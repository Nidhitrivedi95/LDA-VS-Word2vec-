2A1wvIFdKQZZe-vtTO7olQ My wife and I came in and sat at the bar. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio. A server came along with (which looked like very good) bread with a smalling dipping bowl of olive oil. Picked up the bread and dipped it in the oil. It wasn't warm like I expected. It wasn't even room temperature. What is was was ice cold like they just took it out of the refrigerator. There was a couple sitting next to me. I said, is your bread ice cold. She responded, "They always serve it that way". Now I know this place gets high marks but when they fail to deliver something so basic as warm bread we didn't want to follow through with the rest of the meal. We left.
