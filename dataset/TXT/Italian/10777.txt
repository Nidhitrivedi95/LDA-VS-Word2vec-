I went with 3 friends for my birthday (sidenote: Las Vegas Restaurants don't really do anything special for your birthday, no free dessert, maybe a candle on the dessert you order).  We split an appetizer, ordered a bottle of wine, and all ordered one pasta.  The bread accompaniments are fantastic!  The Marscapone "butter",  citrus infused olive oil, and tomato tapenade are delicious.  Each pasta we had was spectacular.  Then we each ordered a dessert (the coconut panna cotta was the best, light and refreshing, and I'm usually a chocolate person when it comes to dessert).  We had an issue with the check (they presented us with a check, then when we gave our credit card to pay the amount changed, turns out they gave us the wrong check the 2nd time around, but they went back and corrected this promptly) but other than that service was flawless.  We each paid about $60 for a shared appetizer, wine, pasta, and dessert and it was the perfect amount of food (full but not stuffed).  I went to Vegas for a food extravaganza (including going to Sage, CarneVino and Joel Robuchon's) and I would go back to Scarpetta every night if I could do it again.  The food is wonderful and the atmosphere is modern and well-done.
