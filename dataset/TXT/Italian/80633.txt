D8ztK8n4L0_6cAslAPFYTg A great family restraunt for Chardon. The parking lot almost needs to be expanded as there are always tons of vehicles every night. Food was good - I had a grouper sandwich and it was the freshest I've ever had. The restraunt was busy and the server did a good job taking care of the table. I'd go back again and again.
