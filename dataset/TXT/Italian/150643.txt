klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw Great for breakfast, but being in the Encore, it's pretty pricey.  Breakfast for two people here cost just as much as what six of our friends paid for dim sum off the strip.  

It's the second time eating here, and the food is pretty consistent.  Although, it's pretty hard to mess up breakfast foods.  Some of their specialty type items are quite tasty though.  Popeye omelette is filling.  The Cinnamon French Toast is tasty, but not too sweet (if you push all the cream to the side).

Service is good.  Like others mentioned, they asked about food allergies.  Also, ordered a Bloody Mary and they tweaked it for us after drinking some, since we asked for spicy and it wasn't spicy enough.
