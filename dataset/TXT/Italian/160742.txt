lJbxQFXqbgKBdHPKKxROMQ We visited Cenci's this past weekend and it was your typical Pittsburgh pizza joint.........  full of yinzers enjoying mediocre food. Everyone was nice and the service was good and their traditional crust was delicious. However, that where it ended.....  very skimpy toppings and flavorless cheese.   If you're looking for mediocre food with nice people, this is your kind of place. If not, move on.
