k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw Ordered the insalata de casa and a large mushroom margherita pizza. Salad was pretty small but the pizza was good, nothing special though. The little rolls they bring out in the beginning are delicious, ESPECIALLY the marinara sauce it comes with...wow, ended up adding that sauce to my pizza. Service was nice but this place is definitely super touristy. Might update my review if I ever do go back and try something else but seems a little over hyped.
