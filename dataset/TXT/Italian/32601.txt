Everything is made from fresh organic ingredients and "il capo cuoco" just doesn't cut corners. Everything is delivered with pride and care - fresh olives, thick-crust fresh bread and olive oil to start and the water and ice tea are served extra chilled. Love this place and we often find our regular table to enjoy the best pizza in Scottsdale.
