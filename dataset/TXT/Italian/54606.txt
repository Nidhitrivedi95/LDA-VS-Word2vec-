aBmuthrQ7yP8cnbgkxU5Ug A whole month later and I am still LOVING this place. It is my new top Phoenix Gyro spot. I have seen it packed the past few times I have been in. I have also gotten a few friends and coworkers addicted. LOVE. Seriously, if you love gyros, try this place. It's a hole in the all but seriously, AMAZING! Their $6.99 meal deal cannot be beat! (I'm having cravings as I write...) Long live authentic gyros! :-)
