BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag We went to Local Bistro on a Friday night. We were sat in the patio section. Service is very, very slow so be prepared for a long dinner. A member of our party sat on a chair and got gum on her pants. The manager or the server wasn't much help in assisting with the gum removal nor did they offer any type of comp item. The food was good but would probably go somewhere else the next time I am in that area.
