ivugOYd-QcXVEfnm1OyqZA The pizza here is different from your traditional place. They only bake the dough and sauce then pour on the toppings cold. It reminds me of the those Lunchable pizza snacks I used to eat when I was little where you have the ingredients separate then you put it together yourself.

This pizza joint isn't one of those places you fall in love with immediately. Eating pizza with cold toppings is a bit strange at first, but once you get over it its pretty good actually. It took me a few tries until it started growing and now I find myself craving for it often. Its pretty awesome how they give soooo much topping on each slice too.

I usually get take out from this place but there is a small seating area to eat at. This isn't one of those places where you must eat at the restaurant since the pizza is cold anyways.
