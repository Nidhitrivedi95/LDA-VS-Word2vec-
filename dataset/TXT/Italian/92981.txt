Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag Had a great experience overall! We had tickets for the 9:30 showing of Zarkana at Aria and we arrived at Cucina a little before 8:30. We mentioned that we were running late and that we had tickets to the show and they were very accommodating. Our food was brought out in less than 20 minutes (we ordered pasta and no appetizer) and it was delicious. Not the best Spaghetti Pomodoro I've ever had, but it was certainly fulfilling. 
I was very surprised to see how empty it was at 8:30 on a Friday night, but then again, it was inside a shopping center, so it was a quiet escape from busy Las Vegas.
