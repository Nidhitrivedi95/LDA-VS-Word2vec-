Great price for lunch. Nice atmosphere, a little cheesy, but still nice. They have a couple of decent dishes, but most of it what you would expect for a $14 lunch buffet. Go for the whole meats, rotisserie chicken, baked salmon, the garlic bread, salads, the pizza that isn't pepperoni or cheese (pizza crust was fairly good actually, but the sauce sucked), chicken parm was great, lasagna, ravioli, and gnocchi were all great. Everything else was either average or just bad.

I give them 4 stars despite the bad food review because the price and convenience were hard to beat and the service made up for a lot of lost points. Everyone was very helpful and nice!
