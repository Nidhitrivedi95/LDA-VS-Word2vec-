-httBl6DSZiUtDX4SQWtag We went there for lunch.  It is a small interesting place.  Seating is limited and the food selection as well.  However the quality of the food seems to be good with good quality ingredients.  Me and my company where all satisfied with the food we got.  The service was though very slow and for sure not competent :) However in general I think I would try the place again.
