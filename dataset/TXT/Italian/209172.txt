qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg Absolutely delicious!!!! By far one of my favorite places to eat! I will definitely be coming back and recommending this restaurant to others. I hope the other location is just as amazing!
Wait staff was so friendly and provided great recommendations! Very warm and inviting atmosphere, handicap accessible!
The food was delicious. The meat in the gyros will melt in your mouth! Rice is seasoned n cooked perfectly. Everything had great flavors, was well prepared and plated beautifully.
Dessert is just as food as everything else! The cake was so moist and delicious! They do not skimp on the portions!
