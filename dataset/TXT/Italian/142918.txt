js9rQZAlA5rr7oSBRRcCDw As I understand it, they make their own pasta...I came here with a gf, who is gluten-free (they offer a gluten free pasta option).

I ordered a penne with gorgonzola cream sauce.  Yum...(I can't remember what else was in the pasta but it was delish).  We paired our mains with chianti - also yum, and finished off with creme brule.  

They had both indoor and outdoor seating available, but we opted for indoor seating, as it was pretty humid and muggy out, and a storm was pending.  Overall a great place to visit.  The food is good and you're served by real italians.  Our server loved pasta - so I went with that.  

Dimmi doesn't disappoint.
