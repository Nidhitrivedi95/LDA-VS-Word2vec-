uwT7CppiYkek-Z-661sndQ Just had an opportunity to try this new Italian establishment in the Yonge and Eglinton area. Visited on a Friday around 7 pm and didn't have to wait. 

First impression of decor was just ok. Nothing special but nice and cosy. We were seated at our table and then tableware and wine glasses were set. They were busy and in their first week of operation so ill cut them some slack. 

Table was wobbly so I had to add some bar napkins at the bottom to stabilize. Ordered the house red wine and two pizzas from the menu.

Pizzas arrived relatively fast. We ordered both the margherita and spicy salami pizzas. Pizzas were relatively good but not really comparable to Libretto or Tennessee Williams in Ottawa. The wine came after the pizza arrived. 

Service was good considering they were busy and having some computer issues. They also don't take American Express which was slightly inconvenient. 

Overall am happy I tried it and may visit again in the future especially if more vegetarian pasta items are added to the menu.
