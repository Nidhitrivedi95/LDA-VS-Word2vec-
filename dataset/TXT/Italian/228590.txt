swi7mi1ixWpu5-tZO2mtsg Ordered an 18 inch pizza with pepperoni, black olives, mushrooms on the pizza and bacon on one half with a side of ranch with $5 tip it came to $39 and some change.  We ordered it at 10:42 am on a Sunday morning and it took over an hour and we on 7th Street and Indian school. I was very disappointed in the pizza for the price I thought it was really flavorless. Won't be coming here again.
