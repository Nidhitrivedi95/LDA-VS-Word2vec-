UHPjDgiEHnTe7-MP-b2kyQ Seven in our party.  The food was good and well-prepared, but you may not get what is on the menu.  Under "Entrees" the menu states a garden vegetable will come with each entree.  Mine did not.  The waiter explained only some come with veggies.  The cornish hen was to be deboned.  It was not.  When I asked the manager if he was aware of the menu's shortcomings, he replied,  "I make the menu, you don't like, you get out.  Go somewhere else".  We surely will.  Very rude and disrespectful.  This manager/owner waltzes around schmoozing and telling stories of Italy, but if you dare to criticize, he becomes  very short-fused.
