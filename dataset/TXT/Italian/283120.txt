Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA this place is amazing. stoped here and got the 19 inch buffalo chicken pizza.  the whole pie cost me around 25 bucks. the chicken was amazing. huge chunks of real chicken. just the right blend of cheese and sauce too. seeing how its only a 5 minute walk from my place. i will be back
