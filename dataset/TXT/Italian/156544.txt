l8SNag-Ii0YUeSGHkA3Vhw Went here for Valentines Day....it was delicious. Great ambiance, great food.Got the recommendation from TripAdvisor and it didn't disappoint. My boyfriend was also excited because he was able to watch the All Star Dunk contest on one of their 2 TVs by the front/bar area. 

Appetizer: YOU MUST ORDER THE MAGIC MUSHROOMS! Yum x 1,000,009

Entry: I had the halibut (daily special) and I ate it too I wanted to explode it was delicious. 

My boyfriend had one of the pizzas and really liked it. 

Dessert: Flourless Chocolate Cake .... amazing. Not too rich, was able to enjoy all of it. 
 
Criticism: Maybe figure out the door situation so it isn't so cold. 

Otherwise, this is a great date location. Awesome food, with the option to sit by a TV if you want to watch a sporting event, or have that as a backup for conversation.
