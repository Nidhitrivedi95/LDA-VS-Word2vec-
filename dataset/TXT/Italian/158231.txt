LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA I had no idea that the best meal I would eat in Las Vegas would be at the mall of all places. We had a meal at Craftsteak and I'd trade it for the one we had here any day.

Our server was a tiny, bubbly blonde who I wish I could have put in my pocket and taken home with me. She was sweet and happy and very personable.

We ordered an appetizer of and then I had the fettuccine Alfredo while my husband ordered linguine and clams with the white sauce. 

The app was simply prepared and just lovely. My Alfredo was smooth and creamy. It was very flavorful and not oily at all. The linguine was bursting with clams. Nicely prepared with most of the clams tossed in with the pasta and a handful still in shells scattered over top. The wine sauce was fantastic.
We also had red wine which was their special house red blend. Also excellent!

We were completely stuffed and declined dessert, but our awesome waitress showed us that they serve little mini desserts for just $2.50... I went with the chocolate cake and my husband got the cremé brûlée. They were both, of course, to die for. So good!

In the end I found myself not wanting to go back to the hotel and leaving the lovely atmosphere (with lots of Frank Sinatra playing in the background) and warm, comfortable interior of the restaurant. It was just lovely.

Like I said, best meal we had the whole trip!
