hTsZSiftorNUFb1VaHCHHg I decided to try something new, and discovered The Nook. Though it's located in a old looking plaza, it's interior design inside  is quite nice. 

I managed to get in right before happy hour ended, and ordered the beer braised pork butt bruschetta and the vongle pizza.

The pork bruschetta smelled and tasted so amazing, I was definitely left wanting more. The vongle pizza was good, but it could have been better. The center of the pizza was limp, and the pizza was barely above warm.

I would definitely come back to have the bruschetta again, and possibly a pasta dish.
