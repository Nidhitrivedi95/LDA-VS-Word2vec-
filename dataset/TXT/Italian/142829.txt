JS24kvJ0I5fWWEuplEiZjg If you're looking for comfort food this is the place to go to. Its a quaint lil restaurant westside of Vegas. 

I stopped by for a small dinner after work, so I was hungry and looking for a light meal that would fill me up. 

Business is slow during the dinner hours, or so the owner tells as he made the recommendations for my meal. As a general rule I always ask for a recommendation when I visit a restaurant for the first time, a nice way of saying "Give me the best you got". Sorta makes it easier to determine whether the best warrants a second visit.

On to the food. As to the owner's recommendations, my meal came with their delicious Moretti's Soup of the Day. As delightful as the soup was, the main course, Chicken Parmigiana with Marinara Sauce and Linguine pasta, failed to deliver. 

Don't get me wrong, the chicken was fantastic, the garlic bread that came with it was equally good, the sauce just never hit. Their sauce is home-made which gives it a nice chunky texture & hints of dried herb (would have been nicer if it was fresh), however it tasted watered down, and lacked the richness of authentic Italian Marinara. Something that I hope they'll improve over time. Come to think of it I hope that sauce didn't come from a Prego jar...

I would definitely recommend this place, if you're looking for a place that's not pretentious.
