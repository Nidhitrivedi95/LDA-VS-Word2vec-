cd5Utm93d5Ta_F4e8A3pCA It's a chain and lives up to that biking. It's nit going to knock your socks off but is good simple food.  Service at lunch wss really great, Bri is under paid.. actually she let us take food home like salad and extra soup.  Some olive garden's tell you they can't do that.   

But I'm here for food.  Light menu had real winner with ravioli di Portobello had real rich cheese flavor in sauce.   Didn't seen low calorie.   Nice size portion too.   I got asiago tortellini great mix of cheese inside and meat sauce outside.   Not fancy but very good and filling.  Can't go wrong with unlimited soup if it's good.
