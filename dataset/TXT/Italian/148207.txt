KDF3qxIYv1OkqtSUl4PwGQ This is probably one of my most favorite restaurants in the city. My favorite dish is the tartare by far. I love tartare and they are just the absolute best for this dish. Their pasta's and meat dishes are always on point as well. The restaurant itself is also beautifully decorated and such and is a nice place for a romantic nice out. Would definitely recommend!
