b83NNHvvWQk-DTTzs-3WLA Great concept and plentiful choices.  As a vegan I appreciate the vegan options when making my selections.  I ordered a veggie sandwich that met my dietary needs.    
I was nearly finished with my sandwich when I  found several pieces of bacon in it.  I told the woman behind the counter who said they must have flipped some pieces in by mistake when assembling it.  She did not offer me any type of compensation nor did she apologize.  
It made a poor first impression.
