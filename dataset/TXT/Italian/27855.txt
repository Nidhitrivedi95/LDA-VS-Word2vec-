Me and my sis have gone here like maybe twice but the last time we did was a huge mistake. I ordered the oven baked penne and my sis ordered the regular ole spaghetti and meatballs. This was at about 7pm. Three hours later my sister is violently ill with the works, my first thought and hers-food poisoning. This lasts until about 1 am she tells me. Fast forward and it is day 2 and she is still feeling nauseous with stomach cramping. I get that it's flu season but this meal was the defining factor- she was feeling great all day before eating here. Be careful. This is the first time we've eaten this food and gotten sick. My meal was apparently okay, but hers made her very sick and she is now afraid to eat this food ever again. We won't be back. Word of warning don't eat here if you don't want to be up sick all night.
