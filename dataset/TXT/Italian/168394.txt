mLP-jIIRdoaYM7fJqqFurw Napoli tries to put itself into the famous Pittsburgh pizza competition against Aiello's and Mineo's, but it falls short, save one standard: it looks damn good. In the end, however, it will always place as shameful, shameful bronze. Here's what is best about Napoli: its cheese, which tastes exactly the same as the other two (same cheese seller?), and the crust is chewy, too. But the sauce is rather flavorless, though a little sweet.

Don't get me wrong. This excellent pizza, and it destroys 95% of all other pizza in the universe. But in Pittsburgh, it only wins the consolation match.
