hh-N1r9O1JpvzGw1mp0bKw I really wanted to like this place but it was disappointing. The dishes I tried were Ray of light and The Devil Went Down to Georgia.  Pasta in the first dish was inconsistent in texture and color, as if some of the noodles had been sitting there longer than others. TDWDTG is supposed to be topped with jumbo shrimp. Did they really mean a single shrimp because I barely got more than one. The sauce was also a little runny and bland, with hardly any depth of flavor except the spiciness of the chipotle sauce. I expected a lot more for 13 bucks. 

Saving grace was the cream puff. Both the regular one and the chocolate covered are excellent. 

I will probably be back at some point since there is not much choice around this area. Maybe I didn't pick the right dish, maybe they had a bad day, but certainly the cream puffs are worth another visit.
