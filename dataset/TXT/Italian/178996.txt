nsw3tlB-hwz4KbPYcuaSww Looking for an authentic, Roman-style pizzeria café? Novanta is your place. When I say Roman-style, I mean the type of café you would find on the streets of Rome. For me, Rome means you can eat nearly anything on the menu, and you know it's going to be fresh, local and delicious. That is Novanta. I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. We always order the salad (to share) and two Margarita pizzas. 

Don't know where to begin. I suppose I could start with what it is not. It isn't "stuff your face" pizza, like many cheap delivery places. This is hand tossed, wood-fire pizza that has a crusty, chewy base. It's topped with incredible sauce and homemade mozzarella cheese slices. One word: Incredible!  The salad was very fresh and topped with imported olive oil, balsamic vinegar and shaved parmesan. 

The price is a bit subjective. Pizza was $7.75 each and the Emiliana salad was $7.50. Now, some people may say, "Hey, I can order a Pizza Pizza from Little Cearser's for five bucks." Yep, they certainly can, and will have about 8 more slices of cardboard, who-knows-where-it-came-from pizza-like thing for nearly the same price. But, that's not Novanta. I have never been disappointed with a meal from here and would HIGHLY recommend it.
