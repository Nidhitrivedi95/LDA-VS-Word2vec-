RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ I had a situation in which I couldn't eat most of the day, and picked Mineo's a the place to chow down at the end of the ordeal.  I noticed they have Arancini on their menu and wanted to try them.  I have not seen them anywhere else in the US but ate them all over Sicily.  I wanted to see how they handled them.  They were round, hot, and made with a mix of peas, rice, and ground meat.  They were served with a red sauce that my husband liked but I thought they didn't need any sauce.  Compared to the dozens we ate in Sicily, we thought these were solidly in the middle of the pack--which is a high compliment since food quality is generally much higher in Sicily.

Given the Sicilian theme, I also chose to go with Sicilian pizza.  Very bready pizza like this is not my husband's favorite, but it was a nice change since neither of us had this type in many, many years.  Also we were painfully hungry upon arrival.  I also decided to go with the John's Special since it's our mode to opt for house specialties when available.  This meant that we got sausage, peperoni, green peppers, and onions for toppings.  We thought this was a good value since the individual toppings are pricey.  Even though we were so crazy hungry, we each only managed to eat two pieces of the pizza.  It was a satisfying experience.

We ate the pizza for breakfast the next day, and the next day, and lunch another day, and finally took it to my parents.  At $28 it wound up being a good value...a gift that kept on giving.  And it made dad happy, because he LOVES leftovers that are not his own.

Would I deal with the hassle of the heat and the wait at Mineo's again?  Probably not.  Twice before we set out to eat there and decided we couldn't manage it.  For me, it fit the bill for the specific events of that day.  If I was in Squirrel Hill and wanted pizza, I would just get a slice to go from one of the other shops on Murray.
