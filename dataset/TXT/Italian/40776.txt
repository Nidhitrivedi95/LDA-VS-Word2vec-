7iZYl52Gtica73shRYsuMQ The Saturday lunch special is an incredible deal: $5 for a gourmet pizza that serves two. We had the quattro stagioni (prosciutto, artichoke, mushroom, olive, and egg), the napoletana (arugula, cherry tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, provolone, and shaved parmesan), and the margherita (fresh mozzarella, mascarpone, plum tomatoes, and basil). All three were generously topped with quality ingredients. A word of caution about the quattro stagioni, though: it comes with an undercooked poached egg in the center that the waiter punctures and spreads over the pizza at the table.
