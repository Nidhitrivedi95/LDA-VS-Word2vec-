j1xqz2w3wjVpvxYJi3t5IQ I don't get up to the University area that often, but I've now been to Ciro's twice and overall I've give them 5 stars for service and 3.5 stars for food.

I won't reminisce over the first visit as it was quite some time ago, but hubs and I strolled in there to grab a quick bite before heading to a show in Concord. Our server Colleen was fantastic - she seriously should work at Disneyland because that woman is so happy. She was also incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, making sure that we were in and out of there for our show with plenty of time to spare. 

Beyond the tasty (I presume freshly baked bread), I ordered the cavatelli primavera - an large portion of finely cooked cavatelli pasta loaded with tons of veggies in a light marinara sauce. The pasta was just what I was looking for and the veggies were fresh - my complaint? The sauce was quite bland. Perhaps more crushed red pepper? More garlic? More BAM? Regardless, I had leftover to eat for lunch for another day and for the price, $14.95, it was a ton of food. 

One an alternate note, make sure you note the price of the specials if you're interested in them...hubs and I were both surprised that his chicken & pasta dish was $22. It was roughly the same portion and similar ingredients to my dish and seemed as if the chicken breast cost added $7 to the price. Strange. Regardless, next time I'm  in the University area I definitely want to try their tiramisu - I hear it's phenomenal!
