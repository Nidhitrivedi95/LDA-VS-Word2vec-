llCxryWr8j1S39tusYCWxg Wow, let's just talk about Yo Pauly's for a moment. This is easily the best restaurant in the entire Scottsdale area. What makes it so great you ask? Impeccable service down to the tiniest detail, incredible food that makes you salivate at every bite, and an intense atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. Each and everyone of my needs were met, and the host (Pauly) greeted me with utmost and genuine respect. Definitely get the cheese pizza, so good. Also, make sure you inquire about desserts - as they were fantastic. Just woah, I am utterly speechless.
