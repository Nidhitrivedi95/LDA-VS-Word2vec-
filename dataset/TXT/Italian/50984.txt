The servers were wonderful and keep track of your rhythm. Our server made great suggestion for me to try the white sangria. The place is big but it still feels intimate. The place is famous for its freshly made mozzarella and gigantic meatball, which was great coz I was not hungry enough for a huge Italian main course. 

The kitchen is visible through a window and customers are welcome to view through a large window, specifically how the mozzarella is made. 

We had the naked mozzarella, which came with well buttered garlic bread that was just the right crunchiness. The mozzarella was warm and chewy. Very delicious.

We had the stuffed meatball, it was the size of a soft ball. The outside is slightly crispy. I don't eat meatball on a regular basis so it's a bit difficult for me to compare but I have to say that I only gave the last piece to my date to be polite.

My date also ordered some sort of pasta (i didnt pay attention to what it was because of the mozzarella) which I tried.  It was great as  well. 

Will definitely come back more frequently
