FcFnVG2NO2a6h6Mi86zaFQ I stopped in on a Tuesday night, wanted to check this place out before I did open mic night. 
Pretty cool place for a coffee shop. The counter girls seemed a little stand offish until I started asking questions about open mic, then they were as friendly as can be. Going in to sing open mic tonight.......I hope it's great. 
Big bonus.....they have beer and wine.....AND FOOD!!!!
