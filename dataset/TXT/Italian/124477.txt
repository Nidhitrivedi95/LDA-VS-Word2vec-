Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ Tired of ordinary store front pizza or questionable pizza from the national chains Old School Pizza is the perfect place to jump off from the bandwagon.  The slice of Anchovies spinach olives and egg was delicious.  Great service and atmosphere.   The cannoli was perfect.  Right across from the Cannery.  You will not be disappointed.
