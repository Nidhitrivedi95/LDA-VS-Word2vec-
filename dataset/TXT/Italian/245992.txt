UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Ahhhh Brio... sweet Brio....

When I saw those pics of the beef carpaccio - I was sold. I didn't realize, however, the grand SIZE of this dish.... best bring a fellow foodie to savor this delicacy- it'll become a sweet memory for y'all... "remember that one time we split an arms length worth of beef carpaccio??!! Yeah.. GUUUD TIMES!"
Just go for it...

My person & I ordered the same dish after much deliberation and bouts of indecision .... lol. We both ordered the pesto pasta and man.. A+. Had lots of vegetables & good amount of chicken... just all around GUUUD. highly recommend. But really- everything on their menu looked worth trying.. so I'm planning on swinging by for that. 

we also split a side of mashed potatoes ... auguuguh amazing.com.org.edu.uk.usa.gov 

AND we didn't forget dessert ... I forget the name of it but it was a chocolate cake filled with chocolatey liquid goodness... with some raspberries & vanilla gelato I believe !! I DIG IT.

Our server was pleasant & polite .. it was a busy Saturday night so we were glad we made reservations ahead of time! We only had to wait 5 minutes to be seated ..

YOU GO BRIO!
