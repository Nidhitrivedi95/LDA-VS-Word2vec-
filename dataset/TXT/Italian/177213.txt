Nkb9_PKgnVYZe8W1y_fBRg What a great place for brunch! It was cozy and charming, and they had some nice, quiet music that gave it a relaxed vibe. Our server was extremely nice and helpful.

I had the omelet of the day (tomato basil), and it was great and fresh tasting. Didn't feel too heavy and it came with a nice salad. I also got the duck fat potatoes to balance it out (can't be too healthy). Can't wait to go back and try something else.
