Im0hMcWaqWIzuBM8xILDsA I constantly have fantastic experiences at Trivs.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable when it comes to the menu and how dishes are prepared.  They are also very accommodating when it comes to changing entree sides.

The food is usually cooked perfectly, thought a few times it has been only good instead of great.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a well-cooked, delicious meal.
