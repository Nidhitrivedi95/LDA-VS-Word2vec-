G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I really wanted to love this restaurant but my expectations were crushed. It's sad because I'm such a huge fan of Giada but her restaurant hype wasn't all what I expected.

First off, we came here to celebrate my Bfs birthday. my server Gregory was so awkward and rude. He rushed us to order our food. It was so weird because out of all the restaurants I've been too, I've never been rushed. He even waited awkwardly until we ordered our main entrees. If I'm going to pay $200 on food don't rush us. Cater to your customers first they are the ones that make the business. I understand you want to keep the flow of the kitchen, but don't tell us "I prefer you order your entrees now" even when we ordered our appetizers, he was like "that's it" um yes that's it because I want to order my entrees later but instead rushes us and waits awkwardly.. Who does that? 

Once the service sucks the whole experience is ruined especially on a special occasion. 

I have to give it to the busser tho, we wished he was our waiter. My tip should of went to him. 

Her dishes were pretty good.
We liked the Rosemary bread that was served, the paperdalle was a little on the salty side but still delicious, the Parmesan with the homemade fig sauce had a great flavor and last but not least the orzo meatballs were delicious. 

It's a little expensive for the amount tho. 

Overall ambience and the food were great
But Mr.Gregory needs a lesson in manners.
