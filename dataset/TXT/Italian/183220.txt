oCULDH0GWWLM4GdLSt0Huw Had dinner with 4 friends tonight. Absolutely loved everything. Great service and wonderful food. The Cuore Romana salad and Caprese salad were great. Our group loved the Cavatelli alla granchio, lasagna and pollo ripieno. I've also had involtini di melazane in the past and it was incredible. Definitely need to come here more often. Love it!
