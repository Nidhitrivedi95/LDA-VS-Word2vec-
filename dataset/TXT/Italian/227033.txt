SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ We ate here at the recommendation of one of our peers. They have seating available outside, which is great for people watching, although it is very noisy so it would not be good for holding a conversation. We decided to be seated inside which was surprisingly empty (the patio was packed).

I had the clams and linguine with white sauce which was ok. The clams tasted great, however the sauce was lacking in flavor. My dad had the Chicken Marsala, which he liked a lot.

We finished off the meal with some gelato. We had some Oreo chocolate gelato which wad awesome, and probably the best/highest quality gelato that I have ever had.

The service was great. Our waiter regularly stopped by to give refills and to check that we were satisfied.

All in all, I would come here again, but I will definitely try something else!
