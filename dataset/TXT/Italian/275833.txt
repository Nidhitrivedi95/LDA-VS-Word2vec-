Yav3F0jvjZ6gUSEb0g8NMw This place has just AWFUL food. My husband and I ordered caprese salad: the mozzarella wasn't fresh, the tomatoes weren't nearly ripe, and the basil was dried, not fresh. Cmon. I ordered the salmon fettucini: the sauce was terribly sour - just gross - and the salmon was freezer burned.  My husband ordered sun dried pesto pasta: again, completely inedible. I'm not a "hard grader" and I typically will try to like a local place, but this place has just inexcusably horrible food. The one nice thing was the waitress - she was very sweet and seemed utterly embarrassed about the food she was serving: as there weren't many people in the place, we could observe all the other customers complain and return food. The waitress remained calm and smiling, which took a lot of grace!
