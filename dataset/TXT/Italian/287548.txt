zluk4cL7Ch-uRlRply42ZQ Used to like this place for special occasions, but it's been sliding downhill for several years now. When we got the "Cheeses of the World" and it turned out to be less exotic than you can find at Giant Eagle -- a plan cheddar, a dull brie, etc. -- we realized it had jumped the shark. It's time for a refresh with a new menu and a renewed commitment to fine dining.
