pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw "There's no way that this place can live up to the expectations" was the common consensus amongst our group of six that dined here last night.

Before we get there though, flashback to 2008.  One year ago, I heard of this place.  After hearing about the unbelievable wait and unwilling to invest 3+ hours of time regardless of the deliciousness of the pizza, I placed Pizzeria Bianco in a spot in my mind reserved for the unattainable such as owning my own private island or being with Megan Fox.

Then one day, somebody informed me that Bianco accepts reservations for groups of 6+.  Hallelujah!  I immediately made a reservation only to find that the first available was about a month later.  Undeterred, I booked it.

When the day came, I was not disappointed with appearances!  There's something about the decor of both the Pizzeria and the little bar next door that makes it very inviting.  It almost felt like I was showing up at a party that somebody invited me to.

The food itself was good, almost great, but again, with the expectations and the wait, it was difficult to fulfill.  The sampler appetizer platters showcased some wonderful cheeses and olives and cured meats.  The salads were crisp and flavorful.  The pizza itself was a little thin and crispy-crusted for my personal liking, but the ingredients were fresh as can be and delicious.

One thing that I missed was more of an emphasis on tomato-based pizzas, which amongst our group, was the first pizza to be quickly snatched up and eaten.

Overall, a wonderful experience, but I don't know if I'd come back again simply due to the logistical coordination required and the high price blowing my expectations beyond what could be satiated.
