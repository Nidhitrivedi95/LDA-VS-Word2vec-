qtotIYIF9U1PCEzMl1iE2w The wings here are cooked perfectly - and you can get dry rub or wet - and both are amazing.   I loved the Carolina sauce.   The service was amazing as well - our server was very attentive even though they were busy.   Great selection of craft brews as well.  Nice outdoor patio.    Living up to their name Buena Vita. ... "The Good Life".
