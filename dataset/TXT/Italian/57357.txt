anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg I love this place. I've come here twice and both times it was for a friends birthday. Both times it was a amazing and memorable meal.

First trip was a few years ago, ran into a couple celebrities from CSI. We ordered a nice bottle of wine, calamari, and I got the "a zuppa di pesce". Sooo good and sooo much food. I finished the lobster and a lot of the large items, but couldnt finish some of the calamari. Really good dish that I almost got it the 2nd time I went.

2nd trip was more recent. Nice bottle of wine again, started with Calamari which may of been the most tender calamari I've ever had, the garbage ceasar which a few of the people were raving about, than the butterfly veal parm with eggplants. MAN!!! that veal parm was ridiculous. It was on special that night and I think a double cut, I only got about halfway through it and devoured the rest later. I was a bit shocked when the bill came to see the price on it (think it was $65 or $68). Holy crap! thats more than most steaks i've had at steakhouses, than again it was better than most steaks i've had at steakhouses so that eased the pain. There is a on menu veal parm which is nearly half the cost, so if I go back I will probably do that since I didn't need it to be that large.

TL/DR: Go here, get a nice bottle of wine, calamari, garbage ceasar, and on menu veal parm.
