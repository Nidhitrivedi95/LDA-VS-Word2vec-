UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ The food here is really good. I know it's a chain restaurant, but needless to say-it's food.
Location is ideal but parking is crap, of course.
Ambiance is nice, we were there for a wedding rehearsal dinner, had the back area reserved for us. 
Service was good, prompt, and attentive.
I don't have anything negative to say.
My bestie-the bride-even left her purse, which they held for her until we were able to make it back.
Good experience!
