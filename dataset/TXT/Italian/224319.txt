Dimly lit, with a brick wall backdrop donning the Sienne Mercato logo. Pretty snazzy atmosphere. You can go casual or take it up a notch.

FOOD:
"A meatball joint".  Emporio is a unique place that specializes in meatballs. 
Step 1: choose a type of meatball (I liked beef; the pork was a little chewy and tough)
Step 2: choose sauce 
Step 3: choose how you want it served (on a slider, panini, etc)

These meatballs are the size of a baby's fist! NOT the size of a typical meatball found in your spaghetti. 

Let's do some simple math: 2 meatball sliders + 1 side/appetizer is a perfect amount. Believe me, I thought I would still be hungry with this order, but it was definitely more than enough. 2 densely packed meatballs + 1 side/appetizer of heavy carbs = a bloated stomach. 

SERVICE:
There are no reservations, so you need to wait it out. Best advice is to come early or late and not during peak dining times unless you can wait 30+ minutes. Service overall was average, nothing that was above and beyond. 

IMPRESSIONS:
If you are looking for a heavy meal and/or like meatballs, you want to check this place out.  I mean, how many places specialize in big meatballs?!  I enjoyed the beef meatball with the arribiatta sauce served on a slider--soft and delicate, like a meatball should be. The spicy pork was a bit too chewy and tough, so I would not recommend it. Mac and cheese as my slide was awesome, and you can't go wrong with any of the sides. It really is a heavy meal though, so come hungry!
