UYJLWDj_jytplZEkjPe6sg So I upgraded a star after my most recent experience. The only reason I'm docking a star is for the long wait, which isn't something they can help. It's just naturally a very busy location.

I ordered pickup, hoping not to have to wait for long. Since it was Valentines Day there was even a line for pickups haha. 

Even though it was CRAZY busy, our food was perfect, still warm (even after a 15 min drive home), and high quality like we were eating in. The server that rang me up was so polite and nice. I give her big kudos for her attitude and smile amidst all the chaos. Fantastic Customer Service from all staff.
