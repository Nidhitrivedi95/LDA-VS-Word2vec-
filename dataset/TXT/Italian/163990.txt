lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg First off THANK YOU SO MUCH PAULO for letting us sit at the bar towards the end of a Sunday night. Second, thanks for the heads up on the 45 minute wait for the BEST PIZZA. So worth the wait. Plus this bartender is a great person! He's super down to earth and a funny guy over all. He was great at getting us drinks while we waited for the deep dish! Over all great experience, and definitely coming back every time I come into town. I will come see you again my friend. Thank you.
