spRvn4UnYH8cck8SXriGkg Walking into Blu Basil was a little wierd.  You walk in and the hostess stand is right there in front of you.  Take another step and you walk into it.  Immediately to your right is a booth for patrons.  Against the window to your left is a 4-person bench for anyone that may have to wait to be seated. 

The whole layout of the restaurant was strange.  My group was seated in a large booth against the left wall.  On the wall over our booth were lit up signs with pictures of entrees and a tv so you always felt like people were looking at you.

Sat down and ordered.  For an italian place, they have an odd menu...cajun chicken and shrimp for an entree and the soup special was clam choweder?   I ordered Chicken di Napoii which was described as penne pasta in a pesto cream sauce with kalamata olives and pancetta.

It arrived and the sauce looked more like a soup.  The flavors while individually decent did not marry well together.  I really think even Applebees could have done better with this dish.  Was the sauce supposed to be runny and was there still supposed to be 1/2 inch of it in my bowl when i finished?

The best thing I had here was the almond gelato for dessert with chocolate cake.  The cake was lightly sweetened and not as heavy as it looked.  The gelato was absolutely delicious.  

So maybe this place is better for dessert?  But really I didn't get the whole concept of the place.
