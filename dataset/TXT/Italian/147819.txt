kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Highly disappointing! We use to love this place until they changed the menu, ownership, and staff. We went for happy hour and was informed by the hostess the menu has changed and decided to stay anyway. We were seated outside, sat for 10 minutes and with no service we left. Losing all around! Shame, shame, shame
