8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA Went for the 1/2 cheese stuffed pizza and the 1/2 choice. We had mushrooms, onions, green peppers and chicken on the 1/2 choice. Other than about a 35 minute wait for the pizza to be cooked (the waitress forewarned us) we enjoyed ourselves. The tomato sauce is extremely fresh and you can tell by the simple taste. The pizza was filking and we shared a medium between two of us with a few slices to take home. The place is full of large, crystal clear TVs for watching your favorite sporting event. The restaurant is clean and brightly lit. Saw someone order chicken parm and it looked like a LARGE portion of pasta and breaded chicken. If we are on this side of town again we would consider another visit.
