Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA Enjoyed a late afternoon lunch with my girlfriend here. She had already been and raved about it so I trusted her choice. All options looked great but we were in the mood for some prosciutto so we opted for the Casanova. I was a little iffy on the dates but they ended up complimenting the arugula very well. Great afternoon meal out on their patio and great experience. We'll be going back again soon.
