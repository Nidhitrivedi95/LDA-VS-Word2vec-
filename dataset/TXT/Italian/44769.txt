8CRoFhyVzple6ji3S1_L-A This place officially has the best views of anywhere I've eaten in Cleveland (that's counting a view of the dishrags at Goodman's Sandwich Inn). Much of my dinner here was spent trying not to look like a rube -- "Look, momma, they got tall buildings here! Damn! Is that a boat? Whoo-whee!" Seriously, if you have people coming in from out of town and want to show off Cleveland, take them here -- but take your American Express card, because if you're cheap like me and think Outback Steakhouse can get a little pricey, this place may give you a heart attack. Besides the view, the atmosphere, food and service here left little to be desired. I got a vegetarian entree for some reason, while the rest of my party got seafood. We all noshed a bit on each other's food and were all pretty happy with what we got, but I can't remember anything else because I drank four double gin-and-tonics.
