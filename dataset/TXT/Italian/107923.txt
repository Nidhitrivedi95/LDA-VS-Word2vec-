FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A I was so indecisive coming in here that I just ended up building my own pasta. I ended up getting a bowtie, pesto, and bacon combination. I LOVED THE PESTO. It was so delicious! 

The only downside was the amount of bacon they put. I only had one "big" piece, and the rest were crumbles/bits. They were lacking :((((
