e_BiI4ej1CW1F0EyVLr-FQ Four of us dropped in at Casa Mia on a Thursday night - no reservation required at this time of year in AZ!  As usual, the service, food and wine were fantastic.  My wife and I and our good friends have frequented Casa Mia about 6-8 times in the last year and the experience is always great.  The Cod special was enjoyed by three of us last night and I had the Penne 85269, a superb penne with chicken and tasty red cream sauce.  The atmosphere is very comfortable - this doesn't mean a dress code, it just means that we feel at home here.
