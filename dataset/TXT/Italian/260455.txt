My wife and I ordered a meatball appetizer, carpaccio, and the pizza Cristina, which was our favorite. The meatballs and polenta were a great combo. It was our first time trying carpaccio and we certainly would order it again. The pizza Cristina features prosciutto and arugula, which are two foods we love. Good service and pleasant lively environment. We were able to listen to the live music playing at the Venetian every 15 minutes or so.
