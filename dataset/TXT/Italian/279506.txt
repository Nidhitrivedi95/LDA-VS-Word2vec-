yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Taking an alternate route from the strip, we came upon this place. They weren't open yet, but the kind hostess gave me a menu to check out. Whoa! For $25-$40 you get a salad, amazing garlic bread, your entree, a cappuccino (best I've ever had) and if you're a wine drinker, free wine. Gordy greeted our table with an accordion and a smile to light up any room! The staff were all friendly and prompt. He atmosphere is fantastic. I guess that's why they've been around for over 45 years! Our server was on year 31 when I asked. We will definitely be back!
