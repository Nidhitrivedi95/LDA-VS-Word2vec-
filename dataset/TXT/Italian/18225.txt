2LOTz08OPRyA0ibJImJRbQ I haven't been to all of them yet, but I'm reasonably sure this is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city. A nice decor and excellent service make it a great place to take your girlfriend/wife on a date if she likes Italian food, she's hungry (your typical meal includes an appetizer, pasta course, meat course and dessert) and you have some spare cash.
