LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw I absolutely adore Oreganos.  Their pizza is so yummy.  My family usually gets the meatball pizza.  I love the thin crust.  We tried the whole wheat crust a couple of times but this type usually gets burnt.  Their salads are amazing.  Their staff is always super friendly and nice.  It is usually too busy and crowded for my liking but I know the reason is because this place is fantastic.  My boyfriend came in from England and stated this is easily the best pizza he has had (and the Caesar salad was the best too).  The atmosphere is neat but reminds me of a lot of places...  The birthday pizza cookie is perfection.  If you haven't been here yet-- what are you waiting for?? This place is awesome. :)
