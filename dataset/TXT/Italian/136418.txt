j_PL_u4SWW1LoEd2dCu0Iw I wanted pizza and he wanted roasted chicken.  Thankfully there is a place in North Las Vegas to feed us both in one place--Bambini's.  The moment we entered the restaurant I was intrigued. It has the pizza counter on the left and a quaint booth area next to it with tables on the other side of a pretty wall divider. 
We were greeted nicely and seated.  This is a casual eatery, so don't expect hotel restaurant service. Despite having servers. the only come out to greet, seat, and take orders. We were checked on once when the appetizers came. Honestly we don't need to be waited on so this was fine.
Their menu is extensive. boasting everyrthing from pizzas to ribs. We chose the following:
-fried mozz sticks: definitely frozen or premade then frozen. good, but I hoped it was fresh.
-zuchini sticks: good. not awesome but i liked it.
-Philly cheesesteak special: The mushrooms are from the jar, so it tasted. It was a typical philly but I hoped for cheese wiz as a cheese option. I had provolone and it just wasn't the same. The bread, though, is awesome. Freshly made, perfect texture and crust. 
-roasted chicken: dry. Seasoning was good but the breast was dry. The potatoes as our side choice was okay but didn't have any salt or pepper on it. 
Deep dish pepperoni pizza (slice): Their pizza is their best menu item. Crispy crust, gooey cheese and salty pepperoni. I left with two more slices to go.
Overall their other menu items are decent but their chicago-style pizzas are pretty goodl Nice change from Papa John's for sure. Their pizza dough tastes fresh and I love the sweet and tangy sauce. 
Tip: stick to their pizzas. I saw that they use boxed/dried pasta for their pasta dishes. If they would just make it like they do their dough and bread, they would be a great Italian joint.  Also don't expect very fast serving of food.  It takes around 15 minutes for entree and about 8 minutes for appetizer.
If you like a change and want good deep dish pizza, give it a try. I think you'll either love it or hate it. I hope that this restaurant finds a way to weed down their menu to concentrate on what they are good at.  I think having too many options brings the quality of the food down because they have so many things to make.  If this place focused, like I stated earlier, on their pizza, pasta, and rotisserie ONLY, they could become a great pizzeria and rotisserie.
