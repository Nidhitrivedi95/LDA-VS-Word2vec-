Now, the chicken is stringy and can't even be chewed easily and they don't even give you a mini size brownie sundae on your birthday. They are such cheapskates that they don't even give you a wedge of lemon to squeeze on your lemon chicken anymore. The management is just trying to squeeze you for every last buck they can.
