nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow My visits to Trattoria have been pretty solid, but not mind-blowing. My first visit was a few years ago, and all I really remember from that experience was a very rude and kind of crazy server. I recently went back for dinner for a friend's birthday though, and the service was far better. Our server was sweet and efficient. I got the gnocchi with shrimp which was good - the portion is massive and I love the creamy tomato mushroom sauce. I've also stopped by to meet a friend for a few drinks at the bar which were yummy, and the bartender was great and really friendly. I would go back to Trattoria, but I'm in no big rush.
