SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Great food, good drinks and really cool environment. Reason for the 1 star was the horrible horrible wait staff. Everything he could have done wrong as a waiter he did & paved the way with apologies.. Don't say sorry, just be better at your job. Otherwise, I enjoyed the king Kong and a variety of cocktails. I may go back, but never on a Thursday at midnight again
