I8QpDTJUZ6Mk5IQuQSG2pA Came with a party of 5. Very cozy seating area. The server was super attentive and helpful, and they stock Angry Orchard which we love. The fries weren't done all the way. I could swear they are either Walmart Great Value brand frozen fries or taste just like them. We got a specialty pizza, and I'd call it a step above Papa Johns. I kind of think that for $25 a pizza should be amazing, and it was just good... but overall it was a good experience.
