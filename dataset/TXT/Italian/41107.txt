7JWWeXqil03Ua_wV9KN8ZQ Went here for Valentine's day with my husband and sons. The food was mediocre we ordered the pepperoni pizza, fettuccine alfredo and the bone-in rib eye steak. The waiter, Diego, brought our food in and instead of rib-eye, he gave us filet mignon. The rib eye was supposed to be medium rare, this filet was well on the outside and rare on the inside. Clearly a waste of good meat. We told him we got rib eye and he went to check and confirmed our order was the rib eye. but my husband didn't want to get upset so we just told him to just leave it. Ok, what really bugs me is, this waiter clearly made a mistake and not once did I hear an apology for his mistake. Our table was ignored and when we asked for refills we had to ask three times. We were nice and didn't complain (which I think now we should have spoken to his manager) but own up to it if you made a mistake. When we got the bill he still did not apologize. So I told him I would've appreciated an apology for his mistake and he just nodded and muttered I apologize. I told him no, it's too late. And he walked away. The restaurant was not even busy at all!! I would not recommend to come here because not only was the food not great but the service was just as bad. Sadly we only went here because sunset and vines was still closed but I wish we waited for it to open instead of coming here. Thank you Luna Russo for a wonderful Valentine's day experience. (I'm being sarcastic btw).
