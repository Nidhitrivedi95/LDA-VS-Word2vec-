yPgUkQxj8CYPKF89HV65kg My husband and I have been coming here for at least 12 years. We moved out of Wisconsin 8 years ago and this is the one place we always come back to when we are in town. Service is always good, food is always on point, and the fact that it has stayed consistent for over a decade counts as a win in my book. Definitely a place to go for a small celebration meal, or to eat at the bar when you're craving some yummy italian. Also love that their menu changes seasonally and that they use local farmers when possible.
