D1lAVtlav4atQTJnIvtcpw I work fairly close to this restaurant so I dined here twice recently. My first visit was for a coworker's birthday so we had a large group. The restaurant was very accommodating and obliged our request that we needed to be out in an hour. They also provided a complimentary slice of cake for the birthday boy, which was much appreciated. During my second visit for a dinner, service was less attentive. One thing that bugged me was that I had to ask for bread, or else they wouldn't give you any.

Small issues aside, the food was great- especially the pasta! I tried the chitarra alla carbonara and the pappardelle with braised duck. The carbonara was creamy, rich, and delicious, albeit a tad salty. It's a good one to share. The pappardelle was also very tasty and hearty. However, the standout dish for me was their lasagna, which sadly was a daily special. My coworker ordered it and let me try a few bites. I loved the savoury browned crust on the top layer and I would order it in a heartbeat if it was available again. All my other coworkers also seemed to have enjoyed their dishes. 

Small issues aside, I enjoyed dining at Taverna and will probably revisit in the future, given its proximity to my workplace!
