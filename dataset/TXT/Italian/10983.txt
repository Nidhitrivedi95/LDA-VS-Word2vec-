0P46EQN6wGc52nONZX0kgQ Went with my wife with the hopes of finding good Italian food. Authentic isn't something we hope for anymore, good is now our target. 

Ordered the shrimp appetizer special. The tomato based sauce was very tasty, but the shrimp was a little over cooked and therefore tough. 

I had the Beef Braciola and again enjoyed the tomato sauce, it was a thick marinara I believe. The beef was pretty good, seemed a little tough though. 

My wife ordered the salmon with spaghetti and a beurre blanc citrus sauce.  The salmon was overlooked and a bit dry and the sauce wasn't very tasty. It was definitely missing salt, perhaps other ingredients. Not sure how to fix it. 

All in all, nothing to write home about. I am thinking this place is really more about its pizza, that seems to be what most people on Yelp are enjoying.  

The service was good and all the staff were very friendly.  There is an odd sign about using abusive language.  The only other place I see a sign like that is at the MVD.
