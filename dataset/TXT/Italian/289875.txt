zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA My husband and I ate here and I had the same special as the reviewer Pamela and I agree with her 100%. Also, I had to remove all the linguini as it was  overcooked. The entire dish consisted mostly of the overcooked pasta with a tiny bit of fish, 2 shrimp, 2 clams and 2 mussels. I'm giving 3 stars because my husband's cheese steak sandwich was very good. The service was also very good as was the ambiance.
