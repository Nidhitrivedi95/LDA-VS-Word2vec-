gCZAYkIcRjNYYRHQ9htpJQ Food is pretty average, service is sub par the few times I've been there. Our whole sales department just had lunch there and 1 person out of 7 enjoyed their meal and it was a salad (tough to mess up). Hoagies are served on a roll that takes away from any flavor the sandwich may have had. Pizza is wood fired, pretty good. Wedding soup was very good as well. Nice bar area to watch sports.
