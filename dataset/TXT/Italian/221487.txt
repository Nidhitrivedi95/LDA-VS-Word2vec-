SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg We went with a large group and had a WONDERFUL dinner!  Our group of 12 were able to get a seat on the patio with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  It was the perfect spot!  Our waiter (forgot his name) was so attentive and helpful!  The food was delicious.  Four of us shared:
- TONNO (ahi tuna)
- CAPASANTA (scallop)
- SALMONE (salmon)
- AGNELLO SCOTTADITO (lamb chops) 
- BISTECCA (steak)
- BRANZINO LIVORNESE (fish)

Will definitely be going back!
