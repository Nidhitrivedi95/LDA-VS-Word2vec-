Uda-CqNfow8Gh4rgtdhJZg The worst customer services! Tired to order a pizza and the sent the wrong pizza. I called the manger and they hung up twice! He called blamed us but I have proof my order! They didn't offer to help and refused to accept their mistake. They yelled. And I will never again go there. So many other pizza places that care about you and your order. Safe your money!
