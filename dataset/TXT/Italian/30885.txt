5nie8WoCB-MpEYT5uE6t4A Overall unpleasant experience. When I called and successfully made a reservation for summerlicious, the employee then said, "Next time, don't call around this time (around noon). Call earlier, at 11am, or later, at 2pm; we're really busy right now." I was about to apologize for causing an inconvenience, but realized that he had already hung up on me.
When seated, we were placed at a table in the furthest corner, when there were plenty of other available seats. We were told that there was no lamb shank, no creme brulee (apparently they hadn't set properly and therefore couldn't be served), and no mango mousse (spelled incorrectly on the menu). After we finished eating our dessert, we see other tables eating lamb shank. We asked a manager, and he told us that when we were seated, the lamb was not yet cooked and therefore couldn't be served to us. However, a nearby table was only seated 5-10 minutes after us and they were given the choice of lamb. We told the manager that we would've waited 5-10 minutes for the lamb (that's what most of us had wanted to order), and the manager replied that there was a 1.5 hour seating limit, but we had only been there for an hour.
Food was mediocre at best, nothing stood out, portions were fair for someone who has a small stomach.
The manager and all the employees had awful customer service - they gave us attitude and carried a tone of condescension whenever we asked for clarification.
Definitely will not go back, and would not recommend.
