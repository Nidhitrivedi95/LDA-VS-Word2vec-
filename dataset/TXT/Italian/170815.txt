mX9wWpoz1x6-snTvxlIOOg I'd went here with a Party yesterday and it was the first time in years I've been there. The table ordered a seared tuna app which was pretty decent. It came with wasabi, ginger, and toasted bread. I liked how the items went together and was pleasantly surprised as for whatever reason, seared tuna usually never tastes as good as I hope it would. In this case, I was happy. The table also got an eggplant app. It had an egg batter, shrimp, a creme, and it was laid over a bed of Frank's hot sauce. The plate itself was big and could easily be an entree. I was skeptical, but enjoyed the contrasts in flavors. The egg batter is something I don't see much outside of this area, and it sort of sent me back to my childhood which was nice.
For main, I ordered the NY Strip. It came with these red potatoes that were surprisingly good. They had some crisp on them and seasoning that really made them stick out to me. The steak had a very nice sear on it, but it was overlooked for my liking (I'm a rare to medium rare fan). The bread they brought out was a very nice ciabatta and I personally ate a bread loaf. I'm very low maintenance in all parts of my life except a few, bread is one of them. 
I'd like to give them 3.5 stars in all truth. I'm very happy to pay top dollar for a good steak. I'm not one to mind going to a place like Morton's if the steak is great. While mine was good, I expect it to be cooked to my liking if I'm paying almost $30 for a NY strip, or at least be close (it was between medium and medium well). I'm about to head to Eleven which likely means steak again (I'm in vacation, this isn't a lifestyle), and I'm sure that I'll be dropping $20 more for a steak, but I'm also sure it'll taste amazing.
