lB0xRVCVc5t86RGBnBdnmA Might be my favourite place to eat!  Veal sandwiches are always well cooked and huge,same with their delicious fries and caesar salads!  For $10 you get a full combo that you won't be able to finish!  Hard to find this place as their is no advertising and it's tucked away in this tiny plaza that has poor signage.  Once you go in there is an old school bar eating area which ads to the character of the place.
