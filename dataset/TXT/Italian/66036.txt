bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw I will never go back. Me and a friend sat on the patio one evening and not one person came up to us. Several waitresses walked past us several times and did not say a word. We sat there for over 10 minutes before I got up to get a manager. A waiter decided to argue and say me and my friend were being helped which was a complete lie. The manager told me to go have a seat back at the table. Overall nothing was done. No apology, nothing. I emailed another manager the next day about the experience and guess what, no response.
