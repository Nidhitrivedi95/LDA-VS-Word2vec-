5sZyYGQH4k-WwvVJk_LIvQ Villa Antonio always reminds me why I enjoy dinner there so much.  From the greeting at the door from Anthony, Fidel or Walter...to the great service provided throughout the dinner...to the great multi-course meals....Villa Antonio always hits the mark!  The wife and I had a great dinner before going to a local jazz concert.  Fresh focaccia with balsamic EVOO dip....and the fresh bruschetta....all so very good.  The lemon sorbet with extra dry brut provided the best palate cleanser!!  And the wine selection is always amazing!!  We had a great pairing of delicious red wine....(Yes RED goes well with everything) and our waiter never asked our preference!!  Why....because that is how good they are with pairing!  Dinner was great...the dishes are always well prepared and so so so full of flavor.  And the portions are so great...you have to think a minute before you decide on the tiramasu or other wonderful dessert ...or do I just get a box and take some home!  So...on this particular evening....we passed on dessert.!!! And passed on the boxes...and cleaned our plates!
