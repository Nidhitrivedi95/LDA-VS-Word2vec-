nwnizMdBAhJ9CVDHXf3QNw Aw, I wanted to like this place SO badly because it's practically the only restaurant in the neighborhood. It was very cute inside, and my non-fancy self thought the menu looked quite tasty. The creamy chicken soup was very good. Unfortunately, the Chicken Parmesan that came afterwards tasted like something that would be served on the "before" portion of a restaurant makeover show. The chicken and the very oversauced pasta had very little flavor, and what was there wasn't very good at all. 

I want to see this place succeed and serve tasty food to this very underserved neighborhood. Keep trying Giuseppe! I'll give you another try next time!
