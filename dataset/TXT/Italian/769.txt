Saw a meat cheese plate (photo added) that was pretty disappointing.... $11 for a few chunks of parmigiana and sliced meat... however their pizza did make up for it. Flavorful and lots of toppings. Got the white pizza with sausage and rosemary, tasted a pizza with hot honey, yum!!!! 

In conclusion, go for the pizza , not the cheese plate.
