ilUhKIqr1rsALh-6BM7_RQ Horrible. I used to like their pizza a lot. Haven't had it in years though. Must have changed. I was told it would take 35 minutes and it took over an hour for delivery. Tasted like it had been sitting there for days. I've had better at a gas station. Bread sticks were sopping wet with oil it actually splattered all over the counter when I took them out of he bag. Had one piece of pizza and a breadstick and threw it all away. Don't waste your money.
