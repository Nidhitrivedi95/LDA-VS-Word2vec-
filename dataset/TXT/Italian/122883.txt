hHgSUnDB9yIrxUEMSmsdoQ Piada is one of my favorite new fast foods to go in Oakland. I am often faced with the problem of wanting something light and fast, but not wanting to settle for the typical fast foods that serve really unhealthy and heavy foods like McDonald's, Five Guys, or Popeyes. Thanks to Piada, I now have a place where I can satisfy my hunger with lighter options. 

Piada has the modern vibe you find in places like Chipotle and &pizza with cleanly cut corners everywhere and simple decor everywhere. The food is created in front of your eyes, and you have tons of options to customize what you want. 

I really like their pasta because it is chewy and also really thin. You get a lot of flavor out of it if you want to with their sauces, but you can also go for a lighter combination by pairing your pasta with olive oil and then adding a few veggies. 

What really stands out to me at Piada is their quick service, and their ability to put together a meal so polished with little effort. The only complaint I have about Piada is that their eponymous  dish, the piada, fell short of my expectations. Essentially, it is just an Itailian burrito, except it doesn't taste as good as a Chipotle burrito. I get it, it's a different style but I felt that the piada wrapping was rough, and the things you put inside don't really mix and pair well.

So Piada is really nice for pasta, where you can customize meats, sauces, veggies to create what you are exactly feeling for lunch of dinner.
