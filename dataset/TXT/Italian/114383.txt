GLObol9ZkKPQOQ1LMsqkew My husband and I ate at the Ray Rd & Priest, Tempe location yesterday at the recommendation of my daughter who highly recommended it. I had a hard time choosing between the salads since they all had such great combinations of fresh vegetables, but settled on Fall Leaves. This probably is the best salad I have ever eaten anywhere. Everything was fresh, crisp, and crunchy. My husband chose a great BLTA sandwich which was very well prepared. I am anxious to try their other menu items so we will definitely be returning to the Perfect Pear often.  We are so glad we found a restaurant with a flare for the unique!
