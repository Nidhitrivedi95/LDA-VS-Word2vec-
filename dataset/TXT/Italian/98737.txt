EwHfTgHuBqkONBvtKKhQIw Bella Vista really does give a "beautiful view". One of the many restaurants offering a scenic panorama of the Forth and the epic Rail Bridge, this is one of the best.

I love the feel of Bella Vista. That cosy wooden cabin feel. Altogether the atmosphere in this place is really great. The food is pretty good too, that is, it tastes nice. Unfortunately the portions are quite small. When I ordered soup I didn't even get bread with it, and they charged me almost £2 when I asked for some. This is unfortunately consistent with the restaurants slightly higher than average prices. But don't let this put you off what is still quality food at its heart. Apart from the one hiccup with the bread the staff were perfectly amiable

As an obviously Italian restaurant you can expect mostly Italian standards. They also offer a range of fish, as with most restaurants in Queensferry. On my second visit I had a vegetarian pizza and was quite pleased! 

Expect quality food in a fantastic location, but expect to pay a little extra.
