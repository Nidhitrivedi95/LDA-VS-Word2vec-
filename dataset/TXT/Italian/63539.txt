On arrival our group was greeted by the owner with his elaborate Italian welcoming gestures. I felt special from the get go. he arranged for a table to be cleaned for the 4 of us and ensured we were all comfortable. 

The menu was overflowing with many delicious options and the only niggly bit was that one was similarly named and they brought the one my sister did not want. She enjoyed it, but it should have been pointed out.  My wife enjoyed the affagato with gusto  -hi hi -  see what I did there :o) 

My sister was highly impressed with the entertaining way they teach you Italian whilst being on the toilet - yes you need to go there to know what I mean , but I promise you it will be entertaining and useful! 

In contrast to the attentive service when it came to paying there was not a server to be found, so that dragged the evening a little. When you are a little tired and satisfied this is a little irritating. But we settled the bill eventually and I agreed with my wife we would return for the dessert alone
