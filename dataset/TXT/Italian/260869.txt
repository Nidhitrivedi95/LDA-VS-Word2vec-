wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g We were going to watch a show at the Venetian and was looking for a place to eat. I saw the Happy hour at the entrance to this place and we decided to try it out.  We were pointed to the bar area. We sat and the bartender came up right away and offered us the happy hour menu. We ordered pizza and calamari and a couple of beers.  The pizza was great and so was the calamari. You could actually order one whole pizza for one person, it was only $7.  We were able to watch the show at the Canal. The place is right in the middle of the Venetian Canal, so, the view and the ambiance was really nice. We are locals and we always look for this good deals and we were glad we found this one. We already came back 3 times.
