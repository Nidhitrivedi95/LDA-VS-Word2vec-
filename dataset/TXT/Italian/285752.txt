zFnPRtP7LGvr3sfxvy_dfg I absolutely LOVE this place. When we went yesterday they had 42 beers on tap! The best part is that with their "Pick a flyer" option, you can try a sampler of 4 different beers in 6 oz glasses for only $8, which is so reasonable. The pizza is also amazing and the service was wonderful. We went a little earlier than typical dinner hours and didn't wait at all but we noticed that when we left there was a huge wait for tables. Luckily, with so many great beers on tap, it would probably make the wait not seem as bad. I will definitely be back to Revolution.
