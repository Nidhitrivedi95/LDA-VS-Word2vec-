7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg My new favorite Caesar salad, Veal Milanese like i have never experienced before.  Truly simple dishes in nature, but executed impeccably.Thank you Chef. The Cassata cake (usually very rich and heavy)was the lightest i have ever experienced, thank you Mama.
     We had a party of eight, and the service was also , impeccable. Brittany?kudos, from someone who was in the industry for 15 years. All in all , the best Italian cuisine I have experienced in a loooong times
