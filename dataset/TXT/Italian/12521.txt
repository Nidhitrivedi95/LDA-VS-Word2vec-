0WAL6O1YvcJbeDRYeRm34w The interior of this restaurant doesn't look at all like I expected. No warm music, no tablecloths, no Italian paintings. In fact, it's pretty cold, a bit modern, and not all warm in the ambiance department. 

The restaurant itself was empty besides the table by us, and the bar had several men sitting at it. Don't rush out and get your glam on,Girls, they're around my dearly-departed Dad's age
. 
The food? Very average. 

The wine selection? Very small, and red's are not chilled to the temperature's that they should be. 

My husband ordered the Shrimp Verde appetizer and the mussel's as his meal. 
I ordered the stuffed shells. 

My stuffed shells were good, in and of themselves, but the vodka sauce was so salty that I am not swelling up and so thirsty that I am guzzling water. 

My husbands shrimp verde was pretty good. Nothing offensive about them.
The mussel's were a little fishy, and although I generally love mussels, one was enough. 

This place is quite a bit overpriced for what you get, in my opinion. 

If you're an Italian, or an italian-food-lover, you may want to try somewhere else..
