tXJkGjBkGOZHWAcCmlzS6w the same for the past 10 yrs which is just awesome.  Same owner, same staff and same great food.  We love the specials and you can let them pick the wine (they won't just pick the expensive stuff either, they are honest).   Next best thing is walking around Little Italy after, going to get Coffee and pastries (or ice cream) are all part of the experience.  This is really nice when you want to make more of an evening out of dinner.
