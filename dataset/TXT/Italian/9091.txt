0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw My wife and I recently decided to spend my 35th birthday in Montreal and as soon as that decision was made I immediately rushed to try to get a reservation at any of the Joe Beef restaurants. Having already been to Joe Beef and loving it, I was really excited when I managed to snag a table for 2 on a Saturday night at 7 at their sister restaurant Liverpool House.

The service was fantastic and attentive. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable with wines and when we told her what we were going to have she went looking for some great wines to pair. The wines were all between $60-$100 also so all within a reasonable price point (I just can't justify any more than $100 for a bottle of wine).

The food of course did not disappoint either. We started with a very thinly sliced rib eye on toast special which was probably my wife's favourite dish. For mains I decided to go for the beef in Joe Beef and had the steak which came with steak sauce, horseradish and pickle on the side. My wife went for the lobster spaghetti which I also tried and was incredible. The shocker was we ordered some brussel sprouts on the side and these stole the show. Definitely the best brussel sprouts I've ever had with so much incredible flavour.

Overall I have no complaints and would definitely head back to any of the Joe Beef restaurants.
