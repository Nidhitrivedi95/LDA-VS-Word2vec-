9uyPRXK7NGVXpMKpbOhw0A Being a world traveler, this was one of the worst meal we experienced. We ordered spaghetti Aioli with a side of meat balls & one spaghetti sausage & peppers. 
Blend, no taste, meatballs tasted like chemical. Garlic bread with absolutely no flavor, basically eating plain dough. Also, had a Pinot noir served room temperature which had a vinegar after taste, had to chill it with ice.
I gave it one star just because of the service.
Save your $$ , as McDonald might serve better food!
Horrible experience, will NEVER go back!
