zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g ZERO Stars. My wife and I walked in when they were NOT busy. The hostess was taking care of the one table in the place that had customers. The other two servers were wiping down tables and wandering around aimlessly. They all looked up at us then continued on about their chores. No hello, no "be right with you", no greeting of any kind. So we stood at the hostess stand for at least 5 minutes with no acknowledgement (probably closer to 10 min.). Then we walked out. Their staff is obviously poorly trained and not customer service oriented. We live very close by but we will NEVER go there again. Dom DeMarco's FAILED miserably, immediately after we walked in the door.
