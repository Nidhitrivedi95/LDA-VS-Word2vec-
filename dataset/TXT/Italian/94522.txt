ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA This was the first time I tried this place . The ambiance is fun and has a nice vibe. There was a 30-45 minute wait at 1:30pm ( damn Arizonans and their love for brunch). Our server was fantastic! He was knowledgable and gave great suggestions! We had the blue corn pancake and would recommend that to everyone walking through the door! I had the fried mozzarella sandwich and it was mediocre at best. It lacked flavor. I wouldn't order it again. I am looking forward to trying some of the other dishes. But will definitely make a reservation!!!
