eRjcli4nDHRwhByViUz9Ow The pizza isn't worth the hassle. The service is slow, wait times are a joke ie 25-30 mins really means about an hour. And while I waited for my order 2 ppl called to complain about there order being wrong and they messed up two ppl's order in front of me. This will literally be the last time I come here. And I strongly recommend that any and all save your time and money and not come here.
