Salads were fresh and HUGE and we ordered the 1/2 portion...highly recommend the salad with brussel spouts and my husband enjoyed the Italian Salad.  Lemony chicken and pasta with shrimp were also delicious...plentiful and served hot with a smile.  Bottles of wine are 1/2 off on Sunday...what a nice surprise!  Will definately return!
