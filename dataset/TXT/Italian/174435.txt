nDfN1RkA40anfzjFGRO8qQ We stopped by here tonight after being turned down at a different Italian restaurant for being unwilling to accommodate our vegan diet.

When walking in to this place we were greeted by the two owners; to say they went out of their way was an understatement. 

They made sure the kitchen made a special item that we could both enjoy. 

Our meal was delicious and very reasonably priced. 

We will make this our new frequent spot.
