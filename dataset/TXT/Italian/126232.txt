hsDkxhc-_YYsVqAeQBJJjg I ate the WHOLE calzone and didn't even get a t-shirt?!?  Really?  Not even a discount?!?

Seriously, my stomach hurts so bad right now, but I conquered the beast. The whole, delicious beast in all of its entirety. 

This place is not a diner, not a drive-in...definitely a dive, but, man is it good!  Came with a business party of about twelve and the place accommodated us just fine and without hesitation. 

Everyone loved their food, so I'll definitely be back...though next time for a MUCH smaller portion...or at least when I have portion-control. 

Super delicious and a super dive!  Gotta' love places like this!

Cheers!
