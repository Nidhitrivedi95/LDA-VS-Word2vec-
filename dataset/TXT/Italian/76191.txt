CSaVK9wgqe2_tQuuCDINyQ I'm from Jersey so when I came across this place for the first time, I could tell this would be Authentic. I got the stromboli and the lady said we could add more to it! We added mushrooms and broccoli. It was so delectable! I took this photo, but probably shouldve taken a close up. I couldn't wait to eat so here's my hasty photo. I highly recommend this place especially if youre from NY & NJ. You wont be disappointed!!! This is going to be my new spot
