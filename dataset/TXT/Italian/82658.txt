DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw Had a 90th birthday party here with 8 family members in a back room. They went above and beyond to make this evening special. As usual, the food was great (especially oso buco, veal and homemade pastas) and the service was very good. You do need time for dinner as this is not a rush place but a dining experience. The ambiance is classy but not stuffy. They even coordinated the entertainer we hired (Squeezebox Hero) with the cake presentation. We will be back next time we are in Vegas.
