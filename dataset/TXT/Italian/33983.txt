I was feeling like a calzone one day and wanted to try a place different from my usuals. A coworker always had Joe's New York Pizza and it looked good since I had never been I figured why not.  Checked out their menu online and placed the order for one of their 3 Item Monster Calzones.  The calzone was pretty huge for the price so I was very happy at first.  It was load with ricotta, mozzarella, marinara, and a ton of pepperoni, no exaggeration.  Only thing I didn't like about it was the dough was undercooked.  I was literally eating uncooked dough that had a little toast to it.  It's a good thing work had a little toaster oven I throw it in and went back to work, the room smelt so good.  I don't know if they usually under cook their calzones or if it was because I customized my calzone and didn't know how adjust for that, I don't know.  In the future I'd asked them to leave it in the oven longer.

I have to give them solid OK considering I could've gave them a MEH for undercooked calzone dough but I heard they have AYCE pizza during lunch or before dinner, don't know the details but that's cool.  And from what pizzas I've seen looks pretty good.  They have a good selection of items on their menu. I like the interior and that you can order online.
