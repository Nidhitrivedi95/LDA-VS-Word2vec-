Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw I ordered a cheese and pepperoni pizza from this place,because I saw it had quite a few awesome reviews so I thought I'd try it out. This pizza is absolutely amazing! I think this is going to be my new favorite spot, I know pepperoni pizza is pretty hard to mess up but you'd be surprised lol. As a local I'd have to say this is definitely one of the better pizza places that I've gone to!
