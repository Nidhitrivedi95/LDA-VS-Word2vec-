UHPjDgiEHnTe7-MP-b2kyQ I had higher hopes for Veneto based on some of the Yelp reviews I read prior to going and it was good but definitely not great.  Again, like most of my meals on this trip, it was dinner with a big group of coworkers. By far, the dish that got the most rave reviews was the special of the day a  Dover Sole that they boned and filleted for you at the table.  But.... I didn't order that and neither did the guy next to me.

I started with a house salad with a vinaigrette that was overwhelmed by the amount of vinegar in the dressing.  For an entree, I got veal parmigiana which was two smallish pounded out pieces of veal with good tomato sauce good mozzarella on top and some overcooked squash, zucchini and carrots on the side.  It was tasty but not much veal for the price paid.  The guy next to me got the Osso Bucco and judging by how he had to hack at it with a knife, far from the fall of the bone tender you expect from a braised dish.

Based on how happy the Dover Sole crowd was with what they ordered, I'd be willing to give it another go on a subsequent trip to Scottsdale but they would need to step it up all the way around to get a third visit.
