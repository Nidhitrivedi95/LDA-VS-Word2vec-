nDZWoEznY5-oSCc2HvoMtA I feel like Villa Francesca has gone downhill recently. We've been multiple times since they opened and it used to be one of my favorite spots to fill my Italian craving. 

This last visit, our food came out so fast there was no way it was made fresh. Mine was chicken parm - sad little chicken pieces partially burned and not fresh at all. It was like they fried it earlier and then for my order they just popped it in the oven to melt some cheese on top. My pasta was cold and watery. So disappointing!

Our waitress never refilled our wine or water - service was definitely lacking that night. In case management reads this review - please educate your staff about your pasta. I asked our server if any of their pasta was made there, to which she replied "Yes, it's all made here." When my Barilla-looking pasta arrived, I realized she meant "Yes, someone opens the box and boils it here" Come on!

Maybe this is a good place to grab pizza and a pint before a game at TWC? But I don't see myself going back for a "real" Italian dinner. Sad to see the quality go down like this!
