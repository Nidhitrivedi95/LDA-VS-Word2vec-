We decided to just order the shared appetizers since the prices were just high...of course it's encore.  We ended ordering mac bites, barbecue ribs, some sweet potato fries and their banana split.  The service was fine and wait staff attended to our needs. They even gave us some veggies and of pretzels sticks while we waited for our foods, which was cool. Kudos to the banana split sundae that had a different twist.
