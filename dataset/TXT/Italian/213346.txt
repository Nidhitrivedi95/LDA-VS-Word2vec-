The quality of their grocery items are unique and truly Italian.  I've spent some time over there, and this is the real deal.  You could have a field day in here if you wanted to cook a special dinner.

Yes, the wait was a bit for ordering at 2pm (it wasn't packed).  But the food...the food shut me up it was soo delicious.  The portions are enormous, so you get really good value for whatever you order.

One weird thing though: I clearly stated the YELP discount for 1 free cannolli, and the cashier looked at me like I was crazy and charged me for it.  The cannoli was probably the least satisfying part of the meal.  Other than that, I'd come back for sure.
