RHcfJ-l69RbBE4viU0-jwQ Holy spicy!!!  I had the hot sausage with cheese and mushrooms and my goodness, so hot.  Very delicious though and very filling.  That being said though, and maybe I'm a bit biased because the first ever Italian sandwich I ever had was from California Sandwiches but I like Cali's better.  They do something with the sausage that just makes it taste way better.  Plus it's a sloppy mess which I love about Cali's.  This place was good and much spicier but not as much sauce and just not up to my par.  Very quick service though and a lot of options.  Price is basically what you would expect.  If you're not the best with spicy, definitely go for the medium.
