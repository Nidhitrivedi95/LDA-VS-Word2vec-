epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ Out of the handful of Little Italy spots I have tried, this is now my favorite. The reviews about the award winning 3 Cheese Tortellini are no joke-- that is what I ordered and it is no surprise why it is Mia Bella's most beloved dish. I can't wait to order it again. Our table had a hard time not filling up on the bread, as it was the best bread at a restaurant we had ever tasted. James was our server and he was also one of the bests ever. He was on it like flies on you know what and even noticed that I had slopped on my shirt (I couldn't help but to shovel the tortellini in my mouth like a barbarian) and came over to ask if I would like some soda water and a fresh linen. I mean talk about A+++ service. All around just an amazing dining experience.
