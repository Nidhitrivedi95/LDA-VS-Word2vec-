yY9XOQ1Baozl8HGK4mN76w Nicantoni's wasn't bad.  But I wasn't blown away like most of the other reviewers.  I pass this place everyday on the way to pick up my son from La Petite Academy.  The wife and I decided to stop in here last Friday for a quick dinner.

The staff is really friendly.  Our waitress was an older lady, REALLY talkative and just like a gradma should be, talking about her grandbabies...  She was just sweet and very nice to my son... that's refreshing!  4 stars for service!

The Food:  We ordered Dom the spaghetti, Morgan had a slice of pizza and a greek salad.  I had the Ceasar salad.

The salads were good, tasty, nothing spectacular, but satisfying.  The spaghetti wasn't bad.. I'm really picky when it comes to spaghetti and this was pretty good.  

The pizza, was just eh... kinda greasy not a whole lot of flavor... but at the same time it wasnt horrible... and I have to say, by the time I tasted it it was cold, so to be fair I would have to go again and order it for myself... nice and hot to get the full effect.

Over-all not a bad place at all.  I wil have to go back for the great service and I'd like to try some more of the pasta dishes or the eggplant parm.

Give it a try!
