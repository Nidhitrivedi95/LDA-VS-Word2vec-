qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ Best pizza in town.  The owner is always friendly and remembers your name.  Even if you haven't been there in 3 months he will still remember you or try to even after1,000 people have come in.  The wait is a little long for pizza some times but who cares when the food is so good! We will always be loyal to this place and support the local business it has grown into. Get the knots and a pepperoni pizza!
