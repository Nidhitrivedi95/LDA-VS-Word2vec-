lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg The best deep dish pizza I've tasted! The resto is in good location. But the staff at the entrance getting your name for tables are so clueless and kind of unprofessional. They need more training on how to deal/ greet customers. Also, the wait for the deep dish pizza is about 30 to 45 min ! So don't come here hungry or you'll lose your patience. But 1 thing for sure, the DEEP DISH PIZZA is worth the wait.
