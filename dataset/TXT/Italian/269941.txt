XKzXbANurEvec3UzQRKcRg Where was my lunch Special menu?! Why I was not offered that at 1:30 pm on a Friday?

Belfiero Trattoria & Pizzeria is a good option if you are in Scarborough and looking for some decent Italian food.

I love the Fettuccine Asparagi ($16) which is house made pasta tossed with chopped Asparagus, Prosciutto, Onion, Parmigiano, Cream and Truffle Aroma. 

Portion size is a little small... I can eat 2 of those with no problem... The sauce was really good which I wiped the plate clean with some nice warm bread.

Why was I not offered any bread until I ask at the end of my meal? Most Italian restaurants I been to give me some bread even when I order or while I wait for my entrees...

I am willing to come back again to Belfiero to try out their Linguine Frutti di Mare ($19)... (My DC will order that for sure!) but hopefully the services will improve....
