xiNBWLfditvEZ_GAbGUbCw This was a good find. Behind American Tavern. Not crowded but good crowd at the bar. Small but has a nice patio. The menu is also kinda small but it has a decent amount of variety. 

3 of us went. Got the Pumpking on tap. And ordered the cavatelli with meatballs and sausage. My family got the lobster mac n cheese. And the paida fungi which was the special. It was like a mushroom flatbread. All good. Everyone liked their dinner. And we were full. Portions decent. 

Met the owner. She and her family relocated from Connecticut and bought this restaurant cuz that's what they do. She told me. LOL! She is originally from CLE. I like to know about the personal stuff. Makes me want to eat there more. 

Definitely go back. This one is worth a try.
