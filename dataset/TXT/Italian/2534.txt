"Chicago-style" and "Chin-dribbling-fatness" can pretty much be used interchangeably when describing food. Either you get it or you don't. I won't try to convince anyone.  

Personally, I recommend the Italian Beef sandwich with mozzarella and sweet and hot peppers in lieu of the signature Chicago-dog. Any hack who has had one can emulate the Chicago Hot Dog, but it takes a special touch to get the Italian Beef sammich just right. Luke's does. 
 
Don't take a date there. Don't expect comfy seating and a cozy atmosphere. You may wait a long time in line. You may wait a long time for your food. You may ingest 2300 calories in a single sitting. Your circulatory system may temporarily shut down upon completion of your meal.  If any of these things are a concern for you, please go elsewhere. For those of you who remain undaunted, check it out.
