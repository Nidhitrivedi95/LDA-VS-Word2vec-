wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg One of the best pasta place in Toronto! I went here for lunch with my family and I felt extremely satisfied with their service and food. When I first walked in I saw another family where one person was in a wheelchair. I was super impressed with how the server paid attention to that person and made sure to check in with everyone else (very heartwarming) :) 

I had the Capri pasta (linguine with shrimp and clams) and it was a good sized portion for the price. Best of all, the atmosphere was casual. From a restaurant like this where you would assume it to be business casual wear, it was actually very casual. Food came promptly and is a place I would definitely recommend. It truely lives up to its hype!
