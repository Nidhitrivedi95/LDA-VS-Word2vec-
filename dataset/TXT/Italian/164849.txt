m-ZqJFz9jJqyBA9Wsp_3KA Myself and two others arrived at 12:25 PM on a Thursday. The fact that there was only one other table with customers should have been our sign.

The service was pretty good, the food was mediocre. I had the cheese steak and the steak was cooked to death, actually crispy and dry. Sad. 

Nobody was impressed, it was OK at best.
