WpZkK951tqHONywmKLmhQw Oregano's is OMG!!! So Guuud! :D
We had the House Salad with Ranch for a appetizer. The Deep Dish pizza with meatballs, sausage, bacon, pepperoni, mushrooms and olives. It was AMAZING! Plus, they add fresh grated parmesan right at the table. Everything was fresh, tasted so yummy and the cheese was such good quality. Our waiter Charles was so nice and personable. His kindness was refreshing and much appreciated. We got a Pizza cookie with ice cream on the house! It was well worth it. The design of the restaurant was pretty cool with the 50's-60's vibe. The atmosphere was enjoyable. We will definitely be going back!
