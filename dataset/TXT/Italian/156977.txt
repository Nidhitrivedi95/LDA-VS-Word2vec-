lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ Awful. We were there with a party of seven  and our server straight up refused to split our bill into two separate checks. It's not like we were asking him to split it seven different ways, just into two different bills.  Seriously, I've been a server. It isn't that difficult. Soooo we decided not to eat there and my husband and I left. If you don't want my business, I will go elsewhere. There are enough good restaurants in Las Vegas that care about their business that I don't need to eat at this kitschy tacky mess with poor service. 

Also, my friend ordered a soda and it took our server thirty minutes to get that and to get straws for the table.

Aaa and the server kicked my chair every damn time he walked by.
