u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down last night, it officially opens this weekend so we were sampling it pre-grand opening. We had fantastic service and the food was incredible! If you're looking for a great authentic Italian meal--THIS IS IT!

I liked the ambiance of restaurant blue light accenting the walls, pictures in black and white (one of the owner), tvs on walls playing movies with subtitles on, and music going. The menus are electronic, a little heavy.  But each table got an ipad that displayed drinks (wine list, cocktails), daily specials. It was very high tech!
