NnOAwa0A2tNPnZl9IHVLPQ It's hard to put into words how perfect of an experience we had at Zeppe's last Friday for our wedding. Firstly, we gave Zeppe's a very short notice to plan our big event (3 weeks). Without hesitation, Chris, Zeppe's event planner, dove in, reserved the entire restaurant for us, and began planning the decorations and food menu. She had everything put together for us within 2 weeks --from the menu, to linens, to decorations, to a schedule of the night's events.
Now for the night of the wedding itself--the restaurant was set up perfectly to host a wedding. The tables were moved out of the middle dining room, which was where we had the ceremony and would later be used as the dance floor. The decorations were absolutely gorgeous--flowers, linens, centerpieces, a hand decorated trellis, and candles. The food was absolutely delicious--we crafted our own menu and were given a large variety of options to pick from. We also had an open bar, which worked out perfectly. 
Also, the price was unbeatable for a 60 person wedding. Zeppe's was extremely reasonable and tailored the menu to match our budget. 
The staff was very helpful and efficient. All of our guests had a blast and we had the time of our lives. Chris and Zeppe's management staff and wait staff really pulled this off! We cannot thank them all enough. This is a truly special group of people. Thank you again for making our perfect day just that--perfect!
