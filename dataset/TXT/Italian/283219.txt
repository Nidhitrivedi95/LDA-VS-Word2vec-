Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA These guys are a joke. I ordered a pizza and chic parm sandwich at 8:37 on on a Monday night. At 9:20 I called to confirm it was on its way, I spoke to who seemed like the owner or mgr. He said 8 minutes, lots of traffic. I said is the food on its way, I said has driver actually left, he would not answer the question. It is now 10:06 pm and nothing while I breathe in the fumes at the valet area of the hotel. What a joke. Number one on Yelp, who stuffed those ballets. Run to a different location.
Why have a restaurant if you don't do what you say. I'm still starving.
