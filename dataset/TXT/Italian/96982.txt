esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA OYSTER HEAVENNNN!

Six of us came to dine here for company dinner and it surprised me how delicious the food actually was. 

For 6 of us.. we definitely feasted.

Several dozen plates of oysters - all very good!
Pico de oyster - had to order this twice!
Cream de oyster - also ordered this twice!
Pan roast - hmmm.. was good, I do like the actual OYSTER BAR PALACE STATION BETTER
Alaskan crab legs - perfect warm temperature when it is served to you.. remove the shell, dip the lobster piece in the warm butter and into your mouth it goes.. *drooool*

If I'm lazy to go all the way to PALACE STATION for my oyster fix, would totally come here!
