While Chicago cuisine isn't known for their subtle flavors or soft aromas, its pleasing to know that tradition finds its way to Chicago Joes. 

Though a little "heavy" for a Friday night, I was enticed into making some terrific dinner decisions by my patient host. Who kept me at ease from all my fidgeting of feeling out of place.

Relieved that I kept my ordering to a minimum as the two dishes I ordered glided down with quite generous portions & then some. When a torrent of flavors comes cascading down, the night becomes rather adventurous. 

As demonstrated by the Chicago Hot Shrimp, tender meat bathed in rich sauce that's heavy on the palate, savory & delightful taste. Something that the bread that accompanied dinner would agree on. Some agree that half an order wouldn't suffice a hungry person, half an order of their Mussels Marinara can feed me & my doppelganger. As I pick on the shells & extract the ambrosia, a sudden urge hits & I'm tempted to pickup the used shells & scoop up the marinara off the plate. 

But the night ends in a more civil manner as I pick up the check & exit with tomorrow's lunch.
