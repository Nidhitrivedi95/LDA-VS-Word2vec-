fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ We went here for dinner and the food was delicious. I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and it was very tasty. The restaurant also gives u delicious bread they make fresh and warm out the oven. Their portions are big very filling! Definitely coming back, staff is friendly :)
