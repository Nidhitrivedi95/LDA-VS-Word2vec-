2-0Z3UeQZ_Mx98m8Dv3oeQ I'm not sure why this place has such a low rating. We tried to go to E11even before the Raps game and it was ridiculously busy. Due to proximity, we walked over to Aria and we were seated right away. 

They have a pretty extensive wine menu by the bottle. I saw a review indicating they don't serve by the glass of take debit; they do both however the 'by the glass' section is a bit limited but pretty standard. We had a bottle of chianti -- which you can't really good wrong with and my friend had a pasta that she devoured in seconds and I had the salmon filet which was really nicely cooked, not too salty and went well with the quinoa salad. 

The only real downfall was the service. It was a bit on the slower side, however, it seemed that our server was handling several of the tables so we requested our cheque when our entrees arrived so we could depart immediately for the game.
