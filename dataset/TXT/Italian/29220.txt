5CeizAHfOQJOI6sSh0kJmw Realy was quite disappointed, Had travelled up from Tempe to watch a movie with my wife at camelview 5 and so looked up the reviews and chose this place. Business must be slow - since we were the only customers on a Friday night other than a couple of pickups.  The 3 folks behind the counter begged us to come in with their eyes.

Large slices of pizza which had been pre-cooked were on display. Chose one each and they were rerun though their reheat oven. 
We took our seats outside on the sidewalk at a large and very unstable plastic table. I have to give these guys a star cos it didnt take long for them to run through the reheat oven.  They shouted at us to come and pickup the pizzas after they had been reheated, In my stupidity I had assumed they might bring the slices out to us - esp. with 3 idle folks behind the counter. They had asked me if I wanted a drink, but unfortunately they didnt have a beer or wine license and didnt feel like paying several dollars for bottles of water.

Pizza was rather heavy, greasy and kinda soggy. Initially my wife had wondered if hers had been deep fried cos it was so soggy and greasy. I told her not to be silly - that happens only in the UK.
Finally we finished up our pizzas and I stuffed the used plates and plastic ware into the overflowing garbage can outside.

Nostaligia is the word - I was taken back to the world of my youth spent in the UK eating greasy deep fried pizzas served by grumpy old Italians.... :-)
I really could have kicked myself for having chosen such a lousy establishment when there are so many other good places to eat in down-town Scottsdale.

We wandered off down the street peering into shop after shop that were filled with cowboy hats and indian jewellery. You have to wonder how they all survive.
