klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw Thank you, Steve Wynn! Thank you for going vegan so that people like me can have a great meal. 

Vegan Options - 

Florentine Benedict - English muffin, sauteed spinach, and smokey tofu. The smokey flavor of the tofu makes this dish fabulous. 

Wynn Double "Cheese"burger, Fries, and a Chocolate Shake - Sometimes you just want an indulgent meal without it feeling heavy on the stomach. This was so darn good! 

I will keep coming back here every time I go to Vegas!
