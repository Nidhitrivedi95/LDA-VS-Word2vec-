5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g I've only eaten here twice and the second time was not good. I got the shrimp Po boy which was served on a hamburg bun. Yes, a Hamburger bun that was thick and dense with about 8 shrimp on it. First of all a Po boy sandwich of any kind should be 1) on a roll and 2) over flowing. You must be wondering why these are the requirements for this sandwich?  Well let me tell you, the roll with its crease holds the over flowing goodness that's inside. They should have a disclaimer on this overpriced sandwich that states; beware that this sandwich is literally a Po boy b/c its inspired by ppl that thought a Po boy should have as little filling as possible to represent the disenfranchised shrimp lover. 

***fries were good
