The grilled cheese was mostly toasted bread with a sprinkle of grated cheese, my eggs Benedict was ok nothing to write home about and same for the French toast. The breakfast potatoes were very good although I don't think they were made to order as they were not very hot. Overall, the service was good. Waiter was attentive and fast. The food was ok, I will probably give it another try.
