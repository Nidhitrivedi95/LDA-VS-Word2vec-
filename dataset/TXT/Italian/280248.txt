Yo8ODT7aFMM2xKUd1yaBVw Did another Ladies Group Happy Hour and again, we were very impressed!  The service was the best, all the way from our reservation to the nite we were there.
Had 25 ladies on the patio for Happy Hour, servers were wonderful, food was delicious (as always) and the weather (which I think they asked for :)) was perfect!
A really nice location and great restaurant for all occasions!
