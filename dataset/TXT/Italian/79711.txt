D1lAVtlav4atQTJnIvtcpw I didn't like our server that afternoon, and that set the tone for the entire meal and this post. 

He had this air of superiority over us, (and I'm only guessing here) because we didn't want alcohol during a work related lunch, we didn't want soft drinks (didn't want all that sugar), and just went for the Toronto's finest water. We skimped on the dessert because we just weren't that hungry. 

Having a clumsy waiter was slightly annoying, but to have a dirty fork fall off a plate and onto a diner (in their clean pristine work outfit) is inexcusable. 

Food was just OK. It's better than the food court, but it's just that, OK. Tolerable because we needed a restaurant with service and a place to talk.
