q5GKRL_u3YsP8ADaU4uNbw I had a terrible experience at this place. I went in on a Tuesday night on my break from work to get a personal pizza which comes with 6 slices. I only got cheese (thank god I didn't get any meat toppings from this place). I ate 2 slices and then went back to work. I started having really bad stomach cramps around 9ish and when I got home an hour later I felt terrible. I didn't feel like I was going to throw up, but that's what eventually happened all night long continuing into the next day. Since this is the only thing I had to eat since breakfast I knew the pizza was the cause of it. It was super greasy, I felt like I was drinking the cheese. The bread is like cardboard, and there was barely any sauce on the pizza. Also it cost me $8 for a 6 slice pizza, I could've got a better deal at any other pizza chain and guaranteed wouldn't have gotten food poisoning! Won't be eating here again!
