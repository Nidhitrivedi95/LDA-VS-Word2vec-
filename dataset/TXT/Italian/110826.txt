We came for lunch and was pleased by a well decorated environment in a nice hotel. Our server wasn't friendly and once the order was taken, never checked in. We ordered an appetizer and meals. When our meals came, we inquired about the appetizer and with apologies, it was taken off the bill. The food was normal--nothing to write home about. 

Nice decor masked a sub-par experience. I'm not sure what "ordinary" is in Italian (Giada would know), but we won't be back. Sad.
