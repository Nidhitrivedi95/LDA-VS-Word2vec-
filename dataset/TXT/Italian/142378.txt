JPmu9-2jd7nGIuTXEqT9zg Was here this week. Had their special called Lobster Frangelica. Had the same a few months ago. It was wonderful with real lobster meat.

This time it was monk fish imitation. No lobster meat. The actual owner prepared it. I think that is called "false advertising" and cheating the customer. Not coming back!
