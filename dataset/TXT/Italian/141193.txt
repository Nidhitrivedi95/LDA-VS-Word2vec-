jNQnscvgn_dMTS954qW_9Q The great thing about The Open Kitchen is that it never changes. I've lived in the Charlotte area all of my life (50 yrs) and The Open Kitchen is the same now as it was when I was young. My wife and I went to The Open Kitchen as teenagers and we took our children there when they were young. We have been married 30 years now and regularly enjoy The Open Kitchen. I agree the pizza isn't great, but many of the other dishes are wonderful. My personal favorite is the braciole. The Open Kitchen is the only restaurant that I am aware of in Charlotte that serves it. If you are looking for a fancy uptown dining experience then forget The Open Kitchen, but if you are looking to enjoy a good meal at a landmark Charlotte restaurant then try it out. The family that owns and operates The Open Kitchen are really good people and they are dedicated to preserving the ambiance and menu that made it World Famous.
