aadG1TzULt-ezzUJZUSSJQ Two of us for lunch on a Wednesday.

Margherita pizza which was so mushy as to be inedible
A greasy linguine dish paired with a mushy breaded chicken 
Way overpriced Caesar with what was clearly brought in dressing (i.e. not made on premises)
Minestrone soup that my friend did like

Service was strange. Mains arrived while we were eating our appetizers...reaction to being told the meal was crap was a shrug...

Certainly will not return.
