Bs8AvNO3xWoURWpqiGd_4w I have eaten at other Macaroni Grills in Az and outside. This particular location has issues with the food being overdone. Way overpriced and the sampler platter consisted of a handful of calamari, two pieces of rustic toast with shaved parm and a side of tomatoes "bruschetta"- I think not, and three mozzarella sticks FOR $11???? Three slices of tomato with small lumps of mozzarellla on each a Capresse salad?
Quality, quantity and price are so scewed here- better go to Carraba's for almost the same price. Service was good though.
