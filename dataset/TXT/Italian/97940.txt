EUQoB_ph7_xIyj7JZGI3bg I went for dinner to Giussepes and really enjoyed my experience. If you're looking for an authentic Italian meal, this is the place!

The location/venue doesn't do the location much justice. It's in a "meh" shopping plaza next to sprouts. So, initially, it doesn't feel very special. The staff and the food, on the other hand, make the experience fantastic! All of the pasta is hand-made in house!

Met the owner, Rich, and he is an awesome guy who cares most about quality and authenticity. 

Great for a quiet dinner. I ate bruschetta, chicken parm, paired with a delicious cab-mix wine and ended things with a crème brulée. I was basically in heaven.

Overall, I would give this place 5 stars, but I gave them 4 because I wish they had a nicer venue.
