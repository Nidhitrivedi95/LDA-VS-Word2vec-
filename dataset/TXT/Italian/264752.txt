wyKd4F1fAfDCA1rTxSoT_A I love the ambience. The wine collection is great, and the staff have been lovely on my yet visits. They don't rush you, and let you enjoy the for. The food itself is great, and I recommend chef's specialty: the lamb. It was a tasty piece of meat, and it was cooked to perfection. Their cheese collection could be improved, in my opinion.
