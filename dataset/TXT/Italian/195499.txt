PJVjfGtVc71M0XlUr83teQ Fantastic place. Was visiting Scottsdale and ventured down to My Pie since we are east coasters and always crave the best pizza.  My Pie did not disappoint.  The ingredients are so fresh and my wife, kids and myself all thought it was incredible.  Great concept, awesome decor and fun atmosphere.  Besides the pizza, the meatballs were amazing too. Hoping one of these opens up in Louisiana where we currently live.  Highly recommend
