nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ Decided to come here after driving all the way from Florida. Four of us sat down and placed our order, and then our waitress Hilga disappeared after that. Thirty minutes have now passed and our beers and drinks are empty but no food is present. Finally flag our server down and she looks at us and tells us yeah yeah it's coming it's on the way and she didn't even refill our drinks! Later, she comes back with a notepad and asks each of us what we ordered and began to write it down! 45 minutes in and she hadn't even given our order to the kitchen. Our server was replaced and they gave us a free antipasti platter that we didn't even want - we just wanted our food at this point. No one touched the platter at all. Our food finally came and we were approached by the manager offering us one cannoli or one slice of cheesecake for the four of us to split. One dessert for four people after sitting there for an hour waiting for our food! When the bill came, there were no apologies and no comping on any of our meals, and the food here isn't cheap at all. Hilga has been our server two times in the past and after the third time, we won't be coming back until she is gone.
