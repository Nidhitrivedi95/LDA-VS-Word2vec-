q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Food was above average but the experience and ambiance are awesome!  Went for lunch and had the italian beef sandwhich....just ok...my friend had the pasta...better...i brought it home and warmed it up with some grilled chicken i made...yum! So you dont come here for the food you come for the experience of being at a speakeasy during prohibition.  In the evening they have live music which i bet is pretty cool
