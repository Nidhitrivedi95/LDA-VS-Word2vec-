q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ What a cool place! Service and food were great. So glad we found this place, we never usually venture far from downtown but glad we did. New favorite Italian place. We had the cheese bread to start, pretty good, came with dipping sauce. I actually just told them what I wanted, a cheese ravioli with a cream pesto sauce and they did it, amazing. Pesto was so good. Husband order the Spagetti and meatball. Very good, sauce wasn't to tangy, meat was perfect, made with just a little sausage but not to much. Well done Everyone!
