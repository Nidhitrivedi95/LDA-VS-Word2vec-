tWdp26XQEJqJGnRmFVJQxA First of all, I know nothing about Italian food. My opinion on the taste of Carpaccio was just okay...maybe its because I was not familiar with Italian spices. I thought it may taste like Japanese beef tataki but i was wrong....
Our pizza canadeses was spicy + all three side toppings were even more spicy...I didn't expect that...
Finally I tried this panna cotta for the dessert that I've never heard of and i really loved it. 
As for the price, I think it's a tinny bit over priced...I was expecting a little more topping on their pizzas.
I had no complains about the service, although she didn't say goodbye to us when we left, she patiently explained the menu and offered her recommendations.
