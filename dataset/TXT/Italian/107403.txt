But still wanted to give it a try. 
No hostess. Waited a few minutes before the bartender came out to seat us. 
My menu was dirty.
My silverware was dirty.
Glasses spotty. 
Come on guys. If you're slow and still can't keep things clean.....?
Food was ok, but definately didn't live up to the prices. I am in the business and it makes me sad when a new restaurant doesn't do well. 
These little details could easily be fixed.
