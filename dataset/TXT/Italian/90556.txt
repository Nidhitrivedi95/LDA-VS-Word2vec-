eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA Something magical didn't happen this time or I was not in the right mood for Italian food. We usually go to the one in Town Square but this time it was faster to go to this one. 
Food was OK but lacked flavor. Mine was too salty and wife's plate was a little under-seasoned. Kid's portions are gigantic. Not that I mind taking stuff to go but I could split one portion for both of them. 

I think I'll take Brio off my "occasion dining" list for sometime. At least this particular location.
