N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg My bf loves deep dish pizza. He received a gift card for his birthday from a friend for here so we finally made it in (we don't really live close to here). It was totally worth the drive!! We went on a Sunday afternoon and didn't have much of a wait, maybe 10 minutes at the most. We shared a salad and each had a beer. The salad was great and good sized. Our waitress was very sweet and helped us pick out a pizza to share and it was so good. I'm not usually a deep dish pizza girl but I would definitely come here again! I definitely recommend giving it a try!
