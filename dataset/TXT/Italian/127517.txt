Actually, it doesn't close until July 28.

And I wish we had gone here more than this one time. Fantastic french fries. Not the super crisp kind (my fave) but delicious nonetheless. And the beef sandwiches are great. We took some tamales home (cuz don't think we've ever had Chicago tamales before). Sad it's closing.
