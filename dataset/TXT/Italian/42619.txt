7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg We came here last night to celebrate two family birthdays and my mouth is still watering.

Upon walking in I was really underwhelmed, the dining area is about as small as a living room with no decoration on the walls. The chairs and tables were basic and looked rickety. This restaurant is also not in a very good area, they even have a guy that stays outside to watch your cars. Needless to say I was skeptical. This is a great example of why not to judge a book by its cover.

There were six of us and our pleasant quirky waitress explained the menu to us while we decided on bottles of wine. We started with the non breaded calamari appetizer, this was honestly the most underwhelming part of the meal and I wouldn't order this again. It is such torture watching servers walk by with HUGE portions of delicious homemade Italian in the biggest over sized plates and bowls I have ever seen.

I ordered the veal Parmesan. I have never tried veal before but the man watching the cars said 'if you order anything with veal, you are in for a treat' so I figured he knew best. I was so glad I did because it was divine! Every thing came in super sized portions, I snuck bites off of almost everyone's plates so I can say that the  chicken Marsala is out of this world along with melt in your mouth meatballs. Don't forget about the pillowy gnocchi. I want to go back right now. Everybody will leave with a box,  now whether the delicious leftovers even make it til the next day is up to you, but it will certainly taunt you in your fridge. Also most meals come in at under $20!

Seriously do not let the atmosphere of this place scare you away, A great dining experience among great company with some of the best Italian food I have ever had. Sounds like a perfect night to me.
