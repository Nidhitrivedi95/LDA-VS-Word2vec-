OqYZdBUgmId7tZMAVpiFCw went here for Summerlicious with a friend and we are both very satisfied. I had sea food salad, pasta and tiramisu. we were expecting the salad as normal salad with bit of sea food but turned out to be ALL sea food and it was very delicious. the bread that came with it were also chewy and good. the entree was in a nice portion and all three courses were very tasty. we sat in the patio, where has a lovely view and is quiet. trees gave us good shade so even it was a hot day, we still felt comfortable sitting outdoors. the waiter was very nice as well. in all we felt satisfied and happy having lunch here and would love to come again for another summerlicious treat as well as their regular menu:)
