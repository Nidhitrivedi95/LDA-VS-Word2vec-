gjATEWAllTfxfxhGqJ93sQ Lots of great vegetarian options, amazing salad & great pizzas. They also have a really nice patio overlooking the square for a nice day, although the tables on the patio are very close together (we actually ended up having conversations with the tables on either side of us).

Anyways, had a great meal and would definitely recommend. Right in the center of Montreal with lots of shopping and touring to do around it. 

It has a big yellow awning that honestly doesn't look very promising from afar, but once you get closer, it has a lovely interior and atmosphere to eat in, so don't be surprised!
