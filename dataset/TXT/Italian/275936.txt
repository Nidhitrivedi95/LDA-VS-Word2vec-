yBGqf8l9NOM3vZFnlxcgzQ What a hidden treasure.  Was looking for a place to have lunch with a friend on Valentines day. Most places in Little Italy were not open. We walked in and they said today it was 25% off, on Valentines day?  So we stayed.  Food was wonderful, waitress was so nice and knew when and when not to show up.    The guy making the pizzas looked like he was really enjoying making them.   I didn't get a pizza, but will next time, and there will be a next time. They could do without the big screen TV, it's not a sports bar.
