BX4HheOcR7sdGLvFrBXy2A The best pizza in Ballantyne!   You're served with a smile and the food comes out fast!  The place is very clean and they have condiments on every table.  The pizza slices are huge and it's only $3 per slice. The meal deal of 2 slices of pizza and a soda for 7.25, is worth every penny! Reminds me of being in New York!  Looking forward to going back!  
They also serve subs, pasta, salads, calzones, etc...
