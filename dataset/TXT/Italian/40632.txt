7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ I wish I knew our waiters name but honestly, I will never again dine here or recommend it to anyone. Carnevino should be ashamed of themselves for having a staff as terrible as who served us. $1500 dollars later, all we are talking about is our terrible waiter, terrible service and what a joke this place is.

We dined at this restaurant the evening of 3/17, a party of 11. Our waiter PUSHED for us to get this pre fixed however many course meal, and was not taking NO for answer. He was rude, pushy and just terrible. When we said that we all wanted to order on our own, he got even more rude and horrible. Our waiter refused to take our drink orders, he would actually cut us off, mid sentence, and say "AFTER I take your FOOD order". I wanted to let him know that the restaurant makes a ton of money on drinks and he should definitely make sure to keep us happy on the drink front. He was TERRIBLE. The food was fine, but the service really ruined everything. When we did FINALLY get drinks, they were make incorrectly. What a joke.

Gratuity was included in the total of our bill, and we left nothing extra. The waiter then approached the bill payer and harassed him about the additional tip. Is this for real? Who does that? Carnevino, I would love a chance to speak with a manager about this, we should have that evening but couldn't wait to get out of there. What a disgrace. Never again.
