vlJsF5tTfplbo1D5kbUPmQ i'm the first to admit it -- i give Italian food in general a half-hearted shrug and an "eh." i'm not hatin', i just never, ever crave an Italian meal (unless it's my ma's meatballs, she's pretty great at making those).
so, when a group of co-workers picked this place for a bday lunch i was prepared for a shrug-able meal with nothing of importance to note.
the sign is easy to miss under a growth of greenery, so keep your eyes peeled. plenty of parking, but that was because 1. we got there about 1120 and it opens at 11; and 2. i was warned in advance that this place is almost always dead during lunch. but a big parking lot nonetheless, something that might appeal to you since Postino's is next door and often a parking or waiting nightmare.
the dining area is what i call a parents' fancy-factor dream: linen tablecloths, pre-set stemware and bread plates. spacious, and sure enough, we were the only patrons. server was Italiano through and through, nice, helpful and attentive. three paninis were ordered (2 caprese and a filet mignon) and i *tried* to order the caprese app (simple plate of tomato, basil and mozz, i wasn't very hungry). even went so far as point to it and mention that it should come out with the other orders. i say tried because i ended up with the chicken caprese salad somehow. chicken wasn't very good, unfortunatley, a lot of chewy rubbery bits and not very flavorful. the greens ...i don't know how to describe that i didn't like the mix, but i felt like i had to do a lot of picking through to get a good bite. dressing was scant but tasted good, mozzarella was clearly the star -- soft, light and flavorful (and made in house, someone mentioned, but don't hold me to that).
the rest of the party RAVED about their paninis, so if i found myself back (not going to go out of my way) i would def go that route. 
all in all, it was a nicer stop for a professional lunch that was quiet, low key and with good food.
