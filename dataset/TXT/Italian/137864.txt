j7yI3qYRsbGBUv9rShLCaQ The hot sauce was fantastically fabulous. The beer was cold and plentiful. So plentiful in fact, that when the waiter poured our glasses, it foamed up and ran all over the table. 

Speaking of the table, it was orange. So orange, it seemed to be proud of its orangeness. The hot sauce and the orange table were the highlights of the meal. 

I mean, if you like the colour orange, than this place is for you. And if you like hot sauce that will put hair on your chest, this place is totally for you. The dish even had a few long black hairs already on it, it is that strong, and tasty. 

So, if hot sauce and the colour orange are your thing, try this place. Or, if you are in to table beer, hairy dishes, and pizza that is quicker than Delissio and almost as tasty, then you may want to try it.
