BsvCTCVG7lrzXZ68VyyIcg Came here with a large group for a birthday, and was less than impressed. I would've given the place two stars only, but they deserve an extra star because of their overall good service. I ordered the kobe carpacchio, which was okay. The linguine and clams tasted like buttered noodles with a couple clams thrown in. I didn't try the pizza but it looked better. Disappointing!
