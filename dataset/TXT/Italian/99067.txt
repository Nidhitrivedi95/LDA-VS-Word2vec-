eZAbJKjEt-siFM8em1l9mQ They should change the name to Streets of Bejing because their pizza, wings, and sandwiches are about as far from New York as anything I've ever experienced!

Even the worst New York pizza is better than what this place is serving up.
The wings tasted like they were dipped in vinegar.  No flavor.
I've eaten at this location several times, each time thinking how maybe I just got a bad dish, or they were off their game that day. Not the case. 

Good thing for the owners how most people in Arizona who enjoy S.O.N.Y. have never tasted real New York Pizza and wings, otherwise they'd have been out of business long ago.
I will never grace their doorstep again, even if they were giving it away!
