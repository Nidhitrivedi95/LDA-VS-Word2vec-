B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw I've been to Gusto 101 for brunch, lunch, dinner, drinks and patio chilling. It's great for all occasions and definitely one of my top preferences on this King St W/Portland corner (the other one being WVRST).

Things to like:
- nice, professional and attentive service with good knowledge of the menu
- a variety of spaces including an enclosed (but very bright) upstairs patio, street level patio, bar space and and multi-level tables next to an open kitchen
- the wood interior 
- $1 per ounce wine and the overall wine selection
- kale salad
- mushroom truffle fettuccine
- the truffle aioli they have for their fries (I like truffles, okay?!)
- occasional spotting of high profile Torontonians and Suits actors
- a nice vibe whether full or empty, downstairs is especially cozy

Note: it can be pretty busy on weekends and evenings (particularly in warmer weather) with a line situation going on. The downstairs party near the kitchen can be kind of loud and claustrophobic when it's busy because the tables are pretty close together. Upstairs is much more spacious.
