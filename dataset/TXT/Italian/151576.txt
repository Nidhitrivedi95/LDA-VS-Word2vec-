kp9IG_6UDGFn8HxlIDBusQ This is a great family Italian restaurant which I have eaten at on several occasions. This evening we showed up with 12 people without a reservation. We had gone to a funeral and our family all wanted to eat together. We had a reservation at another restaurant (J Alexander) that had promised us they would seat us all together, but when we showed up they told us they were going to put us at separate tables. I called Alfredo's and they said "no problem come on in."  Their service was exceptional, and everyone enjoyed their food.  They bent over backwards to take care of us, and our waitress was phenomenal. I would definitely go back.  This is a restaurant that knows how to take care of its customers.
