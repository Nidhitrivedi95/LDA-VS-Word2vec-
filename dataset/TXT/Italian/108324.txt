I haven't had lamb so flavorful and tender before. Tender vegetables and a beautiful presentation which I enjoyed so much with my friends. Heirloom Tomato Salad as an appetizer is wonderful and to have mouth-watering, red aromatic tomatoes which look and taste homegrown like these in a restaurant is refreshing. House made pasta which I tried as a Primavera that my wife ordered is a fare I'll have on our next visit. My friends had drinks from the bar which they loved and I drank a frothy latte. 
 The service is so fast and friendly that we felt right at home, Mora is a very comfortable place to be! I usually don't do this, we spent two and a half hours at Mora visiting together.
