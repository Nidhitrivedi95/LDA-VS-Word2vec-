0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg I've been to Scarpetta in Beverly Hills and enjoyed the food there so I was delighted to see another location at the Cosmopolitan. I couldn't find any other review mentioning take out/to go orders and on Yelp, they're listed as not offering take out. The kids in our group really wanted pasta though so I thought I'd call to see if perhaps the information on Yelp was incorrect. They do in fact accept take out orders. The lady who answered my call informed me that she could take my order over the phone or I could come in and order at the bar. 

Ordering was easy and I found the staff to be welcoming and knowledgeable. Scarpetta is known for their spaghetti; however, the regular spaghetti sauce does have dairy and the noodles have egg. They removed the cheese and subbed in gluten free noodles to accommodate the kids' allergies. I myself had the duck and foie gras ravioli. All of our orders were delicious and definitely comprised of quality ingredients. It took about a 10 minute wait to make our order.

I'm glad that they offer take out because they were the only restaurant in Cosmopolitan that readily noted that they offered gluten free options. From my past experience with Scarpetta, I know the restaurant itself isn't meant for kids. Therefore I appreciate that we could still enjoy great food in our hotel room and avoid potentially disrupting fellow patrons' dining experiences. Only caveat is that the serving sizes are on the smaller side - arguably not really a surprise for fine dining. The thirteen year old inhaled his serving of spaghetti and the two year old easily finished half of hers in one sitting.
