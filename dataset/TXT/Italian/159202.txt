LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA I could definitely do without the creepy guy walking around playing the accordian, but I'll put up with it for the really yummy food and fun ambiance!

We have eaten here several times and ordered pretty much everything on the menu at one time or another and have never been disappointed.  Some things are better than others, of course (try the chicken and spinach manicotti -- MMMMmm), but overall the quality has always been good, the service fast, and if you can get a window seat, the view is great for people-watching!

Oh and it sounds really plain and boring, but trust me... try the pound cake for dessert.  YUM!
