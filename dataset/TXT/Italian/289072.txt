Stopped in to celebrate a friend's birthday and had not heard of Picazzo's, prior. We were pleasantly surprised on entering-- comfortable but colorful interior was inviting; patio seating was appealing; and the service staff greeted us kindly. We were seated immediately by Elliott. 

We were able to order drinks and appetizers. We had the Caprese, baked BBQ wings, Siracha slaw, and cheese bread (free on Yelp! check in) hit the table with a minimum wait. All were very good, though general feeling was that the slaw was a bit milky and bland, and the wings were a tad too sweet. Still good, though.  

For the meal, we went with a Vortex pizza, a ravioli, and a Mac & Cheese. Excellent stuff! And Elliott was cordial while he checked on us regularly. Never did our drinks go empty, nor were we ever left waiting. And he was super nice to our little girls. 

We'll be back!
