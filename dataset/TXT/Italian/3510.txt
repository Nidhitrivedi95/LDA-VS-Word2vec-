_AVXgkX4DiNQAQj_3tNhFQ It's been years since I last dined here and I literally walked past the resto.   They have changed the name to Locale Mercatto and also the entrance to the restaurant.  If you didn't have a magnifying glass with you, you will probably miss the Mercatto sign which is right underneath the huge Locale sign. 

I loved my seafood spaghetti! The sauce was a creamy texture made from fennel seeds! I thought that very unique and it tasted amazing.  What I didn't like was the service.  I had to wait 15 mins for the server to give me a glass of water. When our pasta arrived, we weren't offered any fresh pepper or Parmesan, I had to ask for it.  In terms of the price, my seafood pasta cost $25 which is average however the food portion was pretty small. I never finish my pasta but I did here.
