SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg It's a shame my review get deleted after I rated it bad. I'm not sure who deleted it, but I was sick for a whole week from eating from a pizza shop. So I contacted Environmental Health. Well I did get a follow-up report from them and the restaurant received a "C". I'm sure it would have gotten something lower if the worker didn't put on a show that day. What wrong is I was stating the truth and sharing my experience. I also have proof from DEH. You would think others would like to know the good, and the bad. But I guess not on yelp. Anyway I guess I wont be writing anymore reviews for restaurants, since i'm scared of going out to eat again due to getting sick.  

I'm sure this will get deleted as well.
