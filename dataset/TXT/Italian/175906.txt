NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ This restaurant does not disappoint. Just moved here from NY and it was wonderful when our neighbor recommended this to us. This is our favorite go to place. We love that it is not a chain and feels like family. The garlic knots I could eat forever. Everything I have had so far has been delicious!!! Three different kinds of pizza, baked ravioli, veal parm. And if you don't have any room for dessert.... Take it with you! I have not  tried them all yet..... But I plan to. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. From day one it felt like home. We have also taken our friends there twice and they enjoyed it as well. When I think of Italian I will  definitely think of Montesano's!
