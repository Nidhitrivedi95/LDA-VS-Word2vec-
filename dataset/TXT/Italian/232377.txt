tKi4OvAlckcVzeP92InsOQ It was our first time here with my son. I had prepaid for the movie tickets online and I was impressed that you get to pick your own seats. No more rushing to get good seats. Once we arrived we ordered our food and headed over to our seats, once there our food was deliver right where we were seating! Talk about amazing specially when being a single mother things can get complicated! 
Environment: Fun & Decent. Comfy Leather Chairs that Recline 
Food: Good but not great
Employees: Very nice & Helpful

The only reason I will be giving them a 4/5 stars is because the seats where we were seating could be cleaned out. It was sticky and dirty.

Otherwise its a nice place to come & distress for a bit. 

P.S: They have $5 dollar movie tickets on Tuesdays!!!!!!
