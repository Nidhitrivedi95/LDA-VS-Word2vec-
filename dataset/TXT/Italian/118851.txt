GzYAIjVULpRrFV2dQMKDog What a joke! Every single reviewmust be from friends and relatives I had lunch there one day last week.i had the salami and Provolone.it
It was just fair. Nothing special yet it was $11. It is a horrible location.they unfortunately will not be open for long.
I. Wish them luck. But.........


I went back on Saturday and gave this nice little place another try. His time I ordered the italian sub. Wow it was really delicious. I'm glad I gave it a 2nd chance.you will do great. Keep it up.     


Dear Carlos- please read the re review. I said it was Delicious!! What's the problem?? It was like an Italian sub. I'm trying to be nice. I was a bit harsh on  my 1st review.
