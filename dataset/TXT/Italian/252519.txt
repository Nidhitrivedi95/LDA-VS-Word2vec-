VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w The only reason we came here that night was because the line for XS was insane and cover went up to $150 for guys.

Since we were staying at the Palazzo, we had free passes to Lavo.  Man, it definitely wasn't even worth the (albeit short) time in line.  It was packed inside -- like sardines!  And geezus, whoever was "DJ'ing"...Pandora could have done a better job.  Yea, that's right!  I really expected better DJ'ing over Memorial Day weekend....but it was stop and go, stop and go...horrible.  But if you really like choppy/bad transitions between some classic 80s rock tunes, this is your place.

Lavo's dance floor was TINY and the ceiling was really low, so this place overheated fast.  They don't offer tap water at the bar either...only Voss bottled water for $6 (think 8 oz)...RIDICULOUS.  

I have no idea how this could possibly be advertised to be on par with Tao.  The crowd had a very high male ratio as well (gee I wonder why).  Definitely will not be coming back for sure.
