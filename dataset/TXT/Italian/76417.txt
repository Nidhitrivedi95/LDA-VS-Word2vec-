ctwh8bLtYm821qz6mhcDVQ Seated in the heart of old town Montreal, this restaurant looks like a grand place to dine and smells like a tourist trap.  The food is expensively price especially for what it is.  

My adventure starts with 10 of us at a table outside.  It took 15 minutes for us to get our orders taken and then another 10 minutes for us to get some glasses of water.  Maybe it's slow or maybe this is just how the do here in Montreal.  Either way me no likey.  

I ordered the seafood pasta.  It came out like Prego on Barilla pasta with little rubber balls that were "seafood" scraps.  Needless to say, I was not pleased.  However, the waiter kindly offered to switch the pasta for something else -- a pizza that was actually pretty darn good.  Oh yea my buddy ordered an apple juice that had a fly in it and they replaced it with a gingerale??

My advice?  Pasta is a no go.  Pizza is solid.  Service leaves something to be desired.  Overall still a place you can stop by with a nice atmosphere.
