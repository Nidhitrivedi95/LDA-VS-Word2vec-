h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ This quickly turned into one of our favorite places and top choice for taking friends or family. We were told about Mezzo by a friend who found it on Groupon so we bought one too and tried it out. Don't judge the place by the address either, it is definitely more upscale than the area! I didn't make it half way through dinner before grabbing my phone and buying another Groupon! The decor is beautiful, cozy, and warm and they have bar seating as well as indoor dining and an outdoor patio. You are never rushed either, we love to sit outside and enjoy some wine and the amazing food! This is a must go!
