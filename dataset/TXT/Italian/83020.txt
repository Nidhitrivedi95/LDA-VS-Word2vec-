DHBDTikebcLpCzF2LF27uA While in Pittsburgh, we decided to try Papa J's. I am still not sure why we did. Anyway, the food was decent. Not great, but it was tasty. Our server was very friendly. It was a little weird because we were the only ones there.  I am not from Pittsburgh, so I am not sure if it was an off night or what.
All in all we left satisfied.
