KT8Lyc7lhL48SXalBSwLfw I came here on a Sunday night after a day of flying. Tired and cold, I just wanted some hot satisfying Italian food. This was closest to my hotel so I gave it a shot. 

The mixed salad was very traditional, and by that I mean iceberg lettuce, hot house tomatoes, oil and vinegar dressing. Meh, but exactly the kind you find all over Italy. 

Next, I had the lasagna. This was quite possibly the best lasagna I've ever had. When I finished, I wanted it all over again. Get the big portion. 

Bar Italia claims to have award winning desserts. They don't lie. I had their champion ice cream, Belgian chocolate and cappuccino. I could make a meal of just desserts. 

I would definitely go back.
