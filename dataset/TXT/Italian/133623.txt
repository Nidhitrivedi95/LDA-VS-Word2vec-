iNhP0ejUf2jVzaR5YCOoEQ I've passed by this restaurant so many times in the past and never had the opportunity to try it. I finally was around the area and decided to come here for dinner.

I got the Fettuccini Alla Napoletana (tiger shrimp, crabmeat and scallions tossed in white wine cream sauce) and the Meat Lovers pizza.

The pasta was incredibly delicious. There were generous amounts of shrimp and crab meat, the pasta was not overdone like most restaurants and the sauce was very creamy.

The pizza was very mediocre. It was done well but it was nothing special.

I would skip the pizza and try their pastas instead.
