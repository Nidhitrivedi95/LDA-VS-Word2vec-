Kykw3ho8wHtLV6gr9qbWTg We are from out of town and rented an airbnb house with 10 people.  We ordered delivery from Picazzo's and everything was amazing!   Truly delicious food - wings, GF focaccia(!), and all the pizzas we had and the zoodle pasta and carbonara were fantastic.  I wish we had this restaurant back at home - it would be our go to for sure.
