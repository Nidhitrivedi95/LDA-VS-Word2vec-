CAALCmefoLQtDvLEER4_6Q To die for! I was hesitant from a few reviews but c'mon... a nice waitress who is simply overwhelmed isn't anything to give a garbage review about. Maybe poor floor coverage, yes but a bad experience, no. Sit down restaurants are not fast food establishments and shouldn't be treated as if they were. Real authentic Italian pizza, an attentive but not overbearing server, great music and a laid back atmosphere. Wonderful establishment. Any place can have an off day. Do not let that in anyway deter you from this place. It's a gem. Quality through and through.
