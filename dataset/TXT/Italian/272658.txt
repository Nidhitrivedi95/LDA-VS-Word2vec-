XvYtp_rwIWdd382zbQ6XjA Went here on Sat afternoon after a team softball practice.  It was decent food and they offered a variety of items.  Out of 7 people, 3 got pizza, 2 got wings, and 2 got salad.  The pizza was decent, nothing to write home about but adaquate.  

The service wasn't bad, but it also wasn't really friendly.  Kinda got the feeling the waitress was annoyed at something else and didn't really want to be there.

It was a bit hot in there and it seemed like they didn't want to turn on the AC for some reason, either that or the AC just isn't strong enough to cool down the whole place.

Prices were about average.

Would I go there again?  If it was with a group and every else wanted to go sure, if i was on my own it wouldn't be my first choice.
