w3PwDEbI0EDx4YI_BkFhIA Good spot, reasonably priced, casual atmosphere with really great food. 

Woody at the bar is the best!! I usually grab a table with a friend, but if you are dining solo don't get take out, I mean I'm sure it's great and everything, but just grab a bar stool and enjoy your meal with some really great company. 
It's like a little local spot with really friendly people a tv and a pretty extensive wine and cocktails selection. 
Woody was great. Super sweet and super attentive. (He's the bartender) I mean he even refilled my cannoli because I left some shell on the plate and it obviously needs filling to be eaten 

I love their linguini with clams, their 
Sorrento Pasta (pomodoro with mozzarella) 
And the Arriabata? I think that's what it's called? It has red sauce and mushrooms

They have great house salads and really really good bread, like really really good. It's made fresh and is always hot and delicious!! 

If you save room for dessert they have the best cannolis and my new friend Deb at the bar said their tiramisu is
