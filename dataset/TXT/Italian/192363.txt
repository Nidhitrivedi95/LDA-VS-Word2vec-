pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ I met friends from out of town for lunch earlier this week.  As always, Nora's did not disappoint!  There were 5 of us and we ordered a large salad that was enough to serve everyone at the table with seconds.  Ands, it was very good!

I ordered one of their menu's "Lunch Favorites."  It was the penne chicken broccoli pasta with garlic and oil.  It was excellent.  One minus--there wasn't enough garlic taste for me.  One of the others at the table ordered a large pizza with pineapple and mushrooms--the pineapple being a first for me.  It was such a pity when there were three pieces of pizza left over and she couldn't take it home with her.  She was winging back to Canada the next morning.  I made the sacrifice and took one for the team.  I brought the three pieces home, had one for dinner, and have the other two frozen for a lunch treat!  Tip to Yelpers---go out to eat with out of town friends the day before they're flying home and you might get some take out for the rest of the week.

I have been a fan of Nora's for several years and I highly recommend the place to anyone looking for good Italian food with a really good atmosphere and great service!
