My buddy & I dropped in at 1am after doing a long gig on the strip one night. Our server was awesome. His name was Joe, I think. He was attentive, & professional, while joking around with us. The drinks were well made, although my chilled house vodka was a bit watered down. My buddy ordered the Pabst Blue Ribbon NA beer. We were laughing about it until we tasted it. It was probably one of the best non alcoholic beers I've ever tasted! The filet mignon was nice. My buddy had the NY. Both steaks were cooked properly, & had a ton of flavor. We also had corn, & mushrooms. Both were good. I would never pay full price for a meal here, but the 50% discount makes it worth a trip
