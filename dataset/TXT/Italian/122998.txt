HhPVzZYQI-akaXRK_A4dKQ IheartPGH and friend of IheartPGH stopped in for dinner.  Monday night is buffet night!  $8 gets you soup, salad, iced tea, coffee, Italian buffet with pasta, meatballs, sausage, chicken, vegetable AND dessert.  
Del's is a great local restaurant and was pretty busy for a Monday night - not packed but busy enough to make you forget it was a Monday.  This is a family establishment, the food is decent and it is worth a trip for dinner.
