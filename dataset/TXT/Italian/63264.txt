B7G_2Hx8Rx8l6oQ6K3n5Uw Love the gluten free pizza crust. its delicious. the salads are decent too but the chicken is kind of like a canned chicken in texture. Sometimes when I need a box for leftovers it's hard to find someone to bring one because there's no assigned waitstaff for each table. You order the food up front then sit down with a number and the food is delivered. They ask for a tip when you pay for your food but that's before the food is delivered. I'm not a fan of tipping before I receive any services. My 4 year old is obsessed with this place and I think its more because of the atmosphere/ambiance than the food. We go here at least once every couple of weeks and have yet to really be disappointed in the food.
