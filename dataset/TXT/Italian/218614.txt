s2hzc_rFWYY9_-4TfrFGng Tried going to Bowl of Pho on a Tuesday & it was closed, so we opted for this place.  When we went, it was over half-way full- by the way, this place is teeny tiny!  The booths they have must be for kids or for way back in the 40's when everyone was tiny! Next to the tiny booths are normal chairs & a table.  This place could really use a make over!  Seemed like an older couple running the place.

I ordered a calzone & thought it was very good!  It took some time, but I thught it was worth it.  You can get wine to go, but I didn't notice what types/lables.  My co workers ordered spaghetti & meatballs & veal parm sandwich.  I tasted some of the veal & I thought it was really good!  Portions are great!

Very limited seating and while we were there, the pizza delivery guy was in & out- I would say they have a good carry out business.

Since there are so many other places to eat in the area, I probably won't go back, but I did like my meal.  Curious to read future reviews...
