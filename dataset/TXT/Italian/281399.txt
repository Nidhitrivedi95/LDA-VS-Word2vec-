YSUcHqlKMPHHJ_cTrqtNrA Came here for summerlicious on Friday after work. 
It was quite empty at 5:30pm on a Friday but by the time we were done the patio was full. I had the calamari, chicken and tiramisu. The portions were very generous, and the chicken was cooked very nicely. Bread is only given out on an ask basis for summerlicious diners.
Not a bad deal for a financial district restaurant.
