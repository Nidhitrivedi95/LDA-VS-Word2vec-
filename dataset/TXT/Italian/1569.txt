-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q A friend of mine has been recommending this place for some time. She is a big fan and is trying to  slowly sample everything on the menu. 

So today we decide to give it a try. Now I just wish it was a wee bit closer to our house.  You  walk in off Glendale Ave. and it's very comfortably decorated  with a clean Italian style. It reminded me of Pizza A Metro with more room , and decor.  There is a large brick oven in the front  that gives it an authentic flavor. All the servers were very nice and treated us like we have been going there forever. We ordered a  cheese pizza for my daughter and a "Italian stallion " pizza for us.  The crust was very nice chewy , with a light oven char that I really liked , a bit of tomato sauce , cheese and very different Italian sausage. Very tasty. 

My daughter loved her pizza , she was thrilled , I was afraid it would be too upscale for her. But she was so enamored she about bit my husband hand off when he reached for a piece. 

We are  anxious to try some of  the  other items , they brought a basil and cheese pizza by our table that smelled heavenly. we also saw some great pasta dishes at other tables.
