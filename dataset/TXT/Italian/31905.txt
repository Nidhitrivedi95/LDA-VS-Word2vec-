5SEwzlWlrxSVyZx3IgXwLg I met Aileen b. at Marcella's for HH on Thursday evening.  I will start with the positives:  We sat in the patio which was cute. There was heater lamps to keep the area warm and cozy.   The HH  specials are half priced pizzas and half off any wine on the menu.  I went with the roasted chicken pizza, and it was topped with Gorgonzola, Parmesan Onions, Apricots and Aileen went with the four cheese pizza.  The pizza came out piping hot and was tasty.  I also enjoyed my cup of white wine. They do not serve wine in a wine glass, they serve in a cup.. I thought that was odd.

Now the Negatives:  we were served table bread and I grabbed one of the little serving plates on the table and took a bite and placed my bread down on the plate.  Aileen was admiring how cute the plate I grabbed and she started to look through all the serving plates to find one like mine. Each of the plates were unique. Then she noticed they were all filthy!  Of course I did not finish my bread and we both thought it was disgusting.  The manager was very apologetic and replaced with clean plates right away. It sort of turned me off to my experience at Marcella's, so for that reason I was only able to give them an overall rating of 3 stars .... 2.5 for service, 0 stars for cleanliness, 4.0 for fresh and tasty food, 4.0 for the HH prices. 
They easily would have been a four stars without the negative experience.
