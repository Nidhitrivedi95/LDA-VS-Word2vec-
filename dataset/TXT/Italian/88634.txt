e_BiI4ej1CW1F0EyVLr-FQ Sorry to do this folks, although I enjoyed the atmosphere, I can't say I enjoyed my main dish and hence the two stars. I order lamb.  I asked for medium rare and I got cold well done.  My mash potatoes were cold and hard, not smooth and silky at all. The whole freaking plate was cold. I told the waiter and he did nothing about it. Had it not been that I was hungry, I would have not eaten it. 

The soup was fine and had a good flavor, but again clearly sitting on the servers area too long as it too wasn't hot as it should have been. The Cheese and tomatoes were great!

The martini's were fabulous. The service was just okay. They need to adopt a tag team style of service instead of one guy serving us all the time and frankly not taking care of us as we should be when one spend $160. 

But I do like the decors, seating, etc. I may give it another try.
