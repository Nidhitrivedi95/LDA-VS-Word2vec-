There is more to a restaurant than just great food. There is location, parking, service, price and finally the wait! The insufferable wait! Pizzeria Bianco offers no reservations! You think the wait at Olive Garden on the prom night is bad? You ain't seen nothing yet! The wait can be longer than Jaden Smith receiving an Oscar nomination from the Academy. The pizza is delicious but you are going to wait, and wait, and wait, and wait. Don't look for support or the hook up from the hostess, she has got a thousand sheep right behind you waiting to be fed. If you leave in disgust or frustration, an eyelash will not be batted and one tear will not be shed. So if you have plans for dinner at Pizzeria Bianco get in line before the doors are even open, because chances are while you are thinking about dining, a line has already begun to form.
