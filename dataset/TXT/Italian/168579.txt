MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg This is just one of a handfull of places I'm willing to drive from Green Valley to go to downtown.  I'll start out by saying that the environment of the restaurant is decidedly homey and quaint...it's basically a small old house that has been repurposed.

What Chicago Joe's lacks in style and location is more than made up for by the food...plus, that why you eat out, right?  I've been going there for about six years now and have never had a meal that was less than stellar!  My personal favorite is the "Shimp Joe" on anglehair.  My wife loves the lasagna and we've both tried and like several of their other dishes.  The freshly baked bread and house salad dressing really push the experience over the top.

Personally I love the ambiance of the place.  More than once we've sat next to a "vegas celebrity" and at any given time you're likely to see a Bentley/Rolls/Limo in the parking lot.  Chicago Joe's, you might say, is kind of in line with the Tiffany Diner (inside White Cross)...kind of an institution with old timers.

At any rate, if you want the best Italian food that I'm aware of in the Vegas valley, you should certainly check it out!
