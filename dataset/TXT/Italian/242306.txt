umxki_So2--o08q9bkXK6Q Came here on Sunday for leisurely lunch to meet up with friends, we all enjoyed good lunch here.

I've been to their Sedona location and they are my regular night before the race eatery, I was excited about trying this Scottsdale location. 

Their lunch special is really a great deal, served with a choice of salad, just right portion size for lunch. I tried their lasagna, it wasn't the best but still good. I had much more flavorful pasta dish at dinner time from their Sedona location, not sure why but what I had for lunch didn't have that great flavor I was hoping.

Don't forget to check in on Yelp for free desert, tiramisu. Pretty good size, we ordered two deserts and shared by four people, felt like it was just right amount to share.

Patio seat was perfect on a Sunny afternoon, nicely shaded, when it wasn't that hot outside, pleasant to dine outside.
