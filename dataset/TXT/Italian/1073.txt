-CLTZ0cO-ooKDDmXHFoGMg Came here the other day to grab a quick lunch with a friend. We both got the margherita pizza, their standard with basil, tomato sauce and mozzarella. I definitely like the vibe of this place, staff were friendly and efficient. Everything is freshly made and you watch them as they p bake your pizza in an oven.

My pizza was a bit burnt, but otherwise very tasty! I liked the texture of the dough and the thinness of the main part of the pizza, while the crust was fluffy and airy! 
Definitely plan to come back when I have a pizza craving. Roughly $12 for a personal sized pizza and a drink.
