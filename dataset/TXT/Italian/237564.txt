u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg My sister and I went in for some food because the pictures we found on yelp looked so tasty! I didn't realize it was more of a wine bar until we got there but was definitely happy to be there, I was totally feeling the vibe. It's very cute and trendy, great music, good staff. It's a great place for any occasion really... My sister and I ordered the bruschetta and split a panini and the food was most definitely AMAZING in every sense of the word. The  burst of flavors was exactly what I was looking for and totally hit the spot! If I had not had to be up at the crack of dawn the next morning I would have definitely split a bottle of wine with sis but we didn't have much time and were just wanting a bite to eat. I will be back for that wine though, I think my sis and I found our new favorite neighborhood place! I'm so glad we stopped by, I seriously can't wait to go back again.
