2I7QtHJI-izdThjghMaT1g Just left, came in at 8:30pm and all the cooks were eyeballing me even though they closed @ 10pm.

The guy in charge of bread didn't even bother cooking my bread until the waitress asked twice and my entree was coming out. All my food was RUSHED out of the kitchen, so some of it was either cooked ok or burnt. Their Signature Lobster Ravioli was rushed so fast my scallops and shrimp were "cooked" raw and the pasta for the ravioli was chewy.

The only reason why i give this place "2 Stars" is because my waitress was absolutely nice as could be.

I presume the head chef was there as he walked around to shut the store down.

The people in the kitchen could have cared less about how they cooked for their consumers and were mm ore worried about cleaning up and closing.
