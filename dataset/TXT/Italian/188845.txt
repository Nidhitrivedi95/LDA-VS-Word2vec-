OXrFWgoz533T8tMRemkiww My girlfriend and I were searching for the perfect place for dinner and drinks in the Mt Lebanon/Bridgeville area, and this restaurant immediately came to mind! Even on a Friday afternoon, we were still able to snag an 8:30 dinner reservation that evening for two. I was so excited to return after having such a nice lunch with my sister in law several months ago.

As it was a hectic Friday evening, service was initially a little slow. It took the hostess 5-10 minutes to seat us at our table, and our waitress was also MIA for a while when we were ready to order wine. However, I quickly forgave the minor delays when I took my waitress up on her dinner recommendation. We started with the Arancini, but really, you can't go wrong with fried rice balls. I did enjoy that there were two varieties that we were both able to try. I had planned to order the Cavatelli Rapini, but my waitress so passionately recommended the Cappelletti that I had to go with her recommendation. Wow, I am so happy that I did. The pasta had a beautiful smooth texture and fresh flavor while the mortadella, prosciutto, pork, and parmigiano-reggiano filling was hearty and robust and just simply divine. This tasty homemade concoction was topped with a rich and decadent tomato sauce. 

I wished that I had room for more because the heavenly lemon dessert that I shared last time was amazing. However, I was just too full and will have to return yet again to try more on the menu.
