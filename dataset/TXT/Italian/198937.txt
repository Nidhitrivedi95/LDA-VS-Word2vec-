It's in an area which is desolate at night except for this pizzeria.  We had a 1.5 hour wait so the hostess recommended us getting a drink at the bar next door.

There were 4 in our party so we ended up ordering the Margherita, Wiseguy, Rosa and Biancaverde.  The only pizza that we all felt wasn't that great was the Rosa.  It had a few cheeses on top plus AZ pistachios.  It just wasn't flavorful and was quite dry.  The wine paired with the pizzas was great.  

Service was exceptional!  

I wouldn't say that this place is the best pizzeria in the US but probably best in AZ.  Check it out if in area but be prepared to wait.
