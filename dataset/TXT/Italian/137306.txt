J4tO07oCDhwP3rdcgjjdxg This place is Amazing!!! Chicken Parm sandwich is Ridiculously Good! words can't describe how delicious this sandwich was! We also enjoyed pizza and salad as well, the only thing We are disappointed it's about dessert, we got the tiramisu and is not worth the price, We were expecting a delicious dessert for that money. Our server was nice and polite so We'll definitely recommend this place and we'll come back for sure.
