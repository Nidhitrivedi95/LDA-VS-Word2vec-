srIy6x9Z_6hEHuGPE6L0dw I wanted to give them another star but couldn't because they are missing an Italian staple - no garlic rolls or garlic knots or garlic bread.  The service was average to bad.  The food was pretty good we had a mushroom appetizer that was really good.  We got a linguini for dinner that was pretty good ended with a desert (chocolate lava cake) that was good.  I just can't justify more stars when they are missing the garlic rolls.
