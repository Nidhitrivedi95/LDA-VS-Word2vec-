uLdJrH2rJwULKLopi0XH4Q Fantastic family run hole-in-the-wall place. As others have noted not a fancy place but the food is excellent. 

I had the italian wedding soup and the pollo dello chef, which was served with ziti. So so good. My mother had the veal cicialno. Equally good. Chicken was flavorful and well cooked. The cheesy sauce was addictive and delectable. The pasta was al dente, and didn't taste like watery junk. I kind of enjoyed that we could watch the activity in a main part of the kitchen from our seats.  

Far less expensive and a far better dinner than most mid-level not quite fancy italian restaurants.
