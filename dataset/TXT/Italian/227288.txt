SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ in this trip to Vegas, first night we went to this restaurant based our previous experience of years ago, when this place was rocking and was incredibly busy. We order the specials which has to be the best of the night. But surprisingly the specials were without any taste, cold and not worthy of 36.00 dollars charged, we all sent the food back to reheat and very unhappy with quality of the steak as well of the quantity of the dinner, even the waiter who by the way was a great guy and very accommodating didn't hide his disappointment from the food... we end up paying outrageous money for a bad and taste free food, nothing was Italian in that place that night. I will never go back.
