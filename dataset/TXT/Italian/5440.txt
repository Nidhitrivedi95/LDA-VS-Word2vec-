_qA2HPqgLiBc-M4wRyml0g We had dinner there tonight and it was delicious! We had the house bread which is cooked in the wood ovens. Then I had the small serving of the Pasta Pomodoro and my sweetie had the small Spaghetti and Meatballs. The smaller servings are the absolute perfect size for a dinner that does not leave you stuffed.
