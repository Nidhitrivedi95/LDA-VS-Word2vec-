qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg My husband has a palette for Greek and Italian food and he LOVED it here! He's excited to come back and try more. We had the lunch special gyro with Greek fries and mine had a Greek salad. Both awesome. Our 14 y/o had pasta Angelo with shrimp and couldn't stop saying how good it was. I wish we had more time for dessert as I'm a fan of baklava, but I KNOW we will be back. Our server, Frances, was super sweet and very helpful with the menu and to top it all off, she relayed to the manager that it was our first time here and he personally came over to talk to us and invite us back...wait for it...WITH A 15% OFF CARD! Very impressed with the friendly service here. Thanks, Sean (Shawn?) and Frances!!
