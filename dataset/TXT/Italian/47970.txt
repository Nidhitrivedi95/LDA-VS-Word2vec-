90DT5MO2X-C2F_5c66DNag We decided to go to Piccolina's for our 10th anniversary dinner, because in years past we had really good food here., plus it was convenient to our home. Well, what a big disappointment. The one star was for the scallop appetizer, which was delicious. Also, our waitress was very good. It wasn't her fault the food was horrible. The salads came, which they should have been embarrassed to serve. Basically the lettuce was not fresh , one grape tomatoes split in half, one olive and one pepper. I could have opened a bag of salad at home, which would have been better. 
I had the limoncello shrimp with risotto, which was so sweet, I should have dipped it in my water. I couldn't even finish it. Believe me, if I don't clean my plate you know it's bad. 
My husband had the spots with crab, which is one of our favorites. But this dish was unseasoned and flavorless. Not sure if Piccolinas got a new chef, they really need to reevaluate what they are serving. Yuk!
