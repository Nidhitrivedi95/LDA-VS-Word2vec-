-PUPEpMsjBjk_rX5lFaWng Nice little wine bar.  I enjoyed a flight of whites and one of their specialty salads for lunch.  Pretty tasty.  The food won't win any culinary rewards, but it is good and the ingredients seem fresh. Minor niggle, they only seem to have high-top seating... when all I want to do is curl up in a booth and drink myself silly, this can be a problem.
