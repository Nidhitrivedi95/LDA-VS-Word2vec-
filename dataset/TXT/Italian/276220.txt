yE0f7SPDqafcaE1D8WsmDQ I really wanted to enjoy Goodfellas as I was a regular in streets Ville where originally opened.
Unfortunately there's no WOW factor here, As you're walking in and being greeted by a bunch of students that seems to be a organize of confusion. Food is OKKK bones in the fish and calamari was chewy, when I asked for some tomato sauce to put on the calamari they wanted to bill me $3 on a $19 dish - REALLY!!!  They just opened up like any business it takes time to organize the kinks out of any new restaurant or business. I hope they figure it out soon Etobicoke was not a very forgiving place. They got a beef up their portions also for the prices they're charging, And maybe offer some bread and olive oil to the tables would've been a nice touch.
