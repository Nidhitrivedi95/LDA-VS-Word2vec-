tKi4OvAlckcVzeP92InsOQ I will be reviewing the theater specifically. The movie ticket prices are less expensive than harkins or AMC for example, and you can reserve your seats online prior to going to the movie, so that's pretty cool! Also, the seats are very comfortable reclining leather, with plenty of space between yourself and the rows ahead and behind you. What I didn't like about the theater was that the popcorn tasted stale and old, not hot, and the lady handed it to me in a bag that was all crumpled up at the bottom. I got myself a Coke from the soda fountain and once I was seated took a sip and realised it was flat. They must have not replaced the carbonation. And the screen and volume weren't as large and loud as a regular theater.
