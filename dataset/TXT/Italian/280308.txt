Yo8ODT7aFMM2xKUd1yaBVw Unfortunately, our third time at Bella Vita was not as good in service or quality of food as our first two times. Our bartender was not very skilled in making cocktails and gave me a drink I didnt actually order. The antipasto misto was still good. Also had the caesar salad which was pretty good. The Panna cotta though..  So disappointing. It was nothing like our first experience with it. This time is came on a plate and it was a layer of a weird raspberry gelatin, Panna cotta and then a raspberry glaze. It all tasted so fake and weird. The raspberry gelatin was not good at all. 

Overall, it feels like the first time we went, Bella Vita was new and they were trying really hard to have great service, food and presentation. But, now its almost like they've realized they'll get steady traffic even without trying hard. It's all fine but nothing like I experienced before.
