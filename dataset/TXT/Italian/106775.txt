fuBpjG-lsD94_BdpjHxbuQ We dined at Lo Zingaro in November. This place has bar far one of the BEST PIZZAS in the city. The chef takes great pride in his pizza dough and came out to discuss the intricacies of making the right dough depending on the climate and humidity. He was very gracious and knowledgeable. I had a Margherita pizza which was perfectly done. My friends were swooning over the Maple truffle pork ribs - but as a veg I didn't try them.  I can't recommend this place enough.
