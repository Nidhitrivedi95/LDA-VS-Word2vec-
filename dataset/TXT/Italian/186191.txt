oP0eUhf44jU71-I8DwKU5A I was there last night for the first and last time. As we sat there for 15 minutes waiting for the server to approach the table, I thought that the dining room closely resembled one of those places that Gordon Ramsay comes in to save. How I wish he had. 

All the fried items on the sampler platter ($18.95) tasted of fish. The Italian hoagie ($13.45) was served on bread that was hard and stale. The fish sandwich ($13.45) was dry as an old man's bones, as was the bun. We didn't even eat half our food, and no, we didn't ask for boxes. 

I did have a chance to visit the restroom after dinner, and as I was washing my hands an employee (don't know if he was from the kitchen or bar) came in, did his business and left without bothering to wash his hands. 

The interior of the place has possibilities, with an attractive stone fireplace at one end. Unfortunately, the room has been junked up with unattractive Waffle House-style tables and chairs, two huge muted televisions, and bright, very bright, lighting. I can't comment on the "lounge," since I didn't stop in that part. 

I have a hard time believing this place has any relation to What's Cookin' At Casey's, which I used to love to go to when I lived in that area.
