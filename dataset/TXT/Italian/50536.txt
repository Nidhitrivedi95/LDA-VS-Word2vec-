9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Absolutely DELICIOUS. Aside from food though, the decor inside was cozy and beautiful. Very cute and warm, lit up for holidays. I came here with a large party. The service was great. We got appetizer boards and bottles of wine to start. I was never without a full glass. Now, I am from NY, and I loved my personal pizza I got here. The best pizza I've tried since being in AZ thus far. I got the basil pesto pie with roasted potatoes and mozzarella cheese, ate every last bite. Then I had the Nutella dessert. I wish I had photos to show. I will definitely be coming back, I already told my boyfriend it seems like the perfect date night spot.
