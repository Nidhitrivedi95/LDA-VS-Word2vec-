gLJravrwk28C2WXExAh5iw My order of delivery comes from this pizza hut, and I have been always satisfied with service and quality. Pizzas arrive somewhat quick, and they are cooked nicely -ie not burned. They are always delicious (I love stuffed crust! Hell with diet!) But the amount they charge for delivery is crazy. You can get the same pizza at half price if you pick it up yourself.
