H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g The nectarine salad with pine nuts was very interesting, enjoyable. Arugala salad with freshly shaved parmesan was nice, too. I didn't care for the squash blossoms only because it had mint. But it seemed high quality so if you don't mind mint on your food, this is a unique appetizer.
hmmmmm, the corn pizza is delicious. Very unique flavor.
The quattro formaggio is very good, too. They were nice enough to substitute the ricotta with fontina.
The margherita is tasty. Fresh basil. Perfectly balanced cheese and sauce.
I'm not sure that I'd come back only because I like to try different pizzas. But this place serves nice, fresh, light pizza.
