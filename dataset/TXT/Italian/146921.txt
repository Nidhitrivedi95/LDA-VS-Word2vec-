k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw If you ever go to Vegas, this place should be on your list of places to dine. I've been here every time I visit Vegas and I've never been disappointed. My brother's wedding reception was also here and they still had stellar service. They are just south of the airport on Las Vegas Blvd, maybe 10 minutes from the strip if you hit traffic.

You sit down and before the second butt-cheek hits the chair, your bread is on the table. Very soon after that your water. I've had several different entrees there and every single one of them have been great! I love their breakfasts too.... especially at 2pm. LOL Their service is exceptional. Their food is always wonderful and I've managed to hook my family on this place too.

I was particularly impressed when they hosted my brother's wedding reception. Even though there was a selection of pre-determined items to choose from, because I'm vegetarian and not a fan of alfredo (thanks to my meat eating brother, this was the only veggie meal in his selection), they had no problem offering me something else and offering it to other people as a selection as well. I loved this. The only complaint I had, as my brother's photographer, was that the lighting was so dim, the pictures were hard to take.

The only thing I haven't had here is dessert. I'm going to have to change that.
