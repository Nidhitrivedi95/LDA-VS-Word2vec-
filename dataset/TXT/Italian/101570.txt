FdiZDOs8LbSnBpA_e5R5HQ It is hard to describe how horrible the pizza is here. Let me try:  overpriced($12 for a 10 inch thin crust pizza-really), greasy, lack of toppings, strange tasting, but mostly overpriced. A 10 inch pizza, that is essentially a personal sized pizza for $12 is outrageous. Many of the reviews rave that their pizza is real East Coast pizza. Sorry, it is not even close, but then Arizonans don't know what real pizza is. Save your time and money and get a frozen pizza for $6 at the grocery store.   You'll enjoy it more and keep some of your money.
