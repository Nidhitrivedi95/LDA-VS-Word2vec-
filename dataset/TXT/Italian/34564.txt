6frPvwX14wDH8jju64ewRg I generally avoid this strip of restaurants on King West, as I find them usually overpriced and surviving solely because of tourists and theatre-goers. But I decided to give Paese a try during the Telus Taste of Tuesday promotion and had a lovely dinner with a good friend. 

The place is modern and elegant. I really liked the square tables at the back and made a mental note to remember this place the next time I am planning something with a big group. Square (or round) tables make so much more sense for groups, as everyone can see and talk to each other. With those long rectangular ones, you end up just talking to the people in your immediate vicinity. Anyways...

We had:
- Waiter brought some baguette and carrot (and something else?) spread to the table. 

- Pear and gorgonzola salad - nice, classic
- Meatballs - they were HUGE. This was a bit of a mistake because I was full before the main course! Delicious blend of flavours -- I could really taste the pecorino. 

- Lamb striploin - came with a nice chickpea mash. 
- Arctic char - with pistachio, carrot, lemon ferro. A light, simple dish. 

- Pistachio and brown butter cake - we both found this a tad dry
- Affogato - the winner of the evening! A dish of chestnut gelato (just divine!), served with a tiny cup of espresso that you pour over the gelato yourself. I've never had anything like it and it was a wonderful contrast. It comes with a huge cherry and dark chocolate chip cookie that was warm and soft, as all cookies should be. But it was so big, I took it home. 

I had a glass on the pinot grigio and our server brought over the sommelier to help my friend choose something to go with her lamb (Chianti). Apparently, this is a great place to go if you really know wine, but I don't. 

We stayed for ~4 hours and nobody rushed us out, which was nice (if it was really busy though, we would've given up our table out of courtesy). They only brought the bill when we asked for it. 

I will probably be back to try the pasta and to get the affogato again!

*P.S. someone should tell them to change this pic on the website (http://paeseristorante.com/team). It looks like a mafia pic:S
