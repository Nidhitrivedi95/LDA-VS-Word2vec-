1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag Breakfast service on the patio is poor at best. Had to wait 10 minutes for server to greet us. Then she forgot water. Had to ask her 3 times. Food was ok. After waiting for server to pick up our bill. We had to go inside to pay. Also, server did not understand what we said in English.
