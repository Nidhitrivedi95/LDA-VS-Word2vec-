qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA I thought the food was good, but not especially noteworthy - tough competition in Vegas. The carbonara was authentic (no cream) but isn't the best I've had. The balsamic and olive oils left tableside are high quality. And the antipasto platter is huge; even a half order would feed four people! 

But the entire experience was marred by awful service that felt like being at an Applebee's and having a waiter-in-training. When we sat down, the menu had barely been presented when we were asked if we wanted to order - he totally misread us and thought we wanted a fast service instead of a relaxing meal (or else he just wanted the table turnover). I am able to look past that, we took our time, ordered, and when the antipasto platter came out, they had substituted a hard cheese for the fresh mozzarella which was disappointing.  When my waiter finally reappeared I asked him about it, and he said "well it should", shrugged, and walked away - no offer to fix it or even query the kitchen for an explanation. He also never offered a refill of the raved-about garlic knots - I didn't particularly need them given the size of the platter, but an offer would have been nice and appropriate.  He also brought our entrees prior to the appetizer platter being finished - poor timing by either himself or the kitchen, again expecting fast turnover instead of a relaxing meal. Definitely the opposite of "authentic Italian"!

Finally, older reviews talk about a hard to find quiet spot, but the current location is in the food court so there is a lot of foot traffic walking by. In conclusion, even though the food is good (three-star), there are many good Italian places in Las Vegas to dine at, so I can't recommend Trattoria Reggiano.
