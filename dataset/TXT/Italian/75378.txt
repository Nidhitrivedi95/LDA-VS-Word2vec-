CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA After finding a coupon for Venzia's and hearing great things we decided to get takeout a Friday night. We ordered over the phone a large pizza and wings. When we went into the restaurant to pickup our food the cashier said that she could not find it in the system. She apologized and told us she would grab the manager. The manager came over apologized and put our order back in. He also gave us a discount and still honored our coupon. I was so impressed how this situation was handled. Both the manager and cashier were so great. I work in the restaurant business and understand mistakes happen. I felt this situation was handled perfectly! When we got back home we ate the pizza and loved it! I was impressed at the service and food at Venezia's. We will be back and have recommended it to other friends!
