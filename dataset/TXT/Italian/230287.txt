Tdc2v9DBRRYeG2P_h9OvRw We have ordered pizza from here 3 times now (I see your 3 strikes and you're out comment Jen H - funny!) and each time it has gotten WORSE!
The last pie (Hawiian) was just last week and it arrived SOGGY all over the bottom! Could not eat it without first trying to crisp it up in oven (failed to work).

I called and the owner answered. FIRST he told me the Hawiian Pizza is ALWAYS like that! OKAAAYYY....  I disputed that and he then said all the ingredients were fresh - I should hope so! THEN he said "what do you want, a credit? Next time you call,  remind me". 

I was not feeling well that night or I would have likely fought harder on this issue, possibly even had the driver return, take back the soggy pie and give me my money back! 

AVOID this place! Lousy pie, lousier customer service!
