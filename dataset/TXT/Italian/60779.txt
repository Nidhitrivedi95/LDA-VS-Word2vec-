AWJhMTYsIYzCIYAIUA-waA Oh my- if you want a real deal, come here Thursday night. An oversized bottle of house red for $16- and you can take what you don't finish. Large $5 pizza, offer cocktails on sale and beer for HH. Also a skinny menu- my friend highly recommends the grilled chicken with angel hair pasta option. And she's really skinny! Yolo
