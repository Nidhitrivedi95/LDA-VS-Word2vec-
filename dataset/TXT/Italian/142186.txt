jOseCpGmgbQWEfX2Wn_TGQ Food was amazing and so was service. We came here for new years eve from out of town and we were a little worried as we drove through the sketchy neighborhood and saw cash and go, etc. It's kind of in the middle of all of this. When you walk in it's a little funky with almost mirrored ceilings and the lighting is too bright. But the food was fantastic. We had chicken parm, scampi, caprese, cheesecake and tiramisu. Service was slow but intentional to let us enjoy the meal - reminded us if really being in Italy.
