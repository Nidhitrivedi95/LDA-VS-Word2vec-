5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Jim Noble, the owner of roosters is a known anti LGBT leader. He has fought for discrimination in this state. And has used God to back up his hate and bigotry. I love God and a praise him, and I Ask God to expose these false representation of God. And I refuse and hope others will as well, to give any money to any establishment that Jim Noble has anything to do with.
