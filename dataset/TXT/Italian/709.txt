-7PX_FOoCwktlunImRyZdg Friends, Romans, Yinzers...lend me your ears. There's some fine wood-fired pizza pie to be had in "S'Liberty." Choose from an eclectic mix of Red and White pizzas. The crust is characteristically Neopolitan though the center didn't quite hold up its end of the bargain. Order your own and be selfish or order a couple different types to share amongst your company. Oh and it's BYOB...bonus. It's no Fiori's, but it's in a class of its own and Caesar would be damn proud.
