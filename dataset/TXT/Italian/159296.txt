LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA I hate to have to give a below 4-star review when the service is extraordinary.
Our waiter, Kevin I believe (Im sorry if I get the name wrong but he's tall and talks quite fast), was super attentive and helpful.
However, the food wasn't very impressive. The lobster carbonara was quite bland and very liquid-y. My friend said her gnocchi was quite flour-y. 
Considering the great ambiance, the great service, and the great reviews this place's got, I expected more from the food.
