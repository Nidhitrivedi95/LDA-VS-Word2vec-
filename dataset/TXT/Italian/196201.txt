PmwKGY3HLpcnC_-g0NCIvQ I've brought my family from out of town here and it never failed to impress. The overall layout is very eye catching once inside and the staff is always attentive and friendly. I've ordered everything from the calzones, to the pasta, to the gyros and all have tasted amazing. Also had a sangria and it was made just the way I like it (not too sweet).
