x1IPOlH_O5D3qZdZo6YyEA With the exception of the waitress (who was friendly and very nice), our experience here was terrible.

The bread was both warm and stale (how they managed to do that I don't know), and an Italian restaurant needs to have great bread.

The pizza I ordered (margherita) was decent: good cheese, but stale crust. 

The place was too warm (they supposedly have AC, but it didn't seem to be working), and the acoustics are awful (my ears are hurting because the party three tables away from us had very loud people).

I def won't be back, which is a bummer since I live close to it.
