OThAF-lt6d7jY-pB1ajWPg Awesome food. It's a tiny place and I've only ordered "to go" but I've tried their calzone, chicken parm, chicken marsala, and lamb marsala. I recommend the chicken parm and chicken marsala! For personal taste I preferred the chicken marsala over the lamb even though I usually enjoy lamb. The calzone is good but I have other favorite pizza places. I just really like their Italian entree meals!
