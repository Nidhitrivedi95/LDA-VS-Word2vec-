aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw I can't believe the number of idiotic reviews on here from people who don't eat or like seafood or who complain about the price of a restaurant in a 5 star hotel. I'm a foodie with money. I eat out 4 plus nights a week. Been to every single restaurant in Vegas multiple times. Bartolotta is a world class experience. Sit outside. $150 a head minimum. Worth every penny. Get the Top Chef menu. Throw in a couple of extra for the table to share like the rabbit in pancetta, pate with white truffles. Sit back. smile like a mad man. The dinner will take three hours. Only the risotto di mare was a disappointment. That's okay when there are 7-8 WOWS! Octopus salad, spiny lobster, pasta with scorpion fish, etc. One of the top 5 meals (for the price) I have had anywhere and I have eaten most everywhere. 4.5 stars. Going back again this week and next. Can't say the same about Picasso, Valentino, Guy Savoy or Atelier Robuchon which are the same price. $300 a head for food/wine tax/tip. Doesn't have to be that pricey. Did a table for 4 with more food than any of us could eat, couple of glasses of wine and a drink for $650 with tip. We were stuffed to the gills...
