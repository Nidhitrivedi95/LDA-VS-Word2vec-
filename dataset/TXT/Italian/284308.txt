A.L. and I are big fans of Groupon because as consumers it is a great way to learn about restaurants and new places, and it allows businesses to market themselves to a new demographic. 

I had the chicken carbonara and a glass of Pinot. They were both good, but as A.L. mentioned when it came time to pay the bill, the owner gave us grief about using the card because "the fees cost too much." First of all, typical card fees are about .45 cents and 2-3%, so the fees for this charge were at most one dollar. What she was really upset about was not the paying with a card, but that we didn't spend substantially more than the $40 Groupon, and in her mind she wasn't able to recoup the $20 Groupon credit. That is why when we told her to run the bill for more the $5 she continued to tell us she was losing money. Although we were affronted by her comments, we just wanted to make her happy, pay our bill, and leave a tip. Despite what Old-Man-River-Roland says about cash the point is that the Groupon is meant for her to market her business, provide superior service, and hope for repeat customers. That is when they make their money! 

I'm sure others have had fine dining experiences and it is very possible that the owners learned from their terrible mistake and have since changed their expectations for Groupon customers. You do not call out a first-time customer for paying with cash. EVER. I don't care how much the bill is or is not. No business should make a customer guilty for not having the $15 needed to pay the bill.
