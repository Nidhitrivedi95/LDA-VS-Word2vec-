JH3zKlfslbSVeA_KsAaRRQ Went here for our anniversary dinner.  I've been to the "old" Splendido a few times previously, and always enjoyed it.

Our visit this time was flawless.  There's not much else I can say that hasn't already been said in the many glowing reviews.  Well maybe one thing:  Be careful when ordering the fois gras parfait appetizer.  You'll dream about it weeks later and wake up gnawing on your own arm.
