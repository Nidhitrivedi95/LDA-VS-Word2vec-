ddlnpDxGDDxGGoG_dVXwiw I'm not sure if the food I got was worth the price I paid but for about $45 I had a salad with apples, marcona almonds, dolce gorgonzola, thyme, sherry vinaigrette and then the bavette steak with balsamic braised onions, kohlrabi and yukon gold au gratin, and roasted brussels sprouts. I also ordered a beverage that included some combo of alcohol and loganberry soda which was good. The food was better than most but still not fantastic. The onions were too balsamicy and overpowered the flavors of everything else. My salad was great though. The apples were legit quarters instead of thiny shaven pieces of apple. The food was good and I would probably go back to try some other things but the price really just has me hung up. I meal for a date night would easily blow past the $100 mark and I don't think their food is worth it. I'd have to try some other things to convince me otherwise.
