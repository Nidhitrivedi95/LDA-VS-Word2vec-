_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw Went here because of a referral about a week ago. Owner greeted us and server took our order. Sat here for about 30 minutes and the whole time the owner was smiling at us and assuring us our food was almost done. About another 10 minutes go by with no food and my husband and I decided to leave. Approached the owner and she said "Have a great night" knowing that we haven't even had our dinner. Told her about the wait and she insisted on boxing up our food for us at no charge, the problem was, our food wasn't even prepared yet to go into the oven. HORRIBLE!!! Won't be going back!
