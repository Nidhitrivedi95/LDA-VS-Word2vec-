If I had known it would be double the amount of time to be seated than they told us, the food would be blah but expensive, and the service to be just okay, I never would have gone.

For starters, we had a party of 3. We checked in with the hostess to put our name on the list and were told it would be 30 minutes or less. I received a No Wait text confirmation on my phone and was told I would be texted when our table was available. It was cold out but we walked around and came back after 30 minutes. We ended up not getting seated for an hour and waited outside in the cold, the staff didn't seem concerned/apologetic for the inconvenience once they seated us. 

The food was decent, but definitely NOT worth the price value. I got a the pesto white pizza which was $14 and the meatball appetizers for $9, both of which were just okay and definitely not worth the price. The pizza was wood fired but stretchy and bland, and the meatballs were hard and lacked flavor. 

The service was a bit strange. It was a very cold night out and they left the door to the restaurant wide open....throughout our meal several customers were clearly cold and got up during their meal to close the door and the hostess didn't seem to care/accommodate at all for this. 

The atmosphere in the restaurant was okay but the seating is a bit weird. 

I definitely will not be going back.
