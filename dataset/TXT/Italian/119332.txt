H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g Coming from a girl who's first word was "pizza" let me tell you this place left me speechless. 

We ordered the "Gnocco Fritto" with the "Prosciutto di Parma" to start. The dough was fried perfectly and the fresh grated parmesan was the freshest I have ever tasted. Then ordered the "Margherita D.O.C" which was topped with an amazing tomato sauce that was seasoned just right, bufala mozzarella and basil. That pizza alone was breathtaking, but the real winner here was the "Pesto" pizza. Thin wood fired crust topped with ricotta, olive oil, and green pesto. When it arrived I admit it looked like the pesto was going to be overpowering and bitter, but boy was I wrong. I have never tasted such a balance of flavors in one bite. The medley of cheese and pesto was perfect. Was disappointed that I didn't get a chance to try the pasta because I'm sure it is amazing as well.

If you like REAL Italian food, I suggest you try this place.
