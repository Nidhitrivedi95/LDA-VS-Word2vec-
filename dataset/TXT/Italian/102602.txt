FiP7mCGs-qelOSmapmbt1A Live and ate Fiore's pizza in Pgh for 40 years. Moved to Washington Co. And was stoked the see new location. My last pizza on Saturday was a disgusting mess. My pie was an oval uncooked disgrace. There where leftovers (unheard of with Fiore's ) I did not waste the tin foil to save it. Right in the trash. Never going back!!!
