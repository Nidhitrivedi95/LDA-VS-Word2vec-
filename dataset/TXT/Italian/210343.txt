qVQGfHphxolps16v6g5X-g This is a great family restaurant.  I have been going here for years. The decor is dated more 80's old but large with two dining sections. 
NY style pizza, calzones and stuffed rolls that are great, my favorite is eggplant. There is a selection of them already made or you can order off the menu. 
There is a small selection of gnocchi or ravioli that they make and then freeze. 
The bakery they have is really great. They have a good selection of Italian pastries and cookies like pignoli cookies, eclairs, tiramisu and different kinds of cannoli's including  chocolate dipped. Some come in both a regular and a smaller size which is nice.
