6SRHHzkCuEIqyreM4lZ8_A I have been to Olive's twice and both times have been great!. We found Olive's because it is a BYOB place and there is no cork fee. My wife and I went had a great dinner and enjoyed our own bottle of wine that we brought in. We met the owner's Tim and Kim. Kim brought us our glasses for the wine and recommended two of the specials that were on the board for the evening. We went with a toasted ravioli trio (mushroom, veal and spinach) and pasta rustica. Both were so good but we were seeing the pizzas come out of the kitchen and knew we needed to come back and try one. We did come back this time with some friends and to our surprise they had live music playing. The pizza was the best I have ever had and can't wait to come back again.
