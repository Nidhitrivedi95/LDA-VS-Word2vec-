gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw If you want to eat somewhere with a good view in The Venetian, that provides solid flavor and worthy presentation, but with value, then you are better off eating @ Canaletto right next to this place or at Taqeuria Canonita near the Canals.

If you want solid wood fired pizza or overprices pasta, then you would be wiser going to Postrio right next door, or Spago at Caesars or any Puck resturant for that matter.
