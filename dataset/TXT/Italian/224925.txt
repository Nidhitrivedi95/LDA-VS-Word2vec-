Highlights:
*CLEAN - the restaurant looked immaculate.  Even though we were one of the day's first patrons, the place was clean, and I'll take that whenever I can get it
* GREAT SERVICE - Waitress was friendly and polite.  Even though our waitress was training another waitress, it didn't interfere with the service or our overall dining experience.
*PERFECT TIMING - any great dining experience has great service and great PACE with that service; quick, but not rushed.  We were able to get in and out within 45min, which was just what my gf and I were looking for.
*PRICE - For such a nice, upscale feeling place, the prices are very reasonable.  We were able to get in and out for UNDER $30, and that included a Mimosa.  
PARKING -  COMPLIMENTARY VALET
FOOD - Both of our dishes (see pics) were very tasty and filling.  Everything tasted freshly made, and was made to our mutual liking.

Low-lights:
*Nothing comes to mind.

I am a fan of this place, and would jump at the chance to dine here again.
