dPxZI9lrKTl5dvFfnb1_Ig Great little Italian restaurant located off of Eastern. We started out with the arinchini which was devine! Most places you get 2 large ones, but here you get five nestled in a plate of marinara sauce. Delish. Next I had the gnocchi with the Ninni sauce and the little lady had chicken parm. Both dishes came out perfect with the chicken parm having a great crust and the cook modifying the dish to meet the request we had. Service was top notch and the prices was appripriate. No down sides at this little gem.
