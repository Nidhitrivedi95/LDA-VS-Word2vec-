nY2oBwH3s5sKox1mERIoVQ I've passed by Epicure many times, but strangely never went in. Its located right across from the winners/loblaws complex on Queen W.

Inside is comfortable seating and inviting ambience. Warm exposed brick, low lighting. Small but comfy seating. I felt very relaxed. 

The menu is diverse with many options. Prices are reasonable-most mains around $20 or less. I went with the tuna steak (yes tuna steak for under $20!). My dining partner had the pork chops. Serving sizes were very generous! I could barely finish my main, leaving no room to try their enticing dessert menu (will have to return).

My tuna was cooked well, left a little soft in the middle but I like that. The best part was the sauce-creamy dill that smothered my tuna and side asparagus. 

Overall a great dining experience. Its a good place to bring friends/family visiting from the burbs who want a comfortable but 'cool' experience in Toronto. Also good if you are out with friends who tend to be picky eaters-there is enough selection to satisfy a wide array of palates!
