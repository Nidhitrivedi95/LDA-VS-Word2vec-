Orgm9nmcClxnAUva4nOKyA I really want to like this place, but after two visits, I can't say I'm pleased.

My first visit was during Winterlicious with my cousin two years ago, which we collectively agreed was an ordinary meal.

My most recent visit was for their Sunday brunch, which my cousin said was amazing. And knowing my cousin, she wouldn't exaggerate over something like food.

I also took my cousin's advice in making a reservation. Thankfully I did, and we were able to bypass those restlessly waiting in the holding area. I could feel their eyes piercing through me as me and my friend were seated immediately.

After sitting down, we were told about their buy-one-get-one free mimosa special. Sold! Shortly after, we asked where the buffet was and we were directed to the general direction. We turned the corner, and let out an, "Oh..." I guess I hyped myself up thinking it'd be a Vegas-style brunch based on the size of the restaurant and the raving reviews.

There wasn't much of a selection, to which my friend suggested that perhaps they've refined their menu. Nope, just as ordinary as the Winterlicious dinner. The highlight for me was the salad station of all things, but that alone isn't enough for me to give this place a third chance.
