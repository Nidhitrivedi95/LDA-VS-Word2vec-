DjvpsmdtEvnyMk2vXxpc-w We have just put the final nail in the coffin for Pier 54.  Our first visit took about an hour and a half from start to finish and all we ordered were two salads.  They were great, but I just couldn't understand why the restaurant allowed 1 employee to work both the bar and the patio area.  After not being greeted 10 minutes after seating ourselves , we cut our second trip short because we were not willing to endure horrendous service again.  Pier 54 has good salads and a great view, but don't expect to be in and out of this place in a reasonable manner/have adequate service.
