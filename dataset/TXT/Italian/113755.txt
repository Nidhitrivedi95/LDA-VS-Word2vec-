gIOpptgl57KGrOAFw_ViIw Having been to most the other Levetto locations, I was ecstatic to see Levetto open in Aurora! For this meal, my table ordered the Carbonara and Rigatoni since these are our Levetto favourites. 

The Carbonara tasted similar to the other locations and the pasta's texture was amazing as usual. However, the sauce was also a little more watery compared to the other locations. 

The Rigatoni had great texture and good taste overall as well but again, the sauce was a little more watery and less rich than usual. 

Overall, still a great place but could definitely use some fine-tuning!
