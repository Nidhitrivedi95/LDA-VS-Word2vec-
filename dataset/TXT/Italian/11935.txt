0u47y3RqsQ_UpTSJGEpGrw I've been to Olive Press a few times, and not particularly impressed by it. It's not bad, but also not great.  It's perhaps just a small step beyond an East Side Mario's or other similar type of chain of Italian-style food.  The portions are decent and it is definitely kid-friendly, so it has this going for it. I think I *might* return there if I happened to be up that way again, with a car full of a hungry family, but would not make an effort to make my way there again.
