aIvvMGWW-Yy3zPZlnXL6Uw This place has good food, but as far as the service goes, it sucks. I ordered two pizzas and wings that came with two small containers of ranch. When I asked for more ranch they told me it would be an extra 50 cents for each one... seriously? I just spent 60+ dollars at your restaurant and you're going to charge me for extra ranch? Stingy much! On top of that I specifically ordered thin crust on both pizzas and they both came out with original crust... even the celery with the wings was old and brown. I'll stick to #1 brothers pizza on 75th and cactus!! They value their customers and have great food!
