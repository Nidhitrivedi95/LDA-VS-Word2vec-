9yH1SL2paauMMuxHnV6cBA What a disappointment the server that toke my order is a CLOWN! she even gave me attitude for calling to check on my order since I had made my order an hour ago! she had the mordacity to ask if I was calling to complain or to check on my order I asked to speak to the manager the managers name is Anthony all he said was he would talk to her! He didn't accommodate anything or apologies for their mistakes! my order was in hour late it wasn't complete when it got to my house the delivery guy was rude I asked for my sauces and told me he forgot wtf I paid to get my food and all I got was SHITTY SERVICE ,BAD COLD FOOD, AND INCOMPLETE ORDER!!!
