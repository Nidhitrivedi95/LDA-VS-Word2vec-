0s1DqJlSSgR1Ftg9Q_HEOg We came across Enzo's after stopping at  Trader Joes. It was 8:55pm, but the owner was more than welcoming. I loved the feel of the place, very mom & pop-like. The wife ordered 2 cheese pizza slices, a soda, & a salad for about $9. I had two pepperoni slices and a house beer for $7. It was all freshly made- we were satisfied with the prices, quality of food, and friendly customer service!
