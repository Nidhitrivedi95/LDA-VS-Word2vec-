At first we were rejected for not having a reservation, but I called in 15 minutes later to make a reservation, and they had space luckily so we got a table for 2. The complimentary garlic bread was nicely done. To start we got the calamari, which was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again. It wasn't as soft as I would like and being grilled, the squid taste was too much. I got the spaghetti carbonara, which was tasty if a bit too oily for my liking. I much preferred the the spaghetti al pesto that my fiancee got. It was absolutely delicious and a 5/5 dish. The portions were fair and so were the prices. Lastly, the service was frequently by our table to refill our drinks.
