GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q This deli truly is as good as it gets. If you are interested in finding an authentic deli, run by family members who love what they do, and who have been doing it since 1977, than this is your place!!! Along with class photos from nearby Saguaro High School, their walls are full of awards they earned throughout the years that claim Casells's as the best deli around. And I agree! The food all looked amazing and I look forward to coming back to try more things on the menu, especially the meatballs! For this visit, I had the turkey sub as well as the Italian Hoagie. I had a side of the baked beans as well. Everything was tasty! We couldn't help ourselves, and on the way out we just had to get a couple of the fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies made from grandma's original recipe. For a real treat, ask to see if Joe is around. If he isn't too busy in the back making chicken salad (he makes 40 lbs of it every other day) or fresh sausage, he will gladly come out and chat with you. 

This deli is worth the drive from anywhere in the Valley. It is definitely worth a visit. One trip and you will want to come back again and again. I know I do, and I know a lot of people have. Plenty of regulars came in while we were there. I know this because each one was greeted with their first name as they came in and were all asked how their family was doing. Become the newest member of the Casella family and stop on by!
