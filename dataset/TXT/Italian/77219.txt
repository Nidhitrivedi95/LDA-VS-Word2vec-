cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA Haven't been to a Giordano's in 20 years. I go back to Chicago every year, but there is a Lou's close to where I stay, so that is the pizza I usually get. Tried Giordano's and they didn't disappoint. Took 6 other people with me that never tried deep dish pizza and they all loved it. Read some reviews before going, so I knew that I would have to wait for a table (No biggie). Was told 1-1/2- 2 hours when we arrived, but we were seated in 40 minutes. Can't beat that for a Saturday night at 6 p.m. My advise..Keep bringing Chicago style restaurants to the valley. I've lived here over 10 years and haven't been impressed with what Phoenix has to offer on the west side.Especially SW
