e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw Should start by saying we walked out. My friend was wearing a t-shirt and was told we could eat at the bar area. Fine! There was nobody, I mean nobody in the restaurant at 7 PM. We waited to order apetizers but the only staff seemed confused by how to bring five people who were having drinks into the larger dining area. The bartender brought me a sip of $15 per glass wine - the cheapest. I asked how much a bottle would be. $65! I had heard the osso bucco was good. Not for me at $50. We walked and ate at Magianno's , literally across the street. Same wine, same bottle, $32. Sinatras is for high rollers who get comped or tourist suckers. Save your money. Got Matteo's in Westwood, CA. , where Sinatra really liked to eat.
