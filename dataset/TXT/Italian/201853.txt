q0n882G2DVBD8DMH8NOaVQ HORRIBLE!!!! The owner grabbed the arm of and SCREAMED at our waiter and "made an example" out of him because I thought there was too much dressing on the salad.....WHAT THE HECK!!! I was physically terrified because the owner was so close that I thought he might assault me like he did his employee. The wife/owner apologized for her husband's violent aggressive outburst and horrific punishment of the employee while we were trying to eat. Honestly, I'm afraid what happened to that poor boy serving us our lunch after we left. So I guess my advice is that if you happen to choose to go to this place and you don't like how your food tastes, DO NOT COMPLAIN or some employee may be hurt/humiliated and/or fired.
