cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA Dude this place is bomb.com.  I am from Chicago and get so excited when one of our places comes down here-I just wish we would get some more in the Southwest Valley near Goodyear and Buckeye.  I have been to this location several times for eat in and I even bought a few frozen ones for carry out as well.  Everything is always excellent.  Appetizers, drinks, and pizzas as well as service have been superb.  I was sad when I saw that the Corner Bakery was shutting down, but when I saw what was taking over and being built in its place I was super stoked!!!
