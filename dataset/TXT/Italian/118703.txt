GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ I had great expectations for this restaurant showcasing Mario Batali and Joe Basstianich. But were we extremely disappointed. 
When we stepped into the restaurant, I should have heeded my instinct and turned around and walked out. The atmosphere was fast food stark, half empty and the hostess wanted to seat us in the back where there wasn't even the benefit of watching the sports offerings at the bar. 
The menu prices were high; we ordered a couple of beers on tap, onion rings, fried oysters to share which were over fried, split a so-so overpriced burger. Then we were smacked in the face when we got our bill for $82. 
Definitely NOT worth it. Do not waste your money here. There are better places you can go for a good burger in LV!
I'd give this place 0 stars if I could.
