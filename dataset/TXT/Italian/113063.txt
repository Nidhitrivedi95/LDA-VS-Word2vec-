Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg We had a great experience here for dinner. 
First of all, the red sauce is amazing. Fresh and flavorful. Second of all, you MUST try the Spumoni Pie. I think I'm officially hooked. I'll crave this in the near future for sure. 
We had the calamari for an appetizer-the calamari was fresh, the breading was light and perfectly fried. It's a must have if you love calamari.
We had the Olde New York pizza and the baked ziti for our dinner-both were so good! You can't go wrong with either. 
Looking forward to trying the calzone we are bringing home (we are total gluttons). 

Good service, beer & wine, great food and a casual ambiance-with Spumoni Pie!! Who could ask for more?
