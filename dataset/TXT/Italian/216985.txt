RwJGNFavhB1u0zzCDqRxGw What a gem! I dined here yesterday and had the delicious stone-oven prosciutto pizza with arugula and parmesan shreds. I wish I had a photo but my phone died! Trust me, it's amazing. You can even ask for the hot pepper oil to drab on top if you like it a little spicy. 

You order at the front, and they'll deliver to your table. You can also take out if you prefer. Frank was so friendly and welcoming. Went through the specials and recommended things to us. He was very attentive and wanted to get to know us. Andre, behind the kitchen, was also very sweet. 

Just such genuine people with absolutely delicious, authentic Italian food that reminds me of my own Nonna's (Grandmother's) cooking. 

Go try it!
