e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw Had an amazing time! Food was great! We actually came in a bit late but we never felt rushed or anything. We ordered off the vegan menu and I had been eyeing the chicken parm all trip from their menu online. We saved this place for our last night and it did not disappoint! The Sinatra smash was great, my wife and I were both very pleased with our drinks and our food. I love when places give you bread to munch on, with vegan butter :) 

Amy was our server and I can't say enough great things about her. She was friendly, polite, and patient with our order and in giving recommendations. We don't eat at very fancy restaurants very often because most don't cater to vegans. It was a great experience, we will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas :)
