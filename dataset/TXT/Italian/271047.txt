XPLSNGSClW8gR5BTcvyOhQ This was a first for me.  We were with a wedding party and the menu was set.  it appeared to be a family style meal with 3 courses and many items were brought out, some I have no idea what they were since I rarely eat Italian.  My favorite was chicken saltimboca, wow.  a lemon sauce was on this along with prosciutto, who doesn't like prosciutto, am I right?  The service was great even with such a large party we were all attended to very well.
