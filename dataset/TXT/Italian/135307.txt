IvovJ3sfYrjHKH_hS5XrNA Love this location!  Its spacious, updated, CLEAN, with SUPER FRIENDLY STAFF & MANAGEMENT. The games are so cool l & age appropriate for my 3 year old niece. The games are different, updated and better than any we've ever seen before.  The pizza buffet always rocks, but this location is busy so they're trying to pump out as fast as they can... you may have to wait a minute... But that's ok... There are about 16 flat screens with cartons, news & other programs on at once... A good time had by all!!!
