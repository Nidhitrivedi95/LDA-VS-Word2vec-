OMG, it was so good. For the main course, I had the "select two:" chicken and mozzarella panini and raspberry chicken salad. Holy salad and sandwiches, they were delicious! The best part, apart from the food, is the ambiance of the place and the people! The servers were very nice, and accommodating. Oh, the bathrooms are unisex! Very cool.
