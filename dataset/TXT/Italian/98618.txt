The chef apparently found garlic salt as his new Magic ingredient and everything was covered in it! Three of the steaks ordered weren't cooked correctly and the broccolini side the waitress raved about in her opening remarks was sold out by the time she made it back to our table to take our order...meh! Back to Fleming's!
