NTaTBDtEKfmqGlLhqK9mzw Love this new halal steakhouse.  I ordered the lamb shank and it was excellent very moist and flavourful.

My friend ordered the steak with fries and very well presented and delicious.
The service was fast and friendly. The portions were perfect and price was comparable to other steakhouses.  The ambiance was lacking, cheap chairs and tables.  I'll be going back for the amazing food
