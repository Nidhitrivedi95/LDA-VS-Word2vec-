Ate here last night.  Was quoted 35 min wait and we were prepared.  We were seated in 15 minutes!  Nice size booth, wonderful atmosphere.  The food was to die for. We had Riga Tony and Zany Ziti...huge portions and so-so - so delicious. Great waiter, too! We live in Surprise and have one in Glendale but were already headed to Scottsdale for a comedy show. I'm not big on Scottsdale swank and it didn't have that feel at all :)
