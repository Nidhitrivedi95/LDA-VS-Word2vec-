15YuEFO59yXd7BTO5NZgYw Used to go here all the time and noticed food was changing. So we changed to another Italian local place down the road. We decided to give them a try again about a month ago and try our old favorite dishes. I was still very disappointed the chicken with my pasta changed and had a familiar chicken from Box taste and seasoning on chicken was not the same and very little spice as this was a spicy pasta dish and was lacking cheese. Hoping they change back to original chicken.
