SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Loved everything about this place! Loved the dim lighting and ambiance. We went for our anniversary dinner and made reservations they seated us right away. We had the calamari as an appetizer and a few drinks which were all very good. My husband orders prime rib with the truffle mac and cheese and I had the New York steak with the mac and cheese they were both very good and the steaks were at the perfect temperature. This was our second time there and we will definitely be going back. Mark Vega was our server and he was so attentive to every detail he made us feel right at home and so did everybody else who helped us. Can't wait to go back
