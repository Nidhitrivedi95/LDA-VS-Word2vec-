QnfAHUr5-HTiaA5-va3glQ Disclosure: I have never eaten in the restaurant, I have always ordered for pickup since it's no more than 400 feet from my house.

Streets of NY is among my favorite places for take-out pizza - it's delicious! I love the pizza - it's definitely more of a NY pie (a little greasy, thin, floppy) - but it's SOOO good. I've had both the supreme and pepperoni. I recently ordered the artichoke dip, which I'd skip in the future (a lot of calories for not a lot of taste)... I'll just be sure to make up the calories in an extra slice.  MMmm.
