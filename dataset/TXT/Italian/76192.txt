CSaVK9wgqe2_tQuuCDINyQ Excellent pizza!! We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, chicken wings, and garlic knots. The crust on the pizza was cooked perfectly. One of my pet peeves is when oil soaks through the crust, this was not an issue at all with Frankie's Pizza. Even reheated the next day the pizza retained the flavor! The garlic knots were huge and came with marinara dipping sauce (quite delicious). They do not offer boneless chicken wings but the wings were decent. Will definitely make Frankie's my go to pizza place.
