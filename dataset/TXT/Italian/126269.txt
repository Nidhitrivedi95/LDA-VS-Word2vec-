hsDkxhc-_YYsVqAeQBJJjg Amid the modern scene of strip mall restaurant chains and tired cliches masquerading as innovative establishments, Big Jim's is a refreshing surprise. For those of us who were children in the 70s or 80s, a visit to Big Jim's becomes a bit of a time warp back to childhood. It's divey, dark, and the decor probably hasn't changed since the place opened in 1977. In other words, it's pretty freaking awesome.

If time warping to the late 70s isn't enough for you, how about giant portions of delicious comfort food? Bring your appetite and a friend. The meals here are immense. My husband, 3-year-old daughter, and I all shared a chicken parm sandwich and I still had a little piece of my portion to bring home. The chicken was tender and generously topped with flavorful marinara and melted cheese. Oh, and the bread. Can't forget the bread. The sandwich is served on a crusty half loaf of delicious Italian bread. 

Overall, I think this place is great. Bear in mind that the criticisms of other reviewers - digs about the decor or the uniforms - were positive in my book. I love that this place has likely never been renovated. If it were to be renovated, I probably would never go back. I like time travel.

Oh, and as a side note, Big Jim's was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. Take that as you will. If you pride yourself on visiting places that are featured on television shows, then put this on your list. If not, still put this restaurant your list because it's a funky place straight out of the 70s with excellent food. 

Happy time traveling!
