29o-qEDIRpXmVmSPNsH4sA Traveling from California for Epic conference ... our buddy Alex said before we leave: Vin Santo
Is a must!  Our party of 3 ... Alex plus my friend Suann and I loved every single item!! Suann and I are Italian heritage and were not disappointed! I checked out other diners as we walked in and I was sure the pasta looked fresh...it was!! I had Linguini a la Pecorino...literally brought tears to my eyes because it reminded me of my grandmother's cooking ... (she has been gone 14 years.) suann and Alex both had the Scampi diavolo which I was able to try. Fresh homemade sausage as tender and spiced just right. Scampi also perfectly cooked. Our server Adam was so helpful and kind. He guided us through dinner choices and the desserts... we ordered the Grappa Bread Pudding...which I literally said tasted like Christmas...plus cannoli. Portions generous and great value for the price. Service was fast but Adam never rushed us as lingered at the table. Go and eat here!!!! You will not be disappointed! Any time I journey back to Epic... a stop at Vin Santo
Will be a must!!
