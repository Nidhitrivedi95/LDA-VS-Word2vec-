82-wE5pkxyBKhfxyyZap_A I'm not too big on writing reviews but I'm pretty irked with this place. I will admit, I am a little at fault for some of this. My coworkers and I order from this place from time to time while we work our late days. The food is just mediocre, but because the menu has some variety we can all agree on it.

Well we ordered from grubhub, and I tried updating our new address on the website, but I guess it didn't save. Mind you, our new building is 20 feet away from our old one, so it's not that huge of an inconvenience. Apparently it was. I'm at work, and both the driver and the restaurant are calling my cell phone multiple times, leaving multiple messages. Eventually when I can call them back, I apologize and give them the new address and move on with my life. I can see the driver walking around across the parking lot, I figured he'd find us pretty quick. 

Another 20 minutes goes by, and he finally shows up. Immediately when he walks in, I'm apologizing for the confusion. He's not saying a word, shaking his head at me and huffing and puffing. He asks me what address we're at, looks at his slip, tosses it and the food at me and walks out. 

My advice to you, sir: we all have to put on our smiling customer service faces, even when we're annoyed. Drop the attitude.

Oh also my grilled cheese sandwich was dripping in grease? or butter? or something. Either way, it was hard to eat. My coworker's egg salad sandwich was so full of mayonnaise that it was falling apart. Come on. I'd say the equivalent of gas station food.

Not ordering here again, not worth it.
