UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w We drove out of our way from the Strip because of the Yelp ratings. 

We got the Pinny Signature pizza. It was good, but not awesome or anything outstanding. The pizza knots were ok, but nothing memorable. The sauce for the pizza and the knots were too tomatoey for my liking and lacked typical Italian seasoning. Got the six-piece wings (hot) and they came with an order of fries. The wings and fries were both good and worthwhile. 

Service was meh. The server either wasn't paying much attention or something else was amiss. Kept having to repeat and reclarify the order. There wasn't any language barrier, so I don't know...

While she was attentive, she gave off the aire of hovering over us -which was both annoying and creepy. She also stood behind the refrigeration/display counter staring in our direction when not hovering -no doubt she was watching the game on TV -but it was creepy. 

I'm glad others have had good experiences here. But there are other choices for independent Mom&Pop pizzeria fare -and I think we will continue to shop around.
