4S7vWgarCkYjSaN8vrTV9g We have never been here for dinner, but have for lunch. Their lunch pricing, even on weekends, is very reasonable for good food. Not sure if this carries over to dinner. 

I noticed the prices are considerably more for dinner, which may be for the same portions. Kind of like a Chinese restaurant is so much more expensive at night. Never understood that. It is a nice restaurant though and we had good service and food.
