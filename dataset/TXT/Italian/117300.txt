GXDRFAunLh0aRao6ERnM4A For some reason I wanted to eat pizza in Vegas, and since I was staying in Treasure Island I had to try this place out. I ordered a Medium Pepperoni Pizza ($23 total with tax) because by looking at the individual slices it was huge. The medium pizza took about 20 mins and it was kinda small....The six of us of course had one small slice each and was not too happy. The pizza was good but not great. The good thing was the pizza is fresh out of the oven and the cheese is melted perfectly. Overall, the food there was good and I probably won't go back. Make sure to ask someone about the whole pan size before ordering.
