-7PX_FOoCwktlunImRyZdg I had heard excellent reviews of Pizza Taglio and had been dying to go. With a spur of the moment decision yesterday I was finally was able to make it there for lunch. I'm a pizza lover in general but their Ricotta Pie was the perfect mix of cheesy goodness and fresh ingredients with arugula and roasted tomatoes topping it. 

Glad I can now add Pizza Taglio as a new go to for me.
