GXDRFAunLh0aRao6ERnM4A Our first night in Vegas we happened upon this place because we had just lost all the money we were willing to part with at the Treasure Island black jack tables. (This is false advertising in my mind, for there was no treasure on this island.) We went in and asked for a table for two and even though there were clearly many open tables the hostess informed us we needed a reservation so we said we'd take the next available, which happened to be about 30 minutes later. Annoying, but I'm sure it's not the hostess' fault these crappy rules exits.

Once we were seated everything else was fairly enjoyable about the evening. Our waiter was awesome and the food was better than decent. We shared Crispy Risotto Fritters, which may have been my very favorite part of the meal, salad and a white sauce pizza. While, it was definitely casual dining and pricey for that, it was less expensive and the quality was higher than I expected considering we were in Vegas.
