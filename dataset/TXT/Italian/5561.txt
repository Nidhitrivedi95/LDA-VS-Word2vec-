_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw I might be a bit biased since I used to work here, but I've tried just about everything on the menu. It's delicious. Everything tastes great when it's cooked in that oven. I am particular to the paninis, and recommend the Pompeii. It's not very accommodating for large groups, however, even with reservations, the location is just too small. The staff is very professional.
