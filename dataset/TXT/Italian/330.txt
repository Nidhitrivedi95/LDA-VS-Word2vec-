-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw Food very average.  I have eaten at this restaurant on 5 different occasions and the quality has progressively gotten worse.  He the last two times the red wine was served Luke warm.  I had the server check the temperature and it was 82 degrees.  Tasted like warm water.  He said they do not have a wine cooler for their Reds and keep them in storage upstairs in a room that is obviously not air conditioned.
