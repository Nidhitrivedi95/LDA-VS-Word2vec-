E_jLyf_YuGgMP_rw8tvNSA Even if the pizza was bad it's hard to look past Niko's and Dorians awesome hospitality. You can tell they have a real passion for their pizza. Something you'll never find in a commercialized pizza shop. Thankfully though, the pizza was also amazing. Been here 3 years and tried lots of pizza and this is easily some of the best in Vegas. I ordered a medium - which was actually a little bigger than I was thinking it would be - with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, onion, and fresh mozzarella and every ingredient tasted high quality and was put together perfectly. Definitely recommended.
