pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Great place for thin-crust wood-fired pizza "artistry" featuring fresh, local ingredients. I sneaked in before a giants/dbacks game and lucked into a seat at the bar. the next group in had an expected hour and a half wait. ouch. the place IS small. there is one and only one pizza maker. expect to wait, even if you get a table. but the good news is that the food is fresh and tasty. wine, salad, bread and bar chat made my wait for the pizza a pleasant experience. my pizza 'rosa' - a sauceless pie was highlighted with red onion and arizona pistachio and was perfectly done.
