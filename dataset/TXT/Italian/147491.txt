KBQcNy9k9G8_a5WtrVGH8w Has been my absolute favourite restaurant in Toronto for the last 10 years. Cannot beat the quality of ingredients, portions, selections, caesar salad, and prices! It might be slower service, but it's always worth the wait. No matter what the occasion--break-up, date night, looking to gain a few pounds--One of a Kind is (and always will be) a top pick. If you haven't already, give it a try today. The pastas, curry, jalapeño mussels and anchovy-licious caesar salad are amazing.
