KcIalceIg6PSPONvLlI4-w Sud Forno has a nice charm to it, great food and little hectic ordering and seating process. 

For a quick bite this place is great. Light sandwiches and pizzas will satisfy your taste buds, but probably not your hunger. I am a fan of the pizza; crispy crust, fresh tomato sauce and a good variety of toppings. 

Their demise is the service. And its not all down to the staff, it lies in the design of the place. No real lineup or way to the cash, its more of a free for all to order. But this doesn't completely take away from the whole experience.

Oh, but don't buy the bread, unless you're a millionaire. I know its good and all, but close to $10 for a loaf?
