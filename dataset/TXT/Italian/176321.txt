NhNO2lN-p1RvA4MfR1wk1A Stopped in dragging after a tough and long day at work wanting a good meal and got one.  I ordered the baked calzone with fresh tomatoes and olive oil. Got a basket of fresh homemade bread to start that was awesome.  The calzone came and looked great. Everything was made from scratch and tasted like it.  The dough tasted great and was full of cheese and ham.  It melted in your mouth and hit the spot!  Just what I needed!  I will be bringing the entire family back for an encore performance.  Authentic Italian!!!
