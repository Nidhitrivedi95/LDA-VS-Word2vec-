UFvLouGNq5q3w-0Ud_HP7w My first experience at buddys was amazing. Great food, great service, very kind people. My next two experiences were very frustrating. I called at 8:28pm and they wouldn't take an order because their kitchen was closed. Then Saturday afternoon we really wanted some good pizza to eat while watching football. apparently they open at 4pm. As much as I enjoyed my first visit it's been difficult going back. I hope they can reconsider their hours of operation rather than being open 4 1/2 hours a day.
