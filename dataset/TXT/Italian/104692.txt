FOzChvW-f6mp0BGbrS-ywQ We started with an arugula salad with fresh figs. Then on to orgasmic scallops in a Gorgonzola sauce over light little pillows of gnocchi , followed by tiramisu as light as air.  One of the best meals I have had. The service was great and the atmosphere was delightful. Go and enjoy

Even better the second time, The veal chop was unbelievable.
