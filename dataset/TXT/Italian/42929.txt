7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw I went to North twice this week for Restaurant Week (two separate groups of friends picked North...what are the odds with all the other restaurant choices??). I don't venture up to Kierland too often, so dining at North two nights was a good excuse to go up there and do some shopping.

The first night I went to North was with a group of 7. We sat inside, which is dimly lit and contemporary feeling. Be warned it is really noisy, so don't expect to be able to carry on a conversation with any one other than the people seated next to you and directly across. Our waiter was friendly and helpful in helping some friends choose wine. However, he didn't check on us often and let us sit a long time before taking our orders. The whole night everything was just really spaced out...but not in a good way. Since I was going back to North the next night, I opted to not do the RW menu and just ordered a caesar salad. The waiter specifically asked if I wanted it with my friends' appetizers or as the main course and I very clearly said as the main course. Well, guess what? My salad came out with their appetizers, and thus, I had the pleasure of sitting there with no food while they ate their entrees!! Grr! The salad was fine as caesar salads go, but definitely not memorable. I did also sample a friend's trio of spreads appetizer which was awesome. The garlic bread was perfection.

Night two of my RW North dining experience was with a girlfriend and we took advantage of the pleasant evening weather by sitting on the patio. If I go back to North, I will only sit on the patio. It was such a calm experience after the noisiness of the night before. Our waitress, really rushed us which was disappointing. This time I did order the RW menu: 

*caprese salad - blob of mozzarella instead of slices - I prefer slices...but on the plus side the mozzarella was very fresh and tasty. Tomatoes were just ok
*scallops - fine enough to eat two and a half of the four that came on the plate, but definitely not exceptional. They didn't melt in my mouth which is the sign of a perfectly cooked scallop. These were a bit too chewy for my liking
*hazelnut chocolate cake - the highlight of the meal. While the cake was delicious, it was a bit too rich for me (I am not a sweets person). However, the vanilla bean gelato that came with it was awesome. 

Overall, both nights, the people I dined with found parts of their meals really good and other parts just OK, if not a bit disappointing. Like the food, service from one night to the next was not consistent. North is a 3.5 star place, but I'm rounding down to 3 because I wasn't impressed enough where I feel I should make special trips to Kierland to dine here.
