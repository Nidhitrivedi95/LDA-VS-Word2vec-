REfekXeUbPWGkgvlzSNbpw One of the better chain restaurant's even though I don't care much for chains with so many good places to eat. Service was very good. Food was ok, nothing spectacular. Was in the mood for steak and outback was too long of a wait. The steak marsala was over-priced but it's not a steak place but I thought I'd take a chance. An average rating at best.
