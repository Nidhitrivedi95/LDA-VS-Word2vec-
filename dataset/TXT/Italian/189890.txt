p2RqycIW2jzjbQnkEw5lkA This location is just terrible. It's very dirty, I wouldn't dine in- dirty dishes everywhere. I always get the salad with side soup to go. I RARELY get the right silverware, if any. Today they shorted me a spoon for my soup. AHHHHHHH, I sick of this. The noodles in Fitchburg has the same problem- no silverware. I had to drive 8 miles back to the store to get a spoon. No one seemed to care. Stay away from this one.
