eQCYur0033RkZdh5VjbF8A I had a pretty mediocre experience here which was disappointing because there's so much hype behind O&B restaurants and at the more expensive prices you expect to have better service but alas that is not always the case. Also I was expecting more from their menu but it all seemed run of the mill for me - some pastas, some pizzas, nothing unique that stood out. I ordered their prosciutto pizza which did hit the spot and my husband's order of fish & chips looked satisfying. But again, I was just expecting more. So I'd recommend going for the convenience of its location (very close to Union stn) and with low expectations.
