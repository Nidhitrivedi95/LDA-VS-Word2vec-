fbU7gHEG5A-cFxH33ouQ4A Go ahead and skip this one.  We've been a couple times, and both were disappointing.  The food is only OK at best, and it's over-priced for what it is.  Food wasn't always cooked well, the menu options are same-ole, same-ole, and the flavors are underwhelming.  Service was mixed.  We'd have friendly folks, but occasionally would disappear.  Worse, on our second trip we sat indoors in the booths closest to the kitchen.  The place was pretty empty, and we picked up a scent of BO or sweatsocks in the air... not good.  The glasses also looked dirty, though it could have been hard water spots/etching.  It's a shame, cuz we eat in this area all the time, but we won't be going back.
