RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ I have dined here several times with my girlfriend and some business associates. This is my go-to restaurant since I live nearby. I had a recent dinner service which changed my perception of Salute. Let me say that I have never had any complaints about the food or the service. I went a few nights ago and was very disappointed with the service. 

My girlfriend and I were not greeted by the hostess who was on her phone. She must have been new because I did not recognize her as I have dined here many times. I thought this was very unprofessional. She made it seem like WE were bothering her. 

She did not even ask how may guests we had, but assumed it was just a table for us and very ghastly walked us to a table for 2. We had other guests... I wanted to walk out at that very second but I had other guests and it was too late to make reservations at that time. 
Then, our waiter took awhile to even acknowledge our table - didn't even ask if we wanted drinks. WE had to ask. 

At the end of our service, my girlfriend asked her for her name because she was so upset. I think it was Gina or something along those lines. I am not sure what is happening with Salute but I won't be back for quite some time.
