o86OGfW63bVqWkIrvxcEQQ I've been to all the other Postino's in the Gilbert, Arcadia areas. This location was the first for me. Excellent location, private parking lot and the service and food is just as good as all the other locations.

My friend and I had the Bruschetta Board of 4 and we shared the Tuscan Tuna Panini with homemade chips. Note: I love their Tuna Salad because it is a non Mayo based, delicious!

Excellent service, great food, nice location!
