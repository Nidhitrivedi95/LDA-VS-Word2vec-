ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg I've been in several times.  Overall I think it is fairly mediocre.  We had a really good experience on our first visit.  We sat at the bar, the bar tender was super friendly and the service was great.  That first visit I had one of the pizza (Not sure about the shape) which I though was decent (I prefer a thinner crispier crust), but overall good.  Based on the first visit I would have granted Crust four stars.  

Since our first visit it has gone downhill.  We live in the neighborhood so this could have been the perfect neighborhood hangout.  We brought my partner's mother and grandmother in on a Friday night (Memorial Day Weekend).  There was only one waitperson (but three busboys...)  The service was slow, the music was too loud, but the food was good.  I had the special which was delicious.  I would have given this visit three stars, knocking off another star for bad, slow service.

We have been in one additional time.  The service continues to go downhill.  We sat at the bar and it was all we could do to get the attention of the bartender to serve us anything.  We finally had the Penne alla Scottsdale.  It's a good dish.  However, I am knocking off the final star for continued service problems.  I don't think we will go back because we found a new Italian place up on Shea that we like a lot better.  It's further away, but the service is always good.  

Overall, the food at Crust is good and it has a decent wine list, it's just a bummer to eat somewhere where the wait and bar staff are apathetic.
