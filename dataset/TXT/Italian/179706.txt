I have to admit that I wasn't a fan of TLC's "Cake Boss" and didn't follow it but I knew of the show and appreciated that it was a family affair. When the restaurant opened in Vegas I didn't really have any desire to try it out until my man had a business lunch there and told me I had to try it. 

We've been here twice now and I'm happy to say that the food is just delicious! My favorite dish is Buddy's mother in law's capellini shrimp scampi. Packed with flavor I can't stop eating it and it never comes home with me for a late night snack. There's tons of garlic, roasted tomatoes, spinach and white wine! My man has enjoyed everything he's tried from the meatball sandwich, chicken parmigiana  and his favorite dish which happens to be the super cheesy lasagna. 

The warm, complimentary focaccia bread is always a hit and we've had the calamari and caesar salad which were great.

Don't forget to tell them if you're celebrating anything special as they'll bring out a mini cannoli on the house. 

Located across from the restaurant is Buddy's bakery which serves the best chocolate dipped strawberries in case you want something for later!
