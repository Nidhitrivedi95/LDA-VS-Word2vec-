Great Italian, family style cuisine...good ambience, and great for big groups...celebrated a fantastic birthday here with friends during a birthday debauchery weekend..and it was NICE to get the hell off the strip for a bit (how much strip can one person take at a time?)

There was this cute old man who played the accordion and serenaded me too..

Loved it.
GO!
Get the hell off the strip.
