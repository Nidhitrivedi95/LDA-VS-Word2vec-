4sfof0u2L7_ryXQusDM-aA We live nearby and wanted to check this place out  since it was new to the neighborhood. From an ambiance perspective this place wasn't my favorite, it just felt a little stuffy and dated compared to the other new development in the area (Sumo Maya, Paul Martins, Binks, etc.. In hindsight this probably isn't surprising as they are under the same ownership group as Tomaso's which is a more old school traditional Phoenix staple).

The food wasn't bad but there are other atmospheres and dishes in the area I would prefer to spend $20 on.
