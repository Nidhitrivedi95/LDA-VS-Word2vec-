C63sF-wG4f1doMIMv2qvOg Café Porta Alba is one of few restaurants in the country serving authentic, certified Neapolitan pizza, and it is some of the best pizza di Napoli that you'll find in town. The sauce is phenomenal, the cheese is sublime, and the toppings are perfect. 

The servers we've had have been exceptional. They're always friendly, quick, and on the ball with refilling drinks. 

My kids and I all give it two thumbs up!
