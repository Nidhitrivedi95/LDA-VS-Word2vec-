ppT0Rbx0-_W0W8DqY2fPiA I rarely order pizza by the slice, but anything beyond a single slice here seems a mistake! The first time I went to Luigi's I ordered *two* slices. A mistake. By the time I finished the first one, I was only able to make a weak effort of eating the topping off the second! I have been back a couple times. 

These pizzas are the size of wagon wheels! The slices are humongous!! All three points of the slice are hanging obscenely far beyond the edges of the paper plate upon which it is served! As others have said, awesome and authentic NY style crust! 

I've never ventured beyond the pizza here (it's too good!) but the sandwiches and other Italian dishes sound great, too. 

As far as the dining environment.... it's order at the counter, self-service beverages and pretty much "fend for yourself" fast food booths. You may have to scrounge for the Parmesan and the red pepper flakes.
