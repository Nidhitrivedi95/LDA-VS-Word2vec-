I decided to take advantage of the Happy Hour and got the Salmon Nigiri which came with 3 pieces and ordered the Hakata Ramen with an extra egg. 

The Salmon Nigiri was actually really good, soft and fresh tasting. The rice was a bit on the wet side so didn't keep it's form well under the Salmon. However, the flavor was there and tasted best with a touch of wasabi and a light dipping in soy sauce.

The Hakata Ramen was pretty basic, I can tell they use powdered broth for their ramen as my tongue got a little bit funny feeling from the MSG. It comes with stick straight ramen, green onion, char-shu, wood-ear mushroom (ki- kurage) and my side order of egg- poached. The broth is Hakata style, made with pork bones and appears creamy, fatty and white in color. Though it is Hakata style, the flavors aren't complex as other ramen I've had and as I've stated was apparent they use a soup base mix/powder. The noodles were okay- though not always a fan of stick straight noodles, but the portion was just right. The char-shu was on the thicker side, but seasoned well. The egg, I wish was soft boiled instead of poached and lacked seasoning/flavor. Another thing that bugged me was that the ramen wasn't hot, it was warm ... perhaps sitting out in the pass a little too long?

Over all I would come here for more Nigiri and pass on the ramen, the ramen is doable for the price point but nothing to get overly excited about. Thus far, their pasta and sushi seems the most promising here.

The service is also pretty good as everything is friendly and quick!
