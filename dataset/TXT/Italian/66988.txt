I noticed people from my neighborhood here and a couple neighbors posting pics here, and due to it's location I can see you might only know about this if you do live local. The decor makes it look like a trendy restaurant and I love the lights, very cool. Upon entering we were warmly greeted which was appreciated, and once I sat down I was given the menu and someone brought waters.  My husband arrived and sat at the table and the second he arrived the waiter asked if we were ready to order. My husband did not even look at the menu yet. When I said we need a moment, instead what we got was no attention at all, and we had to flag down another waitress to help us because our waiter was too busy. There were 2 waiters for about 10 tables full of people and they did not seem to be able to handle it. 

On to the food, we ordered the beet salad (great taste but not enough arugula. Its nice to have a bite of arugula with every bite of beet, but if you do that then you have about half a plate of beets left with no arugula. The Tartufo pizza was excellent (but pricey $20.95). Our meal was big enough to share if you are not that hungry. 

The service was lacking here, we had to flag down the waiter for our bill, water, to ask for more arugula, and they did not come and ask how the food was once. Considering others mentioned how great the service was, maybe this was an off night.
