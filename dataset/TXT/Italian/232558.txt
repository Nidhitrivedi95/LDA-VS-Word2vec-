tkQyffM9YCGBTnyl7Rxo5A I'll start with the good:  

Good service, OMB copper on tap, nice patio in Dilworth, and large inexpensive salads.

The bad:

14" is a "large" pizza here.  The dough has got to be pre-made; it had the consistency of pizza from Chuck E. Cheeses.  Our margarita pizza was covered in way too many spices, which just means they are trying to cover up the lacking flavor.  Plates were still wet and dirty with food particles on them - gross.

I agree with one of the previous reviews.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if it was on the way home or something I might stop.  There are too many way better nearby pizza places.
