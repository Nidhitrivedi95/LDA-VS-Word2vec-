q4mx-ff4_LvU3NnMvNIrZA My wife and I came here for the first time after a recommendation from a friend . The atmosphere was nice and the service was very good. The cheeseburger sliders were excellent! The  pretzel appetizers were just ok (a bit overcooked) but I won't allow this to prevent me from coming back. FYI - We actually got to meet SAMMIE! :-)
