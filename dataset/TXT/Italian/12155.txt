You pick the type of dish and then toppings.  I can say I was impressed with the lobster bisque(a little bit salty) and the calamari on top of noodles.   The calamari was absolutely spot on the workers were friendly and helpful. I sure asked a fair amount of questions so I was really happy they didn't mind. Being lactose intolerant can be such a hassle!!! They have a pretty interesting drink selection as well, peach tea yumm. For fast food Italian I think this is as good as it gets. The only thing i don't love is that they don't cook the vegetables with the noodles so the noodles were a bit bland but other than that, a great experience.  CleAn tables and great service when ordering food!
