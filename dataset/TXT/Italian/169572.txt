MrmwDgMlL2GtthlAZsJwNQ Great food, great company. For a chain italian restaurant, Scaddabush is highly recommend if you want italian food and do not want to take the risk of trying a new place! The decor is very similar to Alice Fazooli's.

The fresh mozarella here is amazing! I have only tried the prosciutto one but with the fig jam, sea salt and crostini, it is the perfect combination..you can always ask for more crostini free of charge.

The calamari fritti and spaghetti and meatballs are also delicious, the meatball is huge. 

I admit that Scaddabush is quite pricey but the food is great. The first time I came here, the server took my drink order but I guess he forgot, I never got my order and was not charged; that was kind of a disappointment as I was already halfway through my meal and did not want to bother.

The location is quite convenient as I was able to take the bus from Cooksville GO and get off right at the intersection (after work, from downtown); the parking lot also has tons of parking available.
