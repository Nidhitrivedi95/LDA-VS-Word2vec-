6PqYwabO2g1r2ZB7eImOiw Though there are several here in Vegas, this one seems to me, to be the best of them (and not just because its closest to my house). Dine in or take away, this Olive Garden always gets it right. They are accommodating to special / extra requests, and if it's not something outlandish you are asking for, they typically don't tack it on to the bill (I often as for extra sauce for the pasta dishes on the side). The staff that work here are very friendly, and to date, we haven't had a waiter / waitress who was lacking in their service abilities. Their menu has gone through some changes, but many of the classic dishes I've had throughout the years are still there, which I'm happy for, since those are the ones I really enjoy. I know many people don't think of it as "authentic", but my kids like it, and so do I! I enjoy ordering curbside pickup for those days when you want to watch that Redbox rental as you chow down, and they are pretty darn close on those pickup times, so you can grab it and go.
