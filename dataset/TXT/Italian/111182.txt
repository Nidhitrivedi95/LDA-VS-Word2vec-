g_x5lM7itVvWA9n34QVlFA Another five star service restaurant in Fountain Hills. I think people here are just very nice. We came here for weekday night quick dinner the other day, and I really had nice pleasant time dining here.

It wasn't crowded at all at dinner time, very small place, six or eight tables (can't remember exactly). You order at the counter first and they will bring your food.  Since it wasn't the full table service restaurant, I wasn't expecting much but the staff took our order came back to our table at least 4 or 5 times over the course of dinner to make sure we were doing well. He brought a big bottle of water, and when we finished a bottle, he came back with more.

Food was good, I liked the pizza I ordered. Garlic knots and marinara sauce was nice appetizer to have.  Pasta meat sauce wasn't what I expected but we ate all anyway.  It's so close to my house, I think I will add their number to my phone, so I can order pizza from them whenever I don't feel like cooking.
