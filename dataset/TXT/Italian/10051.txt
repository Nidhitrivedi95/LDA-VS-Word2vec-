0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg Good, real good.  Had the short rib risotto and crab, shrimp, lobster pasta.  The waiter said that the portions would be really small, European sizes, and he recommended to order a couple of things if you were hungry.

Well our group was hungry...

But after ordering the short rib risotto and seafood pasta dish, I was beyond stuffed.  I would have been completely satisfied with ordering just the seafood pasta.

Talk about overselling, but I don't think he meant to do that...who knows!

It's expensive, but Vegas in general is expensive.  If you're looking for a great meal but don't mind spending the $$$ then you should check this place out.  While their menu isn't extremely extensive I think it has a little something for everyone.
