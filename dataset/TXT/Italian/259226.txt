wJYFQrlx-uRmujWM_IDFtw Walked into this place while visiting for Spring Training.  It was open late (plus) and it was casual (plus, because I wasn't all kitted out like the rest of Scottsdale!).  Boyfriend was pleased by the beer prices.  I liked our Sante Fe pizza--  It was quite light for a deep dish.  It wasn't super oily or soaked in cheese.  However, it wasn't a pizza I would totally crave.  We also had the caprese salad which was ok but the sundried tomato dressing was really good.  Service was a little chilly, but the bartender seemed to be having a very good time!
