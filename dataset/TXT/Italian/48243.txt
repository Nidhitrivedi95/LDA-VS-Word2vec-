They were followed rather quickly by a very fresh house salad that had green olives, roasted red peppers and mixed greens. We had veal and chicken piccata which was a perfect pairing of tangy lemon, capers and cream over an artfully placed base of rapini, cherry  tomatoes, and artichoke hearts. The veal was the winner here as it worked best with the picatta flavors. The espresso was good and the deserts ample. The staff was very attentive. The only complaint was the pacing of our meal was a bit rushed. Nevertheless we will go back to try other menu items.
