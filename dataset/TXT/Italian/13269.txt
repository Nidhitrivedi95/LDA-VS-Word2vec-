15YuEFO59yXd7BTO5NZgYw My husband and his family have been going to Vito's since he was a kid. Just recently he decided to take our family here for dinner. The place is old, but very cute with a lot of character. We were seated fairly quickly, and the server promptly greeted us and got our drinks quickly. 

We had a party of 8, 4 adults and 4 kids. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer with marinara to dip in. It was a little greasy, but overall very tender and good. We eat a lot of calamari when we can get fresh squid, and this was up there. For dinner we ordered 2 large pizzas and my husband got the seafood lasagna. The kids got spaghetti and pepperoni pizza. 

I was impressed with the kids meals. The pasta was plentiful and a meatball was in a bowl of sauce on the side. It was fun for them to mix the sauce into the noodles. The kids pizza was dinner plate sized and filled up my 10 year old. 

Our pizzas were decent sized and ok. With all the hype I have heard about this place for the last 15 years, maybe my expectations were too high. It was good thin crust pizza, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't "to die for amazing" I like Oregano's about the same as this. My husband's seafood lasagna was very good. It had a lot of seafood in it with a tomato cream sauce. I was disappointed to see that there was no bread basket or anything, but again, it was good and something quite unique.

Overall for my this place was good, but really expensive! For the price, I was expecting a LOT more in flavor and originality. Will I go back? Probably. But we won't be back often and we will probably go without kids as a $60 plus dinner bill for 2 people seems about what we would pay.
