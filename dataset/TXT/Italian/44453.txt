8cdiFhBfCwRW1xiktRtV_g This restaurant was highly recommended to me by someone who's clearly never had good Italian food.  We came here with 6 other people, and after trying the food I was embarrassed to have made the plans to meet here.  Not authentic Italian food at all! Sauce is straight out of a jar and the waitress lied about it being homemade!  I've had better frozen pizza than theirs, pasta was overcooked, veal was like a piece of leather, also overcooked and overpriced.  I couldn't even eat most of it.
