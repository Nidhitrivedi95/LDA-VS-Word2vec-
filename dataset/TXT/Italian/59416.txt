AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw What happened? I remember coming to this place for the first time and it was filled to the brim. Food was excellent and service was spectacular. A highlight being the fried chicken skins. Well...not so much this time round. A very clear indication of our not-so-good time was an almost empty restaurant, odd seeing how it was a Friday night. The food was bland. Their current menu, lackluster. They removed a lot of great dishes, like the Ham hock, and replaced them with "I could get this anywhere else" dishes. Service was awful. The server was arguing with another co-worker. They ran through their supply of soda for the night, which we were comped for, the server ran through and poured what was left into our cups, letting us know all the while (we were not offered something else to drink). Our food came out at odd times and we were left alone, no check ups on refills or a "how is the food?."  We had ordered some other drinks when our server happen to walk our way....actually glad she forgot someof our order, considering how everything tasted. Hah, nothing could redeem Okra that night, not even the chicken skins.
