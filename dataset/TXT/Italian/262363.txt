wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg Work offsites can be hit or miss, especially when it comes to after-conference activities and food, but North Italia delivered on expectations. 

We had a group of about sixty (60) people attend, and there was never a moment where my wine glass was empty. However, when it came to the "serve yourself" salad and pizza during the middle of the gathering, there were moments where most had to wait for new pizzas to be made (I understand quality control), but once we waited, we ended up walking away with a single piece of pizza and one scoop of salad (little food, a ton of booze - you do the math.)

However, the staff themselves were incredibly friendly and personable, and service can make up for sub-par food delivery.

I will visit again, possibly on an actual dinner reservation.
