crFb3X-Kz0gLnoiSqg_dvg The food is in fact pretty good but the service and staff attitude are dreadful. We want with a buy one meal get one free. It was very evident that using a coupon makes you a second rate customer. Intentionally smaller portions were given compared to the table next to us. We asked for a few more dinner rolls only to find out when the bill arrived they charged us for each extra one! When I pointed this out to her she rudely replied "we can't give things away". I have never been to an Italian restaurant where bread or rolls are not included. If in fact they need to charge....fine but she should have at least mentioned that prior to bringing them. My husband ordered spaghetti with oil instead of red sauce and she arbitrarily charged $2 more for that as well. Needless to say we will not be going back. Evidently that is why there was only one other table there as well.
