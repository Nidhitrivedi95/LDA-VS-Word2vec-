9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Love this place. Have been there once for lunch & couple of times for dinner. The last time I went was for a friends birthday & although they take reservations, they will not seat you until the entire party has arrived. It was a Saturday night & they were jam packed. We did mention once we were seated that we had tickets for a comedy show & were on somewhat of a time crunch. They took note & were able to get our meal to us promptly. Most of us shared pizzas & they were excellent! Real mozzarella, tasty red sauce & fresh ingredients. One of the girls had the wood board mixture of meats, cheeses, veggies & fruits. It was such a huge plate that it could have fed the entire table of 9 as a nice appetizer. Drinks were good but as mentioned in a previous post, they should consider having another bar open on busy nights. We felt like we were crowding some of the folks who were eating at the bar while we tried to order drinks before we were seated. Overall great place!
