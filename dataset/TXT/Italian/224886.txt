sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg I've dined at the sienna emporia for a girls' night out.  I'm not so sure that it was a good environment for catching up with friends (crowded and noisy) but the concept and menu certainly were unique!  I loved that they offered a vegetarian meatball (which was delicious by the way) and the variety of sauce options was awesome because I'm not a big fan of marinara or traditional red sauces.  Will be returning!
