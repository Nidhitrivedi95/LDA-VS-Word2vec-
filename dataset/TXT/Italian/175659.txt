NFHlMOEyVsbqY_VQNJFafQ I found this place on Yelp and we decided to order a pick up one night and try it out. My husband went to pick it up and said he liked the atmosphere and would like to go and eat there if we like the food. I will say both of us loved our dishes!! Even left overs taste as good as they did the first time! We will return. I will say it's a little pricey but the dishes are big and delicious.
