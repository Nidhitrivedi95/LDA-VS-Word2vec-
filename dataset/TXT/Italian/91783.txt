Egd-0nDgzZGEVA0R09yyUQ love this place, we've never had a bad meal there. Every time we decide to try something new we always end up saying that we should have gone to the Italian Village. They will make special items, all you have to do is ask. I love their Carbonara that they have on special once in a while, wish they would put in on the menu so I wouldn't have to special order it.  Great service always also. The owners seem to always be there, not just standing around but working in the kitchen etc. very hands on. Keep up the good work!!
