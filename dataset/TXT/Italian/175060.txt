ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA EVER. The REAL deal! It took around 45 minutes to bake. This place was awesome! Great service. Great beers on draft. We had Lagunitas IPA and a Sam Adams winter lager. The overall vibe was super fun and very family friendly.  Garlic bread and marinara appetizer was delicious. Wish we had Oregano's back in Santa Fe!
