XJ2dT7pwmutxM4ceQnTVUg Food was disgusting the only reason we went there was that we bought a restaurant s.com voucher where you save like 20.00 dollar s so we decided to try it and we ordered a salad , dozen wings , large pepperoni pizza . The lettuce was old the tomatoes where mushy , the wings tasted like they've been sitting for a while , and finally the pizza was flavor less nothing on the pizza stuck out . But that is not the worst part nasty food aside THE STAFF DECIDED TO ADD THEMSELVES A 30% TIP never going there again
