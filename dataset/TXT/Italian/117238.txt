GXDRFAunLh0aRao6ERnM4A If only I had readthe reviews prior to eating here.  The night before Id eaten at a pizza place in the ny ny, in my quest to find that level of deliciousness once again I stopped by this place.  While eating it I noticed it didn't taste quite right.  Well, two hours later my body was making every attempt to rid it's self of this bacterial hayday.  I was throwing up for honestly 2 hours and after 5 hours the diarehia tapered off.  Unfortunately, I spent my entire last day in Las Vegas holed up in my room, never more than a few feet from a bathroom.  I will never return to this establishment and would recommend others steer clear unless you want to utilize their unadvertised weight loss program .
