We were seated at a table with a bench, which was perfect for my son. As we settled down and perused the menu, we waited for our server to take our drink orders. We waited, and waited, and waited. All this while, the servers were hanging out by the bar, sipping their drinks, not even glancing at the tables. We waited. I was looking at them, giving some sort of signal that we were ready to order. We waited some more. Finally, the maitre d' walked by our table, and we had to flag him down to ask him if there was a problem as no one has even approached us to offer water or take our drink order. Then we promptly got up and left. We sat at our table, without anybody approaching us, for 15 minutes. They were not busy. They just have bad service and an inept waitstaff. It's not that difficult to give good customer service.
