SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog Looked at reviews on Yelp & decided to stop in. We were promptly seated & were asked what we wanted to drink. After a quick browse through the menu, we settled on the Eggplant Parmesan, the Baked Rigattoni with chicken, & the Cheese Ravioli with the tomato cream sauce. All of these meals came with an antipasto salad and bread.

The food came came out in a pretty quick amount of time. Everything was good. The Eggplant Parm tastes a little bit off ... I think because it was slightly undercooked. The sauce it was covered in was pretty good, however. The Baked Rigattoni was kind of the same way - the garlic sauce with the chunky tomatoes tasted good but I was not impressed with the chicken. It was tasteless & could have been left off. Lastly, the Cheese Ravioli was good as was the tomato cream sauce, however it confused me as to why there was an additional cost associated with it.

As far as the restaurant itself - it is very much a family place & has that atmosphere. The decor is very outdated. I'm undecided as to whether or not I'll be back. It was good .. Just not exciting enough to go back. Not anytime soon anyway.
