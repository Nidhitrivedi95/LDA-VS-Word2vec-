Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA I love Postino, Windsor and Churn so this was next on my list to try. I had a coupon for a free entree/pasta so my mom and I gave it a shot. The atmosphere is very cute, modern and in a great location! 

We ordered:
Arancini - always a great appetizer, was perfectly fried and full of flavor
Meatball Pizza - everything was great, pizza was a little soggy and had to be eaten with fork/knife, but didn't bother us
Garganelli Pasta - perfect blend of ingredients and very light

There are many other items on the menu that I would like to try, so I will definitely be back!
