9QgxFnsLqB1CHCA0F2bGzg Whenever I crave a hearty plate of pasta, this is my go-to-place.   The pizza is good too, but maybe just a little too much on the doughy side for my personal taste.  Overall the food is very solid though, the atmosphere is comfortable and fun, and the waitresses are all super sweet.
