qKOFjSSUM4cftB0FTpL_7g My family and I are vacationing in Montreal, and we stopped by this place to get ice cream and coffee. First, we asked for samples of the ice cream, and the employee said she didn't have anymore of those small ice cream spoons. So we just ordered the traditional flavors of vanilla and chocolate. Then she gave us those small ice cream spoons, which she initially claimed were all gone. So after paying for our ice cream and coffees, we decide to sit at the patio. As we're eating I went back inside to ask for napkins, because we didn't have any (sounds logical), but she's starting to build up a slight attitude as if I'm asking for too much. But I just go back to the patio with the napkins. Then I decide to share some ice cream so I go back inside and ask for extra spoons. That's when she gives me a sigh without even trying to disguise it! So right then I decided I have to write a negative review of the place. Most horrible service I've received so far in Canada. Stay away and spend your American dollars at a more welcoming place. (You won't be missing out really because the taste is just ordinary).
