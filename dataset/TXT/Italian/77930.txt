cZO6RmJcqRY9jGbYY71z-A My large family (about 24 of us) went to 'My Mother's House' for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was such a treat!  I cannot say enough wonderful things about our experience- it is one we will all cherish for a long time.  A festive interior filled with Italian accoutrements and Christmas lights greeted us, along with a warm greeting from Chef Mike himself.  Wonderful servers kept our water glasses filled and our wine glasses fresh (with that nice Italian pour!) as we prepared for the FEAST!  A 7-course meal left us all so full yet it was so delicious none of us could stop eating.  Italian wedding soup, antipasto salad, amazing pastas, melt-in-your-mouth meatballs and Italian sausage... and then the traditional turkey and other Thanksgiving items...but let's not forget the delicious spumoni and to-die-for cannoli.  Wow.  I cannot wait to return to Vegas so I can enjoy another meal at My Mother's House, enjoy more delightful background piano music, hear tales from Chef Mike, and make this place part of our family's tradition.  We will be back!
