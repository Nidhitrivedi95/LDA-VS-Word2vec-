LOEZ8zDGly7s-laA1OBIEw Checked out this new place with freinds couples night out. Not bad looking spot for junction. Don't expect a huge place and too fancy.  We were disappointed there were not many choices on the menu for what we are use to in Italian dining.  Another surprise. Sides  were not included with your entree ended up costing everyone more and portions were small.  Many wine choices but hang on to your wallet.  Not sure we are going back.
