N_cCvYUP0dQeLKflgoUrXQ Love this pizza place it is so delicious! They have amazing pizza and wings. Every time I go in the people are very nice and the food is delicious. There is a bit of a wait but it is worth it. Sometimes they forget some stuff but a friendly reminder they always are quick get it. Wings are also a good deal 8 boneless wings for 5.60.The pizza is still cooked in a oven and comes out warm. I would come to this place every time I go to downtown phx. ALSO! They did change it to kinda a "pizza subway". You get a 10" pizza with unlimited toppings for 7.99 which is perfect size for a couple to share
