zYb4kj2R54R2YPeNm829BA Rating based on 2 delivery orders.. First time was totally a 1-2 star experience. Dry rubbery chicken, flavorless pasta... This 2nd time was great, 4-5 star even. Tried their 97.5 combo based on them being their popular items and figure if they're actually good then that could redeem my first bad experience. Chimichanga was a nice fusion item. I don't see how some consider it filling enough for 3 people.. Decent size for one person though. The pesto pasta was good, as good as anything my dad would make (half Italian). Only gave one meatball despite the description saying meatballs, it was good so was disappointed they only gave one. Wings were different.. Good but not what I was expecting.

As for service.. Both times the delivery has taken longer than expected (90 minutes turned into 110 min or so and we don't live that far). The box the pasta came in was plastic wrapped and smashed in, leaving sauce in-between the box and plastic wrap. Was able to open without a huge mess but still something they need to consider during deliveries. If I recall I had the same issue the first order as well. New to go containers for the pasta maybe or just try to keep the pasta boxes on top if possible...

Overall, I think I might try it again and hope anyone who had a bad experience does the same.
