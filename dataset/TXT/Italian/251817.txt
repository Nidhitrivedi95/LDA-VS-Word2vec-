vRH_EJYGpvSl9lxyPwdbfA I don't understand why people don't like this place other than attitude - what do you expect for a place trying to be a swanky hip place?  First time I ate there, a girlfriend and I walked in without a reservation.  After an eye-roll from the hostesses (all wearing an interesting 6" heel and mini skirt not really attired to service any food), they found us a small table giving us a 3 hour time window to finish.  I guess you better be prepared to expect people taking this restaurant and making it a "to be seen" night scene.  
The hostesses try to act a little snotty about reservations, but once you get over the initial scene, things only got better.

The waiter made up for the non-polite hostess.  Our waiter smiled the entire time and made sure to service our every need in a timely fashion.  He was so excited about the dishes, had tried a majority of them, and gave great advice.  I LOVED loved the gnocchi poutine - something unusual for a Montrealer having tried every fry variety of the dish.  The gnocchi oozed as if a crunchy ball of melty cheese instead of a dumpling.  And the sauce is not your average gravy.  Besides the appetizer, the other dishes were good too - nothing out of this world, but great tasting and satisfying.  And unlike a lot of places, the serving size was ample for most dinner plates and had great presentations.  I don't know if maybe there's variability in the service, but both times I ate there, I had a great time.  I would for sure go back there and hopefully you enjoy it just as much!
