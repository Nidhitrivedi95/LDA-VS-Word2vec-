DC3B2efrhw1c6c79BBgYjA I have to agree with first two reviews. I was not impressed with the food at all. Even the something as simple as the antipasto platter (which consisted of salumi, various types of cheeses and giardiniera) was mediocre. 

There are much better places to eat decent Italian food on College.
