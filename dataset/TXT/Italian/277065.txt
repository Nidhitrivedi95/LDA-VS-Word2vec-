YgTDjlEFRtLVVzg9G1bQbQ When I lived in Deer Valley we would go to Ralph's at least once a week. With Ralph, Ann and Betty you always felt like you were their best friends. The Sicilian was the best. The last time I was there was in 1983 the day before I moved to Rochester. I'll always have fond memories of Ralph's.
