-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw Maybe it was just us (M and I) that had an very off and weird visit.  They told us that it will be 15 mins for a table.  Then they came back in 5 mins and said a private area is open & will sit us there.  Ok, they sat us on the patio.  Cool.  The heaters were on and I was melting, so we moved to another table.  

We were enjoying view and noticed the table we moved to was not cleaned yet.  OK, it was not dirty, it just had a used cloth napkin in the corner of the table.  We placed our order and talked.  Then I noticed a feather in M's hair.  I was like where have you been?  I removed it out of her hair.  When the appetizer and salad show up, M was pooped on by a dove.  YIKES!  I heard it was good luck?  She moved to the chair across the table.  When she sat, I noticed a fold white item underneath her chair.  I was like OMG, it is a maxi pad.  Where the heck did that come from?  

Here is the low down on the food and service:
Appetizer:  Pepperoni & Sausage Pizzetta - YUMMY!!!
Main course:  Chicken Milanese - Was pretty good, but not GREAT...
Main course:  Whole Roasted Chicken (M's meal, but I had some) - Flavor was good, but the chicken is DRY!
Dessert:  Chocolate caramel something - It was ok.
Service:  It was ok too.
