Red checkered tablecloths, welcoming staff, baskets of warm bead with olive oil for dipping, and a menu filled with favorites. Even lighter-side options for delicious standards. Specials included a gluten free ravioli with fresh vegetable sauce that got rave reviews. As did the salmon salad.  Chicken Parmesan, chicken piccata, a rigatoni also were winners. Our small group Got lots of positive attention at lunch, since the place wasn't too busy mid-day, mid-week.  Fun for a celebratory family meal.
