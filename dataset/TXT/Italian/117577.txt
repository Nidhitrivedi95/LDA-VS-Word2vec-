gyDTYm_NDWXEHBPGnL-oRQ Worst experience at a Noodles and Company....ever. There was a line at the door only one cashier. We saw two managers neither choose to do anything about the super long line to get customers through the line. It looked like one was dealing with a previous complaint. That should of been our signal to leave but our son really wanted Noodles and we had already invested 10 minutes in line. When we finally got to order the cashier was neither nice nor super rude but very indifferent. You think maybe she could of been a little nicer considering how long people were waiting.

After we ordered we headed upstairs. Talk about a disaster. The place was a mess, napkins, straw wrappers pretty much everything but the kitchen sink was strewn on floor. The lights weren't even on! We tried to picked the least dirty table in the place. Then we headed to the bathroom that wasn't any better, one of the soap dispensers had no presence of soap whatsoever it didn't even have a container of empty soap in it. There was even a dirty shirt on the sink counter?? 

We then proceeded to get our sodas. Im not sure exactly how many soda options there are but at least out of 20 there were only 4 soda choices. I had to go downstairs to get our drinks. 

Finally got order, so from coming in the door to getting our food it took 35 minutes that doesn't sound fast-casual to me. The Tuscan fresca that I ordered was watery with very little feta on top. We wanted to take our son's left over food home but low and behold no to-go boxes. 

After reading many of the other recent reviews it looks like this place has gone downhill and we will never ever be returning to this location...like ever.
