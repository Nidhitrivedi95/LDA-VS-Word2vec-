6okGKL2PA7kkc-GjZzNHnA Service was great...bread was ok and the salad was good but I didn't like the fact I couldn't have my own salad and had to share with my table.  I ordered the Tiger prawn shrimp stuffed with crab cakes and I got 6 small shrimps with a spoonful of crab cake sitting on top.  The manager comes by and says how is everything...I said I don't like this and he says yea the crab cakes has a funny texture and walks away.  WTF??? How rude!! That was a waste of $25 and they don't have to worry about me ever coming back there when there are so many other restaurants in the area that are so much better than that place.  Way over priced!!!  Hope they get a new manager soon!!!  The current one is worthless
