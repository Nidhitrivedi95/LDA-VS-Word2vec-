Nqs4_gT6nKyeTOJ_rgu1mg I absolutely LOVE Frankie's Italian Cuisine!  Been going there for years, and the food is awesome!  The fantastic, aromatic pizza alone is a NE Ohio institution!  Without question, in the top 3 around these parts.  I'm a 'pizza snob' and conoisseur, having been spoiled by the great, world class 'mom and pop' run Italian restaurant pizzas in the NY/NJ area, when I lived there.  Frankie's pizza is 'to die for'!  I love their crispy iceberg lettuce house salad as well, with the sweet & sour dressing and shredded cheese.  I'm salivating like Pavlov's Dog, just thinking of the place!

My family will continue to dine there, as we support local, dedicated family owned and run businesses rather than national chains!  We have consistently had great service and great food from this North Olmsted landmark.  Thanks for listening.
