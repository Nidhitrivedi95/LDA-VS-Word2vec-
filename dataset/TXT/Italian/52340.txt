But with so many special events held there that means it has to be good right? WELL ITS ACTUALLY BETTER. 

Me and my boyfriend went there on a Tuesday night with reservations made the same day. When we got to the location in the heart I the distillery district, it was literally packed to the rim. 

This is what we ordered: 
Antipasti: costatine di bisonte
SO GOOD. The meat was really tender and the portions were more than I thought they were. 

Pasti: spaghetti alle vongole veraci
Essentially clams, cherry tomatoes, and parsley in spaghetti. I'm not a huge fan of spaghetti but this one is iight. Not one of the worst.

Main: bistecca di manzo all espresso
ie) beef striploin with a side of potatoes and a red wine/espresso reduction. The sauce was amaaaazing and the beef steak was perfectly tender. It's honestly excellent food and my photo doesn't do it justice. 

Our entire meal was tip top for Italian cuisine (but then again I'm not too experienced in that department). 

The servers were more attentive later on the evening when the restaurant started to clear up a bit. 

The atmosphere is beautiful. This is where you would take a date if you wanted to impress them and be all fancy shmancy. 
Personally, the prices are way over my wallet for an everyday thing, but it's a gem in the distillery.
