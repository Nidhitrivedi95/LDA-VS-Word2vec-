qrCWmo0o3On13ltqOdRgkw First time at this location, waiting for the new restaurant kinks to be worked out. I must say the place was spotless and the service was really great!  Pizza was very similar to the good stuff I've had at another location, fresh and very yummy!  Love the fresh basil, spinach, with olives and they are always very willing to cook it a little more for me because I like it crispy.  Welcome to Fairlawn, Pizza Fire!
