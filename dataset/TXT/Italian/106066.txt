fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I know some of you love this place, but I just don't understand I guess.

The food:
I had the Cha-chu. Bland, under seasoned, and deeply in need of some spice heat. The pork was over cooked in my opinion, lacked some of that wet savory I come to expect in my pork products. 

We shared the Miso Seasoned Eggplant. Really greasy, and the miso didn't do anything to mitigate the amount of grease we had in ours. The green pepper was way over cooked and turned to rubber.

I had the goyza as my date was a vegetarian. This is where they went from one start to two stars. These were damn good, but not enough to salvage the meal.

The Service:
We ordered takeout on a Saturday night. Maybe this was a mistake on our part. When they took our order, they told us "15 minutes." After 45 minutes we had our food in our hands after standing around like a couple of assholes with our thumbs up our butts for 30 additional minutes. I hate waiting because you cannot manage your product flow out of the kitchen. If its going to be 45 minutes, tell me that and I will gladly show up on time. However, having me stand around like that isn't going to work for me.

All and all, I know this place is the light burning bright for many of you, but like I said, I just don't see this place's potential. I'll stick to Rice Paper down on 7th St.
