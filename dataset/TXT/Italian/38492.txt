7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ Let's get this out of the way: La Grande Orange Pizzeria has delicious food. Their grilled wings are savory and their pizzas are incredible. They have a lot of vegan options as well. 

LGO also has an adjourning gelato shop on one side and a small store on the other. The gelato is amazing, as are their selections of cakes to go with the gelato. The store has some amazing desserts for take-away as well as wines, colas, and a number of kitschy little items. People-watching there is also grade-A. 

Now for the caveats. Parking is hellish, so watch out for peak restaurant hours. LGO is NOT a well-kept secret. Also, LGO is not for the enochlophobic; until seated, you will have to deal with a crowd. I have been there many times and have never seen it below nearly full capacity. The restaurant is not very big, so seating is crowded.  

The service is very good considering how terribly busy it is. If you haven't been to LGO, you must go. Brave the parking, brave the crowds... you WILL be rewarded!

OR (considering how much I love to eat there) stay away at all costs! Do NOT go there!
