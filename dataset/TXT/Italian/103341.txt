FmraE2CWt65VRnEqCAqNEg So disappointed!
We started with the wings, which came out with no seasoning! Just chicken, with ranch and blue cheese which we could not tell the difference between. No good :(

I ordered the chop salad. The salad was completely tasteless! $12 and it tasted like wet lettuce. I think there were a couple pieces of chicken at the bottom, but I had to dig.  When I mentioned it to the waiter, he said he had never tried it, but hopefully I would like it better next time. I informed him there will never be a next time and he ignored it and handed us the bill. 

We also had a manager stop over and ask us about our meal, but even with our honest reply, she didn't seem too concerned that we weren't happy.

It is now obvious to me that with this food and service, the only reason they are still in business is because they get overflow from patrons who don't want to wait at blue32. I will never be back there myself!
