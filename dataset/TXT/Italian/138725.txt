jcasci3gjbsSuTEVzvDQKg One of our favorite Italian restaurants. We love the penne ala vodka with chicken and shrimp and the bruschetta is the best I have ever had. Their tomatoes are so fresh. We also love their garlic rolls that are complimentary. It's hard to stop eating them...lol. Prices are reasonable considering the portion sizes. Two people can eat off one entree.
