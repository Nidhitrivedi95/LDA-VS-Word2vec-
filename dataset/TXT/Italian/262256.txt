wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg So this is my current Sunday All day Happy Hour JAM!

This place is SO GOOD and I'm not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts.

The Chefs Pizza of the day hasn't let me down yet... We don't even ask we just order it!  The Chefs Board is pretty good too! My fav dish right now is the Broccolini - super simple but it's just so light / fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini & Meatballs if your their for happy hour. 

Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff. The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case. 

The parking / Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says "Complimentary" not Mandatory - park your car yourself if you want.
