uwT7CppiYkek-Z-661sndQ Great neighbourhood gem with awesome pizza and fantastic service. 

We stopped by for lunch the day before my wedding and were promptly seated. I explained the the waiter that we were in a bit of a time crunch and she said that was no problem. The Pizza came out very quickly and was perfectly cooked. Wonderfully delicious cheese and fresh toppings. I'd certainly go back here again.
