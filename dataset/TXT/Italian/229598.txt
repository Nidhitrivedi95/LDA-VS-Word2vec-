T7yKffTuhiIZclsgjfgowA Went to Via Mercanti on a Saturday evening.... The place was busy and almost full....The Marinara pizza was okay. The Linguine Allo Scoglio was good but the portion was disappointingly small for the price. Good Creme brulee and Strawberry sorbet. Good service and this place as its own charm....
