We went on Sunday around noon and got seated right away. we started with the orzo meatballs which were pretty good and then I had the lemon pesto grilled cheese. My cousin had the baked pasta of the day. We both enjoyed our meals but we definitely weren't as impressed as one would think for a celebrity chef restaurant. 

However the ambiance was very open and pretty with good views and the wait staff was superb so all in all, a good lunch visit.
