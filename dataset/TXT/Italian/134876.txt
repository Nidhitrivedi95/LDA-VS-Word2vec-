IsN0qEzgAXBjbT3qn6lokA My friend suggested we try this new pizza place in the Hilton Shopping Center on Scottsdale Rd. for our regular Sunday night dinner.  I love trying new restaurants, and so off we went.  Upon entering, we saw a cute restaurant with a great indoor/outdoor bar, plenty of outdoor seating and inside tables with comfortable chairs.

The appetizers (green beans with mustard and crispy french fries) were delicious, the chopped salad was refreshing, but nothing to write home about, and we ordered three pizzas (margharita, pepperoni, and shrimp)  All were yummy, toppings were good, dough was great, but I felt like they skimped a little with the toppings.  The crust was very wide and so I felt like half the pizza was more like a bread stick.

I would go back again, but maybe only for happy hour (half price wines and beers, maybe some appetizers) but felt for the dinner price, the pizza didn't live up to my desires.
