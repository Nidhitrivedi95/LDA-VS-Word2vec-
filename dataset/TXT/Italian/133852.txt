iPxDmZVbssspPtUEBnUyQw Thoroughly surprised at how good their pizza was for a Dominos!  I received a free pizza coupon in the mail.  First of all, I was completely shocked by this--a free pizza! No catch?  No catch at all!  It was a free large pizza with ANY AMOUNT OF TOPPINGS!  I asked that they make the pizza with extra sauce, extra cheese and extra well done.  I also opted for the garlic crust.  I was extremely surprised at how good the pizza was and how tasty the garlic crust topping was as well.  However, if I had to pay retail price for the pizza, not sure I would go back to Dominos.  I'm not sure if it just tasted better because it was free!! If I get another coupon, I'll go back.
