yGd87bkFijZ6YHrHtW5maA Out of all the Thai places in Vegas, it is hard to find one that makes pad Thai excellent every time. This place is always on point. On top of that Kim made my experience there one to remember. She got the order correct and out fast. She also managed to fill my every need and not once did my cup of water get low. Thank you for the experience and count me in for another visit.  Only place I order pad Thai for now on. Wish this place many more years to come.
