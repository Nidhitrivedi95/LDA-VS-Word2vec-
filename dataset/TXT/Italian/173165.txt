N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg Gotta hand it to em' best pizza out there! My fiancé and I love food & of course pizza and this was outstanding! It's easily in our top 5 and we travel often! Went on a Sunday evening and it was still very busy, we tried the trio of the dips with pizza chips & it was amazing! We haven't ever had anything quite like it! We shared a small pepperoni & sausage (love there sausage!) deep dish with butter crust and man was that delicious! We drove all the way from downtown chandler and can't wait to go back again!
