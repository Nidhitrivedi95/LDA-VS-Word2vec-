xD7cl0fmr_nPbuCOro_vYA Great little gem. Seem's like a mom and pop shop so it's very welcoming. 

The food portions are great for the price so if you're looking to a split meal, this is the place to go.

I ordered a Penne Veal dinner. Enough for two since it was a whole plate for the pasta and another plate for the veal plus bread. All this for under 18$ 

Great spot, would recommend and I will be returning
