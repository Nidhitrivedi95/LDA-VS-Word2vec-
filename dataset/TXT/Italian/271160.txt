XQ0RIDqgnkXueL6y1CY3Cg This used to be a good pizza shop . In the last few years I've done something i never thought I would do and that is THROW OUT pizza.  Always from this store.

Today I returned a pizza because the crust was really bad - or it could have been the oil used on the crust because the taste was strongly rancid.  We partially ate only 2 pieces of the large pizza and then I drove all the way back to return it. 

This is the 2nd time I've had rancis crust there . Last time I was told the refrigeration system had been "off" for a while.

And GUESS what?  I paid $10 for the pizza and they do not refund - they give store credit only!  Which means, Pizza Hut got my $10, and they will "repay" me with a pizza that costs them a buck or two to make.  What a rip off.
