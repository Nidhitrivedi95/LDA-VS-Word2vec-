sKrt4CMGyG8YAjxVkk4hPQ Get here before lunch during the week cause Fusaros gets PACKED! It's a popular spot and rightly so - the food is superb. If you've got a hankering fo some good old fashioned Italian food, this is the place to go!

Their pasta is absolutely delicious and I've had several different ones and never been disappointed.  My favorite has to be the rigatoni, with spinach chicken and tomato sauce  - and it comes with bread. They also have a selection of paninis, which are filled with a delicious variety of Italian meats and cheese. They also have a salads to order, daily made pizzas and Italian favourites like veal parmigiana and spaghetti and meatballs. 

Beware, seating in here in sparse so make sure you get it to go if you can!
