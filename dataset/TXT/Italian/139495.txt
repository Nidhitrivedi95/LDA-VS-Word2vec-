jG1jcAeDw0pZTHCNC5kw_w Worst service I have received in a long time.  We were a party of four.  After waiting 20 minutes to order, we were told that we were given the lunch menu but that they would let us order anyway.  Then our server switched, but failed to tell the new server our order.  Once he put it in, another 20 minutes later, we were told we could have a sandwich and we need to order something else.  They also didn't have any white sangria left and told us they were too busy to make more.  Don't waste your time.  Grimaldi's up the street has better food and service.
