G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I didn't know what to expect going to Giada.  I'm a fan of her show however there are mixed reviews about this restaurant.  I give Giada 3.5 but rounded up to 4

Preface: I came with a party of 9 and a baby

//Food//
Amazing! Everything was pretty tasty.  We ordered an large appetizer to share.  I'm not exactly sure which one it was but it included what I believe was Giada's "favorites" like Crostini, bacon wrapped dates, wood roasted mushrooms, eggplant, olives, etc.

Favorites: 28 oz bone-in ribeye.  Holy moly was it huge.  The sunny side egg just made it even better.  My husband thought it was a bit salty and his was overdone which is why I took 1 star off.  He didn't send it back because service was SLOW...he was starving so he gave in and ate it the way it came.
Pappardelle - it was perfect.  Pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was flavorful.  I also had our server add a bunch of parmesan cheese on top.  It was amazing.
I forgot what it was called but we had a hazelnut chocolate tart for dessert to share.  It just hit the spot.  Everyone had a couple bites and it satisfied our sweet tooth.  

Risotto was good but I generally don't like risotto and my cousin liked her lobster ravioli which I didn't taste.

//Service//
SLOW.  I loved our server Joseph.  He was great however food came out extremely slow.  I was also disappointed that they didn't offer any birthday desserts.  When you spend that much money, it's a shame you can't provide them with at least a cake and candle on the house.  

//Highlights//
There's a Photo Booth in the waiting area and you can have them emailed to you.  The printing option wasn't available when we went.
