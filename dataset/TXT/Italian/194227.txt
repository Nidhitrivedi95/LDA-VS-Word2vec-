PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ This is really a great place! Vegas has lots of places to eat, but this is one you can't afford to miss! The food was absolutely awesome in every way. Far better than any celebrity chef chain restaurant on the strip. It had a very laid back atmosphere where you felt like you belonged. The staff was attentive and very friendly, even the owner came out to talk to us for a bit (great guy). By far this place is one of the hidden gems of Las Vegas. So if you want the true Vegas experience get Off The Strip!
