mDiFWhywAziq9SKnj6am_Q This place used to be "Our Gang".  Not much has changed.  I still adore their outdoor "garden" area which makes me nostalgic for Little Italy.  The bread comes out hot and fresh, you can dip it in a nice pesto.  The salad caprese is standard, nothing mind blowing,  The chicken parmagiano will hit the spot if that is what you are craving.  I will say that the pizza "4 ways" is good, but not terrific.  Everything seemed to need a little salt, or some red pepper or some kick.  However, this is a great little neighborhood place for when you want to go out for Italian but don't want something super fancy.
