ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw Our family loves oreganos! Their salads are sooo good and the pizza is to die for! My 2 favorite go to's are: 

Alfredo the Dark pasta with chicken - Creamy and spicy alfredo sauce with big curly noodles, and a nice fire roasted chili on top. 

Thin crust cheese pizza - Add some freshly grated parm and the red chili oil from the condiment tray on the table... so simple, but damn is it amazing! 

But the most amazing thing ON THIS PLANET is the pizzookie.. when you get that first bite of warm gooey cookies, and cold creamy ice cream, you will think you died and gone to heaven. And it's free on your birthday!!!

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is hit or miss with the services. 1/2 the time the waiter/waitress is amazing and totally on their game. The other 1/2 of the time we would wait 30 minute for our check, 20 minutes for refills, ask repeatedly for condiments or utesils. But being right across the street from ASU i bet the turn around there is crazy. And the parking lot it tiny, there have been a few times we circled and circled for 10 minutes and never found a spot and were forced to eat somewhere else.

All in all, amazing food at decent prices :) Highly recommend for families or friendly get togethers.
