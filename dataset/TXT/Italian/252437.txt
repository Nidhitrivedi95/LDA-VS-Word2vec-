VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w We made same day reservations and were seated immediately when we arrived. Our seats were sooo close to the other table I felt as though we were being listened to and there was zero sense of a romantic evening in our future.  
We sat down and our waiter soon came, very nice guy (forgot his name) ordered our drinks and then took our orders. We started with the polenta fries and the complimentary garlic bread. I loved both but hubby didn't care for the polenta fries, he's super picky. Then on to our dinner, my hubby ordered the chicken parm and said it was just meh. For $28 it should have been wow! I however loved my dinner! I ordered the spicy pasta with clams, scallops, huge shrimp and mussels. It was spicy but I loved that! Oh and the scallops were sooo tiny but there was so much other yimmyness in my bowl I didn't even care! Overall, this place was nice but we won't probably be back. For $200 for a nice dinner out we should have been wow'd and there was zero wow factor for us! Way to many amazing places in Vegas
