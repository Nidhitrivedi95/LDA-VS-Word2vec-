-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q Since this restaurant was on Diners, Dives, and Drive Ins (Food Network show), a friend and I decided to eat here. We started with the fried calamari, which wasn't too bad. I've had worse in Austin, TX. The fried calamari's consistency of the batter was just right, but could've used less salt. 

I ordered the frutti di mare with white sauce ($16), and it was okay. There were 6 mussels, about 4 plump shrimp, and lots of shelled clams. It was too salty though, so I stopped eating once I finished the pasta. The dish was unbalanced in my opinion. I had plenty of seafood while my friend (who ordered the same thing) had plenty of pasta. I ended up giving him some of my seafood. I've definitely had better in Portland, OR, which is why I give two stars (Meh. I've experienced better).

You may wonder why I didn't order pizza, the highlight of the restaurant. I knew we would end up ordering pizza later, post game (was in town for US-Mexico soccer match this past week). So, I didn't want to have two meals in a row with pizza. Maybe I should have anyway, but oh well.

The restaurant doesn't have root beer, FYI. Service was not good. It took the waitress about 10 minutes just to bring water after being seated, and it took another 10 minutes to get the check. My stomach was upset shortly after eating the seafood pasta. So, I won't be back!
