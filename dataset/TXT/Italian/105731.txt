fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg We met some of my wifes co-workers after work here. I just kept dishing out Ramen jokes all day since I wasnt too much of a fan on this is where we would be going.

After getting there my attitude quickly changed. They have a very wide assortment of dishes rather than noodles. Everyone but me got the yaki soba noodles with chicken. I tried something else, but dont remember what it was called. It was basically shrimp tempura in rice with some kind of sweet honey type of sauce over it. It was pretty tasty. I also got a rainbow sushi roll that took a very long time for them to prepare. It came after we were all done eating. It was good, and the price for it was decent. The only complaint I had was that the fish was sliced to thick. It was a little on the chewy side.

Our waitress was kind of hit and miss, but she was a delight when she showed up. I would visit it again and definately skip the ramen jokes the next time!
