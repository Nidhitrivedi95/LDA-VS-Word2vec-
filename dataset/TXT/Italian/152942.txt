KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg The first time I came here I was pretty excited to have some good pizza. I came with a bunch of friends and we all decided that we would order different things and share. Well, that was all good in theory.

Once the pizzas came the ones that had the "good" pizzas never wanted to share and I got stuck with the super mushroom one that tasted like feet. I did try another one, it was the ricotta pizza, and I was hooked, I was already planning my second trip there.

Upon my second visit, I was determined, I didn't even look at the menu and told the waiter I wanted the ricotta pizza, he then went on to inform me that they had run out of the ricotta pizza! NOOO! What was a girl to doooo???!!! I stared intensely at those that ordered my pizza but did not finish. Grrr! I decided to order the second safe pizza and one of my favourites, the margherita (basically the same pizza minus the ricotta). And I wasn't disappointed. 

The crust was perfect and it was just delicious. It wasn't too soggy where the pizza fell flat when lifted it but you did need to get a little dirty with this pizza. I find that the ones with heavy toppings never stay together, so for this type of crust, you have to have a light pizza like the margherita. 

The wait time is a little ridiculous because it is first come first serve and the tables are cramped together in which you can have an accidental arm graze with your neighbour or even leg graze. But they are good in that they will take your phone number down and call you when your table was ready so that you wouldn't cramp up their small little waiting area.

The wait staff is friendly and extremely casual, there doesn't seem to be a set dress code which can confuse me at times since they all dress like hipsters as do the patrons. Many a time I have almost flagged down a patron to check on my order. Oopsies, but I would definitely come back and I will definitely order the coveted ricotta pizza.
