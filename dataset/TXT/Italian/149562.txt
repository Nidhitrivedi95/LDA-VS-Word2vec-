We ordered just a pepperoni pizza and an order of the Zeppolis (which I highly recommend... such a simple yet delicious dessert!)   The pizza was just as good heated up in the oven the next day.  My next trip I ordered pizza and the cheesy bread... again was not disappointed at all.  It's only been 2 weeks since my first trip and I've already been 3 times since then... LOVE IT!
