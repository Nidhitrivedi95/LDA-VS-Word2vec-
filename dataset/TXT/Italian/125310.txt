Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A I was in Arizona for my 40th birthday and found this nice restaurant tucked back from the road. It had beautiful aumbiance so we decided to take the family in for a nice celebratory dinner. We walked in and were overlooked about 4 times before being welcomed. The waiter was neither kind nor rude, just doing his job. We ordered a lovely dinner and wine. About half way through my birthday meal I found a hair in my food. I lost my appetite! I can't eat another bite if I find a hair. I told the waiter and he did nothing except charge me the full price for my dinner. A gentleman behind me was also celebrating his birthday and was given a cake with a candle, we weren't offered anything despite our server asking if it was my birthday when he saw the cards. The food was very tasty but the service was well below expectations especially when we are spending over $100 for 2 kids and 2 adults. Unfortunately, I won't be returning.
