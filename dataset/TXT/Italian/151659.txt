KPKQLzVKqLgEPKOWrSCRtg Fabulous dinner for my 2nd trip to monroeville! My server Dana was very quick, attentive and helpful. Loved the tiger shrimp, polenta, red pepper, feta and northern bean entree. Nice sized portions. Bread comes with dinner, if you like. Raviola special at the last visit was delicious as well. Blizzard cappuccino for dessert with fresh whipped cream, yum ;-) nice atmosphere, very popular place, perfect tag team service, not intrusive. Old style 50sish music, romantic darkish lighting, comfortable booths where i sat. A candle on the tables would be my only request, otherwise perfect! Check it out if you're in the area!
