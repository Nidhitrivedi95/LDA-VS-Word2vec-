5gl2GLgimBz1-Q-uXji_Rw Please avoid this place. Had bad experiences after the other. The last straw was when I asked a Philly cheesesteak ONLY with American cheese & oil and vinegar 

I Received a Philly cheesesteak with mushrooms and green peppers. I told the manager I didn't request this , he said its my fault, stuff already comes on the cheesesteak REGARDLESS of what I requested (American cheese & oil & vinegar) I was shocked. No apology or anything. Walked about with no refund or no sandwich. This restaurant sucks people if you want real Italian food in Charlotte go to Joe Mammas, it's on south tryon but further down. I'm from NY and these guys would be outta business if they pulled something off like that there!
