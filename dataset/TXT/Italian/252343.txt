VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w I was there because the bouncer from Tao gave me & my girls VIP tickets with complementary drinks so it's like why not, lets go check it out. The place is pretty small, & crowded, The crowd mostly 30+ we were there for less than an hour and left. I just wasn't having fun there. =(
