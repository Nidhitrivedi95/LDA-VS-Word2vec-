q-FFEFn4gHlM3kv2BLuYkg A legend in the Ashland area. Giovanni's is one if first places former area residents eat at once 'home'. It's greasy. It's a bit messy. It's the best pizza around. Various Giovanni's are available around, but IMO this one located on Diederich, in Russell offers the best services and buffet. I love pizza. I can eat tons & tons of it from various other pizza joints. Nonetheless, Giovanni's tops the list.
