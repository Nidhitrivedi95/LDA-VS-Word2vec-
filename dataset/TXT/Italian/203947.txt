Q9jOi1245KEyb-vehMUeFA We ate here in September 2014 for a late lunch on a Sunday.  We were greeted and seated in a timely manner. I ordered the Lasagna and it was huge. The meal came with salad and garlic bread. The Lasagna was delicious.  My guy had the Chicken Marsala and he said it was very good.  We took half our meal home and the price is good for the portions.
