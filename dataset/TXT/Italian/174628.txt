nDKcQkh8vZkY_u1kyww44g I kept meaning to try the one in Santa Monica, but since we were in Vegas thought it be a good idea to check this place off my list.  For a Fri. night without reservations, we only had to wait about 15 mins.  That was the highlight.  Service was attentive enough, but it didn't make up for the food.  The mushroom pizza as an appetizer was very average.  The seafood linguine, however, as my main course was sub-par.  Bland, with chewy bits of seafood.  The pasta even tasted cold.  This place is way over-priced and over-hyped.
