UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w Great little find here.  Almost a year old - if you are looking for a Chicago style pizza (Chicago thin), Chicago dogs with fries and Italian beef - some of the best comfort foods in the city.

The owner and staff are from the Windy City - so if you are from Illinois like myself....stop by and check them out.  Great food and friendly neighborhood eatery.

I will be back to try some of the Italian food and some pizza pie.
