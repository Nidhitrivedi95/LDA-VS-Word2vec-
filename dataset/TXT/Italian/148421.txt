KEyjG-6G4Dbo3p1Wmnxs4Q Came here for Winterlicious with some girlfriends and had a good time! The place is quite small but super cute with nice decor and a great ambience. I really liked the service- our server was super nice, attentive and gave us really good advice on what to order.

The food was alright- the portions were quite large but didn't taste that great. I had the minestrone and tiramisu which were pretty good. For my main, I had the risotto de marre and it was okay. I found it quite bland and not very flavourful. 

Overall, not a bad place to visit but if you're looking for good pasta/risotto, I wouldn't recommend it.
