VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w You can't deny the likability of an honest man running a little Italian restaurant.  The 7-9 tables that make up this great neighborhood find, the attentive service by the service staff who was also helping cook in the kitchen, and the unexpected quality food that came out were 3 key ingredients that make this a 5-Star Find!  

Even though the name of this place suggests ordering pizza, I didn't actually get to taste the pizza. :(...but I saw it and it looked amazing! Next time. 

What I did find was MY NEW FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT GNOCCHI!!!
  I ordered the Gnocchi alla Sorrentina and it was fantastico!  The only way to describe this dish (which on this night came with a vodka sauce instead of their usual tomato sauce i guess) was a plate full of little fluffy pillows of deliciousness!!!  It was a great dish that I will be coming back for.  

Thank you Pizza A Metro for a great dinner...and Victor, don't be afraid to expand...a few extra tables might be a nice move for you.
