oryS4vX0xkKC4tOekgowDQ Day after Christmas 2015 went in for dinner at 4:00 pm.  One large party before us and we're told the wait would be 5 to 10 minutes.  The place was NOT BUSY!  No problem.! We were seated right inside where all servers and management personnel could see us. We sat at the table for 10 minutes  while several employees walked past our table.  NOT ONE PERSON, NOT ONE, stopped to say anything!  No one said, "your server will be right with you or may I get you something to drink?"  NOTHING!!!!  

We walked out and when we told them their service was less than desirable, the hostess in her best "valley girl voice" said, "thank you!"  We Love The Spaghetti Factory but this one NOT SO MUCH!  We won't be returning or recommending this joint to anyone! 10 THUMBS DOWN!!!! You get better service at any fast food restaurant!
