qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA We were looking for an Italian restaurant to eat dinner before the Human Nature show in the Venetian Hotel and reading the reviews and having two people I knew who ate here before, sealed the deal and I made reservations for 5:15 pm.  The place is alittle hard to find, but it is located near the food court.  

Our server was friendly and attentive and when we first got there, it wasn't busy but by the time we finished dinner, the place was packed!  Luckily, dude found a Tix 4 Tonight booth that had 50% off entrees and pastas at Trattoria Reggiano.  These tickets cost $3 a person and can only be used Monday to Thursday from 11 am to 10 pm.  Menu prices are high for a hotel restaurant.  We started with the delicious garlic knots, then shared a kale peanut salad (crunchy and tasty), veal milanese (light and crispy light batter with arugula sprinkled on top) and lobster ravioli!  I liked the veal milanese more than the lobster ravioli although they were both pretty good.  And I think because I told the server that we had a 7 pm show, the food came out pretty quickly!  

Had a very enjoyable dinner!
