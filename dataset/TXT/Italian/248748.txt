VfxlkvZQkLr9tu_w1SU_iw I'll make this short and sweet.  We ordered at 8:33 pm and received the cold pizza at 10:30 pm.  We called to complain and the excuse was he didn't put the order in right away.  I guess they don't realize that email confirmation from their company are sent out.  He did offer to make another pizza but why even take a chance at another 2 hour wait.  I wish I had read the reviews before I ordered.  They really should work on their customer service.  I would seriously be embarrassed to even deliver a cold pizza.
