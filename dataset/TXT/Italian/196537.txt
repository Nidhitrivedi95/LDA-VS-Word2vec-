pOEL97ld-FJMKO8Ki8JmYg Ate here with fellow classmate Amy K (a Yelp Elite who got me into Yelping) as an end of the year celebration.

We ordered the fish tacos and spinach/artichoke dip for appetizers. Fish tacos were okay, dip was pretty standard.

I had the chef's special for main, a veal tenderloin wrapped in proscuttio served with gnocchi. The veal was pretty dry and the herbs they used made it kind of bitter. The gnocchi was alright.

Tbh, I think this place is a bit pricey for some of the types of food they serve. Amy had a super cheesy mac and cheese that should not cost more than $10...
