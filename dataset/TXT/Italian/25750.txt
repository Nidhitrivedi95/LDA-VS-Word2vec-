4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg We spent 5 days in Vegas and ate here twice; and we weren't even guests of the Wynn!  Between the two visits, we sampled quite the spread... Let me just say that the bread and garlic spread they bring out at the beginning of the meal are TO DIE FOR!  For all of you carb-concious ladies out there... SUCK IT UP AND EAT THE BREAD; you will regret it if you don't.

Margherita Pizza = large, super thin, amazing
Calamari = not very big of a portion, great dipping sauce, standard breading
Caesar Salad = big, great for sharing, mild in the garlic department
Seafood Risotto = not as good as you would think, tomato sauce base, not creamy, strong seafood flavour (on the tasting menu but don't let that fool you), expensive.

The atmosphere, service, and prosecco we all awesome; the hostess team is really friendly and fun to talk to.  Don't go in wearing sweatpants, but not over-the top fancy either.

Bread and pizza. Enough said.
