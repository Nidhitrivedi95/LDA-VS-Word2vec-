Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA We love Federal Pizza as well as all of the other Upward Projects restaurants. We have been coming to them since we moved three years ago and have never had a bad experience. We tried the wedge salad tonight.... delicious and the manifesto pizza. That is our go to favorite. I also love the $5 before 5 pm wine coolers. I am sure they are all good but the blueberry hibiscus is delicious. I have never tried another one. I love sitting on the dog friendly patio and seeing the dogs. The service tonight was excellent.
