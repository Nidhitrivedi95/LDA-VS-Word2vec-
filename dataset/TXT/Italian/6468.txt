0ajTatYvxoFd7-C22r6L4w I ordered a wide selection, as I usually do when trying a place for the first time. The gyro was good. The fried shrimp was ok. The fried mushrooms had a very unpleasant taste, I won't be ordering those again. The chicken tenders were good. The pizza was excellent. Garlic bread was very buttery and garlicky lol.
