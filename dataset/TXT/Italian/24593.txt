4EfiNcKSsafogIhAjwv0gg This used to be Mama Luigi's Pizza place.  I used to come here often back then.  Tried their pizza.  It was bland. I expected some tangy spicy tomato sauce and adding the peppers didn't help either. I also ordered HOT chicken wings.  The wings not so hot.  It was more of a mild taste.  When I say HOT, I want my lips to be burning.  I don't think I'll be back here.
