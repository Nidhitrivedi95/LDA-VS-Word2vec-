The food was simple and delicious, warm bread with garlic butter, meat ravioli with red sauce and some lovely veal parm.  I was a fan of the portion sizes since I'll eat what is in front of me despite fullness at times.  The smell of the kitchen was a wonderful compliment to the meal and the wait staff was gracious and cheerful.  
For the sizes of the meals it felt a little expensive, but everything tasted freshly made with vibrant flavors so I forgave the price a little.
