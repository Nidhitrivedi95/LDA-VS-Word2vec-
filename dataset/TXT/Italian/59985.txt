Ava9H-t4scVmP7u_onh7pg 5 years ago, we would have given this place 5 stars.  Now, it's a shame that we can only give it 2.
First of all, we will never dine in the main dining area again because it smells like dirty wash rags!!  It has been this way for several years now. We mentioned this twice to our servers over the past year, but it still smells bad.  We were so embarrassed that we went against our better judgement and ignored the smell and brought some friends from out of town.  Our one friend, who speaks his mind, pointed out the smell after only 5 minutes!!!  We were so embarrassed!
We moved to the bar area, and no problem there.
From that day on, we never dined in the dining area again!!  We really liked this place and continued to go, but only sat in the bar.  No issues, until the last several months.  The food has gone downhill.  Every dish tasted like they seasoned it with salt!  No taste, just salty. Awful.  And, when we ordered wine at the bar, they were basically out of everything we requested.  Gave us a sip of what was left in a bottle, then walked away and never offered to let us taste anything else or even ask if we wanted anything else!!  The other night, we were the only ones at the bar, there were 2 bartenders and we sat for 10 minutes without a glance our way!!!  It was weird and unacceptable!!  
We sooo use to enjoy the food and service here, but wow, it sure has declined.  We were going to host a Valentine's dinner in the room with the fireplace, but after our experience last week, we decided it was not going to happen.  So disappointed with this place as of late.  Don't think we will be back.  Food, wine selection and service has declined rapidly.  Too bad.
