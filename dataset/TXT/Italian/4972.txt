_myTPlWa8QRN5eavs-hNPg I had the Cioppino special and it was delicious! Tender mussels, clams, calamari, flavorful scallops, shrimp and salmon chunks in a savory tomato based broth - the presentation looked as wonderful as it tasted. By far my favorite dish as Pacino's. The linguine was the perfect al dente and the fresh basil was a very tasty touch. As close to San Francisco or Boston style while in the desert.  Not to be left out - but I forgot to take a picture of it, I don't know why :D Hubby's Whitestone pizza with arugula kept him pretty quite until the pie was almost gone :)  We're lucky to live nearby and with food like this we'll keep coming back.
