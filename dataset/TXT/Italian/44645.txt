8cQc0BRbkSDSkLn6oFw3mw In my opinion Nick's diner II is the best breakfast place in the whole Surprise area.  I've tried many others and Nick's always comes out on top.  The server's are friendly, the food comes out super quick (and always hot).  Always consistently great food.  It is definitely my "go to" diner!
