SsR3VcY5HYhn_R5pXgx-MA Figaros is great! We no longer order from the big chains because Figaros is not only delicious, but they are super friendly and quick. When they arrive, they are like old friends. We love their crust, cheese, and toppings. Their extra large specialty meat pizza is our favorite. If you're in the Indian Land/Fort Mill area, you have to give Figaros a call. They always have specials and coupons, so look those up as well.
