The scones and sandwiches are my favorite part. In particular, the cucumber sandwiches. The desserts are very good also just not my personal favorite. They also had them decorated for Easter. The tea itself is also very good, medium selection. If you like sweet teas I would recommend the mountain berry. And if you like green tea I would recommend the jasmine blossom tea. The staff are very nice and attentive. I would rate the experience a 10/10.
