fSYdQCfFF5zsOapeUcY25A Me and boyfriend walk into Piada tonight. it was our first time there. Not really knowing how to order. We look out of place. With customers walking in behind us, we let them cut in front of us.  Customers were really nice helping us on how to order and what to order.  So we move to the back of the line with our order in mind.  The customer we were behind was a former employee and apparently dating the chef. She was very helpful.   She must of told the chef it was our first time. He was very informative on what sauces and toppings to add to our pasta.   As long as we been going out to eat I've never had anything like that happen. We were very grateful and appreciate.  So about the food. It was very filling and so delicious. I order the the meatball and crispy chicken. There a as so much, I have lunch for tomorrow and possibly dinner. lol My bf had the calamari which he smash when he got home. I don't know if he taste it, but he said it was very good. In all I would definitely recommend Piada to anyone who likes Italian food.  The staff was very helpful also.Thank you to the chef again.
