7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw Fox Restaurants can do no wrong and North is another great argument for that. I've actually only ever been to the bar section, but I love the atmosphere and they serve the full menu, so why stray? The menu changes to keep up with the seasons, but all of their simple Italian dishes are consistently good and fortunately they always keep their zucca chips on! Comfortable seating on the patio, which faces the middle of the Kierland courtyard, can't be beat. They even have heaters for when the sun goes down and their house red, a delicious Montepulciano, keeps tempting you with just one more glass.
