L_thK7r3K_h5M4tV7amEKQ Came here due to the great ratings and because I rarely find myself in the area.

This place has 2-star quality food and service. We had the Italian sausage pasta and the salmon pasta; both watery. 

This place gets an additional star for the prices which does increase the value of this place a bit.
