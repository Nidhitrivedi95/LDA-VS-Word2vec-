Ud2r44vcEX9mPCmk62bPuw I visited Amelia's in late July with my husband and his family. We ordered two large pizzas for our group; the vegetarian and the five cheese. The service was timely (we were after all their only customers at the time) and our waiter was friendly and attentive. The pizzas however were just OKAY.

It's not that they weren't good, but rather Amelia's slightly greasy pizzas stand at the border between fast food and proper restaurant food. They're good, but as I chewed through the fat, the fluffy crust and the cheese, I couldn't help but feel the same way as when I order a pizza from Pizza Pizza; doubtful of my dietary choices, and wondering if I might have gotten a better deal in terms of quality for the price elsewhere (the answer is "yes", especially if you are hungry for real Italian pizza). 

Amelia's serves American pizza. That's alright, so long you don't expect high quality food. It's good, but not great. I wouldn't backpedal if I was invited for dinner, but I will avoid going back again by myself.
