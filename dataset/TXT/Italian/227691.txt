svFq2-4Yv5bIXtB2EK24Ow Full disclosure - I had my first date with my spouse at Postino. I love their bruschetta, and this location has my favorite brunch due to the amazing patios. Be prepared to wait for a table if you bring a large party or come on a peak night. Don't be afraid to ask the staff for wine recommendations!
