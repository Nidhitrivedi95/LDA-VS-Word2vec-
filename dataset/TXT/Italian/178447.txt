nqyxSQ_w_FkZmpckIbM4uA Wow,  what a difference less people dining makes! Nice to see this place got some of their kinks worked out.

Came on a Saturday 1pm, no wait,  healthy amount of Ppl eating there but not the 45 minute waiting time I had around 5-7pm when I first went. Server was super nice, got a few apps some pasta,  and a few drinks. Everything was super tasty,  probibly the best Scada experience I've had for food quality out of the 8 times I've gone to one here and at Square one.  The mule drink was amazing,  bartender knew their stuff. 

The location is great,  nice and easy to do stuff all in one place,  I ate here then saw a movie.  For sure will come back next time I want to go to Oakville for a dinner/movie night. Bravo Oakville Scada, you fixed all the issues I had from the first time.  Good mgmt,  nice to see.
