4EfiNcKSsafogIhAjwv0gg Just tried Rustica for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised.  Service was friendly, food was tasty and the prices are very reasonable.  They offer more than just pizza, the menu has a great variety of sandwiches, salads, pastas, and pizza of course!  I will be back, this may be my new neighborhood pizzeria - I avoid chain pizza places and until now I couldn't find a local place near me with good pizza.  I found it tonight!
