Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ I was pretty impressed w/ the food here.  The outside is a hole in the wall but once you step inside I started to get a better vibe about this place.

Calzone $12 - Exceptional - I was able to try the Calzone ($7.99) and add any toping I wanted (additional +$4 for unlimited topping).  I added bacon, sausage, garlic, extra mushrooms, pepperoni, and cheese.  While this wasn't cheap, it made up for in quality.    This thing tasted great!  It was cooked perfectly.  Baked on the outside, cheese creamy on the inside, all the meats cooked to perfection.  I was 100% satisfied w/ this dish.

Pizza slice -$4 - Above average- A "monster" slice of pizza runs about $4, and the name should be taken seriously; the size of the slice is about the size of a football!  I was able to try my friends pizza slice and it was delicious.  Thin-crust, crunchy, and not over the top oily.  Fresh ingredients too.  A slice by itself should make any person full.

Tips:
-Not good for large groups.  The inside probably houses about 15 people to sit.
