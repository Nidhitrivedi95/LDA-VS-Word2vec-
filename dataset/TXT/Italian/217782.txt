RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q I really wanted to like this place because I had been told that the pizza was great. But our pizza was very soggy and dripping with grease. I didn't particularly like that the sauce was so sweet but I could have forgiven that if the rest of the pizza had been good. There was also no crust and the pizza was cut into diagonal pieces so it was very hard to hold (the soggy slices didn't help). After this experience, I was told that their thick crust is better. I may give it another try since it's so close by.
