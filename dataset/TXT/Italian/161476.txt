llCxryWr8j1S39tusYCWxg We love Yo Pauly's!  Great food, excellent customer service!  I feel like I am back east when I enter this little joint.  Our favorite pizza is wise guys, extra cheese, sausage, black olive! We always ask for specials, a great way to get wings and pizza on a Friday night in.  The best way to bring NY pizza to AZ!
