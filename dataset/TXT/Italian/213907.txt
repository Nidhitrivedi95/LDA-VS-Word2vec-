RA5ubX3nRc_1lghtcQC4nw Someone took me to Da Lillo and introduced me to their chicken/pasta plate. You know, the one where you get half a chicken (a quarter chicken? I don't know, but it's a LOT of food) with a bunch of penne in a rose sauce. I'm normally pretty skeptical about people ordering for me, which is exactly what happened after the dreadful words "we don't need the menu"... but thank god it went down that way cause this plate is kind of epic. So much so that I continued eating long after I was full, and polished off the entire portion with a big satisfied orange stained grin. You know, cause of all the spicy sauce I slathered on my chicken? I lost control and finished it in a complete gluttonous trance. Delicious. Then I went back a week later and did it again.

Short term goal: try other menu items. Or not. Why mess with perfection?
