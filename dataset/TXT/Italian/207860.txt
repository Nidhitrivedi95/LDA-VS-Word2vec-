qlg2QMEErgseygqs_MQETA I would like to start off by saying that I love M and I frequent at least once a week. The food is great, the drinks are good too and I love the patio....


However.....upon my last visit I discovered that they no longer have asparagus. After getting over the initial horror, I decided I had to do something about it. So here is my attempt. 

Dear M. We need asparagus back. My salmon is nothing without its tall, lean, and green counterpart.  It's one of the greatest vegetables in existence. It has over 101% daily value of vitamin K in on cup! Guess what vitamin K is good for? Dark circles. Guess who has dark circles? I do. Why? Because I'm at M late night throwing glasses of rosé back. 

Furthermore, it's an anti-inflammatory and an anti-oxidant. It's the perfect side for any protein! 

So please, the asparagus has to come back.
