G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Fabulous! I have watched her show on television and knew this place wouldn't disappoint, and it did not. We came with a business group and had a private room and everything was served family style. Loved the antipasto platter - I could have had that alone for dinner but the courses kept coming. Everything was spectacular, from the bread tray to dessert. An arugula salad was served - I'm not a big fan usually - but her light lemon dressing was so good I ate every bite. Our entrees were tomahawk steak, chicken, and risotto. All were tasty. The best part? Dessert! Save room. Some people at our table said the breakfasts here are excellent also.
