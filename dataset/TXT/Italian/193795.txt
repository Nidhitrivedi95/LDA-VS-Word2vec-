pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg Just had a private party here for 25 people and from start to finish...AMAZING!! Event manager Krista rocks! Food is top notch and service superseded our expectations! I would recommend this place for your private party! Our family was very satisfied ! The food and drinks just kept coming! Thanks Carmine's for making my mother in laws 50th birthday so special!
