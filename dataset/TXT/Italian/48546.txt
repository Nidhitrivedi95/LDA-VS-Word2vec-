Service was quick and fast, the waiters were just scrambling to put out dishes so you didn't get that personal touch but overall good service.

Food was pretty good, I felt some of their pastas were a bit wierd as if they were just throwing in random ingredients for the hell of it. Il Fornello is just one of those places where you know what to expect and it'll be good food and good atmosphere but don't expect it to be somewhere that'll blow you away and have you coming back to too often.
