yEgnxd3aUUgUoG7qJiuDlQ We were seated promptly even though we were early for our Saturday evening reservation. We began with Presecco.  It was nice and quiet so it was easy to hold a conversation.  The service was good from the professional wait staff.  We began with a caprese salad and beer battered squid.  For mains we had the veal and the black cod.  The food was as good as one would expect in a family owned Italian restaurant.  We drank a Ripasso and an Amarone.  The Amarone was delicious.  We finished the evening off with some delicious Grappa.  Overall it was a very pleasant evening.  It was over priced but then we were down town Toronto.
