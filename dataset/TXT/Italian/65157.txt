BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA This restaurant is really a nice addition to the area. Tonight Colin was our server and we were in very good hands. We sat outside and although it was a chilly evening, the heat lamps and seats were perfect. We ordered a lovely wine and it was brought out right away. Our appys were the beet ravioli and the caprese three way. Both are different from most restaurants and very tasty.  Dinner was the short rib for me, which is scrumptious, the fish special and the beef ravioli for my dinner mates. Portion sizes are generous and everyone loved their  meals. We did not need dessert but the menu made it irresistible so we indulged in the Creme Brûlée. Yum!! This place is a lovely treat.
