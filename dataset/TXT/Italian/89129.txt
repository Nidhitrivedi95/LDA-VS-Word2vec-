e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw Wow, I mean, WOW! My husband and I ate here on our 10th anniversary, and it couldn't have been better! I am vegan, and I was blown away by the vegan menu! I'm not used to having so many choices, especially in a fine dining restaurant! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Sinatra to any vegans who find themselves in Las Vegas! A perfect place for a special occasion meal... and honestly, it wasn't even as expensive as we were prepared for it to be!

My husband isn't even vegan, but he found the vegan menu so compelling that he ordered the vegan chicken parmesan, and it was ridiculously good. I had the vegan Caesar salad and chicken marsala (which came with vegan gnocchi!) and they were both outstanding. Sadly, we got too stuffed to eat dessert!

In addition to the food, the service was perfect! They really paid attention to little details. When we arrived, they gave us a handwritten Thank You card for coming to spend our special day with them. At the end of the meal, they brought us some sorbet on a plate that had Happy Anniversary written on it in chocolate. Also, the busser originally told me they were out of vegan butter, which was no big deal for me..... we asked for olive oil instead, and it was the best olive oil I have ever eaten. Then, like 10 minutes later, he showed up with vegan butter, explaining they went and got some from a different restaurant for me! Talk about going the extra mile! 

Thank you for making our anniversary so special! I'm already dreaming of returning for my birthday! :-)
