eTmy0-h4tTEpfbDVAue0MA I am a huge fan of another pizza joint that will remain nameless.  I have raved about how they have the best pizza I've ever had and was pretty sure that I'd never find another pizza that was as good.  Well, they've got stiff competition.  Spinato's has the best pizza I've ever had.  My husband is going to be so mad at me for that statement.  

I've had the pleasure of eating the thin and thicker crust, both are good, but the thin is the best.  

I'm a lucky gal to have them right across the street from my office...
