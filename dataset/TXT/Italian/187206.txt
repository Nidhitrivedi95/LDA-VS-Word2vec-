oryS4vX0xkKC4tOekgowDQ This place was a lot of fun to bring the kids. When we got there, the wait was pretty short, my husband requested a seat in the train, so we walked around the lobby while our table was being prepared. I'm glad we had the time to stroll around, all the creepy old rooms were awesome. The PacMan game is a great touch.

As we approached the table, my 5 year old's smile stretched from to ear at the sight of walking up those train car stairs. Our server was prompt and courteous. Our food was good, I had the cheese ravioli, the kids had some spaghetti, and my husband had the chicken Marsala. But  I'm not a foodie, so this is not about the food. It was about the ambiance. Which was fantastic. The food was good enough to not lose any stars because of it. 

The refills were on point. The only negative was that all of the tables around us were dirty. But I think that's because the train is too small to have a busser in there while customers are there. It, at the very least, would be a tight fit with the possibility of him bumping in to us.

The check was small. Love that. It's a very affordable restaurant.

Next time we come, we're riding the tram and sitting at the bar. I forgot how cool this place was. We were glad the kids had a weird spaghetti craving that night.
