L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw Pros: great ambience, nice restaurant layout

Cons: the food is expensive for what you get. Portions are very small and nothing special. Most dishes are spicy so if you can't handle spice you should ask them to dial down spice. 

Dishes: garlic bread- 1 star, basically hard flat bread
Porchetta - mostly fat and lots of garnish and very small portion
Seafood sphaghetti special- came with 3 mussels and 2 small scallops.

The drinks are expensive and served in very small glasses and small portions. It's seems like they want to be in New York but they aren't.

Overall, you are paying for the name and the location but the food and drinks are less than average. I wouldn't go back.
