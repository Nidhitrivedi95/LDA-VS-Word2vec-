wsmVIHJEi9J_38dXx2qLKA Oh, I've been meaning to update my review. I totally forgot that for every item we purchased that night, we were charged an extra $.25. Now, by no means am I a cheap individual, but here is where I take issue:

1. The food is already WAY overpriced
2. Nowhere on their menu (at least the take out menu), does it indicate you will be charged an additional $.25 per item
3. The individual who rang in my order also never mentioned anything about a $.25 surcharge.

The only thing I can surmise is that I was being charged a "to go" fee.  I have serious problems with places that do this to their customers. I had a problem with a place like this in Chicago who tried to pull this stunt, but at least they wrote "to go charge" on the bill. The fault was in how they handled the situation after I voiced my displeasure with this wack attempt to sneak a few more coins from my pocket. However, Bunky's just sneaks it in, and if you ask me, that's just bunk.
