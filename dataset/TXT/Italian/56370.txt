AKQbrvRBZvU5kB9Ut4gVkg There is a woman named Amber, who is supposed to be their hostess and is extremely rude, sarcastic and basically a bitch towards customers. She made sure to go out of her way to let me and my partner know that our late reservation was an inconvenience to her, mind you, the restaurant wasn't even full. The food isn't the worst, not the best either. I would come back but if this is the kind of service I get when I walk in the door I probably won't.
