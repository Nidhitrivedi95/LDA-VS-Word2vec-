3qTSOuJ-ZyU1L7o62KHSIg I recall noticing this place way way back when I was in this neighborhood. I recall thinking that it was either a plastic surgeon's office (with a sense of humor!) some oddball art store or a shop that sells eye glasses. Later on I found out it was a restaurant with a repute to boot. A friend who had tried this place recommended trying it.
I got in a bit early and waited at the bar before they open. Didn't get a chance to the menu before hand but osso bucco was already on list of things to try. 
My dining companion arrived later. Here is what we had 
fried rissoto balls. Just beautiful not the dried version one gets nice crispy on the outside with the creamy moist center
crepe with butternut squash. These were average IMO. The sauce was done well here.
My DC ordered the chicken which was stuffed (light on that) though cooked well. It was moist but lacked seasoning IMO.
The osso bucco hit it out of the park. Just gorgeous slathered in rich sauce with the meat that was perfectly tender and the center of marrow. Top dish on this outing. 
I had a glass of Chianti as well which was priced reasonably as well.
We have a winner here folks 4 Stars. I will be back.
