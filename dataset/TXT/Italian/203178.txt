q3uuXi_U-Jqxsk5Nx1Iomw not. worth. it.

the points:

*ridiculously overpriced

*ridiculous delivery times--1.5-2 hours!

*unacceptable temperature--food arrives cold! what's the point of delivery if you have to heat it up when it arrives?!?

*made mistake on our 1st order by bringing the wrong pizza. when phoned back, guy on phone was nice & said he'd put a credit for a replacement of same pizza for our next order. 

*when taking advantage of aforementioned replacement, they brought the wrong pizza again.

*decent calzone.

*no specials or combos

*mediocre pizza

*delivery fee.  and the fee doesn't even go to the driver.

bottom line: waste money someplace else.
