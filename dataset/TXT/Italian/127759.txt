hWrr711CC8UpHvQPKyluqQ Dropped in to Sempre this evening after a four year absence (not because of a previous bad experience but simply because there are too many other great places to try). I was in the mood for a "light" meal so my partner and I shared a pizza and greek salad. The sempre namesake pizza  was exactly as I remembered with a thin crispy crust and decent smattering of veggies including artichoke. The greek style salad was good and fresh and the right size for sharing. It wasn't busy this evening and the service was prompt and friendly. One pizza, one salad and one 6 oz glass of wine was $46 incl tax and tip and it was just the right amount of food for moderate appetites. Sempre is a good family style restaurant. It's not trendy or upscale but it's good and consistent.
