oMcKvfNGX2HleFxYg1VGqg The most pretentious establishment I have ever been to. 10 of us there for a birthday ending with the birthday girl cussing out the staff.  Forcing us to order appz and mains because apparently it's a privilege to be there and we need to be forced to pay your bills. THEN taking over 2 hours to serve our mains....with a giggle and a surprised look on their face when we looked annoyed. Serving people around us who had arrived over an hour later. I only wish our whole party had walked out before we ate so we could stick you with the bill, and waste your table for over 2 hours. I will never ever EVER return here and I will tell everyone I know how horrible this experience was. It's one thing to be slow and off your game one night and it's another to be an a$$hole about it. Nothing comp'd...no sorry....nothing....just a snobby and I don't give a f*ck attitude throughout. Dude, there are plenty of places to eat and dance in this city....with a way better atmosphere and staff. Get ur sh*t together.
