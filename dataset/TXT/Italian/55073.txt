AFaUDCTQ8LC33Nfmb_KWhg My girlfriend and I went to cc's. We were there one hour and they asked us to leave our table and go to the bar. While they did ask us nicely , they said they had people waiting for the table ,I don't think that was very polite asking us to leave our table. Maybe it's because we didn't order any dessert or coffee. But that's not even the incredible rude part about it. After I left I called and asked to speak to the manager and told her that I didn't think that that was very polite to ask us to leave our table and go to the bar and she said goodbye and hung up on me. We spent $100 there and  that's how rudely  we were treated. Won't go back.
