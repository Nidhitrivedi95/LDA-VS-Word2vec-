q-YQIvBSNZxYJl1xuB0H_w Really good pizza and pastries.  Great location if you are stuck in the great via Linda dead end toward fountain hills.  Pizza menu was varied and I am not usually a white sauce pizza guy, but the "Hot Chick" pizza was killer awesome.  The peppers were sweated within an inch of their life.  In a good way.  I was going to put some Valentina hot sauce on it, but it is just fine as is.  Pastries are done everyday, they said they will be open early in August for breakfast service.  Will definitely check that out.
