yJkYsl0hOlG2-ITBe16ZIA I loved the decor, a nice change. The room is far too noisy. I could hardly hear myself think! And the booming music added to the confusion. Chris, our waitress was sweet as could be. I think they need to decide what they want to be. The menu choices didn't make sense. Cheeseburger, fish tacos and $32 salmon.  The tacos should have been $2 each. Nothing else on the plate but 3 lonely tacos. At $11, not great. We ordered octopus for our appetizer. It was delicious, fish tacos and fish and chips for dinner. They were just ok. The batter on the fish fell of with each forkful, and the fish alone had no seasoning whatsoever. Salt and pepper would have helped. Awesome tarter sauce. One cocktail was ordered and our bill for dinner was over $65. I don't see a reason to return.
