dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw Fiamma has been my preferred dining option in Las Vegas for the past 10 years.  I never sleep anywhere outside of a Wynn Hotel (past / currently owned), and after attending openings at almost every single restaurant since the construction of Hard Rock ... Fiamma is my true love that has gone unmatched.  
Executive Chef Carlos Buscaglia has created a true gem within the MGM family.  The fact that Fiamma has let Chef Buscaglia slide through their fingers in recent weeks due to his call to indulge in "bigger and better things" is a grave mistake.  It's insane to me how the owners could allow this genius (inhuman to Culinary)  escape.  Food aside.  Fiamma is Gorgeous.  Fiamma is Sexy... its Decor / Ambiance / Lighting / Mood has exactly what we all want when we visit Las Vegas.  When you mix this with a meal that will make you literally cry like a baby... Nirvana doesn't seem as distant.  
Restaurants in Vegas strive for this, but usually come short in one of the above mentioned.  I just hope that Fiamma can find a way to maintain what Chef Carlos created throughout the past years... or spend the money and GET HIM BACK!!!  I leave you with this thought.   Clooney quoted it best after a Chef Carlos Buscaglia meal at Fiamma:  If you can't get laid after a night here... there is definitely something wrong with you.
