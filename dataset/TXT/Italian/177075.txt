nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg I would have given 5 stars but the night we  went here dinner service was very slow.  Our table hardly noticed because we were enjoying apps, drinks and conversation. The party of 8 next to us looked like they wanted murder us because our dinner came out before theirs!!! We were entertained by their anger.
Other than that, food was great! Lemon drop martinis...yum.
