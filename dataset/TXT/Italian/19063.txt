2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg My favorite place to grab a sandwich and coffee and enjoy the fresh air on their outside patio. The service has always been fast and friendly and this last visit was no exception.  They have the best omelettes here.  The Mediterranean omelette is huge and is stuffed with feta, spinach, and mushrooms.  It comes with assorted olives, different breads and spreads.  It's enough to split.  I've also tried the steak guacamole wrap and chicken caprese panini, both of which were yummy.  I never have room for dessert but they do have a large assortment of different pastries and goodies.  No trip to Tivoli Village is complete without a visit to Leone Cafe!
