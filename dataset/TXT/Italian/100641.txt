fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w Came across this joint and really enjoyed my food. Order the grilled chicken with avocados and had them make it with a wrap instead. It was healthy yet tasty. We also had the garbage salad and that wAS REALLY GOOD. The salad had all kinds of stuff in there!!! Cheese, olives, etc. really enjoyed it! Def recommend it.
