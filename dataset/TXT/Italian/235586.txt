tVyLQzyhhinKcGzlZIFZjQ Went here for lunch and I was not disappointed. The food was so delicious! I ordered the calamari because I couldn't resist trying it here. My husband got the meatball baked sandwich which I had a bite of and it was sooo good. Calamari was fried like a chicken strip and it tasted better than I expected it to. Our server was nice but very busy. Luckily we didn't need much. The manager also walked around and made sure everyone was doing well which I loved. Definitely will be eating here more often.
