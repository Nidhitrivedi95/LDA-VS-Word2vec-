lHLNQnEHwCJ_CROCfCxEzw I've probably been here a dozen times in the past few years, and I've never left disappointed.

The food is fantastic, especially over lunchtime. They always start you off with bread and dipping oil. The thing I love about their dipping oil is the pink peppercorns they serve it with.  I recommend any calzone.  If you are not like me and have the discipline to stop eating, a large calzone could feed you twice. Another tasty option is their portabella mushroom salad that comes with their delicious house dressing, a creamy vinagrette. 

The price is reasonable for what you get. The service is okay... The atmosphere is nice, but nothing special (unless it's a nice summer day and you can sit on their patio). But it's the food that keeps me coming back.

One drawback - the oven that cooks the pizzas and calzones is near the dining area. This means your clothes end up smelling like the tasty goodness they serve up.  This may be just me, but I like to eat my food, not wear it.
