My wife and I have been there several times, and without exception, they treat us to a delicious dinner with magnificent service. The place does not look like much from outside, being located in a small commercial corner, but once inside, it is the perfect setting for a romantic dinner. You will be transported to an Italian trattoria the minute you enter. 

The food is very Italian (I grew up in Italy), and prepared with great care. The waiters are friendly and respectful and they are quick to provide you with a glass of wine or whatever else your heart desires the minute you are seated. The linen table cloths and napkins add a touch of class to your night. The menu is varied and reasonably priced. The time it takes the kitchen to prepare your dinner is perfect--not too long and not too short--giving you enough time to visit and anticipate the delicious dishes headed in your direction. We have sampled multiple dishes there, and each one has been as wonderful as the previous one.

We recommend Arrivederci's to anyone desiring a lovely night out with exquisite food, good drinks and a delightful atmosphere.
