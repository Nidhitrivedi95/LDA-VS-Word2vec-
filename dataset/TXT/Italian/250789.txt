VoXUt6TIJWyIf_lihbN5xQ It's hard to write a review for this place. It came highly recommended, so we tried it out, the menu looked robust.
I can't say it was bad, and I can't say it was memorable or great. It was kinda 'eh'. Decor...'eh', food...not too fab, but not bad. Service at the table...'eh'.
I will say we arrived without a reservation and they did accommodate us, and were friendly about it, so that is a plus. 
Our waitress never made eye contact and always walked past our table never looking around.
I don;t know if I will put it on my repeat list, but it does look like there are some regulars (and skews a slightly older crowd sometimes).
Meatballs were good. There could have been a bit more calamari on the plate for the calamari order.
We didn't order the pizza, but they looked good.
Yeah, like I said, I just don't really know what to write here. It was that kinda experience.
