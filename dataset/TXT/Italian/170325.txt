mUUTJY9_BqmAYxypHiqWrw I was looking for a bakery after stopping by Scarborough Town Centre and came across Francesca's on yelp. It was a 2 minute drive from the mall so decided to drop by.

The plaza itself has around 40 or so parking spots and we just happened to be lucky with a spot. Cars were waiting outside for spots so I can imagine it being frustrating if someone decided to drop by alone and there were no spots. 

I had a small Cannolo (2$) and a Sicilia cake (around 5$). The Cannolo was delicious! The ricotta cheese filling was not too sweet or overwhelming on the cheese. The pastry wasn't too crunchy and complimented the filling nicely. Being a fan of pistachio, we chose the Sicilia cake and it exceeded my expectations. It had a sponge cake filling with a citrus layer and pistachio nuts hidden within the cake. 

The atmosphere was very lively and everyone seemed very friendly; much like a family style restaurant. Everyone was laughing and had good conversation going on.

Will definitely be back to try other choices on the menu!
