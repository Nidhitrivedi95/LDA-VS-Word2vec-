TKhlt0jPUhJt10jgEKdWXg Well on the way back from Hoover Dam, this stop was part of the package.  We had really already had lunch but what the heck, we're  game, WOW what a let down.  I check out the pizza buffet, about all we had time for.  The pizza look terrible.  Glad we passed on it, so why not try some cheese cake.  After a long wait well I had to remind the waitress to bring out the cheese cake.  Well out came two piece, one was FROZEN, well we were able to fork it apart.  The other piece seemed to have been warmed up.  Holy cow this was no better then bought at a box store or at a warehouse cheese cake.  After hunting down the waitress so we could pay, she gave me the wrong ticket, I did notice a man sitting by himself at the bar, he had a veteran hat on.  So it was my chance to pay it forward today, so I paid his tab.  BUT THIS PLACE IS NO BIG THING.  GO UP THE ROAD FOR A&W.
