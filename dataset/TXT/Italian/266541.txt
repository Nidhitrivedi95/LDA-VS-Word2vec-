x4aHNNo1osWNCB75q_PijQ I like Pomo so much that on a recent visit back to AZ I had to go twice!

I like this location much more than the previous Borgata version, and the delicious pizzas were something I knew I would miss when I moved away.  

So...  Pomo was the first dinner spot I chose during my last trip back, and I was looking forward to some great pizza, wine and conversation.  3 people means we should share 3 pizzas, right?  Yes, there were left overs.  Some.  A little.  

Principe:  This is by far my favorite.  Pomo's perfect thin crust graced with prosciutto crudo di parma, arugula, and shaved parmigiano reggiano.  I just cannot get enough.

Quattro Formaggi:  What is better than one cheese?  Four!  The fresh basil makes this creation even better.

Bufala Verace:  This is a classic Napoletana preparation, topped with delicious imported Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP, basil and EVOO.  I loved it as well, but wish there were even more of the mozzarella goodness.

A few days later, asked to select a lunch destination, I did not hesitate to suggest Pomo's outside patio.  This time between two people we shared the Principe (I said I can't get enough) as well as a Mista salad (the shaved parmigiano reggiano and balsamic vinegar topping the fresh greens earn this a spot in my heart).  Oh, and the nice chianti that rounded out the leisurely lunch didn't hurt either.

The location is great, and the layout with both indoor and covered patio seating makes it a good choice for an intimate meal or a get together with a larger group.  Can you open one in Orange County?  Please?

Just like you can expect summers in AZ to be hot, you can expect me to be back at Pomo as soon as possible.
