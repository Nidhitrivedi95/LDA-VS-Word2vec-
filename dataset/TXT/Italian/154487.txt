I've only tried their baked goods here and I have not been disappointed with anything that I've tried. My favourite items are probably their donuts which sell out pretty fast. The donuts here aren't overly sweet and the filling isn't overwhelming either. My favourite one has to be their pumpkin cream cheese, which has a fantastic light and airy filling. 

There is parking right outside the bakery as well as along the side streets nearby. Although I've never had too much trouble finding a spot, sometimes it does get quite full. 

Service is quite fast, they run by a ticket system much like deli counters. Only issue I had was when I was told my donut was a Boston cream, but it just turned out to be a non filled chocolate dip donut.
