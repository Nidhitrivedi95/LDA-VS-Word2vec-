pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Wow. Awesome place. Small - great casual atmosphere. Great local beer in tap (didn't catch the name). Started with the Spiedini appetizer. We contemplated ordering a second dish of it as it was so good. The came the pizza. We ordered the wiseguy - with mushrooms. It was phenomenal. The one pizza was more than enough for the two of us. Highly recommend this place!  You won't be disappointed.
