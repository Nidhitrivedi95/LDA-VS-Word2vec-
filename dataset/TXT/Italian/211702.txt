r_KDxVcTZVEigYepnoJ6Lw How delighted was I to rock up here to meet some Yelpers before a Cocktail Quest, to discover it wasn't just a 'café' as the name implies, but a lovely family-run Italian restaurant (or at least, that's how it felt). Not a 'genuine' Italian restaurant that's mainstream; but a real hidden gem, tucked up a side street that only the locals know about.

And run by two very noteable Italian gentleman, who made it feel like I've stepped off of the streets of Leith and into a restaurant right in the middle of Rome.

I didn't have any food, only a glass of wine. But I intend to come back very soon for dinner, as all the Yelpers said the food wad deeeelicious (and judging by a near full order for desserts after mains, and clean plates, it was!)

Bellisima!
