Really flavorful and you could tell it had been made from scratch. Service was really excellent. Our table was initially wobbly and the staff immediately did everything to fix it. Waitress was really friendly and knew a lot about the menu which was super helpful. The manager (I think) even stopped by everybody's table to check how we were.
