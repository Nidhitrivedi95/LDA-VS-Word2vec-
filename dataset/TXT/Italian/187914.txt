OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ Rocco's is a hidden neighborhood gem! We have had their food many times after discovering them about 2 months ago. We started with the pizza that was really good (they have unique offerings for toppings), and delivered timely and hot. They are our go to for pizza (delivery and pick-up). 

Most recently was one of those nights where everyone wanted something different. Rocco's has a full menu to choose from. We ordered a gnocchi dish, pasta with sausage, a cold deli sandwich (they make their own bread), and a great salad with a beautiful homemade ranch dressing. We have also had their tirimasu...loved it!

We have not ordered something we wouldn't order again. Everything has been surprisingly good, and we feel lucky to have them so conveniently located and reasonably priced. You can't go wrong with Rocco's.
