JK_DiDwbl7HX5OhCAh3h4g We were talked in off the street and very happily so!  Excellent service, especially for a Friday night!  The fried ravioli is delicious!  The kitchen accommodated us when we wanted to add items to our already large meat antipasto (a few dollars extra and well worth it).  Four of us dined, three ordered entrees and we still had leftovers.  The carbonara was very good but quite buttery - this is the only reason we didn't rate 5 stars.  Excellent americanos!
