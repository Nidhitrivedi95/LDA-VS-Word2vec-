ypIva71uwehmjr1pvLWr9g Overly rich vegan options with almost no vegetables or anything fresh. All about vegan soy cheese and gluten free pizza and pasta. What about all the nice vegetables of Italian food? Some nice salad, greens etc?   Did they not get the idea that a huge number of vegans don't like fake soy products?  Would much rather have just some tofu!  Much healthier.
The starters and entrees are all the same in flavors.  
I love that they have a large vegan and gluten free menu but would much prefer it be only vegan and include more healthy options like sautéed Italian greens and lighter fare to go along with the heavy, oil rich pizza and pasta.  Seems like the gluten free bread had oats in it...not sure...but it was delicious. The vegan gnocchi was so heavy it was kind of overwhelming. Delicious for a few bites but way too rich.
The servers should suggest some lighter options to start and then to share a pizza or pasta...(but they don't have lighter options)
If it's your first year vegan...run to it you will love it.  If you are used to good Italian food and vegan a long time you will likely find it very heavy.
