eGTAC8EzcHiYnnZ52tijiQ Found myself in Oakville for an appointment and looking for food afterwards.  Decided to check out Stoney's based the fear of having to eat at Kelsey's and all the positive Yelp reviews.

We arrived later in the evening so the metered parking beside the restaurant is free after 6pm.

We ordered the Slow Roasted Lamb ($10.50) and Nove ($9.00) sandwiches along with Greek ($6.00) and Caesar ($4.00) side salads.   

I did try a bite of the lamb sandwich even though I'm not really partial to lamb.  I was completely caught off guard after a small taste, I honey badgered the remaining half of the lamb sandwich.  I always describe lamb as too gamey and uriney for my tastes.  But here I was savouring every bite!

The Nove sandwich was good...very thick with roasted chicken, bacon and provolone, although paled in comparison to the lamb.  Salads were good and a hearty size, definitely enough to share one between two 

Stoney's is for sandwich lovers...I mean people who really, really, REALLY love sandwiches.  I liken it to an upscale version of Panera.  Sandwich lovers will be in heaven here.
