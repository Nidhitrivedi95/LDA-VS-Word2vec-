TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag We have been to this location several times after events and have always had great service but Friday night we were there about 11 pm or so and we had horrible service for the 1st time, our waitress was very slow and not prompt on refills either we had to go get someone several times for things. Food was okay this time not the best quality as before. Hope it's better next time we go
