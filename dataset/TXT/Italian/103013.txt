fLfBoxoqgDxRzPMJIr3izw Bravi is great! My family and I use to go there every week for dinner! Had an awful experience when it went under new management over a silly coupon. We went back after not going there for over a year and it seems as tho it's under new management and is back to the way it was! Good food, fairly priced!
