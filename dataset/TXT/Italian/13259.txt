15YuEFO59yXd7BTO5NZgYw We've been here a couple of time. The first time we went with friends. I had the eggplant parm. It was very good. Not an overly huge portion but it had all the components that made it good, tasty sauce, served hot, fresh grated cheese, etc..
  
Most recently we ordered pizza to take out last week. The food is always good and the service is good. My only complaint is that it seemed a bit pricey for a pizza. Granted it was a specialty pizza & a large but $28 seems a little high priced to me.   I'll keep an eye out for any specials or coupons and we'll go back when/if we can get a bit of a deal.
