VeRHiEbUe_vHprYn8mnezA Ever since we discovered this place we have been going weekly. It is small, cozy, and very friendly but most of all, the food and service are top notch. We have been to Italy twice this year and eating here is just as good. Many of the customers are repeats, and for good reason -- it's a quality place. It has about 20 tables and a four seat bar, the wine list is adequate and the food choices superb. Seafood risotto, several pasta choices, veal and fresh fish are available nightly, and if you try one of the Italian deserts you will be hooked for sure. If you want a quiet, friendly and very memorable Italian meal, this is your choice in Scottsdale for sure.
