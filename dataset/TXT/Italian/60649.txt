aVvMVhCSNT3d4W37Ue1aUw In keeping with my "Review Strategy" (Good review after a minimum of two visits - NOT so good Review after only one visit, as I am NOT going back) I am VERY dissapointed  to have to write this Review, as I looked forward to Café Daniel with GREAT ANTICIPATION, based on so many stellar Reviews here.

To say this was an underwhelming dinner experience would be an understatement. The Restaurant is quite lovely and the menu so promising. I had two dishes, which were presented quite nicely. The problem? Each dish lacked taste, although they were certainly unique enough . NOT at all certain if Café Daniel is French or Italian, but seems to have failed on each count. Pate had very nice texture but was virtually tasteless. Candidly, I have enjoyed Farmers Liverwurst more! The stuffed  figs? OMG, dried would be an understatement. Try eating the sole of your shoe!

One note regarding The Proprietor, who as previous Reviewers had mentioned, was in attendance. With only five tables active he managed to visit each of the other four tables, but apparently an older man dining alone was of no interest to him. NOT A WORD.

Sorry to be so negative.
