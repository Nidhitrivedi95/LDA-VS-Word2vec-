The mussels were very nice and there was a never- ending supply of bread to soak up that delicious broth. Chicken dish went over very well as did a farfalle special. Osso buco was quite good although the linguini didn't add anything to the dish. Seafood pasta was a bit less than expected, mostly down to the fact that it was in a tomato sauce.
