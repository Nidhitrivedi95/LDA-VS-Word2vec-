Pt24B_tPolf9AhWoWD--qw Overrated. First of all, the decor is dark, gloomy and almost gave me the impression that I was trapped! I don't even know if there are windows that AREN'T covered up. 

The food was not that good for the price and at their prices, I am GOING to expect better. Their chicken wasn't marinated properly, it was dry and took me forever to eat as a result. Potatoes were a tad over-cooked. Their pasta wasn't terrible, but definitely not to my liking. The chef's didn't know the definition of "too much" cream sauce. It tasted like Alfredo sauce with one or two noodles inside. It was as though I ASKED for extra, extra sauce (I did not). I will write that the service was super friendly...at least.
