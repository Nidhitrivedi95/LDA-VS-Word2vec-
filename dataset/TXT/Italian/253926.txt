vUDqNV3RhI3FmZRwS7039g We headed out to Bobby's Friday night at the request of a friend who wanted to hang out and listen to live music for her b-day. We had reservations for 8Pm and they seated us promptly. The atmosphere was cool and relaxing, and the music was entertaining. The environment is a little to loud with the music and back ground noise to carry on a conversation. 

On the food side of thing, my wife and I ordered the steamed muscles in the white wine sauce. The sauce was very well done with what seemed to be white wine, lemon, parsley, and either a touch of tomato past for color of just a little tomato sauce. The flavor was great. The muscles on the other hand were over cooked and rubbery. 

For our main courses my wife ordered the Cesar salad with shrimp. The Cesar was ok, the dressing was a little on the lite side, not very tangy. The shrimp were small maybe 41/50's and it was $7 extra for THREE. The wife didn't realize that there was only three until after she had given one to a friend at the table to try. 

I ordered the angel hair pasta with shrimp in a white wine tomato sauce. I can just say that it was average. Nothing over the top or exciting. I too only got three shrimp for $7 and was a little disappointed. 

All in all the food was average but below average for an upscale place. The night was saved by the music and my wife was happy that I got up and danced with her.
