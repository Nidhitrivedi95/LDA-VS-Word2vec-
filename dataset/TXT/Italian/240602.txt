UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ This is not my first review of Floridino's.

I was very close to never eating here again after being served "understuffed" calzones 3x in a row.  The outside corners contained nothing the last three times I dined there.

The saving grace for this restaurant is the Pizza Muffins.  They are excellent.  The pizzas are really good as well.  I'll stick with one of those two when I go there.  My daughters love this place, so I can't avoid going there.  I gave an extra star just because my kids love their food.

Step your game up, Floridino's!  Do some quality control with your calzones!
