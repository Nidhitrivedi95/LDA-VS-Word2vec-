1U9lgJoEhxaCMP0PsuSJgA We have been frequent diners for years never "complained"... until today. Hannah, after multiple times correcting her while placing our (very simple) to-go order. We ended up with alas the wrong items. When I called in to let them know, she rudely questioned me and attempted to blame me for her mistakes. When transferring phone to manager she must not have put the phone on hold so I was able to hear her conversation with the manager Dale. Both were unprofessional and rude. Zero attempt was made to fix our order. They just said they'd have to come  back and pick up our food so the meal was ruined, with zero attempt at fixing. Just condescending behavior. Never experienced this level of unprofessionalism or disregard for a (former) loyal and frequent customer.
