r7IvPMyza853adkAvi1RNQ Saturday afternoon - 1 waitress (Kari) in entire restaurant.  She had 4 tables. So why was she nowhere to be seen?  Why were other tables wondering the same?  Why do I have to ask for a 2nd cup of coffee as she's bringing the check?  Were they so short-staffed that she was in the kitchen cooking?  Who knows?

Personality of a wet noodle:  Obnoxious "You guys" in every sentence, no greeting us either coming into or leaving restaurant, didn't come back to check table to see if we needed anything, doesn't say anything to us other than the bare minimum, didn't offer dessert...  I could go on and on.  She was like a robot.  Hope she doesn't last long there.
