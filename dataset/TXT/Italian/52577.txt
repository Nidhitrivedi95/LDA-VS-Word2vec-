9x1bWbbSgFCMLJlJR8mezQ Delicious home made authentic italian classics.  Low prices.  Extremely generous portions.  For the same price as a Jimmy John's sandwich or Moe's Burrito, you can have a expertly prepared Italian feast with all fresh ingredients.

Why not a 5?  The service can be slow during the lunch rush, and the interior is a bit run down.  If you aren't in a crazy rush, your money won't go farther for better food anywhere in Market Square.
