sKrt4CMGyG8YAjxVkk4hPQ Just because there's a long line up at lunch doesnt necessarily mean that the food is good does it? Well, in this case it does. We waited on a Monday afternoon for maybe 10mins, had a chance to read the chalkboard menu and specials as well as check out the display you eventually are lined up against (free pizza samples too!). Since I was there with a regular, I went with her choice, a smoked turkey panini, with a herbed mayo, cucumber, pepper, lettuce and marble cheese. You order over the counter, your tray is set up on top of the counter and, no matter if your choice is quicker than those ahead, you wait in sequence to pay. 
Took our sandwiches to the small patio and dug in. For about the same price of a turkey sandwich from Subway immediately next door, Fusaro's wins hands down. The mayo alone is a win. 
I will go back. The pastas, the salads and the quiche all looked delicious, and by the looks ofnthe full Corona box on the floor, they're licensed!
