N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ The best veggie pizza my wife and I have ever had in Vegas. And the spaghetti with marinara plus meatballs was absolutely delicious.  Would have liked to have rolls or garlic bread with the spaghetti,  couldn't remember if was on the menu.  Regardless, Great tasting food, that's all anyone needs to know about Biaggio's.  Our go to Italian whenever we are in this part of town.
