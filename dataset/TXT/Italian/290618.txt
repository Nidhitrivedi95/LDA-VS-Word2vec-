ZVtjS8Hvq2a6SxHxlehPGg Good food, nice atmosphere with live music. We went on a Saturday night. We made a reservation for 2 but when we got there, they couldn't seat us for another half hour. The owners graciously offered complimentary cocktails and profusely apologized.  It was not their fault that others showed up late for their reservations and messed the times for everyone else. After patiently waiting, our meal was worth the wait. The spaghetti bolognese and the lasagna were delicious! Then our dessert was sent over compliments of the owners. The customer service is superb and old fashioned. We will definitely be back!
