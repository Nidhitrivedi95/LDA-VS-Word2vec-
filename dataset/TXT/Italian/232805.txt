TLbx_MR2dyFztoyR5d9H2A I've ordered pizza for take out and have never been disappointed.  Today I stopped in for lunch and ordered the Meatball Sandwich.  Meatballs the size of baseballs, delicious sauce and melted cheese.  My party ordered the Cheese Pizza and Lasagna.  Warm bread and butter to hold you over while you wait for your meal.  Out comes the dinner salad (3 options to choose from) with your dressing of choice on the side.  Family run and operated.  Comfortable and Casual.  Friendly staff.
