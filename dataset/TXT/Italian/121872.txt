hdZ_4Vd9opGm5UajNUuhwA We found NYP at about 2am after wandering around the Strip and finding ourselves inside New York, New York. The atmosphere around the restaurants in New York is charming and makes every dining experience that much more fun.

NYP had a great special when we stopped in: Any slice of pizza plus a cold draft of beer for just $7.77. Pizza was good, a little underdone and greasy but very tasty. The draft beer was Rolling Rock and was ice cold and delicious.
