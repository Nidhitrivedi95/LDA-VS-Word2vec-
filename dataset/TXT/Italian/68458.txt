BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I've recently been exploring this whole area north of the 101, as I recently moved nearby. I must say this has been one of the highlights of my culinary findings. My fiance and I went for dinner, and I returned with my parents a few days later. Both experiences were very good. 

For dinner, the music is fairly loud and almost has a nightclub feel to it. The crowd is certainly on the older side though, a lot of cougars and grey haired heads in the building. The food is excellent and massive in their portions without being overwhelming. We had a lot of leftovers the next day. The only item that I didn't love was the burrata dish. It tasted very good, but the burrata was hard as a rock, not the creamy, soft or squishy delight it should have been. The dish itself was tastey but it shouldn't be sold as burrata. The scallop risotto was incredible, as was the chicken and artichoke dish. 

For lunch, the vibe is much more relaxed and the club music wasn't blasting. I think I prefer this spot for lunch solely based upon this fact. The menu is much the same with a few more "lunch" items included: such as more sandwiches/salads. I had a salad this time and it was truly excellent, one of the best salads I've had in some time. 

The venue is very modern, large and airy feeling with great service from the staff. The price is very reasonable for what they offer as well.
