Iam7tYWhssw_rscSBkeRIQ There is a certain style of pizza - thin floppy crust, tons of cheese - so much cheese grease pools on top, sweet sauce.  Totally different than chains like Pizza Hut or Papa John's.  I can't explain it, but there is only one other place that I've eaten this type of pizza in the college town where I did my undergrad (Subs n' Suds, Indiana, PA).  It's my most favorite kind.  No toppings, just cheese.  Simple, greasy, simple.  Fiori's pizza is fantastic.  The only complaint I have is parking on that stupid hill - I nearly had a heart attack trying to parallel park up a 45 degree incline.   Service is as fast as it can be, but they seem to work efficiently.  Super nice too.  We eat here as often as we happen to stumble over to the other side of the Liberty Tubes, which isn't often enough.
