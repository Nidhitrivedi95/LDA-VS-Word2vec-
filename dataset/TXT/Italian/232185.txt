tJtD_lR7ZVmo0GltQia-IA As a big porchetta fan, this place did not meet my expectations.

First off, the porchetta panino consisted of a lot of mayo and meat on a bun. No lettuce, no tomato, no cheese, nada. After roaming around Italy and trying a variety of sandwiches topped with fresh ingredients and condiments, this was very underwhelming. Not to mention, the guy making them seemed to have no interest whatsoever in making and serving paninis. Needless to say, the lack of love was apparent. 

The meat itself was dry, while the sandwich extremely oily. We also tried the mortadella, which  unfortunately, neither of us enjoyed. 

After spending $25 on 2 sandwiches and potatoes, we felt a little disappointed all around.
