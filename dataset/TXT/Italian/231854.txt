tIiiq23utFKTs1At2bVD6w The food was absolutely divine. We ordered the bruschetta appetizer, house salad , I ordered the lobster ravioli and my husband ordered the special which was pumpkin ravioli. All the pasta is made in house fresh everyday. Everything was absolutely delicious and the service was impeccable .
They have a full bar and excellent wine choices. 
Reservations are suggested the only non reserved seating they have it out on the patio. If you plan on sitting out on the patio bring a jacket or a sweater the wind between the two buildings really gets moving.
