Seems like a little place that people in the neighbourhood have been going to for years, like a little hole-in-the-wall hidden gem.
I had the grilled veggie sandwich (that has goat cheese...*drool*) and it was delicious!! The price wasn't too steep either ($4.95) so that was a win. I had a taste of my friend's veal sandwich and it was fabulous - not the best I've ever had but nothing to dismiss either. 
I'd definitely go back in the future.
