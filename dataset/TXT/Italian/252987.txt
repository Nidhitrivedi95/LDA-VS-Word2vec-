VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w We had about seven people in our crew. We got stuck at a table near a server station so there was a lot of commotion. Our server was nice and actually recommended us to get less food. He was right the portions were huge!

Salads are fresh and the dressings are mild. The calamari portion is surprisingly huge and it was average. The eggplant parm was great and HUGE (better be at $18). For dinner I got the 8oz. filet. It was cooked perfectly.

We went to the club upstairs with no wait or charge since we ate at the restaurant. Holy shit it was SO packed, we couldn't breath. It was quite dark as well I couldn't see the decor shown in the pictures I saw before.
