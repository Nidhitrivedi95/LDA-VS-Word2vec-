eU_713ec6fTGNO4BegRaww We usually hit up La Tavola three or four times a year and it has been a staple of ours for New Year's Eve and Valentines Day that past 4 years. This year we actually had to postpone our V Day trip until tonight, but I think I may have had the best meal yet there.

We started with the margarita pizza as an appetizer with their beans and greens. The waitress (who did a phenomenal job), suggested that we add sausage to them. I one up-ed her and asked to have the through in some fresh banana peppers as well. Awesome!

My plate was a Louisiana style penne with shrimp, chicken, and sausage. The penne was cooked perfectly and although it isn't made fresh on-site, the flavors in the plate definitely made up for it.

My wife's chicken parmesan was also excellent and the cannoli that the waitress brought us at the end topped it off.
