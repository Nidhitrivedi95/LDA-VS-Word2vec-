5CJOaZc8Muu8WothauxQ4g Pizza Forte opened just over a week ago in a small spot in the Hard Rock Hotel.  Owned by Mimmo Ferraro, It's obvious that their forte is pizza--New York Style sold by the slice or one can order a custom 14" or 18" pizza.  They also sell hot dogs, meatballs, and cannoli, filled when ordered and not pre-filled like most places.

Four of us had dinner at Ferraro's Italian across Paradise from the Hard Rock and after stuffing ourselves silly there, we decided to walk over to the HRH and try the new pizza place.

Not being a large consumer of pizza, I do know good pizza when I have it.  I've had enough life experience in New York and Las Vegas to have tried a lot of different pizzas.

I had a slice with sausage and pepperoni.  The toppings were just the right amount, the cheese was quite good, and the crust was browned just right.  I somewhat folded the large slice and scarfed it down in a short time.   Excellent!  While I usually don't get NY style pizza often, I know that they're doing a great product.

The dining room is shaped like a small L.  Entering from the casino, you walk past some tables here and there and reach the counter with a large Order Here sign and you can see the pre-made pies under heat lamps.  Then pay at the cashier and you're all set to try some of  the best pizza in Las Vegas.

If Pizza Forte was closer to where I lived, I'd be there more often.  At it is, the few times I'm at the Hard Rock, this is a very enticing option for quick, solid food.
