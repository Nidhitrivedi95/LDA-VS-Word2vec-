LFxMt7Oi0vdsmZ3h_UBV-g Came here on a Saturday night for a friends birthday. Waited 90 minutes for a table of two, we came at 8PM, finally got seated around 930. Resto was super busy which is always a good sign. You could smell the delicious food in the air. Started with the meat and cheese charcuterie app which you can do with out, I've had better. We split the old school gnocchi which was very rich and savoury. Tasty. As well as a regular pizza which was great. Overall the food was good, wasn't the best meal I've ever had. The service was awesome, the bread they bring out at the beginning is tasty and the olive oil is even better. I would return but wouldn't rave about it.
