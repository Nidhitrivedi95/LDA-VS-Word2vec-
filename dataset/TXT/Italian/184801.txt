OIdOJaNS8M624F58XGV3PQ Hands down one of my favourite pizza places in Toronto. Little on the pricey side, but totally worth it. 

Visited this location a couple of times on Friday nights and every time I'm there I get amazing service. It's always busy but the staff will do their best to seat you as fast as possible. I personally love the atmosphere/ vibe of this place. 

I ordered their original Margherita pizza and asked for mushrooms to be added to it. They were very accommodating of that. The service was fast even though the place was packed. 

Highly recommend this place for anyone that wants to experience pizza that's not considered "fast food".
