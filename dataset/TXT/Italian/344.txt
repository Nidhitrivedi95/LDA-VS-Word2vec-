-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw The food here was fantastic. Came in with my family of 5 on Saturday evening. Had to wait a few minutes for a table, no big deal, as a party of 11 came in before us. We got seated near the bar in a large booth, but the table was itty bitty. Especially for 5 adults. 

By checking in on Yelp, I received a free appetizer. We got the Margherita Flatbread, and it was delicious! Rather big, perfect for sharing - enough for all of us. I can't remember everything that everyone ordered, but my mom and I split the Grilled Salmon Salad and it was SO good! Splitting it was perfect size; they do offer 1/2 sizes on the salads. All of the food came out very quick as well. 

Our server wasn't the best, he was very slow, and not good with recommendations. It felt as though he didn't want to accommodate my brothers request to change sauce on one of the pastas, as it took away from the taste or something like that he said. He was also very, very slow. He was too busy leaning against the counter by the computer at the end of the bar, drinking his beverage, and flirting with another server. We had to ask the manager to refill our drinks. 

The restaurant it pretty large, very clean, and well decorated. The bar is rather big too, and they have a few TV in there. I will definitely come back here next time I am in town.

5 stars if the service was better.
