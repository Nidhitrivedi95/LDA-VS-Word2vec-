soyZ8bv2ZsSpsBv4PGMrTA I've had many wonderful meals here. They specialize in Brazilian fare, and I think that's where the menu really shines. But if you aren't familiar with the cuisine, you might not notice. It's just great food. 

For a stellar mixed drink, try the capirania. It hasn't tasted this good since I was on a beach in Costa Rica.

It seems like most of the restaurant seating is outside. So it's great for a nice summer evening. But if the weather gets bad, then the inside can get very crowded very quick.
