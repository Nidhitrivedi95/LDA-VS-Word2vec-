vlJsF5tTfplbo1D5kbUPmQ I already have two favorite restaurants in Phoenix and this may become my third! The food is so delicious it makes addicts out of its consumers. Now, I'm no Italian food expert (I'm not an expert anything except maybe smartass) but I can't remember when I've had better than Aiello's. 

This eatery has everything going for it - the food, waitstaff, atmosphere, and who I assume is the owner - a jovial, and often times loud, older man presumably in his 60's. He obviously knows how to run a damn fine restaurant. Each time I've been to Aiello's he's out at least checking on each table, usually stopping by to chat, and often times delivers your bill along with a fun game of chance where the stakes are a free meal on the house! I love this guy - he's the proverbial cherry on top of a superb dining experience. 

I could go on about how every entree I've sampled has damn near redefined what I think I know about Italian cuisine, or I could extol upon the virtues of their attentive and pleasant waitstaff. But what you really need to know is that you're missing out if you've never been!    =P

With no hesitation, I'd award Aiello's 5 stars.
