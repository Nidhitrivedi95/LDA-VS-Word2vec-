RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ While the view is spectacular, I was a little disappointed in the taste of the food. We all chose the first and second recommendations of the waiter.  Beef cheeks were a great appetizer. 
The salads took over 45 minutes to arrive; however, the main dishes did come in a more timely fashion.  The wait staff was very nice.

Go for drinks and the view!
