u71djaZjecGVU1MqMevQ4g I've been to many really nice Italian restaurants, and have to say that my experience at Sotto Sotto was amazing!

Was there with a large party for my wife's birthday, and they were easily able to accommodate us upstairs without any real issues.  Overall, the service was excellent.  our waiter was very attentive, and was very knowledgeable of the menu.  We didn't even ask until afterwards, but he provided us separate bills, and didn't have ridiculous gratuities added on top.

In terms of food, everything I ate from the salad, to the burrata, to their pasta was on point and worth every penny.  I found the portions of the pasta to be quite a bit larger than I would expect at other 5* italian restaurants, so left the restaurant pleasantly full.  I didn't have any fish, but the other patrons who did were raving over how well cook and delicious their fish was.  Overall, had a great experience and I am already looking forward to my next meal there.
