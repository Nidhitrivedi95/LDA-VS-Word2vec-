nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg Honestly if I could give no stars I would. I can't comment on the food, but the service is to be lacking. We had a reservation for 8, we showed up early and they couldn't seat us. I get that, but there were 2 large open tables. They claimed they had other reservations, and it turns out the other reservations were late (30 min late). I was sitting at the bar the whole time and heard them talking crap about us and rolling their eyes. Also who has a plaque for a 'B' rating!? They do. Hope you have better luck than us.
