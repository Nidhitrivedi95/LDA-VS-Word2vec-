lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ Walking from Mandalay Bay to the Luxor, we were hungry and saw this Pizza place.  There are two options, sit-down or quick "order by the slice" counter seating/to go.  We decided to stop by the quick side and order a couple of slices to dine at the counter.

It's a typical "order by the slice" joint....you select your Pizza slice and they re-heat it and call your number to pick it up.  We ordered 2 slices of Cheese Pizza.

It didn't take too long for the Pizza to be ready.  The Pizza itself was forgettable though.  It was a little Salty and lacked flavor beyond the Salt.  The Crust was a bit like cardboard, very tough.....there's a difference between chewy and tough....I like chewy, but dislike "tough" dough.

Overall, we felt like we wasted calories.
