skQ-HIR664Ivp2-A4kOfnA OK. So its a good restaurant, but the only reason I come is for the baked spaghetti. I always order a large portion and love it! However, as of today you can't get large anymore. Just 1/2 size orders. Not willing to pay $22 for what used to be $16. They also have zero microbrews on tap and their seasonal beer is PBR...really? 

Now I have to look elsewhere for baked spaghetti.
