fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w Nothing super great and nothing to disappoint.  It is near the new High Roller / Linq area just off the strip by Flamingo.  It is in a cool new shopping/restaurant district with a pedestrian walk way.  My friend loved her beef wrapped asparagus.  I had a chicken sandwich was fine.  Wasn't impressed with the truffle parmesan fries, they were a little dry.  Lots of tv's to watch sports.  Not overly priced which happens a lot in Vegas.  No wait.
