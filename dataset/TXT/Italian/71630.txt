cA9LmSotIsN3C8zCI94--A Exceedingly kid-friendly, albeit a bit loud, the QMP at Jane & Annette is a cavernous old bank branch.  The massive wood-fired oven churns out delicious, perfectly crafted and baked Neapolitan pies.  The menu is ridiculously simple, and everything we've had is great. The salads are fresh with a great balance of flavors. The pizzas are divided into those with and without red sauce, and have a great combination of toppings. The desserts are great, including the Nutella pizza, the Nutella budino (like a Nutella pudding - it's better if you ask for no whipped cream), topped with sea salt.  I absolutely adore this place, and can think of nothing better than a QMP pie, a bottle of wine, and a snowy night.
