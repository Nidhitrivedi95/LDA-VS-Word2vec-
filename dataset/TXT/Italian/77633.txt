cZAU9Gs-rIv8DvsVp3qUTw Went there with family of 5 unfortunately they only have smaller round tables had to put 2 together worked but still awkward.  Service kind of harried. I ordered a Full Greek salad for $8.95  I received what I would consider a free throw in salad at most places, tiny and basic dressing was ok.  Had Fettuccine Alfredo watery and flavorless. Calzone was good. Pizza was dry, crust was not fluffy or flaky more cardboard like. To many better choices in the neighborhood.
