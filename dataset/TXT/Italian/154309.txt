kzbH1_l7VTSfFFcwTqY6vA What a gem!  There's absolutely nothing wrong with stepping back in time and enjoying a place like Sarafino's when the food and service are still firing on all cylinders.  It feels like a neighborhood Italian joint from decades past and the food is stuck there too (in a perfect way).  It's quality, old school Italian.  The limited menu is supplemented with fresh daily specials and everything is packed with flavor and enormous.  

We had a large business group come in not knowing it was a BYOB, so we hopped in the car and drove down to a state store to grab a mixed half case of good wine, which made for a fun experience in itself.  

Our appetizer pizza was massive, loaded with fresh toppings and shaved cheese, and we couldn't have been happier with it.  This was served alongside the largest charcuterie plate I've ever seen.  They heaped this thing with a mountain of meats, cheeses and marinated Italian veggies....delicious.  

I ordered the Scoglio (not sure on the spelling of that one) pasta special over the homemade gnocchi.  It was packed full of seafood and the red clam sauce was bursting with flavor and lots of basil.  It's one of the best Italian pasta dishes I've had in a very long time.  

I wouldn't hesitate for a second to head back here with friends.  It was really refreshing to step away from the high concept restaurants, the technology and trendy spaces for a night and just hang at an old school Italian spot with simple, delicious food.  Big cities are trying to recreate old spots like this, why bother when the real thing is still here at half the price.
