NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ Went to this restaurant before seeing Penn & Teller.  Didn't have reservations, so we sat at the bar.  Bartender was taking care of at least 15 people at the bar plus drinks for the rest of the restaurant.  Service was slow, but the bartender had a lot to do so it was understandable.  I got the linguini with clams, my husband had mixed seafood linguini.  The food was good, but on the salty side.  We each had two mai tais with dinner.  Surprised to see that they charged $14 each for the mai tais which were small and unremarkable.  Total bill was over $160.  I wish we had noticed that we could have saved 25% by showing them the stub of our Penn & Teller tickets.  Won't be going back there again.
