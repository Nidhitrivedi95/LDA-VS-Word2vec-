lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ We had a simple 12' pizza and a 32 ounce beer, which they let you keep the class. 
The pizza was super thin crust, we had mushrooms, garlic and green peppers on it. It was hot and very fresh and tasty, can't wait to go back here again. Delicious, and our waiter Brent was really welcoming and helpful, thank you, Brent.
