9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Thanks to a recommendation and other Yelp reviews, I found myself here on a Saturday night for dinner. Used the mobile check-in and only waited about 40 minutes. Live music in the patio and beautiful lighting/atmosphere helped pass the time.

Sat at a table near the bar, greeted by the waiter and promptly served waters and given menus. Started with the 3 bruschetta appetizer. Delicious! Prosciutto and fresh mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and basil, and a savory bean topping. For pizzas we ordered the Rustica and another with prosciutto and Italian sausage. Crispy crust and fresh ingredients, what more could you ask for? The arugula on the Rustica was a nice green and great aroma.  Cheese was perfectly melted as well. For dessert, enjoyed a simple Nutella crepe (light and fluffy) with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream.  

The lighting and decor of the refurbished homestyle restaurant is comfortable and inviting. Definitely recommend for an evening out and delicious food.
