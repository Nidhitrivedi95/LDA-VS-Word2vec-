G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q My husband & I are locals & were anxious to celebrate our anniversary at Giada's on 12/15/16.  We had eaten there one year ago and were anxious to return.  We were extremely disappointed in the food and service.  My husband's Tomahawk pork chop was dry & overdone.  My ravioli was barely warm.  I sent it back & by the time they brought me a hot dish, my husband was done eating.  The woman who was our waiter was not friendly.  When a manager finally brought me my dinner, he didn't apologize or seem to care about our dining experience.  The food & service has definitely gone down hill.
