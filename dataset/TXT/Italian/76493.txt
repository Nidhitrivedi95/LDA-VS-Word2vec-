CUGswyxGdkcd4IE1oHc80A I'd  been to Vespa prior when it was more of a 'traditional' italian resto and I was less than impressed with overpriced uninspired food.  Now that it is more of a pizzeria we thought we would give it a shot.

Well, the food is certainly improved.  The arancini appetizer was nicely done, with a spicy arrabiata sauce.  The pizzas, although nowhere near the quality of a Pizzeria Libretto or Good Son, was decent and the best you will find in Liberty Village.  There was a constant stream of takeout pizza heading out the door while we were there.

Clearly, lots of people have experienced Vespa's biggest weakness and avoid it by ordering takeout.  The service is glacially slow!  

We waited at least 45 minutes between each course.  Although the staff was apologetic, it was unacceptable and ruined what could have been an enjoyable meal.

Unfortunately, we won't be back.
