ZS3l1Q7InA5h4R8nMcFRwg I went to Noce for lunch with my dad a couple months ago and the experience was most enjoyable. The patio out front is beautiful, covered but sunny (my favourite kind) and it's a great place to people watch on Queen. The service was fantastic and we had a long chat with the owner about when to vacation in Italy (September) and about how business was going. 

I had La Caprese salad (buffalo mozzarella and oven roasted tomatoes) to start and it was so simple and delicious I could have eaten 10 plates. I also dared to try my dad's carpaccio (raw beef) and it melted in my mouth - I definitely recommend it. For my main course, I ordered their fish of the day which was a sea bass with vegetables and potatoes and it was very tasty. 

Noce is truly Italian dining at it's finest and the prices fit accordingly.  This is not a place for those on a budget, but if you really want a delicious Italian meal, this is the place to be. 

A little trivia - Noce means walnut in Italian.  The restaurant is located on the corner of Queen St. W and Walnut Ave.
