Rwg1NJ5r2bywahYq44bB9A This place is awesome and I can say that because I am one of the owners daughters.  My mom puts her whole heart and soul into every meal that is prepared.  My dad is a class act he loves people and they love him.  From the time you enter the door everyone becomes family to us.  I truely believe this place is one of the best kept secrets in the Pittsburgh area.  If your looking for a place with old fashioned, homemade meals that are made to order this is the place to go.  I promise you will not be disappointed.
