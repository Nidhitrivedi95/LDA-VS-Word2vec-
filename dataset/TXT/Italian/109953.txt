G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q It was pretty good aside from a long wait. The bread and pesto is to die for. However, The food is slightly overpriced. They had a photo booth for people waiting I thought that was super fun.  This place is perfect for a nice long lunch with a friend. They had many staff members there to help you but you do have to wait a while for the food (especially main dishes) come out. All in all, a pretty good place.
