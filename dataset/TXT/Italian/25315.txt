4HGVxC-zIeQnR1CsD9GePQ Due to Yelp, my husband and I have been trying out some new restaurants. I prefer owner operated (What I call real restaurants) verses chain.
Tutti Santi is a true gem! I am of Italian-Lithuanian heritage, and have been a personal chef. Tutti Santi is the real deal.
We started off splitting calamari fritti, OMG! Perfectly cooked. We both had soup of the day, it was called minestrone but it was a vegetable soup(no beans, no pasta) good flavor. Then I elected to have the Homemade Ravioli so delicate, they literally melted in my mouth. Bob had the lasagna, again a triumph. We split a tiramisu, Bob had a great rich cup of coffee to go with it. Also the bread basket had a homemade herb foccacio and herb butter to die for.
Bob and I, both of us from the NY-NJ area, agreed it was the BEST ITALIAN FOOD we had ever eaten. (and this is from one who has made ravioli and pasta from scratch many times. I want to go in the kitchen and find out their secrets).
Our meal was $65 with out tip; WORTH EVERY Penny!
Don't miss this one
