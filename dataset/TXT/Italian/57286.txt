anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg It's fun getting off the Strip in Vegas when you have the chance.  Piero's was just a short cab ride from the Wynn where I was staying.

I'm a bar guy and sat at the bar last Thursday night for dinner.  Like others have said this place has a classic retro Vegas feel.  My Caesar salad, steak and creamed corn were very good.  My only rough spot was when they brought out my steak half way through my salad.  That's a major no-no in my book.

This place has been around forever and is still going strong.  It's fun to see the owner schmoozing with the guests.  If you're an attractive woman you're sure to get some attention from him!
