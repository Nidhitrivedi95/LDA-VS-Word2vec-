cOWXtCz7F9GQhPIks8gm6Q Found this place while  walking around the Camelback Esplanade. Small place, all the tables and booths were taken or reserved in the back intimate section, so we sat at one of the high top tables closer to the front of the restaurant.  They also have outside patio which is  probably great when the weather is not above 100.  No misters so we opted for the high top tables.  The food was very good, our server Richard, made our visit enjoyable.  He was personable, knew the menu and checked in on us.  My friend and i had appetizers from the Happy Hour menu, he had the House meatballs (3 large beef/pork mixture meatballs), I had the Bruschetta, Buratta, lemon oil, cracked black pepper, mozzarella and basil)  Both of our appetizers were great.  Didn't care much for the Negroni, I'm more of a fruity drink person and switched out the red Sangria instead and it was wonderful!  For entrees, we ordered the Shrimp Scampi Tagliatelle and Salmon Cakes Calabrian chili aioli, local greens, tomato jam was good...the tomato jam was on the local greens and it was interesting...wasn't bad, just interesting.
