O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ I chose Sassi as the venue for our family's Mother's Day brunch celebration expecting an excellent culinary experience. It was absolutely the worst brunch I've ever had in the Valley. A total waste of money $55 + 20% gratuity automatically added to bill + tax = $70 per person. The menu and selections were uninspiring and limited for a buffet. The bakery items were staled, hard as a rock and non edible. Breakfast frittata and quiche- like item was as cold as dog's nose and cut into bite size pieces more appropriate as pass around appetizers vs a main. Fresh fruit had an after taste like it hadn't been thoroughly washed. Kids table offered pizza that tasted worse than a supermarket frozen variety. The desserts were as disappointing as the rest of meal. Gelato was more like ice milk from a cheap ice cream spot. Horrible. Simply horrible. Don't waste your money when there are so many other wonderful spots for exquisite holiday brunches.
