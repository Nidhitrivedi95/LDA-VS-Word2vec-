LhWwwDJ2l79a1tHrpcdK6A I've never had "authentic" Italian food before, so I really have nothing to compare this to, but I've thoroughly enjoyed the food both times I've been here.

The decor is very clean and modern from the moment you walk through the door. It's very spacious as well. The ambience is just terrific. I had exceptional service the first time I went, but the service the second time was considerably slower. 

My friends and I ordered the goat cheese and avocado bruschetta as an appetizer and it was phenomenal. Highly recommended. I can't really remember the exact dish I had for dinner, but it contained salmon and I did enjoy that as well. My friends and I also ordered a pitcher of sangria and although it did taste good, for the price it really isn't worth it.

I can't really complain about my experiences here and I will definitely be back in the future!
