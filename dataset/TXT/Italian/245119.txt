UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Great service ( Anna) and great food! We had the flatbread  for appetizers and with a party of 6 had a variety of entrees.  I had braised short ribs with Brussel sprouts ( no pecans - I'm allergic)and polenta.  Others at the table had salmon, crab cakes , lasagna, chicken Caesar salad and shrimp alfredo.
