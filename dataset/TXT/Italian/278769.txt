YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ Am I missing something here?? Some pretty positive reviews for this place but it's average at best. For a place that specializes in pasta, you'd expect that to be top notch. I gave it a try since I pass by it everyday. Got an order of the red rigatoni and a baked ziti. The pasta for both dishes were overcooked and the sauce was nothing special. The baked ziti had globs of ricotta so if you weren't careful you'd get a mouthful of it. I seriously can get better sauce from a jar. I know a lot of folks have commented on the picking your ingredients part. Well that's available elsewhere too. It's called grocery shopping people. You could make better stuff at home.  If my kitchen burned down and I really wanted some pasta maybe I would stop by just because it's close to my house. Even then I would still prefer Buca di Beppo or even Olive Garden.
