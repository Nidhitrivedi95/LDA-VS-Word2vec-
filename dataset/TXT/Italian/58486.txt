aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA I like this place! The music can be pretty loud, so makes visiting with friends over dinner somewhat difficult. However, our service has Bern excellent every time we've been there. Be aware - the salads are enormous. My husband and I ordered a large salad to split. We could only eat half of it and saved the rest to feed us both for lunch the next day.
All the pasta dishes are good and the serving sizes are huge!
