I love how this place caters to dietary needs. The non-dairy cheese is very good, they also have many gluten free options (pasta and pizza) I have tasted the gluten free crust before, and I have to say, I think I liked it better than the whole grain crust! 

It's nice you can custom order your pizza, just be aware that it will probably come out even more expensive than if you order from the regular menu. If you decide to get a whole grain crust, or if you need to order gluten free, it's also going to cost you more because they will not make small sizes with those crusts. It has to be medium. I ordered a whole grain vegetarian pizza with dairy-free cheese....it came out to be like 25 bucks...yikes! BUT, you do get what you pay for.....quality ingredients, and hey, they know how to make pizza! 

Service is great! Very friendly and helpful staff. And they have happy hour 3-6. I wish I could do regular cheese, because I would for sure come in for their one slice with a salad lunch option......oh well, at least Picazzos gives me a pretty good version of what I used to enjoy! Thanks Picazzos!
