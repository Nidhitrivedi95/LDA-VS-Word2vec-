CKJnoUSWocdVIj6Fqbgm5g My hubs and I found The Red Tomato as we were walking around trying to decide what we wanted for dinner.  It was freezing, and after a half hour of walking it was the only thing we could agree on.  It's down some stairs, below another restaurant (the front door is used for both). After walking in and being seated, I had serious doubts about this place, but I was happily proven wrong. 

We were sat and we were the only people in the restaurant on a Sunday evening. My doubts grew stronger as I read the menu. I mean, what kind of Italian restaurant has gumbo, pork satay, and Peking duck pizza?   None I've ever been to!  I grew up in a very Italian area of upstate NY, I hold Italian food to a higher standard than other types of fare.  By the time we ordered, I wasn't expecting anything better than what may come out of a can.

When I'm wrong, I'm wrong. 

We decided to keep things simple and split a meatball gnocchi and I ordered a Caesar side salad.  The meatballs were large and delicious, cooked perfect and seasoned well.  The gnocchi was cooked perfect, which is hard, because half the time when you order it they come out tasting like dough.  The salad was about twice the size of a regular size salad, and I ended up taking about half of it back to where we were staying to eat the next day.  The Red Tomato was one of the highlights of our trip, and we look forward to returning.
