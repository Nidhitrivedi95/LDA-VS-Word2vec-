FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q Not sure about the high rating but here is my experience.
Went for lunch decor is very outdated and it seems like it was a great place at some point but not today.
Men's bathroom is disgusting where you do not even feel clean washing your hands. 
Food was flavorless and oily almost store bought heated up quality. Pasta was just covered in oil where it basically killed any other flavors and over cooked slightly. 
Waiter was really nice but besides him just an outdated restaurant where their decor customers and food is just not to sound like a dick ....old.
