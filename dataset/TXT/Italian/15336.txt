1rebduwtmrHQhl32djRS7A In regards to the food, the Super Sicilian is quite delicious. There was plenty of meat and cheese which were accompanied with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, dill pickle spear, and a light oil and vinegar dressing. Both my husband and I enjoyed the sandwich greatly! I ordered take out and understanding that I arrived around 3:30, after the lunch hour rush, I was a little disappointed in the overall cleanliness and atmosphere. The floors were dirty, there was trash in the plant, and the table cloths were worn out.
