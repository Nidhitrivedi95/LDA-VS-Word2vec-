10MSnysiOxQehDA_cFCMtg Four of us celebrated an anniversary with dinner here recently. Our table was not available when we arrived and we were sent to the for a pre dinner drink. No problem. We were seated shortly after and our waiter brought menus & water. We were brought bread but no oil & balsamic. We ordered one large Caesar salad for all of us. Very good!
I ordered penne alla vodka. My favourite. Maybe the least tasty version I have ever eaten. It was simply penne in bland tomato sauce, no pancetta, no onion, no flavour! The other 3 diners said their pasta dishes were simply okay. Nothing special. We had two bottles of their less pricy California Merlot and coffee. $320 for 4 with tip. Will not be in a hurry to return.
