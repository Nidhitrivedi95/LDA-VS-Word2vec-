iNhP0ejUf2jVzaR5YCOoEQ This place never disappoints. I first came across this hidden gem years ago for a friends birthday dinner and whether I come here with a large party or with a few friends, service is always commendable. Aside from the service, I have tried many different dishes from the menu and I have never been disappointed. 

They offer a wide selection of pastas and appetizers and for very reasonable prices. I like that they are typically open a little later than most restaurants. I have been coming here sporadically over a number of years and know that I can always count on Remezzo for a delicious, authentic Italian dinner and good service.
