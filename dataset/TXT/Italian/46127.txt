8pmGz3Lg4f_r7HdDZPa4dQ I finally found a place in Las Vegas that makes amazing pizza!!! Pizza is hands down my favorite food of all time and I have struggled to find a good pizza place since moving to Las Vegas almost two years ago. A friend recommended I try this new place that wasn't far from my place and he was so right! New Yorkers know how to make the perfect crust while maintaining the exact amount of cheese and toppings needed! I will be ordering here from now on!
