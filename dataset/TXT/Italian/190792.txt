pbL2-Gej2_lSPXQ-Hn71uA Food was excellent.  Prices very reasonable.  Waitress was very fun.

I had the Wiener Schnitzel and it was very good. My wife had the lemon chicken (it was the recommendation of the server) and she said it was the best chicken she ever had.

We had a group of 10 people. They take reservations, our table was ready, and the entire group loved the experience. We will be back.
