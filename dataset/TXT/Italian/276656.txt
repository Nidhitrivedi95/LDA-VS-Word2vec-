yFUvKpW66cNsYXD6inDsog Food was OK but the service was poor.from the moment we walked in, we were treated like we were interrupting a private staff party. Two waiters eyed us like we were on the red carpet and based on their snickering, we evidently didn't meet their standard.  We arrived at 5:45 and happy hour specials were advertised on the menu and when we asked about them the extremely rude waiter huffed, looked at his watch and said the happy hour specials were only good in the bar not in the restaurant, even though the restaurant menu indicated happy hour until 6 pm.  rather than asking if we wanted anything, he simply walked away and did not return to our table until it was after 6pm. we were going to order full price appetizers but opted not to because of how we were treated.  we would have left if we were not meeting a business collegue.  The waiter continued to be sarcastic throughout our meal and he was completely dismissive of me, deffering completely to the two men I was with. I had been to Tutti's on 16th Street many times and thought I could expect a similar positive experience at this location. Unfortunately, I will never go back and I am not sure I will even return to the 16th street location. Something should be done to help the wait staff understand how they influence the entire dining experience for their customers.
