fbLYRHIZAt3q839whhaBUg Stopped here for lunch for the first time ever with the hubby. Knew that it had to be good if a lunch crowd meant a wait for tables at 1pm. We sat at the bar and were greeted promptly by our server. Ordered from the lunch menu and ordered a pizza slice (pepperoni and portabella) and a side Caesar salad. Our food was brought out quickly. The "lunch" salad portion was huge enough for my husband and I to share. Pizza had the right amount of sauce and the crust was the correct thickness for my liking (thin and crisp!) Our total bill for lunch with drinks plus tip was under $30. The meal was very satisfying and we'd definitely come back!
