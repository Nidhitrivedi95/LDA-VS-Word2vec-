q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Food is definately not the reason to trek to this place. I found the wedding soup inedible and the prices mediocre for below average Italian. Experience was interesting and kitsch, and server was kind and replaced soup without hesitation. Just so many competent restaurants on the strip that made my experience below average.
