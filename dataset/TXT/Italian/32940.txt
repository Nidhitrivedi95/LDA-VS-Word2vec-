5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA I have been searching for a good Italian restaurant in the valley and since this one was close to home I decided to try it.  The view is beautiful but unfortunately the food was bland.  I had a rigatoni with chicken and the food had no flavor.  The breadsticks were so bad that I would rather eat the Olive Garden breadsticks.  The beef carpaccio had a mustard that tasted horrible.  Nothing was positively memorable about this place.  Definitely would not recommend it unless you want a nice view of The Strip.
