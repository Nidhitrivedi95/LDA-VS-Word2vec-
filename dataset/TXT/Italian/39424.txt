Porterhouse steak for two is 90 days dry aged, cooked to perfection with outer crust and medium rare inside. Drizzled with olive oil too!  Waiter will advise you that cooking temperatures are a bit rarer than normal and this is correct. Many steak choices on the menu. 

Awesome food. Best steak in Vegas, cooked and enjoyed the way steak ought to be.
