nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g Went to Terroni's after reading mostly good reviews for our 1 month marriage anniversary. My Aussie wife is in love with pasta and I wanted her to try one of our best. We were very sadly disappointed. We don't eat pork and after mentioning that to the server it seemed like we disappointed him. The menu was hard to read because they tried so hard to seem authentic Italian that they forgot to add enough English. Our server couldn't think of any pasta dish other than 1 that didn't have pork in it. Instead of helping us he provided us with the reason they have pork in everything, "because it is the best and most flavorful meat". I found 2 pasta dishes that didn't have any pork in it. We ordered a Billini, the beef carpacio, the duck ravioli and spinich ricotta ravioli. The bread wasn't great. The carpacio was the best dish although it doesn't come with truffle oil. When the main dishes came there was literally no sauce and about 10 pieces of ravioli. We had to flag the waiter for little while to get extra parmesan to make the food taste better. He never came by to check on us. 
Over all, very mediocre food, very few options if you don't eat pork, garbage service. Can't see myself ever going back. There's more than enough good Italian restaurants in Toronto.
