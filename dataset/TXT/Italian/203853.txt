Q8qsbFqIE7lwA-zkv07fxA Hey Mario, this ain't Manhattan. It's Matthews NC. Cut us some slack on your prices. Last nights dinner was a large pizza with 1/2 sausage (can you slice the sausage any thinner?), 1 children's spaghetti and 4 sodas. $35 BEFORE tip! WTH? The food was good but geesh not $35 good.

Your pizza is good but it's not consistent. Last nights pizza was good. I would suggest asking for the pizza to be prepared well done on the bottom.

Your hoagies (not Subs) are good. But for the love of GOD please train your staff NOT to put Mayo on an Italian hoagie. If you were in NEPA you would be stoned in the town square for putting Mayo on an Italian hoagie.

Your entrees are OK. The side salads are very weak. 

The garlic knots are good and your service is fine. 

We would frequent more often if you weren't so pricey.
