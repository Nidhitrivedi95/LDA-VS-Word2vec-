Q8qsbFqIE7lwA-zkv07fxA Had lunch delivered to my apartment complex. The food was great. I had Spaghetti Alfredo with broccoli and a Greek salad.  The Greek salad was so tasty - I'll definitely order it again. The spaghetti was good also.  I loved how it came with garlic knots. I also appreciated the pleasant person who took my order over the phone and the nice delivery person. Good experience overall and the quality of the food was great! Happy to have found this place.

Over the weekend, I ordered a medium veggie  pie which was also very good. I do have to say that I find them to be expensive. My spaghetti Alfredo dish was $15 and the medium pie was $22.  This might become a "special occasion" place to order from.
