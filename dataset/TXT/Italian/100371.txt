fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w Great, knowledgeable service, but the football game was broadcast throughout the place, whether you could see a TV or not. My slightly dirty martini was two parts olive juice. I asked for just a wee bit of dirtiness. Not what I got. 

The calamari was light, tender and delicious. 

The chicken parm was huge, but it was chicken parm. Nothing special. Plus, the pasta looked liked it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a while. 

And all for only $58. Ahem. 

In a pinch, I'd recommend it, but if you can move beyond the strip into the land of reasonable prices, do.
