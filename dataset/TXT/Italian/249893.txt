I ordered a side salad (lettuce and a couple croutons) and it arrived quickly. We were warned that the stuffed Chicago pizza would take 25 minutes. An entire hour later we got the thinnest crust I've ever seen and every pasta dish was bland. The server didn't check back, made no attempt to appease the ridiculous hour long wait for food and jusy walked away when he asked if everything was delicious and several of us said nit really. Twenty minutes later he came back and offered to bring me something else after an hour wait and everyone else was done eating. Food is bland, wait is long, service sucked. Not going back to waste time or money
