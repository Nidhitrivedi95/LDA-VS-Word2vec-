1) gluten free pasta available!!
2) friendly service
3) very college-y

Ok so first and foremost my view of Tutto Pasta is a little tainted. In college, I always knew Tutto as  a "fancy" date spot. Like a lot of other undergrads I rarely left my bubble of campus and State St. and if a guy was taking you to Tutto you were meeting his parents or about to DTR. I hadn't been since college, but was craving pasta and live in a one block radius so away we go! 

So we walk in and the vibe is still pretty college. LOTS of teens. We were seated right away on a Friday night with no reservation. Our waters and (free!) bread arrived promptly. However, we then waited about 10 minutes before seeing our server to put in drink orders. When the service did arrive though, our server was friendly and apologetic for the wait. 

We ordered house wine, the baked eggplant appetizer, the gluten free (YES!) alfredo, and the tortellini. The wine was mehhhh. I mean it was house wine so I should have had lower expectations but it was pretty unimpressive. Our entrees arrived before our appetizer, and our server then asked if we still wanted the appetizer. The pasta was pretty good! The gluten free pasta was cooked well and the sauce was great. No frills though, just noodles and sauce. My fiancé enjoyed his tortellini, but we both agreed we have had better pasta dishes. Our appetizer arrived right when we finished eating our entrees. It was good, but it would have been nice to actually have as an app. Our wines were free (our apartment has a partnership with Tutto) but even with that our bill was still about $45. Tutto isn't expensive but I think the price tag is higher than the quality of meal you get.

The location is convenient and sometimes you just want "run of the mill" Italian. Worth a stop in if you haven't been or really want some g free pasta.
