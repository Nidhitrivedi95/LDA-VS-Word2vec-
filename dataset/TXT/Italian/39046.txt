7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA We had a Fancy Nancy party for our two year old here. As usual, the food was fantastic. What was even better was their overall attitude and excitement in being part of a bunch of crazies all dressed up in what a 2 year old thinks is fancy attire. They were helpful in every way possible. This is our favorite pizza place for many reasons and we'll keep going back.
