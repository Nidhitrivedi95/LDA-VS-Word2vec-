Next was the PEI appetizer that was the next bad sign - the sauce really lacked in flavor. That was on the precursor to the main course. I went with the baked rigatoni with boar meat and mozzarella cheese. Sounded great but it was hardly that. Again, absolutely no flavor and the noodles were certainly not homemade. In my opinion, if you're going to charge $24 for a small portion of pasta it better be pretty darn good, or at the least be full of flavor. Never in my life had I had to consider putting salt on my pasta. I've had better pasta at Olive Garden and spent half the amount. Service was pretty slow, especially considering we went early and the place wasn't crowded. We will be taking are money elsewhere in the future and our search for authentic Italian continues. If you truly enjoy authentic Italian food, avoid this place like the plague.
