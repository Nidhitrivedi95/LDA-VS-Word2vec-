QyiuN41DV7xe8Wc75427Hg THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE PIZZA, ONLY.

This pizza (sausage, pepperoni, garlic, X-cheese) was awesome.  I ordered the thin crust.  I am not a fan of thin crust, but wanted to try.  The dough (crispy) was perfect.  The pizza had the right amount of herbs and spices.  It tasted a bit salty, but I have found that when corn meal is used as the paddle layering, the taste is always a bit salty.  The corn meal, rather than flour, is the perfect layering for the oven.  

I'm going to have to try the standard crust, just to compare, but this is the best I have had in this area.  Nino's in Glendale is close, but that shop is too far to bring back a hot pizza.  And, it is the best I have had since moving here from Philadelphia.
