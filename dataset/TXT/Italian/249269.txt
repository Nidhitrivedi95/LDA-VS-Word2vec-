viji5rHhNlsy9w-JmUhyaw Been here before for dinner and had a good experience. But this time for lunch it wasn't. It wasn't bad but, well let me explain. 

It started off good. My gf and I were greeted at the door and led to a table. They just opened for lunch so we were maybe the third party in. Our server offered some wine to try but declined, just ordered a coke for me and an ice tea for my gf. 

Drinks came out then we put in our order, my gf had the soup and salad (endless) and I had the steak and chicken skewers and soup. Shrimp for appetizer.

Appetizer came out pretty quick. After that her salad and my soup were next. Then it went downhill. I know our server was busy with a party of nine that came in after us, but it was like we were forgotten. 

My bowl was taken away but no refill for my gf's ice tea.  We waited like 30 minutes then our server came by and apologized saying they overcooked my steak and that the manager would come out and talk to us and possibly take our appetizer off the bill. Maybe five minutes later the manager came out and apologized and did remove the appetizer from our bill which was nice. Supposedly they screwed up my order but all the while my gf never got her soup!?! A total wait time of about 40 minutes then my order came out with my gf's warm (not hot) bowl of soup. She didn't want to complain just wanted to eat and get out of there. Don't blame her. She did finally get a ice tea refill! Yay! My food was okay kinda lost my appetite by then. She was never asked if she wanted to try any other soups. (endless my ass).

The manager did take care of the long wait for our food but there were more problems than that. Like I said we've been here before for dinner and left completely satisfied. Maybe this was just a fluke but I can only give them 2 stars.
