If you like good Italian casual dining with lots of choices and great value, this is why locals flock to Oreganos and it also explains their growth in the Phoenix area.  Love their lunch pizzas.  Very good but hard to finish.  Have to take some home for later.  Salads are LARGE.  Sandwiches are exceptional in choice and quality.  Also, have to take some home for later.  LARGE.  Haven't tried the pasta dishes, but they are popular and in some cases unlimited.  Pizzas are also very good and come in a large variety, thin crust or deep dish.  Easy to see why I always want to return, which I do. Oh yes, they offer you a traveler--your soft drink or tea in a container when you are on the road.  Makes me feel good.
