Both my girlfriend and I , who ate there for our fourth anniversary dinner, had the absolute worst food poisoning of our lives after the meal. And we know exactly what it was-we split an order of the fried calamari. It was the only thing we shared all night and it was delicious, but six hours later it hit us and we were in for about 16 hours of nearly non-stop vomitting and other unpleasantness (which was made much worse by the fact that we had to take the train home that day). In fact I just woke up after passing out immediately on arrival and sleeping for 15 hours. Absolutely ruined the second half of our vacation.
