lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ It was a nice little Sunday afternoon of sightseeing but it was time for some football. The Bills/Raiders game just started and I was looking desperately for a decent bar that was showing the game. I had previously visited 3 bars but the TV's were either small or scarce. As I walked into Slice of Vegas, I noticed that it was impossible to have a bad seat so a friend and I decided to have a seat at the bar. I asked if one of the TV's in front of us could be changed to the game and the bartender kindly obliged. I checked in via Yelp and received a 15% discount. I knew right then that I was at the perfect place.

When I found out they offered pizza by the slice, I decided to order a pepperoni along with some Stella. It was a blissful 3 hours. The bartenders and manager were really friendly and funny. If I lived in Vegas, I would definitely return for some yummy bar food, beer, and football.
