i0bD4WCmVHdK92L73CNbgQ Amazing big coffee shop in Yorkdale mall, they serve a lot of unique coffee specialty drinks and nice desserts as well. The cafe has wonderful seating including a big balcony where you can oversee the mall. Give their 5 grain muffins a try as well as their ice cream coffees. The traffic flow could use some work at illy as even with a small amount of people it got a little slow and confusing. This place is comparable to somewhere like Aroma or Starbucks.
