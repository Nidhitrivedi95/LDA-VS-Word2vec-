tovUJgSCxi2JfUtP9eNQcA We come to Barro's Pizza in Surprise at least 2 times a month. The pizza is great and extremely consistent. Their dough, cheese, and sauce is definitely primo! It is a very family friendly place although it is a bit pricier than other pizza places...but it is worth it. I would definitely suggest the original crust cheese pizza and the medium boneless wings. The wing sauce is awesome! 
If you are looking for a great lunch spot as well, Barro's is great. Everyday until 4pm they have slices of pizza for $1.75. As well as a speciality pizza of the day. Saturdays is Kona and that is hands down my favorite pizza they make! Today my husband and I got 3 slices of pizza, a salad, and a large drink for $9.00. That is a great deal for 2 people. 
I didn't give Barro's five stars because their delivery times and service needs some work. Their delivery times are never under an hour and the couple of times we did order delivery our order was wrong and cold. So if you want hot pizza and hot wings I would definitely suggest dining in.
