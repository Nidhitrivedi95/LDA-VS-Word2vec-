Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA Stopped by after getting off the high roller the other night because  I REALLY wanted pizza. I bought a slice at their to go stand outside the actual restaurant and left wishing I bought more to take on the way back to the hotel. Soooo good that we decided to come back and eat inside the restaurant and I'm so glad we did. Awesome food awesome service an awesome experience overall. Definitely coming back here next time I'm in town.  I love pizza.
