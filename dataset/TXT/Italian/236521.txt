Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA Took a co-worker for lunch here and it never disappoints! We sat up at the bar and we both ordered the lunch special (any 1/2 pizza and 1/2 salad of your choice). I decided to keep it pretty basic this trip and just get the pepperoni pizza and caesar salad. My co-worker got the caesar salad and the margarita pizza. She really enjoyed it as much as I did too. The bartender was great too! Her customer service was top notch!!

I will certainly be back soon!!!
