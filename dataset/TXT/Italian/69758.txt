bXbCGFk3ZjLcTdQQB-xPyQ If you are looking for great Italian food and a classy atmosphere Luciano's would be my recommendation. The prices are great for the quality of service and food that is offered at Luciano's. I had the Lobster ravioli special and it is definitely some of the best Italian I've eaten. 

They also have half off wine sections on Wednesday!
