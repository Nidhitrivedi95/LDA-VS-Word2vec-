jluEI1ZDQDeJlbl-M3YH3Q Went for a dinner with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day , place is nice food was decent wasn't really happy with the server that was serving me kinda gross caught him picking his nose and then putting the Remains in a serving napkin , was very disgusted by this and still thinking about it till this day he also served me water and something was floating in it (in the back of my mind his booger) and ended up drinking my boyfriends water as a result.. Defiantly will not be returning to this restaurant and wouldn't recommend it unless you are interested in eating human remains
