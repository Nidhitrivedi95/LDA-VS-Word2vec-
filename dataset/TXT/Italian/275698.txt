Ya9FMj-MWMkeMcog06N5bQ The first thing I do when someone says "we are going to this place X" is look it up on yelp. So when my bf said "we are going to Bar Louie" I did just that and was totally turned off because of the reviews and didn't want to go, but we were meeting friends, so it was what it was. 
Maybe it was the low expectations, but I thought it was really good. Our server was nice and prompt delivering things. I got the blackened fish sandy and the bf got the chicken sandy and we really liked both of them. Our friends were also happy with the food. 
I see what people are saying about the crowd. It definitely sways a little older (we are mid 30's) but honestly it was more mixed than anything. It was loud and fun and a good place for cocktails and a bite.
