MY-rY-BUoQ9EVQJ5hCXnCA Hmmm, this is a tough one.  I gave it 4 stars for the food, which was very good, but the vibe isn't really to my taste.  It's old-school, business district Italian...think tuxedoed waiters, wine cellars and steaks.

The pastas (all 3) were very good and the salads acceptable.  The complementary bruschetta, however, was excellent - among the best I've had.  The service was friendly and attentive.

The wandering guitar player was unobtrusive and enjoyable.

Next time we'll go to little Italy, but this place was recommended by a friend as his favourite in the city, and he has good taste.  I believe it has an excellent wine cellar.
