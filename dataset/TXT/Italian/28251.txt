4YKU46PNs-wCi3TAafrRaQ I love Barro's Pizza although I had never been to this location before. A previous reviewer commented on the bad smell and, unfortunately, the intensity of that smell was understated. It was so bad that I found myself gagging after we walked in and we had to leave. There is clearly a mold or sewer problem that needs to be addressed.
