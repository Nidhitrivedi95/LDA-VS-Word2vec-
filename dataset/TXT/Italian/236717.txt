tWdp26XQEJqJGnRmFVJQxA Everyone here was great. We did not have reservations, so the owner had his sister give us her seat at the bar. We sat next to his wife and son, they were great!

We had the fire roasted tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and arugula for an appetizer. It was amazing and filling. Super fresh dish and the flavors meshed well!

For dinner we had the canadese pizza this is a traditional Italian pizza with great crust. It was also delicious!!! Everything tasted very fresh. My wife and I couldn't finish the pizza. We were stuffed!! 

The owner asked how everything was and we chatted for a bit. During the chat, he found out my wife and I were on our honeymoon. He gave is a free tiramisu and two dessert shots with espresso, Bailey's, and pure magic!!!! It was quite the gesture. He congratulated is on our marriage and we both had huge smiles.

The food is great and the staff is great. Everyone was happy to be there. If we are back in Toronto, we're coming back for sure! Definitely eat here you will not regret it.
