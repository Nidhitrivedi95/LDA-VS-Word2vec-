Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A What a great experience! I've been here once before, but that was years ago. Our server was excellent. She was very knowledgable about wine, and made some great suggestions. You could tell that she loves what she does. My fiancé ordered the Strozzapreti (veal ragu), and I ordered the Coniglio Pljukanci (braised rabbit with pasta.) I substituted my pasta for sautéed vegetables since I am gluten free. While they do offer a gluten free pasta, I opted for the vegetables. The dish that came out was amazing. It was bright, colorful, and everything worked together so well. I had 3 different servers say that it was such a great idea, and that they wanted to try the dish that way for dinner. It was delicious. The veal was also quite tasty! We will definitely be back.
