TFftsYkRIUtdo6ZhRwJ2lQ Terroni is a place you can find yourself coming back to often. Is has that chill vibe and balance where it's acceptable for both very casual or dressy occasions. Their menu is classic and their service is pretty consistent. You could hang out here for awhile and not realize how much time has past. You get the complete experience ^^
