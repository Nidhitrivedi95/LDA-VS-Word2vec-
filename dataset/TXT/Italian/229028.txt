sZMliOne4mADZ2-CqeanZg I had a lovely end of term Christmas dinner at Bar One! They were able to accomodate a group of about 15 of us despite being a pretty small place. They also let us bring a cake and were okay with separate bills - grazie Bar One.

The menu is quite long (and comes strapped to a clip board with an elastic band - random?), and has a good mix of vegetarian/meat/seafood dishes. The focus is on Calabrian-style homemade pasta and pizza. I had the mushroom papardelle pasta with a light tomato sauce. I loved it - full of garlic and large pieces of forest mushrooms. A couple of friends ordered the gnocchi, which looked quite good, but they  described the sauce as lacking "something."  I also tried a bite of the portobello, smoked provolone and hot pepper pizza, which was fantastic. The smoked provolone added so much flavour, and the crust was thin and crisp. 


Overall, the restaurant and service was great. Main dishes are about $15-$20, and the wine list had a great mix of expensive/inexpensive wines. I would definitely recommend for a date or small party.
