8axxI33rUyswfRk_v3vS0A Family friendly Italian restaurant. Not the cheapest place to eat, but great food. Pizzas are very good, especially calzone.
Bright clean decor, always lots of covers, friendly staff.
Their takeaway menu is good, just about any combination of pizza toppings to be had, plus a nice selection of pasta dishes and italian bread.
