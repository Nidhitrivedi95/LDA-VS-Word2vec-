w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A Warm french bread and NY style pizza was excellent. A little disappointed with the way they handled my Entertainment Book coupon. The waitress assured us that the coupon will work fine, and at the end she said her manager wasn't able to approve the coupon (which coincidentally happened to be around closing time). We ended up spending $20 more than we anticipated. As a frugal blogger, this leaves a horrible taste in my mouth.
