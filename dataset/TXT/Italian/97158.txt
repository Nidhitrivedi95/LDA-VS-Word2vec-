EsCpkEQo_3wFw5gP-Pz6GA Hey it's Domino's Pizza, nothing special or outstanding to cal home about. I go here when the children wants some pizza and it's cheap. As for the adult palette you may want to venture elsewhere in Mount Holly or go to Gastonia because you won't find it here. The location is extremely small or cozy to my snobs out there and they do have a drive through which is helpful for those time when you don't want to get out of the car in the rain to get your pizza..

The workers are cool and accommodating. Again, I've been here quite often and the pizza is good for children, they like it and it's cheap. Can't say much else that you wouldn't figure out on your own.
