OMf69ePEdHXvaqAlCCI01A I was prospecting in the area and John, the Chef was walking around passing out their Spinach Rolls with marinara sauce to the local businesses. He offered me one gladly and I was happy to accept. The rolls were mouth watering! The dough was fresh, the cheese and spinach delicious, and the marinara was so flavorful! 

A day later I ate there again and had a slice of pizza. It was inexpensive and huge! The pizza melted in my mouth and I finished the whole thing. 

The staff was friendly and I like the family-owned atmosphere they have and open kitchen. 

I would recommend this place to anyone and can't wait to go back; I am glad they are in my territory :)
