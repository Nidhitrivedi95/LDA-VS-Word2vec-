1. Totally agree with the food, especially the meat, being super dry
2. The pizzas were one of the few acceptable foods
3. Tried 3 different types of pasta and they either had too little sauce or were too greasy
4. Seafood was absolutely terrible
5. Soups were too salty for my taste
6. Desserts haven't changed much, average quality

On a positive note, Frankie's handles bigger parties very well and the overall design of the restaurant allows easy access to the buffet wherever your table is. They are also known for birthday celebrations because the waiters come and sing for you with some recorded music.
