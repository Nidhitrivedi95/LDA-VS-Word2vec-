R1AVTniig8uZfPy_2ObRQg The most subpar pizza shop in Vegas. It's not awful by it isn't good either it is just there. It is over priced and ali who made our pizza didn't listen to our order and had it ready 20 min before our scheduled pick up. I guess he was just trying to get out of work early because our scheduled pick up was 20 min before close. Needless to say the pizza was cold when we arrived. I'll stick to my regular pizza place because this was just a fail.
