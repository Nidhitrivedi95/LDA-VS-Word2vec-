1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ Delish! I didn't have the opportunity to dine in, as we were picking up food for our company party, but I have to say the take out area was convenient and the girls were very friendly and organized. It helped that the Take out was seperate from the main enterance and that they had curb side pull up (Take note: lunch hour is VERY busy).

I had the pleasure of having a lil bit of everything we ordered, being that this was my first 'expereince with Maggiano's I wanted to ensure of course that I gave it a fair shot on my review ha. Who are we kidding, the food was amazing. The lasagna with meat sauce, Chicken Parm, Chopped salad and Caesar salad all delicious. 

We got the 1/2 orders of the catered dishes, which for all of the above (which came with rolls) was enough for an office of 16. The food portions were perfect with leftovers to spare.

Looking forward to experiencing the dining in abiance, in the near future!
