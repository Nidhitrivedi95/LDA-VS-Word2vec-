P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw I was on the road looking for Lola's and I had the wrong address.  Luckily I had my laptop with me and I had to go to a McDonalds to use their "free" WiFi.  Well.... I felt compelled to buy something so I got a quarter pounder meal deal for about $7 just to use their WiFi.  I found I was closer to Naked City Pizza, so I decdied to try this place.  I walk into this dive bar where it so dark, it took time for the eyes to adjust.  I asked where the restaurant is and they said I'm standing in it.  I sat at one of about 6 tables and proceeded to be shocked by what was being served in that environment.  We're talking white china style plates with silverware.  No paper plates and plastic forks.  I had the caeser salad which was very good.  The dressing tasted homemade, but can't be sure.  I had the garlic cheese buns and the small Royal sandwhich.  The buns are incredible. They are just pizza dough rolled with garlic and cheese.  Baked and served with a marinara dipping sauce.  They serve 5 per order.  This was great becasue they are fresh out of the oven. I only ate one and took the rest to my hotel.  My Royal sandwich was on a nice toasted Italian roll with their homemade sausage.  The fennel flavor of the sausage was WOW.  All that food for about $20.  Don't be afraid to walk in this dive looking bar. The food is well worth it.
