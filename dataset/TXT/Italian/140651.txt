JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw First the Décor has a great vibe to it. Mix of modern materials with and old world feel and everything comes together clean. Some points off for crammed seating though in some sections, as it's not far off from the cafeteria at grade school. At least there are no tater tots on the menu. 

The menu is huge. Most items are good to great. Meats are juicy and tender and pasta's are well prepared. The Gnocchi nocks it out of the park though, I will not waver from that from now on. 

Service is usually excellent....Always prompt, friendly and great bus service.  Might not be the most knowledgeable, which is understandable considering the huge wine list and menu. Still I would rather take prompt and nice over  a slow rude server who just happens to know how salty Soppressata is. My only complaint ever is I received a voice message to confirm a reservation and call back (which is strange in itself) , only to be hung up on when I did call back.  It's 5PM weekday reservation we're talking about here, I did not realize that would require me to play "India call center". . Ah Well.

Price is up there, but you get what you pay for. If you hit up Happy hour though, the value makes it 5*
