H3cMcV9KK3g2pi68lDNsng Went for brunch and was totally ignored by hostess while she looked at us and decided to serve coffee and then answer phone. Was not that busy at 11:00 with only a few tables filled in main dining area. The hostess walked us into the dining area toward a table for four and then stopped abruptly and said since there was only two of us we could sit by the kitchen or take a high table in the other room with the bar. We took the high table and then watched her seat two younger ladies at the table for four we "couldn't have". She then sat two more women at another open table for four in the room with the bar. Our server was very cordial and friendly and took our order. She brought our mimosas quickly as well as my husband's coffee. After waiting for a while another server brought my husband's home fries but neither of our main dishes. We waited another 15 minutes before our food came and by then the potatoes were cold. No offers of refill on coffee. We finally grabbed our server and asked for bill. After finally getting check, we waited another 15 minutes when my husband took check to bar. Bartender refused to take it and said server would take care of us. Waited another 5 minutes. SERViCE is terrible not worth the good food. We will go back to Stone Mad. Not returning!
