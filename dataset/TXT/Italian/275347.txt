yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg Made a reservation for 730 on a Saturday night (a busy time...obviously). Showed up at 725 to find a long line full of other kind folks in small parties (2-3 people) who had made reservations and were waiting to be seated while other groups of folks walked up and got seated immediately.......needless to say we left (so, no I didn't try the food...I'm sure it's great but I don't take my business to places that treat customer's this way). Working in the industry has soured me on places like this. Customer service is the ultimate....if you take reservations you should keep them and be fair with your seating priorities.
