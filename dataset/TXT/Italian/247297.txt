VA95qAV2PRH9gtTi2Vfv4Q The place definitely has potential, but I was sat upstairs and the space was so cramped. The waiter/waitresses has to squeeze by our table to reach other tables behind me. It was not very comfortable.

Aside from that, the food was quite underwhelming. The pasta I got was overcooked and the sauce tasted like it came from a jar (flavourless). My boyfriend and I said it tasted like Chef Boyardee's :/

I would not be back.
