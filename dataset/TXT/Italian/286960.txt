Zja7ykq3icDzkN20XX6j1w I don't want to throw gas on the never ending feud that is the Aiello's/Mineo's war, but let me give you some historical perspective.

In 1869, freshly returned from his reverse trip on the Oregon Trail, Erasmus Jebediah Aiello came to Pittsburgh only to find his arch nemesis/famous actor Sal Mineo had taken up residence in the middle of a giant hill.  Sal Mineo proceeded to whip an apple with amazing force hitting Erasmus right in his junk.  This made Sal Mineo laugh, and Erasmus, understandably, cry.  Swearing revenge, Erasmus used the skills he had learned from a mystical tribe of Native Americans and made a deal with the chief of the squirrels (his name was Benjamin) to fight Sal Mineo.  With the deal struck, the squirrels attacked Sal Mineo with all of their fury, and after an epic struggle, managed to kill him in 1976.  The crime was pinned on a drifter.  And since that day, the area surrounding the massacre has been known as "Squirrel Hill."

After that, their ancestors coincidentally both opened pizza places on Murray Avenue, which was named after Bill Murray after he beat a steam driving machine in a race.

But I digress.

This place is unbelievable, and I am so glad that my wife introduced me to it.  If it's not the best pizza I have ever had in the area, it is at least in the top 3.  Either by the slice, or one of their specialty pizzas, I have never been disappointed.

On a personal note: Children of Erasmus (fun fact: that's what all the people that work at Aiello's like to be called), get a fucking credit card machine.  You officially do enough business to make it a convenience to your customers.
