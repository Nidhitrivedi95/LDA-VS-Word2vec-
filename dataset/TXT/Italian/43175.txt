7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw As great as we remembered it. Had the arancini appetizer at the recommendation of the General Manager who visited our table, and it did not disappoint--thank you! For main course, had my favorite--seared scallops in risotto--and it (again) delivered. Had been easily a year since we'd eaten there, so really great to see they hadn't missed a beat. Will definitely visit again (sooner this time).
