UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ Terrible service at night Aug 16. Usually the service is great.  But thanks Jersey Shore dude for ignoring us and not checking on how the piZza Was. It was raw.  And thanks for cooking it more and not bothering to making a fresh one.  And thanks for not checking if it was better the second time.  And the manager who we flagged down to fix it.  Thanks for not chomping the meal. You served raw dough pizza.


In his defense he at least got the order right.  And this place usually has great service and very good food. But thats pathetic serving raw pizza. Get it together. 

I wish I refuse to pay and wish I stiffed the server. Enjoy your one star review. And guess what I won't be back.
