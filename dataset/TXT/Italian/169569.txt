MrmwDgMlL2GtthlAZsJwNQ First timer in the restaurant and first impression was really good. Fancy restaurant with nice layout and a great patio. From there on, it was all downhill.

The group I was with decided to order a bunch of food. Calamari, mozzarella ball and meatball that I remember on top of my head. There's no need to name the rest of the order since all the food left no impression or good review from any of out friends. No taste, not enough in size, expensive for what it is. Did I say No taste everything tasted bland, as if they are trying to save on seasoning. 

The service was average, but not enough to return as customers. Not worth it, and should reconsider it's chef.
