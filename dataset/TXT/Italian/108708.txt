G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Best dining experience of my life! Calder antipasti plate to start. Fritto Misto was excellent, the eggplant rollatini was surprisingly good since I don't usually care for eggplant, and the meatballs were good though we think they could have used more sauce. Romaine salad was cold and crispy and delicious. I had lobster ravioli and truly this is the best food I have ever tasted. Hubby had veal; it was breaded and properly fried, served with a delicious, cold, chunky tomato sauce on the side, and this was a generous serving of veal. We shared the sweet corn and sausage side dish. The sausage was very spicy but the flavor was still excellent. The trio of tiramisu and plate of cookies, along with an orange and cocoa espresso capped off an extraordinary meal. The service was absolutely first class; our courses were impeccably timed and our glasses were never empty. We had the privilege of meeting Giada herself, which made this a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience. This was a pricey evening for us at just over $100 per person (with only 2 drinks) but worth every penny for an extraordinarily unique dining experience.
