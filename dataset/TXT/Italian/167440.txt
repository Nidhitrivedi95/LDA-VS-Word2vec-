Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw Amazing New York Italian food by actual NY Italians- their food is delicious and they are friendly, despite the gruff reputation New Yorkers usually get. You can't go wrong with the sandwiches, but always check out their specials.

SANDWICHES: Once had a sausage and broccoli rabe special here that blew every other sandwich I've ever had out of the way. It was that good. The #1 and #2 are both solid if you dig cold sandos, the Tony Soprano or Goodfellas are tasty hot options. Regardless which one you pick, they're all served on some of the best bread outside of Italy.

PIZZA, PASTA, & OTHER OPTIONS: Haven't tried a whole pie, but their Sicilian square slices are crispy, cheesy, and delicious. The rice balls are a good, cheap add-on to your meal. Neapolitan is not stuffed, but still delicious. It's basically risotto with a crispy exterior and a side of sauce for dipping. AKA, heaven.

I've mostly focused on sandwiches here, and you can't really go wrong with what you pick from that section. Go in with an appetite!
