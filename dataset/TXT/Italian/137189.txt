j1xqz2w3wjVpvxYJi3t5IQ Went to Ciro's for the first time with a group of former coworkers for our quarterly get-together and was quite impressed...and I'm already ready to go back!

I ordered the Gnocchi w/shrimp in a pink sauce.  YUM.  The shrimp were large and perfectly cooked.  Admittedly it seemed as though they were a teensy bit stingy w/the shrimp at first glance, but it turned out to be just enough.  By the time you finish those & the doughy gnocchi you're full!  Also threw in a Caesar side salad & I must say they did a good job.  Dressing wasn't too bland or overpowering.

Ordered Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo to take back to the other half, and even reheated it was delicious.  Quite flavorful actually. 

I will say that they're a little pricey, but it was worth it since it was a ''special'' gathering.  For the gnocchi, fettuccini and one Tirimisu for me (and a soft drink), my total was just over $50 including tip.  Not cheap for sure, but I'll give'em a pass since it was so tasty.

Atmosphre was laid back and casual, but not a Red Robin type casual.  It IS a somewhat nicer Italian restaurant after all.  During dinner an older gentleman (we're thinking he may have been the owner?) began walking around playing his accordion.  While the accordion may seem corny, it was actually quite festive & jovial--made me wanna wave my napkin around & dance a bit!

If you're in the University Village & would like to partake in a slightly upscale (I said slightly) Italian meal, then head over to Ciro's.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
