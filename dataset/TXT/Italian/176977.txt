nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg My husband and I had dinner there last night for the first time.  We live pretty close by and was hoping for a good experience so we could frequent this place often.  It was way above our expectations.  I am an italian food stob, so it better be good or I won't go back.  Our pasta dishes were outstanding and service very good.  The restaurant was very busy but the hostess got us a table at the bar.  Will definitely become a regular.
