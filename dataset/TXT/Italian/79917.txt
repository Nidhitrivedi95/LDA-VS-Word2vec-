d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew I understand it's Friday night to start. O.K my kids wanted pizza and I live 5 minutes away ( why didn't you just pick it up? You say ) well I'm tired that's why. I ordered the fingers, 2 pizzas , fries and " cheesy garlic bread ". First off it took an hour and twenty minutes and cost me 50 bucks! It was late, all the food was like warm and meh. I wish I would have ordered dominoes. It would have been cheaper,faster and warmer. I will never go back. I know I ordered delivery but that shouldn't mean I get lower quality because of it. I ate it cause I paid for it. But all left overs are going in the trash.
