0VJ8tBxOpD2OxuioVjaAxA Dined here last night for an impromptu dinner with party of six old friends.  Was definitely more than you expected when you see the restaurant from the parking lot.  The decor was inviting and tasteful with an old New York Italian restaurant feel.  We were all able to converse without having to scream to hear each other.  We had delicious Italian wines.  Appetizers were excellently orchestrated and very good.  Mussels deliciously flavored, plump and not fishy.  Stuffed sausage peppers were abundant and flavorful.  Everyone was happy and content with entrees of chicken, veal and steak.  To top it off dessert was incredible.  We all split the best tiramisu I've ever had and a vanilla creme brûlée that was lighter than most and yummy.  The waitress Tina was fun and attentive.  Will definitely be going back.
