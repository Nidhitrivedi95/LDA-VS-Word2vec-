Wppq3ceZDMNCr24X4i-kfw Mr Ciao is one of the first new restaurants to arrive in Chinatown East. As the old restaurants move out, new places looking for bargain rents move in. Fortunately, one of them is this wonderful Northern Italian restaurant serving pan fried pizzas. I started with fried polenta squares accompanied by an excellent Italian salsa, and they were delicious. My wife, who doesn't like polenta, had two. This was followed by individual pizzas (though two could share one with appies.) Di's was soppresata and mine was the deluxe and both were first rate. The northern style is different with a fresh crispy taste and crust you actually enjoy eating.
The ambiance is very nice in a charming reno sort of way, though they need to watch small a like burned out bulbs. The service is prompt and friendly and warm. There's even parking. We WILL be back
