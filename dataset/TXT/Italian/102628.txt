FiP7mCGs-qelOSmapmbt1A Food was good, but service was terrible (and they weren't even busy). Waited 20 minutes for our drinks and only got them because we got tired of waiting and flagged someone down (and they were wrong). In the meantime, the table across the way sat down a half hour after us and got their food before we did. Not an enjoyable meal.
