nebRKfau_9iTxRDR6WGj9A The Karaoke is here is fun, they have tons of songs its a Filipino owned business as are the staffed and most of the guests. They serve some great Filipino food here too, I love the Crispy Pata. Full Bar with a kitchen, Nice Staff, there very welcoming to non Filipinos and I have never seen any drama here like fights etc. I recommend this place to my friends who I know like to Karaoke.
