qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA Restaurant in the Venetian was a bit of a disappointment. Was recommended by the concierge. The atmosphere and the tables overlooking the canal was very nice. The food was average at best but for the price was not very good value.  The carpaccio was not that fresh, the veal Marsala was just ok. The veal parmigiana I would not recommend. The service I must add was very good.  While the ambiance is great I think there are many better choices in Vegas for Italian food.
