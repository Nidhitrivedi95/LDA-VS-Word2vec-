You ate sitting pretty close to your fellow diners, but i didn't mind at all because the service was not lacking at all. We never had to ask for anything, as everything was cleared and set up on our table the way It's supposed to be.  We had the pork belly buratta, which was delicious, but what makes this dish is the baby toast points it comes with. They are crispy, buttery heaven.  The cold corn soup is also very creamy, rich, and bursting with sweet corn flavor. I'm glad we didn't get two, we shared and it was more than enough for both of us.  I got the scallops for my entree and it was good, but I can't say they were the best scallops I've ever had.  You get 5 or 6 of them, but they all differ in size and some of them were cooked a little too long, and to me, it just doesn't look as nice on the plate. Maybe I'm just being critical, but that's me.  The only miss of the night was my fiance's dish. Our server had told us about the special, a prime rib, and he put his order in for it. What he got was a ...and it wasn't med rare like he ordered. The server just mixed his words around and made a mistake. He offered to switch it out for the right temperature, but my s.o. didn't want to wait that long. No biggie, it was rectified, but we did have to speak to the manager to get it taken off our bill, as he didn't even eat half of it. I would think that would be automatic, not just an offering of taking care of our dessert. The dessert was ok. Our fave thing was the giant bowl of cotton candy at the end of the meal. It is so good!
