Kzo1z1hW6224lNd3al2SbQ My 11 year old son asked me to take him here because they have a free pool table. I have to admit I was skeptical when we walked in as it looks like a bit outdated. However, the service was great, the pizza was actually AMAZING (and I'm from Chicago so I would know), and my son and I got to play a few games of pool before and after dinner. The staff and all the patrons there were very welcoming to us whereas I thought it may be awkward to bring a kid into a place that looks more bar than restaurant. It's not close to me but I would make the drive for this place again and again. Thanks for the great Mama / Son time!
