FmraE2CWt65VRnEqCAqNEg The only good part of this place was the live music. You don't get much of that in Gilbert and the patio is really nice. But other than that...not much of a food selection and it's very overpriced. As well as the drinks! The Risoto Balls were terrible. The chicken tacos were not bad, as well as the fried pickles. But very pricy drinks after happy hour ends and the wait staff is very young and very unfriendly. Nobody smiles and you feel really uncomfortable. The owner came to talk to us and he seems very nice and hopeful the place will do well. It's very crowded on weekend nights, but I don't really understand why, due to the prices. I hate to say it cause I really wanted this place to do well, but Blue 32 next door is MUCH better. Very large menu and great customer service.
