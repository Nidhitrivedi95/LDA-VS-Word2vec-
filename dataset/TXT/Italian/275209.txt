yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg ENTIRELY over priced for what is served (a basic, bland Cesar salad with no frills for $20 - really!?) The chicken parm was OK. I could also tell they use powdered garlic on their bread, no bueno! It's time to step up your game - fresh is always best. 

We visited after a reservation mix up at one of the local eateries, and decided to give it a chance even though I wasn't impressed upon walking in. A quirky place with old decor and no sense of ambiance and the lingerings of a musty ash tray. The host/owner was friendly but this review is based solely on the food and atmosphere.
