BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg Finally got around to trying this place last night. I think we've been holding off because we thought it was going to be expensive, but it really isn't. 2 salads, a pizza and a cocktail came to roughly $40. 

The food is excellent and the pizza is very different than we're used to but very fresh and delicious (and the sauce is amazing!). The crust is really thin, airy and light, but not hard, crunchy or crispy like you might expect a thin crust to be.

We had the Diavola pizza which had crushed tomatoes, garlic, basil, bell peppers, peppered salami, crushed red peppers, etc. So incredibly flavorful and delicious. What's really amazing is that you taste every single topping. It's like hearing an orchestra where you can isolate and identify every single instrument yet still appreciate the cohesive whole that they become. 

We also had the warm beets (served simmering in a cast iron pot smothered in garlic, oil and Marcona almonds) and the Insalata, both of which were delicious. 

For the drink we shared the Triple B. Bourbon, Balsamic Reduction, muddled strawberries, lemon juice, and a few other ingredients that I can't quite recall. My wife said it reminded her of a scented candle... Not sure I agree but we both thought it was great! 

The atmosphere is also nice. Comfortable, cozy, warm and inviting with a nice energy. This is definitely a place that we'll come back to.

UPDATE: We've been back 3 more times now and we've never gotten the same dish twice, we always try something new. We have yet to be disappointed! Everything we've had has been delicious. We've also taken friends and family for the first time who promptly went back again to try other items.
