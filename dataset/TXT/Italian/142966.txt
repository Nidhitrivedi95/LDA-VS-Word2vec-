js9rQZAlA5rr7oSBRRcCDw Heard great things about this place as my partner has lunches often with clients in the Vaughan/Woodbridge area. I'm a big, big fan of Italian food but for some reason, not so much a fan of "homey" Italian places. You know, where pizza is thick crust, the decor is cheesy and tacky, the bread basket is kind of stale, and the pasta comes in giant portions. 

This place wasn't that. It was a bit tightly packed, but had a nice atmosphere. Everybody seemed to be enjoying their food and drink. Our half bottle of J. Lohr was so good -- probably made more so with the creamy gnocchi that we had and the Diavola pizza. The bread was also, I'm happy to report, not stale. 

The server messed up our pizza order the first time -- it came out with chicken and too much green stuff. They quickly realized their mistake and worked hard to get our order right the second time. It didn't come out right away, because I assume they were re-making it fresh -- and it came out piping out and delicious. They were very apologetic about it -- really great service. 

I often don't like gnocchi because it's just like these heavy balls of dough. Not these though, they were extremely fluffy and I could almost taste the potato. I loved the gnocchi dish and fought my partner for the last few bites. 

P.S. the spicy olive oil is SOOOOO spicy and good. Would come back here again for sure!
