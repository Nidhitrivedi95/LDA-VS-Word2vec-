fl34c5BlCWmSL_BQk-cnaQ We are regulars at Which Wich.  We have over 50 visits just this year.  We consistently wait for our orders.  Today's order took 31 minutes to get 3 sandwiches!  My lettucewhich was not wrapped properly so it was a mess.  

The wait is always this way.  People behind us got their food first.  Very frustrating!
