w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A My kids love it here because of the dough they get to play with at the table. Great salads and pizzas. The food prices seem a little bit high, but their beer prices make up the difference with 5.00 24 oz domestics. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is the service is usually a bit slow.
