rLMsz9ams_xrlX_weejhtQ A hole in the wall bar with pretty good pizza! 

I've been here twice - one of my girlfriends lives in the complex across the street so we've walked over for some drinks before in the past. I went the other day and we had Kevin, the owner, take great care of us! 

He was super friendly and attentive. He kept coming by our table to top off our wine glasses which we were loving. We ordered a supreme pizza and buffalo wings. The pizza was surprisingly good and the wings were tasty but tiny little things. They looked 1/2 the size of what normally is served in a restaurant. 

We missed happy hour by an hour but I saw both pizzas and wings were 1/2 off during it!! (And $1 off drinks) Next time I'll have to go during happy hour to get another pizza and to go see Kevin!
