jluEI1ZDQDeJlbl-M3YH3Q I should have read the reviews before booking.

I went with a friend for her birthday and the restaurant was running it's Winterlicious promotion like many other restaurants in the city.  

When we arrived for our 6pm reservation, I had the distinct feeling they were being overwhelmed or was about to be as the hostesses seemed to be rushing about.  The restaurant was relatively empty but they seated everyone in the same section, so it was quite packed in our little section.

Once we were seated.  we waited about 10 minutes before the waiter came by to take our drink order and fill our water glasses.  15 minutes later, he came back with the drinks and took our dinner order.

The presentation of the food was fantastic, however both appetizers and mains when they did arrive were warm, as opposed to being hot.  Seemed like it sat for a while before being picked up and brought to our table.  I found the seafood in my pasta over cooked and the pasta sauce lacked any flavour.  The scallops were rubbery and the mussels were shriveled up.  However, my friend did enjoy her branzino.

After dinner, we ordered coffees to go with our desserts and again had to wait for the desserts.  My friend mentioned to the waiter she wanted to her dessert as her coffee was getting cold and wanted her water glass refilled.  The waiter was quite rude and said her water glass was still half full.

It could have been a nice evening, but 2 hours for mediocre service just doesn't make the cut.  There are much better places to spend your restaurant dollar.

This is the last time we will be dining at this establishment.
