UHPjDgiEHnTe7-MP-b2kyQ We were in town for Giants Spring Training and decided to eat here after reading the other yelpers' reviews.  We made same-day reservations and I gotta say, I was really looking forward to it.  We were seated immediately inside with a few other diners scattered around.  Our waiter, Pino greeted us with a friendly accent and brought our selected bottle of wine.  After a few minutes, we decided to split a mescalun and goat cheese salad and ordered our entrees - he: seafood liguine and me: spinach & ricotta ravioli, both in a light tomato sauce.  The salad arrives, it was good.  The goat cheese was soft & creamy and a nice touch.

Other diners arrive, more wine pouring by Pino, the clock is ticking and no entrees.  Our bottle is almost empty, others who arrived after us are now on their dessert and still we have no entrees.  After 40 minutes I asked Pino how much longer.  He says (holding up 3 fingers) "Three more minutes."  Uh-huh.  Ten minutes go by, I ask again.  He says "The seafood has to be cooked special. The sauce takes time.  If you wanted it sooner you should have told me when you placed your order to put it in right away."  What??? They were simple seafood pasta and ravioli dishes.  And I wanted my wine WITH my dinner, not as its own course.  If he was in the business as long as he said he was (20 years) he should know to feed diners the food and not BS.

Finally after an hour, we get our entrees.  Unfortunately, they were nothing special.  The raviolis were too al dente, mostly pasta with a small amount of filling and swimming in sauce.  His seafood linguine was decent, but no big deal. 

The fastest thing in the restaurant are the busboys.  I swear it was like they were on roller skates.  Pino could learn a few things from those guys but I doubt his ego would permit it.
