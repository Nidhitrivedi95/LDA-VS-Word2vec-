1muT5zEqoC4qp9ms08qJtQ Had a late dinner with friends. Incredible food and tasted almost identical to the original Chicago location! WOW. Crystal and Jamie were incredible at the bar.  I'm so glad we choose the bar over sitting at a table or we may not have had this great of an experience. I'll be back often! They really make you feel welcome and they're excited to have you there
