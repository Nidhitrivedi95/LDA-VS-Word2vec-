kpZ2vPjkHfee4pCLC05tfg Romagna Mia is famous for risotto, so I order seafood and an arugula salad.
ooooh rebel without a cause! 
nah, three of my dining companions ordered risotto, one ordered lamb, and we each did a fork-full sampling of the meals. the menu's origins are from italy's emilia-romagna region.

personally, i really enjoyed the seafood and i'm glad i passed on the risotto. perhaps because it was a slow night (during the toronto freeze warning) and the stocks used to make the risotto was just too concentrated... to the point of being too salty.

the service was awesome! friendly, knowledgeable, and patient (some of us *cough* were an hour late for our reservation).
