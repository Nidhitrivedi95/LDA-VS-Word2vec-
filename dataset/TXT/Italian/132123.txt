The food here is wonderful. A little pricey, but delicious, and a huge menu. Maybe we could have ate more of our entrees if the bread hadn't been so delicious and warm. I got the pasta carbonara, and I still dream about the cheesy goodness with proscuitto added. Yum!! My friend had something with meat sauce, and it was equally good.

Service was good, it was nearly empty when we went and the decor makes it seem more upscale than what you would think from the outside.

The only downside - once we tried to make a reservation for 6 people, and the girl practically cried because she wasn't sure how to do it, however I was glad when we came back (with just two people) because it was well worth it. Maybe this is a better date place than somewhere for a large party, but the food will be wonderful either way!
