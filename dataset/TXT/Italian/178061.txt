You owe it to yourself, to your humanity and sense of self-worth, to visit San Francesco's deli and order a hot veal sandwich, and ask for cheese and mushrooms as add-ons. Oh dear lord we've reached the mountain top of hot meats.

FOUR effin' layers of breaded, tender veal are draped in an aromatic marinara sauce and piled high into the freshest kaiser roll you've ever sank teeth into. If you go with the add-ons, you're looking at two slices of fresh provolone and juicy plump sauteed mushroom halves... yes! mushroom HALVES!  This sandwich is absolutely divine. Because I'm a weakling when it comes to heat, I always ordered mine "sweet", but you can order "medium" or "hot" which will include a small (or large) pile of fiery hot jalapeños, seeds and all. I watched my dad, who loves hot food, weep like a baby - which recommends the sandwich. 

The kicker is that you can take (actually you're encouraged to take) the best veal sandwich in Toronto right next door, up the dark and gloomy flight of stairs to the upper-deck Monarch Tavern, where you can order some classic English and Irish ales (in addition to your two-bit Canadian lagers) while you scarf down your tender veal.

The deli has a few other like-sandwiches on the menu (meatball sub, chicken parmesan, etc.) but the veal is the best. You can also get some locally baked breads, a lot of rare Italian dry sausages, and some prepackaged import baked goods, like cookies.

If you don't live in Little Italy, I recommend a thorough Google Maps study. It's just below College St. on Clinton, but the one-ways and dead-ends around the area can frustrate your first attempts at locating this small miracle by car.
