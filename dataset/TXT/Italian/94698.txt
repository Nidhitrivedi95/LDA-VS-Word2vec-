ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Super disappointed, our waiter was so rude and took forever so we left. I normally enjoy it there and the overall vibe is good but he was arguing with us about wine and it was pretty awkward.

***Update, the management and owner reached out to me almost immediately and it's never really about what happens it's about service recovery and they really did a great job. I do enjoy this place and I know I will keep going back.***
