iJpTpE9A8WDWvUlvUcFZuA If I ever go back to Charlotte, NC I am returning to this place for many reasons. The food was delicious I had the lobster bisque, best I ever ate. Followed by the roasted garlic & spinach artichoke dip (I couldn't stop eating it), finally the Lunch crab cakes. The service was amazing, only wish I could have remembered her name. The restaurant was immaculate and so was the rest rooms. Only negatives were there was no changing station for our infant. I ordered two pomegranate martini's in which they were both made differently. However, I enjoyed the second much more.
