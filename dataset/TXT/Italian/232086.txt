TIYw2Dp7wCtU06ZItdSsJA I stopped by earlier because I was craving a margherita pizza. As I pulled into the parking lot, I noticed something strange. There were no cars outside. What is going on? I parked my car. Got out. Walked over to the front door. The was a sign that said they were closed indefinitely. I looked inside and all the furniture was gone. What happened?!! I drove by last week and they were still in business.

I still gave them 4 stars because I'm a fan. I guess I'll have to stop by the one on rainbow instead. Now where do I go for pizza in North Las Vegas?
