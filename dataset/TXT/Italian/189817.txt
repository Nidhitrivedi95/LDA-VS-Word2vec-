A bit pricey (not too pricey) but the place is clean, the food is made to order and they take their time to make sure your table gets the proper set up.  My husband and I ordered the bruschetta, fortini pizza and 2 pops for $35 with tip. The food is fresh and light so you don't feel heavy and gross after you've finished your meal.  I would go back to try their other pizzas, pastas and paninis. The place is hidden so you wouldn't know it was there, so google map it (street view). Definitely will go back!
