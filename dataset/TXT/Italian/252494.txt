VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w came here because a promoter got all 14 of us girls in for free open bar - score!! but you know there's always a catch - open bar only went on for a couple of hours and we had to wait for really long periods of time before we could place our drink order (the bar tenders of course favored those who were actually paying for their drinks). the dance floor was slightly on the small side but the music was good and the dancing lovelies threw out flashing glow sticks to the crowd - overall a pretty fun night at a decent club
