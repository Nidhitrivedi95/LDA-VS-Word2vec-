8yiLVWzJyyTEhYE0fVNvlA Not as wonderful as the New York Il Mulino.
Food was good, not great.
Far, far too expensive. Four guys; about $110 per guy.
Menu is hard to read: prices are in that curly font where 5s suspiciously can be mistaken for 3s! ("My entree is $54 dollars! Damn! I thought it  was $34!)
Service was also good, not great. (I love hispanic waiters pretending to be Italian...but then, who doesn't?)  Had to ask for menus three times.
The decor is very nice: low-light, warm colors, dark wood.
Did I mention that this restaurant is far too expensive?

There are better Italian restaurants in Las Vegas. One that comes to mind rhymes with Schmalintino...also expensive, but almost worth it.
