wxzG81ZyWpBje_mU4aFLaw Holy freaking french fries.   Best fries in Valley.   Garlic, cheese, a little heat.  Seriously good stuff.   Get there for happy hour, fries are half price. pizza is ok.  Crust is the best part.   Mac and cheese is thick rich and cheesy.  Fries are the star of the menu.  Beer and happy hour fruits are too legit to pass up.  Everything else is meh.
