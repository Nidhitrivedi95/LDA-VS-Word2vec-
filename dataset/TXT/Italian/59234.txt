ARWLV46iIa3Dvt1y8-SPpA Went there for the dinner. Food was tasty but way to expensive. For a dinner of garlic bread, and 2 supposedly $8 entrees, one with extra chicken, and one entree of  ravioli for 14, i got the cheque for $52 and when we requested for an itemized bill, the one that was supposed to be $8  they charged $18 for that just for adding chicken!!!!!! Dont think we will ever be going back there !!
