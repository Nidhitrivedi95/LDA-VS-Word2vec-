I got the veal parmesan which comes with a side of pasta and consisted of 4 pieces of veal and almost too much for me to eat.  I had to take a break half way through the meal to rest before I could complete the meal.  The waiter was wonderful and personable; a joy to be served and gave great suggestions tailored to our tastes.  Along with the meal you get live music singing Sinatra songs and such from that era.  When we got close to the end of our meal we asked to call for a cab and he arranged for us to be driven back in there limo.  Really nice touch.
