7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw We came here after a baseball game, and we really enjoyed it. 

We got there a little before Happy Hour was over so I ordered off the Happy Hour Menu. I had a glass of red wine $4, a sangria $4, and a margarita pizza $8 and split a spring salad with my Husband who ordered off regular menu tortellini with Squash and a brown butter sauce. Everything was delicious and the service was excellent. 

You should give North a try it is delicious and great place for Happy Hour.

Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.
