Service is below the level it should be for this Zagat-worthy restaurant. It's not that the service is poor. Far from it. It is simply inexperience, as our waiter was clearly trying very hard to recall the information he was tasked to convey, but he came across anxious and distanced. When I asked him about two different red wines, he stalled a little bit and said, 'Well, it's a red' and then stumbled through trying to say something other than what he should have said, which would've been 'I'm not sure. I'll ask Norman the sommelier to come over.' Again, this high level of restaurant should have a bit more relaxed and professional wait staff. The French-Mediterranean dishes were exquisitely prepared and presented. The sea scallops with lemon and fennel were prepared perfectly, the filet mignon with Bordeaux reduction excellent, and the lobster risotto was amazing. The tapenade was, frankly, addicting. Finally, the view from the 64th floor of the Delano is breathtaking. Go for the food, the amazing view, but check your expectations at the door
