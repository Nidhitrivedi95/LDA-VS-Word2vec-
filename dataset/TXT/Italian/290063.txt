zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA I had lunch today with a group of co-workers.  This was my first visit and I enjoyed it, we all did.  Most of us had the lunch buffet for $8.95 AND includes a drink!

Food was good.  Selection was good.  Service was good.

Great atmosphere.  Great for lunch or in the evening a more intimate encounter....
