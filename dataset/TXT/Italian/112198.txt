GAmd3nHx5TInVN26PLZj7g Just awful.  

The service and the food were both terrible.  The waitress not only didn't give us the correct check TWICE, but she let us sit for fifteen minutes after we asked her to change it the first time before even addressing the problem.  The lamb shank was about 60% inedible fat and the rapini was so tough I had difficulty cutting through it.  So very, very disappointing.
