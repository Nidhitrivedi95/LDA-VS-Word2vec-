6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA Overpriced pasta.  Quality is good but the portions are very tiny.  I ordered the popular Uni Pasta and it is literally just cream pasta with no meat for $30.00.  It wasn't even that good according to all the reviews.  My friend ordered chicken/mushroom which is another chef recommendation item on the menu.  It has NO pasta in it.  Just 4 pieces of chicken with some mushroom for $15..what kind of a main dish is that??.  It is no wonder the restaurant is always empty because its just the restaurant gouging customers over portions.

I do not recommend this restaurant at all but if you must eat it please read the menu carefully.  If it says chicken with mushroom that is what they meant and does not come with pasta.  Very disappointing.
