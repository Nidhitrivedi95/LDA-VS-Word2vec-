9WIn1fMJoDPqkc5HOQdybw Our second visit was our last.  The few items we noticed failing in the 1st became more so on our 2nd visit. 

Waiter was too pretentious calling my daughter "signorina" and my wife "signora"  ... for what ... for charging $20.00 per plate? . Ok fine, he's trying to create an atmosphere - but failed. Did not come across credible at all. 

He was watching the soccer game and made statements that left the three of us in our party scratching our heads --- we found out later were his attempt to be funny. 

Note to waiters: If you suck at being funny, don't even attempt it. You were not funny and in fact annoyed us with your comments. 

Finally the food failed on all levels. I had risotto with peas and basil and seared scallops. It just didn't blend well. The rice was very undercooked with hard centers - not even close to being "al dente". 

My daughter's gnocchi were the opposite - overcooked to the point of being mush balls. 

Sorry - this place should be charging 30% less and then I'd find its failings excusable. At $20.00 per plate for just the entree, plus drinks, plus desert, plus side dishes - - inexcusably poor quality and service. 

First time all year I tipped a flat 10% instead of my 20-25%.  I should have tipped ZERO.
