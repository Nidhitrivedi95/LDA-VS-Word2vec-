-raUM9T-1dKPiB5_vRmFYA This place is over priced and their beefs suck ass....., $27 for 2 beefs 2 fries and 2 small drinks.  The beef was greasy , the giardinara was sliced up jalapeños and onions with oil thrown on them I almost puked. Their fries are frozen store bought. If you want a decent beef you're better off going to Portillos. What a waste of time and money.  Whoever taught the 400 pound fit in the back how to make beefs needs to be shot. Totally disappointed! !!!
