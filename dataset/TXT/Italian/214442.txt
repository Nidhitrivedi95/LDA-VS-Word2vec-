rIcEm0o8Xk413HWD4-f2QA Consistently euphoric. Everything is always so fresh it tastes likes the salads were just picked ripe from the garden and all the dishes I've had (which is a lot bc i come fairly l regularly) are always intricately flavorful.  You can definitely taste the French influence and appreciation for freshness and artful preparation. If you don't absolutely love this place, I'm sorry but it's most likely because you aren't cultured and probably should go to a place like Golden Corral  or dominos pizza because you've never developed your palate for anything outside fast food or chain restaurant junk.
