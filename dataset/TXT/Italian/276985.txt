YgO2v1VNtbPA7zgp0szJXA Great straightforward pizza place in downtown Pittsburgh. Went with my family, we ordered a large vegetable pizza pie and hot wings. When they say vegetable pizza at this place, they don't mess around. LOVE that the pizza had broccoli on it, and that it was cut into 16 slices instead of your ordinary 8. The restaurant itself was large on the inside, spacious with plenty of seating and very clean, and the guy at the counter was helpful in explaining the menu and topping options, both of which have a large variety and are very affordable. I certainly wouldn't mind coming back here next time I'm in the area.
