POJL-N7Smw1UZMP_xldFwg Andrew jetting in from The Nice Guys ™, here. 

This was my first and last time at this restaurant. The food was mediocre at best, but the service was the real nail in the coffin on this one. Not only did we wait long to even talk to a server to order our food, we had to clean our own table and grab our own silverware from this establishment. There was a grease spill on our table, I practically slid off the thing when I put my arm down! We waited an hour to get our food and it was lukewarm when we got it. 

If you're going here expecting to have a great time with your family, or maybe end your workday with a cold one with the guys, look elsewhere; you will leave this place more stressed than you did coming in. 

This is Andrew signing off.
