ow3oP3cfmhlfmSsGaXe25Q I came here for Summerlicious lunch with 2 other friends and the experience was okay, but not amazing. It was pretty quiet for a Thursday lunch, with more the half the restaurant empty, but the food took quite a while to come out (between the appetizer and main, it took around 35 minutes...).

For the starter, I had the mussels, and I was surprisingly pleased with the large portion as I was expecting around 5 or 6, but the dish contained at least 12 mussels. The tomato sauce went well with the perfectly cooked mussels. 

I had the Chicken Panini as the main, and it was okay; bread was a little on the burnt side personally and I didn't really enjoy the salad on the side (it was green leaves with a vinegar sauce). However, my friend who ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo does not recommend it at all, as it wasn't anything special, just plain pasta with alfredo sauce that tasted like those frozen microwavable foods (Michelina's) you can make yourself. Even though the menu did just say there was only the pasta, it would have been nice to have some garnish on it, or even some vegetables.

For dessert, I had the tiramisu, which tasted good, but again, not amazing. The coffee cake was a little too wet for my liking. 

Overall, I wasn't too impressed with this restaurant and the meal, it wasn't anything special and wasn't worth the long wait for the food.
