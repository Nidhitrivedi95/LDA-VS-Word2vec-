jG1jcAeDw0pZTHCNC5kw_w My family and I went to Grazie's for dinner with a Groupon.  On our first attempt, we could not be seated as the restaurant was so busy.  So the following time, we called ahead of time and reserved a table for 6.  We showed up at the reservation time only to be told that they did not have us down.  However, after consulting with a person who looked like the owner, we were told that they had not understood the name and sat us at a table that was appropriate for 4 people, but not for 6!  Anyway, we sat down and waited for a while, until the waiter came to take our order.  The place was so loud that waiters and us had a difficult time communicating.  Meantime, I had discovered that my chair was wiggly beyond my comfort zone, and then my father (an elderly man) showed me that his chair was unglued at the junction of the seat and the leg.  I requested new chairs for the two of us and they were given to us in a not so friendly manner.  When the pizzas arrived, there was no room to place them on the table, because this pizzeria does not use pizza stands and as I said, we were in too small a table!  However, we managed, and ate.  The pizzas were tasty, not great, but not bad either.  One of them had a burnt crust.  During our whole experience (and especially during the chair incident) I kept on glancing toward the "owner".  He avoided my eyes and of course never approached our table!  The GROUPON that we presented at payment was applied in the most profitable way for Grazie (a $4 difference that could have made a great difference in customer satisfaction!).  Oh well, we are never going back to Grazie...
