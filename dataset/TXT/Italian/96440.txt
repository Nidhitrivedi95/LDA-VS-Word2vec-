eRjcli4nDHRwhByViUz9Ow I was a return customer at this location for a while. However a recent experience has changed that. I received a coupon for a free small cheese pizza with a purchase of $15 or more for my birthday. I called in my order and the first girl I spoke to clearly had no idea what she was doing because she handed off the phone to someone else without telling me to hold or even saying anything. The second girl I spoke to was talking to me like I was an idiot then proceeded to tell me that I was not a rewards member (even though I have signed up, the coupon was emailed to me and had my name printed on it), she had never heard of the promotion and kept asking more questions. So I simply asked if I could use the coupon or not hoping to get a direct answer and end this call. That is not what I got. She put in my order for two calzones and not the pizza until I came in to actually show her the coupon. When I got there she told me the coupon was for another location and they didn't do that. She did offer me a "free birthday cannoli" because apparently that is what this location does so the extra star is for that. Aside from that she could've handled the situation much better and saved some aggravation. Instead she wasted my time by making come down there knowing that they don't take that coupon and now I was stuck paying $23 for two calzones that I wouldn't have bothered ordering if I knew it wouldn't be honored. My main issue is with the company itself for sending me a coupon to a location that I have never been to before, never signed up at and is at the opposite end of town from me. Coupons for the company should be accepted at all locations and if they are not then that should be CLEARLY STATED on the coupon, which it was not. I'm big on customer service and needless to say after this, I will not be returning to this or any other Rosati's location.
