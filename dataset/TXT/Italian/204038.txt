qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg Went here for breakfast one morning.  I'm not much of a breakfast guy but I was starving.  We were a group of 6 people.  We were seated very quick.  The selection on the menu was not huge but none the less the Italian omelet caught my eye.  It had mozzarella and Italian sausage in it and then it was covered in tomato sauce.  It was bursting with flavors.  It was served with Italian roasted potatoes and toast.  The potatoes were very tasty but the toast was good done on the wrong style bread.  Other than the toast the breakfast was amazing.  Would go there again in a heart beat.
