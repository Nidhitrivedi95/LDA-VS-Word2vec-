bVTWcZWhtJc4IjWy_74CYQ Since this is a chain restaurant the food is basically what it is but this review is on the customer service. We came here for dinner with our 9 yr old and our 5 month old. Our youngest was getting very moody during our salad and we decided to just take our food to go. The waitress was very prompt in getting our food since she noticed how distressed we were. Aside from the waitress the manager and what seemed like the assistant manager stopped by our table to make sure we were ok and assured us that our food will be ready asap.  Great customer service throughout. If we could get our youngest to be patient during a meal we will definitely be coming back.
