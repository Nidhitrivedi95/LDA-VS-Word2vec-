miUmZ27vC-gHoyEmUQMYuQ I went here in early July - on a nice, cool, and beautiful evening on Main Street Markham.

For parking, I parked in the adjacent parking lot on the far opposite side of the pharmacy - closer to Main St.

As it's a restaurant on Main Street, and without having seen it before but having read a few reviews, I thought there'd be an outdoor patio. However, the restaurant is located on the second floor of The Old Town Hall. As soon as you walk in the door, head straight and you'll see an elevator marked exclusively as "Marca Trattoria". 

The elevator doors open up to a nice wide and modern space with wooden floors and red and black accents. There's adequate natural lighting too. For a main street restaurant, the modern look is different and refreshing. 
My friend and I were craving pizza so we ordered two different ones:

Margherita ($16): tomato sauce, bocconcini, & fresh basil - it was delicious and light. The tomato sauce isn't heavy and hearty but rather savoury and fresh. 

Verde ($18): olive oil base, eggplant, roasted red peppers, zucchini, and onions. What I liked about this one is that it's olive oil-based. There's no tomato sauce base but that doesn't mean that it lacks flavour. The veggies liven it up and add to its healthier, lighter, and fresh taste. 

The pizzas were well-sized too. At 6 slices each, they're each enough to feed 2 hungry people. 

I definitely recommend Marca Trattoria as a great Italian restaurant. Its location is a nice bonus - cute & a cozy main street Markham.
