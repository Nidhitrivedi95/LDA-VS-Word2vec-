a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w ABSOLUTELY, THE MOST GOD AWFUL, HORRID FOOD I HAVE EVER TASTED......wife ordered the egg plant parmesan....came with an inch on stinky cheese, after digging into it, came across a small piece of eggplant..had to send it back only to receive it with more s=cheese.  UGH.  Ordered the veal picatta, it was undercooked, the pasta with it was awful and swimming in tomato sauce.  Upon exiting, i looked into the kitchen, found a bunch of cooks with dirty t shirts.  They were not wearing any hair hats and it was not sanitary.  I also saw many empty large tomato cans...come on, the prices charged at this restaurant are worth a kings ransom and they can't afford to serve fresh tomatoes?  The waiter kept addressing everyone DEAR this Dear that, hey go easy guy, you are just a waiter and not my long lost relative.ABSOLUTELY THE WORST ITLAIN RESTAURANT THAT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.  Stay away from this place
