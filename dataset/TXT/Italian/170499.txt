mv6VAbKBVlCc2Fyyv4jNtw Don't let the exterior fool you! It looks a little older with very simplistic furniture, but the food quality was pretty good.
This place had great pizza, had it not been for the rock hard crust, and the breaded chicken I tried was A1.
The serving size was fairly large, enough to get me full enough to fit in desert afterwards.
Staff were friendly and helpful with all our questions, but there wasn't anything super special about this place.
