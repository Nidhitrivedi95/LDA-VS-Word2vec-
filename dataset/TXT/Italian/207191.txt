QGUeajuwtOSegh7JbrbuXA The food was good but the service was a huge disappointment. My sister's meal never actually came and after waiting we found out that they had given it to the wrong table! After dinner we also ordered espresso that never showed up, when we inquired after 25 minutes they said they forgot and asked if we still wanted it. At this point, we asked for our bills and to speak with the manager. The manager was also unprofessional in not giving a genuine apology, he asked if a round of shots would remedy the situation. Ridiculous, we were here for a nice dinner amongst friends - not to get drunk...
