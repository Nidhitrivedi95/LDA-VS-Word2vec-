4qQVf2lt-47VcQ4v54PEXQ It was 2 o'clock in the afternoon and I had been up since midnight.  I drove 400 miles and just walked around massive antique sale.  Family was feeling Italian, I was feeling my patience drain.  The food at Basil and Garlic was personally responsible for the fate of all of Scottsdale.  If I didn't fill my gullet with good food, I was going to lose my s@#t.  This establishment laughed in the face of danger and packed our table with wonderful Italian food with amazing flavor.  We covered all our bases by ordering a few different pasta dishes and a sandwich.  I wont go into the idle details of who had what, cause I ate them all.  I normally bat clean up for our team, but this time they all tapped out early cause of the big portions, so I had an (happy) cavalcade of Italian delights.  I would like to say the sauces were to die for, but it was more than that.  The sauces were to kill for.  Yep, you heard it here first.  I could choke someone for a plate of their sauce.  So good, will be back.  Thank you.
