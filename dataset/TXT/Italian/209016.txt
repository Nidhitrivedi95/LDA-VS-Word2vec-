Salads do NOT count & we usually eat hummus/baba ganoush at home, anyway.

Lady on the phone had to check the actual vegetarian/vegan-ness of every option- kinda frustrating when I am used to "Mediterranean/Greek" style food always having tons of options for me. Usually I can just ask for no yogurt or no cheese. I appreciated the honesty & the helpfulness, because I genuinely have dairy allergies & don't want to risk it.

We decided not to order, because we were hungry & needed a substantial meal (not just appetizers).

That said, I think it is a really, really, REALLY bad decision to add feta cheese to your falafel, because I know a lot of us vegans go for it on a pita on the weekly & I doubt your omnivores would genuinely miss it. It's not usually used, in my experience.

Why reduce your clientele over something that is usually "accidentally" vegan?
