KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg The arancinis are a great way to start off the meal. The little balls of smooth risotto is stuffed with so much cheese that it strings apart when you go to cut it open. They are not large, but you get three golf ball-sized spheres in one dish. We added a forth for an extra $3, and it became a substantial appetizer for two people. It was surprisingly filling even after only two of them. Great tomato sauce on the bottom brought the right amount of acidity to this rich dish.

The second dish was unfortunately disappointing for me. The duck confit pizza, which is part of the mealshare program (very admirable, a great social program!), but I found the pizza incredibly dry. The crust itself was well charred from the oven and had a good texture. However, the mix of toppings (duck confit, bosc pear, mozzarella) didn't bring enough moistness at all. Every bite was dry, no matter which bite of topping I got. It desperately needed some type of sauce to help balance it out. I couldn't even finish one slice....which just made me sad. Will definitely avoid this pizza and try something else on their pizza list next time.
