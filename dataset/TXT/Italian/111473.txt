G3rk0dDROzpDdTugsnSDTw This little restaurant is hidden away on Bay surrounded by condos. You'd never imagine there would be a good restaurant tucked away here. This place has opened my eyes to other areas of Toronto that can offer great foods.

This place perfect for a date night, its high glass walls and intimate setting is the perfect place to take someone out on a date for drinks. They have a wide selection of cocktails and of course an extensive wine list. I'd recommend the Italiano Gardino, a gin based cocktail with cucumbers and crushed black peppers. 

The staff were very kind and helpful if we ever needed anything and are quick to rectify any issues that we had. A friend of mine had ordered a pasta dish and had found a hair in her food. She told our waiter would quickly apologized and quickly got a new meal out for her. As an apology they offered her a dessert on the house.

Now, with that being said its time to turn to the big negative the food and prices.
After eating here, I would have to say the prices for the food doesn't match up with the quality of the food. The value for money is the pizza. They have a good array of different pizzas for standard price, but I wouldn't say the food was spectacular. It was satisfying but  I've had better pizza in Toronto.

That pasta was the worst value for money. My friend had ordered the gnoochi to share with her date, but when the meal came it was only FOUR (Literally four because we counted)  gnoochi for the whole dish. I mean for $17 that is terrible. There is no way the restaurant could justify the prices, even if they were just made and the potatoes were imported for Ireland!

Overall, this is a great place to get a drink and go on a date 5/5.
For food on the other hand, severely overpriced and for the quality of food not worth the money.
