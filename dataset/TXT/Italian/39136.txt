7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA 4.3/5 Would have given a higher rating if...

I got the meatball sub and fries which were both excellent. Probably had 6 large meatballs that were moist but not rubbery. The fries looked like they were handmade and very salty which I enjoyed. I rated this place a 4 but would have probably given them a five if:

1 - The food didn't take so long. There was no one in front of me and it took 19 minutes.

2 - If they actually got my order right. Note that I am reviewing the meatball sub, however I ordered the chicken parmesan sub which it clearly read on my receipt. When the kid brought the food to my table I noticed he picked up the receipt, noted the mistake, got nervous and crumpled it up. I would have sent it back but I had limited time on my lunch hour. 

Overall I would go back but would allot more time in the event of a mistake.
