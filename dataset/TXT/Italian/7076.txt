0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw We originally were heading over here from breakfast but missed the cut off which begins at 11, and opted to have lunch here. There certainly are a variety of items on their lunch menu but their breakfast looked the most enticing of it all. Be weary, with the spacious property and trees, parents believe it's okay to let their children run wild without supervision. This isn't necessarily a big problem, nor has anything to do with a negative on Joes Farm Grill- but definitely takes away from the ambiance and enjoyment of the farm setting and the greatness of the food!
