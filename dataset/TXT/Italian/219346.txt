SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg My girlfriend found this place during our last trip to Vegas, and it has officially became our MUST VISIT!

We came here after the Vegas night clubs during the late night happy hour from 12AM-3AM, and it has one of the most amazing happy hour menu. All items listed with 2 stars are 50% off - which includes their steaks. But wait, there's more! The half off steak also includes a choice sides. We ended up spending about ~$50 for a 16oz Ribeye, and a 14oz New York Strip with two sides (Mushroom and Creamed Corn). I was speechless! The steaks were delicious! I would say they were on par with Flemings steakhouse, and for the price that can't be beat.

I'm savoring about the steaks as i'm writing this review. Looking forward to my next Vegas trip to come!
