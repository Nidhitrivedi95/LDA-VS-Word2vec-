5TPyzmhr3TKyWkPfzm01wA Fazoli's is just a fast food restaurant, although the real dinnerware is a lot better than eating off of a foam plate with a plastic fork. Price-wise Fazoli's is more expensive than going to other fast-food chains. The new thing is toppings for their baked pasta dishes. I tried the Mediterranean topping and it was greasy and overly spicy. I would not try it again. The bread sticks that we received were obviously not fresh and were actually a bit mangled. The kid who brought more to our table was a little surly, "Want more bread sticks?" he mumbled. On the positive side, the counter staff were super friendly and helpful.
