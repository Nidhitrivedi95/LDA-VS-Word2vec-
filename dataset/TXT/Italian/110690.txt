G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I am a hardcore Giada fan and could not miss going to her restaurant while in Vegas.  Right from our drinks in the lounge to dinner's end, I was so pleased we had time to fit this gem in!  
Oh...there's also a photo booth at the entrance.  We wanted to partake with a group shot to end our perfect dining experience. ..unfortunately for us this older couple were getting it on behind the curtain!  Seriously?!!!  Do you not have a room?! 
Anyways. ...don't let that deter you from a GREAT place to relax and experience fine dining.
Message to that OLD couple. ..."Get a Room!!" Ew
