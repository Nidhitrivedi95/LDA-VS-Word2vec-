We had a caprese salad that was terrible, an arugula salad that came out first with more than 50% bad arugula (was quickly fixed, but STILL), and chicken parm was not great. Arrabiata sauce was great though, as were my kids' meatballs. And three stars instead of two for having whole wheat and gluten free pasta options. The server was SO nice, so I feel bad even writing anything negative, but need to be honest!
