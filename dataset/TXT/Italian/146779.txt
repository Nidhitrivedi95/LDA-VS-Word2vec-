k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw Six of us just went to the Bootlegger to eat a late night dinner at 2am.  They were playing very loud death metal music.  We were shocked that such a nice Italian restaurant with such great food would have that type of music in their cozy atmosphere.  So, we asked the waiter if he could change the music.  His answer was no.  We then told him we would all leave because the music was too angry and loud.  He said that they always play that kind of music late at night.  So, all six of us left and we will not be going back late at night again.  Too bad.  We've been going to this fine place for decades.  But death metal just doesn't make for a nice late night meal.
