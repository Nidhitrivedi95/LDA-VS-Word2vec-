dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg Great, awesome stuffed pizza.  Ordered to carry out, and they gave me a 1:15 wait time. Given that I wasn't super hungry, I decided it was worth the wait to try (had a bad pizza craving today).  Ordered it with sausage.  When I picked it up, I was surprised how heavy it was (ordered a medium). It was definitely the heaviest pizza I've ever carried.

Now on to the pizza.  I was surprised how much I liked it:  the tomato sauce was really good and it also had loads of cheese. The sausage was overpowered by the sauce, but it was good.  

Pomo is my favorite pizza place here, but, if you're in the mood for for a good 3000 calorie pizza that will feel like a load in your tummy, look no further.  This was well worth the calories!
