Ya9FMj-MWMkeMcog06N5bQ Bar Louie is a good stand by in the Warehouse District when I'm too lazy to leave the neighborhood.  Food is okay, service is good and beer list is surprisingly pretty good.  Burgers are a safe bet, always pretty good, but not quite wow. I do like the Luigi, Bar Louie's version of a philly cheesesteak, though it can't really be compared to an actual philly cheesesteak.
