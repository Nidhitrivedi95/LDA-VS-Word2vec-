smBsHggLvIuABgntBvlYLw Horrible, Horrible.  Arrived at approx. 11:45 am.  Seated quickly. Waiter arrived quickly and made some kind of Mexican/Black comment/joke!  We ordered.  Bread came with balsamic/oil and was great.  Food arrived within 20 minutes.  Comments from the four of us:  Mista Salad: "Looks like leftovers from all the other salads...not crisp, soggy."  Spaghetti and meatballs: "Sauce very acidic...meatballs ok."  Pasta Martini: "penne VERY al dente".  Steak Panino: "Ribeye - where is it?  Maybe 1 oz on a HUGE Foccacia roll?  2 thin slices of mushrooms, but 1/4# peppers & bruschetta tomatoes?  Apparently someone had tried to season the sandwich and only on one site...One bite caused me to gag & drink a lot of water.  And again, almost raw pasta salad...wanted the potato chips, but the waiter said they were "86'd" and I assume that meant something was wrong with them.  After eating what we could, another serving person asked if we wanted boxes and the check and we replied "yes".  Ten minutes later, we received the check.  Another 10 minutes before someone came to get our money.  Another 10 minutes before anyone came back with our receipts.
I took my half of the steak panino home and deconstructed it thinking that maybe the majority of beef had been put on the other half of the sandwich.  NO...On this HUGE focaccia roll, there were a few pieces of beef (not big enough to pick up with a fork), two thin slices of onion and huge amounts of peppers and chopped tomatoes. So many restaurants fill your sandwiches overflowing with beef but your beef is like the old commercial "WHERE'S THE BEEF".   I and my friends are very disappointed in your restaurant and can't imagine returning.
