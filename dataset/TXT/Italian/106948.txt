FUqvrauxIP8bcI2aVeoXdg Went there with my family, first impression was a little weird. We had to close the tiny first door and wait for it to close in a tiny triangular space to open the second one. The place is tiny and narrow but had a charming vibe to it. We passed in front of the kitchen through a narrow hallway that gave us a vibe of excitement. We sat in a booth at the very end of the restaurant which was actually really cozy and private. 
We all had water, I don't know if they have any sodas but it was fine. I had the fetuccine alberto and shared it with my sister, I expected it to be bigger but it was just the right size for us two, since we don't eat much. My brother had the atlantic salmon which was great, too. Then my parents ordered the filet mignon and the steak. The filet mignon was missing some sauce to it, but it was good. 
Then we ordered some desserts, the cheesecake was great and so was the crème brûlée. The fudge cake was kinda dry, though.
Service was good; very kind and attentive. The walls had writing over them which was really cool and there was a tree (synthetic) in the middle of the kitchen. 
The lattes were delicious btw.
A little cramped, but if you don't mind, you'll probably love it.
