5aRyuqJZSGp1fNXHQHMLjg Been coming here for many years as I only live a couple blocks away. This is a great place to get a couple slices of pizza for just a few bucks. Service has always been fast and friendly, and the pizza is one of the better ones in the valley despite being inexpensive. Same employees have been working there for as long as I have been going there. Not much seating, but it's not that kind of place really. I always get my food to go. The only drawback is that it is literally hot as hell inside the place which is fine in winter but not so much in summer.
