0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q I didn't care for my pasta. But that might be cause I don't like fettuccine that much... I got the fettuccine carbonara because he said it was the most popular. 

Loved the Mediterranean Sea Bass. 

The charred octopus wasn't too bad. Not amazing but decent. 

Service was as usual per fine dining standards. As expected, of course. 

I came with a friend and we did not finish our food. Took the fish and pasta to-go. Octopus was a small appetizer dish so that was easy to finish. 

Also comes with some bread but it wasn't that good. Same ole. :(
