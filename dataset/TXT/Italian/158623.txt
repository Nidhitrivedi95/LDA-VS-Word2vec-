LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA I setup a Christmas party for my office employees. Because of the mix up and it being cold, they gave us a private banquet room without any charge which I thought was amazing. Had the family style menu and due to certain allergies they had no problem putting certain things like mushrooms on the side. They suggested delicious drinks and the servers we had were very attentive and friendly. So much food they bagged it to go for us to take with us. Had a balcony which we were allowed to go outside and smoke so that was another plus. We even had speakers and a radio at our disposal. Everything was delicious and setup exceptionally. Very happy with the experience. The tiramusu and their chocolate specialty cake are to die for lol their pasta and meat dishes were on point. Thank you very much!
