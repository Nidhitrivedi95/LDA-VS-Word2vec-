QnfAHUr5-HTiaA5-va3glQ Yum! A Relaxed Sunday lunch with plenty of TVs and NFL Sunday Ticket. Service was excellent. Thanks Shelby! Our group had the New York combo pizza on original crust, BBQ Chicken pizza and broasted chicken. The combo pizza had plenty of everything as well as three colors of bell peppers not just green, the sausage was juicy and the crust - oh the crust! Fluffy edges yet crispy on the bottom. Breasted chicken from my childhood memories was something I thought I'd never have again but I was wrong - seasoned to perfection and steaming hot. To top everything off, I asked for a To-go cup for my diet coke and received a large fresh cup for the ride home. Everything was great - we will definitely be back. Thanks SoNY!
