w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q This was my first time visiting the Palms in Vegas. Ive had great meals at the LA venue. 

Last evenings overall experience was very nice. The service and attention we received was wonderful. 

I started off with the wedge salad, which was very, very good. Perfect amount of blue cheese crumbles and nice big tomatoes. For entree i had the 14oz filet. I was somewhat let down by the filet as i was expecting the same great experience ive had at the LA Palms. The filet was a little tough and there were some gristle lines throughout..... i think i just had a bad cut. Shit happens sometimes, but it was still decent. For sides we had the creamed spinach and mushrooms. The spinach was really good and the mushrooms were pretty standard. 

Had a great time here and would try it again. But only after venturing over to the other steakhouses i havent dined at yet.
