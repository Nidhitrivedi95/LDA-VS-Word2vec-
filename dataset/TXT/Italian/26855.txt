4QC-P82ydY2x2HlXzVVJ0g I called on Saturday around 6:30pm to order hot wings & an appetizer. I gave my address & they said it would take about 40 minutes. An hour and a half passed and I called back to find out where my order was. The girl on the phone said that the delivery guys were all out and that if I didn't get anything in 10 minutes to call back. After about 20 minutes I called back now about 2 hours since I ordered and still no food. The girl on the phone transferred me to someone else to figure it out. They said they called me to say that the appetizer I ordered was out and the person that answered the phone said they didn't order anything. After trying to explain that I had never received a call we realized that because I live in an apartment the phone number with my address was someone that previously lived there. I would assume that if when they called and the person said they didn't order they would've realized this and tried to get back in contact with me. 

So I gave them my correct phone number and the employee was going to call me back about what to do. When I received a call back they were going to give me another appetizer instead.. at this point it had been over 2 hours and 3 phone calls later and they weren't even offering to comp my meal. At this point I just told them to cancel the order completely. The employees and management were not accommodating at all and overall I was extremely disappointed with the customer service.
