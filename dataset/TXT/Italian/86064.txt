dSEcQPPUlATxZf5pvN_t5Q I have eaten at the Tempe Red Devil every once and a while for many years.  I used to really enjoy it.  The last two times I ate there I felt ripped off and did not enjoy my food, at all.  The food quality is down, and the prices are up....Way up...Red Devil is trying to charge fine Italian dining prices, for what amounts to an outdated, aging, dumpy, musty, local pizza joint, with inconsistent food and service.  Today my meatball sandwitch was luke warm, with stale bread, and tasted like it had TV dinner meatballs and sauce in it.  The sandwich is  almost $9.00, and fries or any other side is extra.  I got the fries, and they were soggy from a frozen bag.  Allot of people still seem to still like this place.  I am done with it.   I will go to Riazzis, Vincitorios, or even Olive Garden over Red Devil going forward.
