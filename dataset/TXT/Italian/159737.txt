lgWB0yGXpZvupYREWxtV7g I had the mozzarella tomato basil salad because my stomach had been feeling iffy the last day or so. I had a friend from out of town staying on Central that wanted to do lunch, so I brought him here. It was pretty crowded for 1pm on a Friday (or so I thought, but it seems to be the norm here). 

I guess I had high expectations. It's not that the salad was bad. It was quite good, but I guess it just didn't live up to the hype. Not many things do. Everything came cutely packaged with plastic silverware, and candy wrapped crusty bread. And this is where the meal gets into trouble. That bread is the HARDEST freaking bread ever. My friend the dentist says he thinks he cut his hard palate eating his sandwich because it was so hard. I know and like my crusty breads, but there's a line. When they're so hard that the shards of bread start to cut up your mouth, its not good. 

I like the idea and the feel of this place, but the reality isn't what I wanted it to be.
