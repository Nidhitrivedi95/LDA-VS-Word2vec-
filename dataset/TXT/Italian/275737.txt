Ya9FMj-MWMkeMcog06N5bQ Came here with my husband last night for a nightcap after the Bruno Mars concert.  We initially went inside to find a waiter to see if we would be able to sit outside.  However, there was no one around.  After walking around and back and forth for what seemed like forever, we finally saw a waitress. My husband went up to her and told her that we would be sitting outside and would like menus.  She said ok.  We went and sat outside for about ten minutes with no sign of the waitress coming out to check on us or take our orders.  My husband and I are already not huge fans of Bar Louie because their prices are pretty high and the overall atmosphere just seems "bougie". (I've been to the Westlake location in the past). My husband and I ended up going to Ohio City for a night cap.  I don't think I'd ever go back to a Bar Louie location again.
