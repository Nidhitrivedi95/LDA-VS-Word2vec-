vEfK4X4WjZzQmxufdSr1BQ Upon ordering the waiter suggested to me that their veal was really good. Let me tell you this. Yes it is.

I was stupid and ordered the lasagna, this wasn't really spectacular. I can make much better lasagna. 

The veal with tomato sauce was amazing. Definatly a good choice.  The veal was very tender.   

I'm not sure if I'd go back. It's worth trying once but not really a bind blowing experience.
