NjjHgGqhrUfZNK1TMcxTQw Came in to Caffe Centro because it was close and it is on the way to the station. Being well before lunchtime, I was only after a coffee, so made my way to a comfy looking table to check Yelp reviews on this Italian styled eatery.

On reading Tanja's quotes on the heavenly pancakes I was hooked, so placed an order. Looking around the caffe it has a distinct European quality about it, clean well presented seating and staff very friendly good. A short time later...Oh my, you need to go and try the combo of pancakes (yes six small ones), maple syrup, honey, fresh cream were solidly devine, and mouth meltingly good, Thanks Tanja.

As I gazed around, on the walls hung street scene pictures of some cosmopolitan city, And looking around the caffe it almost has a distinct European quality about it clean, well presented seating and staff very friendly.

My new found spring clean is to try as many green teas in as many places as possible the city can offer me in a week. That really got off to a great start at Brew Lab, the presentation of fresh looking leaves in a transparent pot, but here was a small portion of tea in a bag. I suppose you can't have it both ways - great food, hmm not so good tea.

Challenge accepted...but I need to check other reviews first.
