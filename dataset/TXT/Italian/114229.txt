gKPGer8_b532vRzEjsXQxA I'm shocked at the reviews! I went with my kids and the food was so gross! I have never had a more disgusting experience. The waiter was strange. I sent back my nasty house salad that was drowned in sweet dressing. I think they put a lot on it so I would not notice the nasty old lettuce. The "best garlic bread" who are these people? The place was dirty, outdated, way over priced, a little creepy with nasty food. I don't believe any of the people who said they liked it! Liars, there is no way!
