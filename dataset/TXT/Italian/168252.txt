MjQptGzmlOSmxzfE-pktEA Not exactly the most modern restaurant.. ok so it's probably the least modern.. but it's freaking delish!  

I've been going to Bucci's for about a  year now since I was turned onto it by my significant other.. We've gone a few times, one with other people a few, and have NEVER had a bad dish.  

The dishes we have are usually some type of Pasta (ravoli, lasgna, chicken parm) and a delicious cut of steak.  I'm not really the steak eater, so I can't comment but he never complains.  I always love my pasta, the sauce is delicious, the bread is yummy (that garlic butter is life changing), and the service is attentive.  

The only negative's we have are the somewhat lacking options for the bar (we've got some specific vodkas we like that they don't stock), and sadly I wish it were more updated.
