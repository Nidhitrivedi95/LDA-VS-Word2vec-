zIyqiWYKrCvAdGeWXXBxFw My wife and I have been looking for a really warm, honest to goodness french bistro experience for years, ever since our previous champion (Bistro 990) closed down for good. I am delighted to report that we found our successor, an inviting little gem just east of our neighbourhood.

On the first night I ate here I was fortunate that foix gras was on the menu, and they did it just right, seared to perfection. My wife's dish was some kind of tartare if I remember correctly. The novelty there was that it was served on a gigantic block of himalayan salt. That sounds a bit gimmicky, but actually the dish was splendid, although the bits at the bottom were a tad salty.

I ordered the flat iron steak for my main, and it was perfectly cooked (blue of course) with an interesting black salt on top. Did I mention I love salt? The sauce was also quite nice.

The end result is you get classic french bistro food served with just a bit of modern flair. The ingredients are top notch, the presentation exquisite, and the atmosphere warm and inviting.

As an aside, the dining room is quite limited in size, so if you plan to dine here, you may want to book in advance. 

I also would note that there is no need to pay for parking - while the restaurant is on Queen Street, all of the nearby residential side streets have abundant free parking!
