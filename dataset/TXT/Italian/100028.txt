F73T-N5lRNL2Gcpg0Q4KKw This place was actually a lot better than I thought it would be. I went here for a company holiday dinner and when the menu got sent out I was immediately like "well what the..." because I truly couldn't understand hand of it. I am not even joking. I was dreading the meal. 
Fortunately because it was a company thing the appetizers were chosen for us. They were good, especially the brussel sprouts salad. When it came to the main meal the server did a great job of explaining each item and making recommendations. However he didn't do a really great job of explaining how tiny the pasta dishes were. Do not think you can go and have pasta for a meal. One dish had like 7 pieces of bow tie pasta. I am not joking. They intend for the meal to be several courses so it's tiny portions. I got the braided lamb and it was delicious.
The dessert was the olive oil cake and it was really good. So overall I would definitely recommend.
