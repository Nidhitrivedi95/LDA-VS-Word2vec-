RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q Sicilian pizza not good. Doesn't resemble the pictures posted. Ours is covered in a really sweet pizza sauce on top of cheese and under it. Toppings scarce. Maybe an off day there but the expectations were higher. 4 people and 4 pieces eaten with the rest headed for the trash.
