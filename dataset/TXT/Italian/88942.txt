The dinner portion sizes are quite large so beware if it is just the two of you ordering and you don't want leftovers!  The lasagna was to die for (it comes straight in the pan from the oven) and the caprese was delicious. 

If you don't want to smell the smoke from the casino, ask for a table further inward.

Perfect place to eat after going to La Reve in the Wynn!

Definitely pricey, but worth it if you want to leave full and happy :)
