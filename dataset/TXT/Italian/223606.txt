sKy8HkP6X-8dCKq_SzeIpw Wow. We are sitting here almost 40 minutes after ordering and still not even the appetizer. There are two other tables and no one at the bar. I thought maybe the first time it was a one off, this is the THIRD time and it is ALWAYS this slow.. simple pizza and appetizer should not take 40 minutes!!!! Won't be coming back...
