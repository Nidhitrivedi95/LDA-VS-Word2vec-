SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg One of my fave restaurants on The Strip! If you're looking for a place to eat that has the sights, ambience, and food, then reading this review is a start. :]

Out of all the times that I've dined here, I've never had any complaints. And it's funny to think that when my fam and I come here, we're seated at the same exact table every time, which is located in the patio. I would recommend getting a table in this area for first timers! Especially at night, since the water fountain show comes on about every 30 minutes at night. You'll have a perfect view! But don't worry about those nights that seem too cold. They have plenty of heat lamps all around the outside.

Customer service is always great here. Don't be afraid to ask questions on what the staff recommends. Sometimes they'll even offer suggestions that pertain to the number of guests in your group, like the customizations of portions.

All in all, it's an awesome place to dine at when looking for a nice eatery on The Strip. Pricing is not that bad, when considering this place to be more of a fine dining restaurant. Give it a try!
