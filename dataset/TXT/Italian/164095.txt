lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg If you are looking for a really great deep dish pizza then you have found the right place. They have very good pepperoni and sausage pizza.  With that said, please remember that it takes about 45 minutes or more to cook the pizza because it is made right after you order to get the freshest pizza possible. This is a great place to go if you have the patience to wait for the pizza.  I don't recommend this to anyone that is starving and would like the food now. If you get cranky waiting for food to be cooked then this isn't the place for you. You literally have to wait a while for the pizza to come out. It's worth it if you have the patience to wait. If not... go somewhere else!
