7qo6rqDjlHds8ObxzxBD4A We all have our particular likes and dislikes when it comes to pizza.  My review today for Brooklyn D's does not involve their other foods,  The restaurant is clean and attractive with friendly, attentive and efficient help!  Unfortunately I feel their pizza is mediocre at best.  The pizza sauce has a sour taste to it pretty much calling attention to itself rather than harmonizing with the chosen toppings.  The crust just did not taste or feel like an expected brick oven pizza.  Not bad mind you but not on a par with the better pizzas in town.  For this I can not rate it more than two and a half to three stars.  I thought about coming back to try their pasta dishes but from past experiences like this, it seems restaurants uses the same red sauce on their pasta.  The iced tea was good.  The 14" pizza, with 4 toppings and one drink and tax was not worth $25 plus!
