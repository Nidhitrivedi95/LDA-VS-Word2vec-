eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg I am not even comfortable giving this restaurant one star! The most horrible service I've ever had! Food came out late and our breakfast potatoes were cold. Server never came back to check on us until it was time to bring the bill. When she took our order, she completely forgot about one of the people in our party. It wasn't that busy either! She spilled coffee on the table and in the water glass. Did she bring back fresh water? Of course not! Over priced, horrible food, AND bad service. Will definitely not be going back.
