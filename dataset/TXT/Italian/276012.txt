YcAy30XJOUa72kZMt61jsA Couples BEWARE: I brought a very special guest & we selected 1 of the larger & more expensive main dishes stating clearly -in writing on the menu- that diners are entitled to UNLIMITED salad, (or soup) and garlic bread. The server brought the entree divided into 2 bowls (even though that was neither offered, nor requested) & after ONE round of salad, and ONE garlic bread, we were IMMEDIATELY AND COMPLETELY CUT OFF. When I politely asked why we were forced to forfeit the unlimited aspect of the meal deal, the server tried to hastily squash the issue with some sort of well-rehearsed rebuttal comparing our visit to Mandarin all you can eat buffet. A pathetic and insulting attempt at employing some kind of 'fair usage' clause. She brought out ONE more lousy garlic bread as a consolation, and then the bill. Nevertheless, I left a good tip, but walked out feeling annoyed, embarrassed, and very bitter about the whole experience. Unfortunately, these folks chose short-term gain over long-term gain, as this location is close to our home & we would have been happy to make it a regular habit. Now, we'll never go back & I'll be sure to squash the suggestion if any of my friends consider it.
