7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA Let me start by saying I have never actually been to Pizza Heaven. I have only ever ordered delivery (like 10 + times) and every single time it is awesome! The food arrives fast, hot and delicious. It's super easy to order online, through their website, and it's relatively inexpensive for all of the food your receive. I typically get the Baked Ziti which is so good and leaves me with plenty of leftovers. My boyfriend either gets a pizza or a hot sandwich and has never been unhappy. Love that we have such a great option for delivery in our neighborhood. We will have to stop by the actual restaurant sometime because it looks so cute!
