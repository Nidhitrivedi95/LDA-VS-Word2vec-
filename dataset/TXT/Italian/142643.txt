Jpyh7MfaNysY3geXjhzqJQ I ate here about 2 wks ago with my daughter. She's eaten here a few times & loved it. I had a White pizza with spinach. By the time I got back to our table with the drinks, the pizza came. So fast. It was delicious! The crust was crispy & light. It was enough to share but we each got our own. I took home half but by the time I got home, I wanted to finish it because it was so good!! I would definitely return when I'm in the area.
