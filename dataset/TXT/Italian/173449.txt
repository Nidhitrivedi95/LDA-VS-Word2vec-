N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg I saw this restaurant on the foodnetwork a few yrs back, Best Pizza's .. When my husband a Chicago Guy mentioned that Lou's opened here in the Valley we ventured out to give it a try. The place is tucked away in the back of the AJ's Shopping center, we used our gps to find it.
We arrived for a late lunch, Nice decor seats are very comfortable. The server was great very attentive. Having never tried their pizza, we ordered the Classic for two and a Thin Crust w/ Sausage, Mushroom and Onion.  The menu says the Classic is deep dish w/ extra cheese and sausage.. 

The food arrived and the presentation was disappointing. The " deep dish " was in a deep pan, but I wouldnt call it deep dish the pizza barely came to halfway to top of the pan. I think they forgot to drain the tomato's from the can because the topping was a watery mess, the sausage was bland. The best part was the cheese. I do not know what the hype is about this pizza. When I lived in Chicago, I ate Gino's, and Nancy's this place does not come close in the deep dish department. 

If you like Chicago thin crust pizza, this place is not for you. The pizza crust was bland no flavor, three was little or no sauce, again the sausage was bland no flavor so the mushrooms over powered the pizza, very sparse with the Cheese. Not a fan. If you want thin crust Chicago Pizza Vito's in Mesa is the best we have found.

After lunch we were not offered dessert, and handed the check. I asked about the key lime pie and I am glad we ordered that. The key lime pie was EXCELLENT ! I would return just for the dessert, for Pizza we will stick with Vito's for thin crust and Gino's for deep dish. 

Sadly I wanted to love this place.. food network has let me down again.
