iL2-xJ4-eMsJk88PsbivbQ God love 'em. The delivery man waited 20 minutes for me to arrive to pick up my Cannellini soup at the front desk of my condo center. I had ran out of gas, cash, you name it. A woman at the gas station also yelled at me because I was checking out her dog. Strange night. A good night to stay home and eat soup. Anyhow, the delivery man was so cordial, as were all delivery men after him. 

On another occasion, mom needed gluten free grub. Broadway was not 100% sure that the stock they used was gluten free, so they delivered the soup with the can so that we could evaluate the ingredients to assure ourselves. I felt that was really above and beyond because my mom never believes people when they say their food's gluten free. She likes to see proof.

Broadway Pizza truly gets customer service. 

As for the food, I ordered the Cannellini soup several times even after I wasn't sick anymore. Big containers delivered every couple of weeks. The soup comes with a ton of garlic knots too, which are especially good when fresh and hot, but I don't mind eating 2 or 6 straight out of the fridge later on.

Never been inside. Never had the pizza.
