skQ-HIR664Ivp2-A4kOfnA My Family loves this place!! I have tried a few things now on several visits, and everything that I have had been 3.5 to 4 stars. The service is great and the staff is friendly. Happy hour is good if going for drinks and the desserts are yummy too! The portions are very big so get the half if your not a big eater. The ambience is relaxing and the diners are always laughing. The overal exerience is 5 stars.
