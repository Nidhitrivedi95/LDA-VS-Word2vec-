uynbRIP4g85lp87xBJUaTg I went here for breakfast on a weekend.  I ordered poached eggs on a english muffin, with no sauce, ham or anything.  It came with the smallest slice of an orange and these terrible hashbrowns/home fries.  The pieces of potato were tiny and seasons horribly.  And then I was billed $12 for the meal!  I couldn't believe it so I complained to the server.  He went to speak to the manager and he expressed that I ordered eggs benedict and that was the price so loudly I could easily hear him.  This place is a joke and is terrible.  A meal that costs them $1 to make costs the customer $12!!!!  I hope they go out of business soon and a half decent breakfast place could come to the village!
