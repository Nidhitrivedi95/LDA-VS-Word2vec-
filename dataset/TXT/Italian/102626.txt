FiP7mCGs-qelOSmapmbt1A As good as their pizza is, is as bad as their customer service. 
I've gotten pizza here about 10 times since moving to the area.  Each time the service has been in the two star range.  
Today they reached a new low.  Girl that took my order had that "why are you bothering me " way about her. Lost my order then said it would take 30 minutes to fix. "that's just where we are" said the guy clerk. No "I'm sorry " nothing like that. Just a condescending "too bad for you dude" attitude.  No offer to waive the cost or maybe even no charge for mushrooms.  They probably spit in my pizza just for fun. Needless to say management is nonexistent and they don't care about customers. Wonder what goes on in the kitchen...
Pompous and , "we don't need you petty little customer" attitude.   
I have many choices in this neighborhood and I won't be choosing this place again.
