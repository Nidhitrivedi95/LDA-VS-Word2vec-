d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew So I have been here once prior to this last visit and I remember not being impressed by the service but the pizza was okay, not great but okay, and it is in close proximity to me so that is a draw. We went back the other night, mainly again because it was close and we had a coupon for two for one. Even with a coupon I don't think I would go back. I had baked ziti. It was rather bland and there wasn't anything special about it, not bad, but not good either. I switched with my dining partner who had the eggplant rollitini, this was horrible, the underlying bed of spaghetti was fine. It tasted like the make their own sauce, but the eggplant was mushy and again bland. Definitely not recently cooked, more like microwaved, and possibly bought from Sysco instead of being made in house. It was a $2.50 or so up charge for a dinner salad and bread sticks. The bread was hard and cold. The dinner salads were okay. One biggie though - no fresh brewed iced tea. Service started out slow but once the waitress came over everything was fast. I was teetering before a one star, as I said I will never go back there, but gave them a two as the sauce on the spaghetti was decent and the service was good when we finally got service. If there were halfsies in yelp I would probably do one and a half. Although I will note if I didn't have the coupon I would have definitely felt that it was not worth $30+ for two people.
