By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g Still love DOCG Enoteca.  This time we brought a 10 year old and a 1 year old with us.  We started with bone marrow and artichoke appetizers. Then we each ordered a pasta dish. They were very sweet to bring us a DOCG Pizza on the house.  

As expected, everything was awesome and each of us thought we ordered the best dish. My ricotta dumplings were amazing. 

We passed on dessert because we are indecisive and thought the 1 year old might have reached his limit.

Everyone who helped us that night was so sweet and we received such awesome service. I can only imagine what they thought when we walked up with the two kids, but we were treated so well and loved our meal.
