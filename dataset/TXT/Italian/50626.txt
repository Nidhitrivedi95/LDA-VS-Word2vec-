9Boahjn3QxlZnP2Aw_V1Rg This used to be my 'good restaurant' of choice for a few years. Great place for romantic dates, anniversaries and the like until everyone else started using it for the same, which is not a bad thing. Well, it was for me as I noticed the prices creep up a bit. 

The locale is set underground in a basement, however they have given it a very cave like feel. A very well addressed cave mind you. With low-ceilings, lots of yellow lighting and a level service which never disappointed me, I can only give this restaurant high praises. 

The chairs are wooden and the tables have an old world vibe. Funny enough, the decor strikes me more as Mediterranean than strictly souther Italian as I once was at a restaurant in Sevilla that looked just like this place. 

Now, the restaurant is on the small side so expect to feel it a little cramped on Friday and Saturday nights when is generally packed. For some privacy, I recommend the small room on the north-east side of the restaurant on the room on the right. Only a few tables there and a bit less server traffic.

The wine selection is very good and their pastas & desserts (their forte) can achieve levels of culinary orgasm  -- sometimes. Either way, expect the Italian style meal where you will have an aperitivo, antipasti, primo, secondo.. etc all the way to Caffè or Digestivo. So by the end, expect to be feel full & satisfied.   

Of course you pay for it, so for a great meal for two, expect a good $200 as base. I very much recommend Sotto Sotto to anyone who wants a semi-authentic rustic Italian meal.

Fun fact: Even though Sotto Sotto's menu is Italian, the place is basically run by Spanish people. Hola!
