q-YQIvBSNZxYJl1xuB0H_w CM2 has the most authentic Italian pizzas perfectly baked with a crispy crust and ultra fresh organically grown vegetables and herbs. We were raving about the truly exceptional sausage on our pizza, and owner Nantas told us that it is also made in-house. My favorite pizza is their "Chuck Franklin" (with pepperoni, their special sausage, wonderful tomato sauce & cheese, vivid red peppers and thinly sliced tender onions). Also, the Margarita pizza is one of the best that I've ever had. 
We're so in love with their pizza that we pick it up for home, as well. 
And, you have got to have one of their desserts! Their desserts & bakery breads are made fresh in-house every day. In fact, you can see the chefs and bakers right through the large glass windows of the kitchen. The tarts are velvety smooth with a tender, buttery crust & the taste is...off the charrrts!  Check out the video clip showing one that I brought home. 
They also serve more than pizza; you can check out my photo below of their menu, and, they're now open for brunch on Saturdays & Sundays.
The decor is rustic-contempo, the service is excellent, the wine selection is wonderful and they make you feel like family!
