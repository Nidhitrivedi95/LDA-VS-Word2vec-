zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA I am saddened by sending in this review.  We have dined here many many times and the food and service has been great.  

However, a few days ago I ordered several pizzas and inquired about salads.  I was given an option for $48 for a full tray.  I can get 5 large pizzas for $80 but then some salad for $48??

I decided on the half tray for $24.  That was a bad decision.  

I was then 'assigned' house and ranch dressing.  I requested blue cheese instead of ranch and the response from the owner was "Ranch is what most folks get."  How about asking what type of dressing I would like and not give me your attitude about what most people get?  Reluctantly the order was changed to Blue Cheese.

Then she says "You should probably pay now because picking up at 6 during our busiest time with people lined up outside might take some time."  I obliged and paid up front.

Well, at 6, the pizzas were ready as well as the salad and guess what? Not one person waiting in line for a table.

I then get home a grab a $2.50 bag of mixed green salad and add it to this half sheet, which DOUBLES the amount of salad, throw in a few tomatoes and olives and for $3 I just doubled the size of my $24 salad.  Just so it is clear, the $24 salad had some tomatoes, cucumbers, and a few onions, so it is pretty plain jane.

Pizza was good, but the $24 salad really was hard to swallow.

Get the pizza to go, but a $2.50 bag of salad is a much better way "to go"!!
