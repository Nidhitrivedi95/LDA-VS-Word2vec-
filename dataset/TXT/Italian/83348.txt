DIdvV0HZUMZWiYg4OXyGJg It's hard to find quality food and a great waitstaff, but Juliano's has both. We have been here several times and each time better than the last. We recently went an hour before they closed with a party of 13 and they accommodated us as if we were the first people there that evening. Every single person enjoyed their meals. I'd recommend the wings, fish dinner, calzones, and their meatballs; though you can't go wrong with whatever you choose.
