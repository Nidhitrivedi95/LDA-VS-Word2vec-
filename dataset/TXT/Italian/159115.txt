LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Great value for consistently delicious food. We dinned here twice while in Vegas because of the Happy Hour and the quality of food. I had cheese raviolis one night and the pasta Primavera another night with an Italian house salad. Both dishes were flavorful, fresh and big enough to split. You must have the hazelnut cheese cake some of the proceeds go to the charity from the cake. The servers were great each time!
