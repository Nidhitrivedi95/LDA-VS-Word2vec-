6kD0vTLj3oZJm7kXRSvfKw My boyfriend and I frequent this place for lunch and I am usually never disappointed. The new spot is beautiful! Much better than the old spot. The menu is extensive and I always try something different every time I come. The food is delicious!! My two favorites include the chicken Alfredo with rigatoni noodles and the pepperoni roll (which is not on their new menu, but they can still make it for us, which we greatly appreciate!). Sometimes the ingredients don't always taste fresh (for example, I swear, the spinach tastes canned or frozen) but I think the food is good for the price. The wine list is decent with wines that feature all kinds of price points. The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of 5 stars is because the service is always a little slow and lacking..  They don't time the food properly and appetizers and entrees usually always come out at the same time. The servers don't know proper wine knowledge or how to open and pour a wine bottle properly. Plus those white wine glasses that double as red wine glasses stink! Get proper red wine glasses so it can open the wine better! All in all. Nice place and worth checking out. Great lunch spot.
