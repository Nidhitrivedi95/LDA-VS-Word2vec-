5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA Overall, nice local place to enjoy with A-1 View.

View - OK, the view is better than the food, but that is because it is a great view.

Reservationists - The staff taking reservations are generally very nice and pleasant.  Local restaurant, Doesn't seem to have a database to remember you by, or to promote their restaurant to you for more visits.

Ambiance - Very nice overall. From very casual and family in shorts to business / smart casual or more.

Parking - Great and easy.

Food - Stone crab appetizers are great. Mussels are wonderful. All the food here is good. Anything outstanding, naw, but overall, you will never go wrong.  The Baby Back Ribs were quite a pleasant surprise and I would recommend this to anyone that is not sure what they want.   The Cioppino is something not on all menus and this is a nice dish.  I tend to measure a great Italian Restaurant by it's Osso Bucco, but this is not on the menu. Plenty of other good t hings though.

Check it out you will be happy.
