And no, they'll never make a Top Ten Healthy Foods list, but oh well. I made my way back there recently and laughed at all the people who didn't order honey mustard with their strips. Fools. I don't even like honey mustard, but I think I could drink a whole bottle of Geovanti's. Ew, ok maybe not, but I hope that explains how good it is.
 
There are other things on their menu, and I've had some of them. And that's about all I have to say about that.
