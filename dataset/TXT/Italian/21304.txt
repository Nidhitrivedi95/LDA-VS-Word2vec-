38-sjGYYVcQEKrZe5Nu47A The good: the food is awesome, it's a great little neighborhood bar. We've never had a bad meal, and you can't go wrong with the 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $6.99. 

The bad: we have been here on two occasions where the service has been awful--both times we had the same waiter named Andrew. We had to wait 10 minutes before flagging down a waitress to get us another beer after our glasses had been sitting empty. Even after we asked the waitress for another beer she let Andrew know that we were out of drinks. Another five minutes passed before she came back and asked if we had gotten our beers. He dropped off a beer without a word five minutes later. So a total of 20 minutes passed with our glasses empty. We watched as the rest of the staff hustled around helping other tables as we waiting for our check, and Andrew was no where to be found. One of the other waitresses even gave us sympathetic looks and went to go get Andrew for us. 
This is the second time we've had Andrew, and the second time we were left disappointed. 

Overall: We will go back, because the food is awesome and the staff with the exception of Andrew is great.
