7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ I have been here about 4 times.  And normally it is great.  But last night was awful!! I was so excited to take my husband there for the first time.  The waiter was done was done with us when we  decided not to order the 
$72 bone in Rib Eye.  We were set on the Osso Bucco, since we love that!  But we were told they were out of it.  But once we ordered the New York Steak, we didn't see our waiter again. And he as just rude when we asked questions.  I was so disappointed . The worst was for my husband.  He saw they had a pork chop, and was excited to try it.  It was like a pork pancake.  It was beaten very thinly and battered and fried.  Not at all what was described on the menue.
