qUWqjjjfpB2-4P3He5rsKw I'm a pretty big fan of Levetto.  I've been to all of the downtown locations.  

This Chinatown spot has only been open for about a month and a half and serves the "famous" Peking duck pizza... The duck skin should be crispier.  Aside from that, the pasta and the mushroom pizza are just as good as I remember.  

The one surprise was the brown butter coconut cake.  Damn, that was so good.  I don't normally eat desserts but this one was definitely worth a mention.
