jspgVJaiyobeUq6EMhmO-w Great pizza and salads.  Pasta is also on the menu.  Impressive wine and beer selection at reasonable prices, and a full bar as well.  Decor is a modern take on the classic trattoria, with checked tablecloths and cloth napkins making the restaurant area both homey and slightly more elegant than your typical pizza place.  The pizza is New York style, and somehow very tasty without being greasy.  We had a sliced meatball and onion pizza which I highly recommend. A nice Mediterranean salad, and boneless wings which were light and very tasty rounded out the meal.  Upper crust is a great addition to the central Phoenix casual Italian restaurant scene.  We can't wait to go back!!
