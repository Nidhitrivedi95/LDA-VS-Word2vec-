UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ This Brio location is a great restaurant as a whole. The design is beautiful. The staff is wonderful. The food is very good. Collectively the group I was with had salmon, shrimp, their peach beverages and chicken fingers. Everyone was very happy with their food and drinks. I would highly recommend this restaurant !
