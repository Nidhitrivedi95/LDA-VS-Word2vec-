7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Love love loooove this place. Would go here for breakfast every day if I could. Great food, good service. Although the refillable coffees go down to half cups after you've paid. A little slow on the water refills.. but easily something to overlook when the food is so yummy. Plus I feel better knowing everything is as organic and free range as can be. Be prepared for a wait though!
