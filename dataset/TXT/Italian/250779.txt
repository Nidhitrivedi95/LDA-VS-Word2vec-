VoXUt6TIJWyIf_lihbN5xQ Saturday evening walked in around 7:00 and were immediately seated.  By 7:30 the restaurant was full.  Ordered the Eggplant Rollotini and every bite was delicious!  The eggplant was wrapped around a light, fluffy ricotta mixture and placed on top of spaghetti, smothered in marinara sauce.  There are 4 Rollotinis which was more than enough for one person to eat.  I believe this entree could also be ordered as an appetizer and shared between 2-4 people. Ciao!
