1WBVqmo7tgF0z0eGf4fPhQ What an incredible surprise! My boyfriend and I stopped in on a whim and WOW! The service was wonderful but the food is what we will come back for again and again. The truffle burrata special was delectable and the fresh, house made pasta was exquisite! In fact, the food was so good we asked to compliment the owner, Andrea. And yes, he is straight from Italy. My only minor complaint is the ambiance. Radio with commercials and the sound of the dishes being washed are not the best but you will not walk away disappointed!!
