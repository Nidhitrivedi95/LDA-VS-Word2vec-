TQqhfjlPVEz41K_wAogQSQ First off, this place is extremely family friendly.  At this point in our lives that is our number one priority when dining out.   Everything else takes a back seat!

We visited Luigi's for the first time on Saturday evening.  We went with another family.  So... 4 adults and 4 kids under the age of 3.  We arrived at 5:30p and had to wait about 30 minutes - the restaurant was packed!  Not a big deal - it was a nice evening - pletty of areas close by for the kids to walk/run around.  

The food was really good!  The adults shared  a salad (fancy), and a couple of pizzas (sausage and the special that day).  We really enjoyed the thin crust.  The kids menu offered pizza and some pasta options.  The kids portions were generous and reasonably priced.  

Our waitress - i forget her name - sorry! - was great.  She was attentive, but not pushy.  She also had a good sense of humor, which really helps when dealing with 4 children under the age of 3.  

The place was filled with a nice mix of people - families and couples, young people ,as well as, those with more grey around the edges.  The noise level was appropriate.  The concrete floors are a God send for easy clean up after the kiddies!

Luigi's will definitely get put into the rotation for our weekly family dinners out and about.

As Yelp says...  Yay!  I'm a fan!
