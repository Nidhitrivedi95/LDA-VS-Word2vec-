3cbsPfoUUrysf-M8FI_0IA The brunch dishes were amazing, but the service was lacking. Right after we paid for our $80 brunch, the hostess asked if we could leave and go downstairs to their coffee area. I thought this was very rude since we were only there a little over an hour and paid $80! In Europe and many U.S. Restaurants, this would be frowned upon. We were also never asked if we wanted more coffee (that we poured ourselves). The server asked us once how our food was 1 minute after the meals were dropped, not even enough time to pick up my fork and take a bite. Even though the food was great, that's not the only thing that needs focus in a restaurant. Probably won't return because there are plenty of restaurants in PGH that have good food AND GOOD SERVICE. Sorry for the negative review, but I worked in the service industry for 4.5 years and I would have never asked my customers to move after they tipped me $15.
