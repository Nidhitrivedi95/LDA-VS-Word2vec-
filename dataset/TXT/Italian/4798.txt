_MHUEErH3KW_KvVSOjyYhg I was working around 12st St. and Glendale Ave and was looking for a place to grab a quick lunch. 

There aren't too many places that are quick unless you want a fast good chain. But after a quick search I found Pats Pizza Plus.

I got the lunch special that had the 2 slices of cheese pizza and a coke. I added ham to one and pepperoni to the other. The soft drinks they offer are coke products.

The food we ordered came out fast! The quality of the pizza was great. Its a New York style pizza, cheezy and a nice crispy crust and not too much sauce. 

Pats also has alot of other dishes that are on the menu and hope to one day try.

If your looking for a quick bite and are in the area of 12st St. and Glendale Pats Pizza Plus is yout place.
