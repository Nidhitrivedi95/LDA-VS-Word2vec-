BrhyYc1-gn3lPuhlkqNk2w I would say overall that this pizza joint is a good one. It's not far from our house, so it usually doesn't take long for delivery. I've noticed that when Frankie (the owner) works there, the pizza is amazing. We usually get pepperoni and garlic knots. A couple of nights we've gone to pick up an order, it isn't ready when they said it would be, and the pizza just doesn't taste the same... that is when there are teenagers working- so maybe it had to do with that? I'm still sold on ordering during the day- the prices have kind of gone up but they do have some great specials.
