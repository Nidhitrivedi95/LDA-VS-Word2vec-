tshN5rYRrzanHu4ZiwCVrA This is consistently the best Olive Garden I've ever been to. 
To go orders-
I've ordered on there go a few times (which is SO easy and surprisingly customizable!) And each time I've been greeted by at LEAST three people with the biggest smiles on their faces. They have had my order ready exactly when I requested it each time and they always make sure I don't need anything else. Not to mention they package my meal appropriately! How many times have you ordered to go soup from a restaurant and the lid wasn't sealed or the bowl was upside down? Not here! They even put in these nifty divider things between items. I love it!
Dining in-
Have you ever worked in retail with a manager who just sat a computer all day, not facing any of the crab burst customers? Every time I've come to this location, I've seen the managers help carry meals to tables, bring refills, check on guests, and even clean tables. What a breath of fresh air! The waiters are all smiles, super fast, and give you updates on your meal before it comes out. Once I ordered a piece of the limoncello cake to go and the waiter accidentally brought it on a plate (not a big deal of course, let's be real, once I saw it I wanted to dig right in!) so instead of bringing me a box, he brought me a brand new piece to go right away, at no charge! What?! These guys get it right. Now, I'm gonna go eat my delicious fresh salad and some of those famous breadsticks.
