mYlNFkIiFY3SyDl-nPWR5g I was originally in town for business but then connected with family and ended up celebrating our belated birthdays at Nick's. All I can say is that I wish this place was right around the corner from me. It was SO GOOD!!! I could totally become a regular at this place. It's nothing but high points folks:

1. Authenticity - the waiters are actually, get this, ITALIAN!
2. Service - fast and friendly, which is impressive for such a popular place.
3. Beverages - good selection of affordable wines and specialty drinks. The house Pinot Grigio was great.
4. Seating - though it's small inside and by the looks of it, very popular, we walked in and were seated immediately without a reservation. 
5. Food - 5 stars! FANTASTIC! The bread that comes when you are seated is delish (and a generous selection of a few different breads). We started with the yummy antipasto salad - fresh and delicious. It could only by topped by the entrees - each meal was so good and was a decent portion - Shrimp Scampi, Baked Ziti and Butternut Squash Ravioli (my fave). Though definitely full, I couldn't resist dessert and ordered a cannoli. Oh...my...gosh... delicious. Such a fantastic meal. 

I hope that business or other travel brings me back again.
