U3O8l_wmzdeckbhHpuRWCg It was my brother-in-law's birthday on 6/15/12 and he was given a gift card at work to Olive Garden. We bought him a Bellini and we advised the waitress of his birthday and asked if they will bring him a cake and she said cakes are $6. His wife agreed to order the cake and the waitress brought out a chocolate chip frozen cake and dropped it in front of him and didn't have the wait staff sing happy birthday or even refill our drinks without being asked to do so. 

The prices for entrees have gone up in price so high for the amount of food that for two people ordering one appetizer and 2 entrees and one Bellini and iced tea cost over $60!! The price coupled with the poor service on a special occasion make Olive Garden an undesirable choice in the future. My brother in law said he will never eat there again.
