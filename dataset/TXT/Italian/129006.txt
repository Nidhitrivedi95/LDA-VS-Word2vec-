i4hvmTd4RH9HvOyG8ndYGw I would have loved to eat the meatball sub and wings I ordered but sadly, I never received them. After placing a pickup order online I called to confirm and was told my wait time would be about 30 mins, no big deal. After about 20 mins I realized due to the proximity of my location and Raffaele's (Less than a mile) and the fact that I spent over the delivery dollar amount that I would call and ask for my order to be delivered instead. The woman who works there explained that it would be an additional 30-45 mins for delivery, still not an issue as I had ordered before I was too hungry. Fast forward two and a half hours later, still no food...mind you, I am .3 miles away from this place. I had enough at this point and called to cancel when i was informed the delivery person had already left 10 mins ago. Now, I am no food delivery expert but .3 miles is not more than 10 mins away (Google Maps agrees with me). I informed the employee of this and she said the delivery person had other deliveries to make as well. Well I am (still) not a delivery expert but one would think that because I was so close (.3 miles away, remember?) and the fact that I had placed my order 2 + hours prior would give me some priority, right? Not at Raffaele's! To top it all off, when inquiring about my refund the staff were not at all knowledgeable and referred me to the 3rd party ordering company through which they receive the online orders. Needless to say I won't be waiting on food from here in the future. Every individual who has worked in food service knows customer service is key, someone should alert the staff at Raffaele's.
