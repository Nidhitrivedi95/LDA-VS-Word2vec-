qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ I brought a group of students to Casanova Brothers for lunch and they were so patient and kind! It was awesome. They have many lunch specials for decent prices - under 10$, with some pasta dishes closer to 5....awesome! Further, their white pizza was amazingly tasty. Their regular slices were alright, but didn't hold a candle to the white. It's too bad they're so far from my house, but I'm excited that they are moving into a larger space and would definitely return.
