rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg Best food at festival was "Chef Office" . It's a small booth next to the cheese cake on a stick, second row near the stage.. The food was well seasoned and hot. The people were very friendly. The other food we tried was bland , not hot, not tasty. The beer was good and cold and the Kettle corn is yummy..
