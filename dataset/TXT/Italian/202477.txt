q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ I met some friends at Capo's with no reservations around 7:00 pm on a Saturday night.  I expected to wait some time for a table which just made for more conversation time with friends.  We made our way to the bar and ordered a couple of drinks that were well made and just strong enough.  The ambience was evocative of what I think a "speakeasy" would have  been in the 20s or 30s.  There are pictures on the walls of various notorious pre-WWII gangsters.  There was a gentleman performing karaoke to classic Sinatra, Martin, Bennett and other crooners.  He was, for the most part, right on.  

Eventually, we made our way to a booth to eat.  In our group we ordered Veal, salmon, lasagna and arrabiata pasta.  We started with an appetizer of caprese which was very good.  A large section of mozzarella, thick slice of tomato and a good dose of balsamic vinegar.  I would have preferred more basil, but I'm really partial to basil.  Our meals were delicious.  The protions were good, but not overwhelming.  With our appetizer, bread, and soup or salad before the meal there was enough to take home after eating sensibly.  

The server was attentive without being overbearing.  Our waters were consistently refilled without request.  All in all a great evening of food, service and ambience.  I look forward to going back.
