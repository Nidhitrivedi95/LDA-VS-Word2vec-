klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw AWESOME. 

Went here for breakfast. There were several people at the restaurant already, but it was not too crowded. The restaurant is right on the edge of the casino, so it is great for people watching.  The decor is modern and they have a few tv's on throughout.

I had the filet mignon sliders and they may have been the best thing that I have ever eat. In fact, the restaurant was recently featured on a show called "the best thing i have ever eat" for that very thing! They are served on cheddar/bacon biscuits, with eggs, cheese, and creamed spinach. You seriously need to order this!!

Great service from the time we walked in. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive, without checking on us all the time. She just took care of things.

The only downside to Society Cafe is that it is a little bit pricey (breakfast was around $55 for 2), but this is a real nice hotel, so that is to be expected. Breakfast was pretty awesome, so I think that it was worth every penny. I heard the cinnimon rolls are pretty great.

Would/will definately go back to Society Cafe at Encore. Would like to try them out for dinner sometime.
