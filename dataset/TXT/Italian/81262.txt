dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw This dinner was wonderful.  I had the rigatoni and found it absolutely delicious!  My boyfriend had the lobster gnocchi and found nothing to complain about whatsoever.  I am giving this place four stars based on the food.

The service was smothering.  We barely had a chance to glance over the menus before he came to our table.  He was overly helpful, making the service seem comical yet annoying.

I found a few things that prevented me from giving it five stars.  I do not drink during dinner and therefore ordered a coke.  My boyfriend's beer was six dollars, my coke was 5. That is just outrageous.

For a good meal, come to this restaurant.  For great service?  I have seen better.
