I made a reservations on open table. On the day of, I forgot to call to say that we would be late, and thought they would just give away my reservation, but instead, they called me and checked in. When I asked if I could push the reservation back, they gladly obliged.

We got our table right away when we got there despite there being a line up! Our waiter explained the specials and when we ordered, we got our pizzas within 10 mins! We had to remind them of our drink order and to bring us bread, but overall, the food came quick. We ordered a libetto Margarita pizza and a mushroom pizza. Both were good, but a bit cold (perhaps due to us taking photos and such). I liked the margarita better.

Afterwards, we ordered the donut and coffee. I told the waiter it was my friend's bday and he comped the dessert (pleasant surprise) and put a candle on the donut! My friend accidentally ordered the wrong version of coffee and the waiter give her a new one and comped it! Another pleasant surprise! 

Overall, the experience was awesome! The music was pretty loud so we had to speak loudly to one another. The waiters did come by a lot asking to clear our plates. My friend is a slow eater so that was a bit annoying, however when she said so, one of the waiters made a joke and said he was a quick waiter, but gave us our space after. Jokes!

A very family style feel. Food isn't bad. I've been here a couple of times over the years and food is always consistent. Give it a try!
