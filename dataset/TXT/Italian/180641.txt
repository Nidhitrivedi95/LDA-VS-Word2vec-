NvG2KYObJujUeswSDmww_w I don't usually put in comments about places, but I had to let people know before they decided to go here on a weekend night thinking of having a casual wine/appetizer evening with their spouse ... think again!  I think there was only one waitress working the whole place.  We sat outside on the patio for about 20 minutes and she came out and said she would be with us shortly.  We waited another 35 minutes and she was no where near heading in our direction - so we left.  I can't tell you how their food/drinks were, because I didn't even get that far - if I have to wait an hour just to get a drink/water I can't imagine how long it would take to get our food!  Those of us crazies still living in Anthem know that there are very limited places to go, but if you ARE one of the few places people decide to come to, wouldn't you hire more staff to get the service up to par and make it a place people WANT to hang out at?  Needless to say, we won't EVER be going back there again - who has that kind of time to waste?  I'd rather drive down to Scottsdale and get served as soon as I get there than drive 5 minutes and wait an hour to get water!  Good Luck Wild Vines ... you'll be on the list of closed places in Anthem pretty soon ....
