_myTPlWa8QRN5eavs-hNPg My husband and I have dined here several times.  The   food & service are pretty consistent.  My personal favorite is the sausage & pepper risotto.  My husband loves their lasagna. They seem to have good variety in the nightly specials Sunday brunch with live jazz is a hidden gem!  I agree with other reviews in that their take out service & online ordering are their weak spots.
