y1AM7MeCN3HaS7SHnxcBfQ I came to Il Mulino with a WagJag voucher in hand for a four-course prix fixe menu for 2.

The wines here are expensive $13.95 for a glass of 6 oz. Cabernet Sauvignon that I didn't think was a great wine.  

The food at Il Mulino was very good, though attention to detail needs to improve as I was brought my soup without a spoon to drink it with and my order of cappuccino was totally forgotten about until I asked about it.  I had already finished my dessert by the time it finally came. Also, no bread basket?  And I doubt they do this to regular customers, but an automatic 17% gratuity was added to my bill.  That didn't sit well with me.  But in their defense, they charged 1% less than what Toronto Life magazine standard of 18% being the norm.  

The 10 oz. striploin was the standout of the evening with a nice char and a great grilled flavour to it.  They know how to cook a great steak!  Their gnocchi is also pretty amazing (they have a cream sauce or tomato sauce option).  Pillowy-soft and the tomatoes were extremely fresh.

One of the better Italian restaurants I've eaten at and if it weren't for the little details I would've given it a full 5 stars.  If you're promoting your restaurant, the worst thing you could do is count the pennies.  At the end of the day, I think the prices are a little inflated for what it is.
