mFmmOKdcwFrDqXKaew0ahw Saturday night didn't feel like going out but was looking for an Italian dinner. Pasta for my wife and a pizza for me. 

Ordered on line and the experience was great. Easy to navigate and a delivery time is given. In our case 7:00. So we opened a bottle of wine in anticipation of the arriving dinner. 

At about 7:10 the doorbell rang and our meal had arrived. This is where our evening turned. My wife had ordered angel hair pasta with marinara and meatballs. What she got was a dish of dry pasta (little sauce) and not the angel hair. My pizza was the worst. I've never in my life thrown a pizza away as there's always some redeeming quality somewhere. Not in this case. Ordered the thin and crispy 18" pie to freeze the left overs. What I got was a cold dried out pie with what seemed to be a "ready made" crust. Had little dimples underneath in the crust from the production process. Tasted worse than any frozen pizza I'd ever had from a supermarket. 

After spending 40 with tip for this meal, we were extremely disappointed. My advise. Don't order the thin & crispy unless you're a connoisseur of frozen pizzas.
