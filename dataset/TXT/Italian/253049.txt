Dinner was amazing, service was excellent, food was great, we sat on the patio which wasn't too hot even for July weather. Just really really good experience...

then we went upstairs, the club was mehhh, we got free drink tickets and got to get weird drunk men touching our hair and walking up out of nowhere to try and kiss us, gross. The nightclub obviously can't control their patrons oddness but the club itself was underwhelming, we only stayed for one drink then left... but I would really reccommend the restuarant!
