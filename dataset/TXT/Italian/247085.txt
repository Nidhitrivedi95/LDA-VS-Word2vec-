V6MWAv-xv4dgSUrDU1qxaA We tried this place on a sunday at lunch. It was not that busy and seemed pretty clean. It has a casual fast food vibe like chipotle or moes except everything is noodles. Italian , macaroni, asian, whatever. If its noodles they have it. I ordered the pad thai noodles and we had an order of pot stickers. The pad thai was surprisingly good and the pot stickers were decent. Food came fast and service was good. The only reason I cant rate it higher is the price. I think the pad thai is like $7.50 which sounds about right for a fast food place. A nice sit down restaurant you would pay $8 to $9 until you realize all noodles dishes you have to pay extra for meat, so $3.50 extra for chicken in your pad thai puts you at $11 for your bowl of noodles which is getting into almost $$$ scale at sit down full service restaurants. Decent choice if you are out shopping and dont want a lot of hassle but kind of pricey for what you get.
