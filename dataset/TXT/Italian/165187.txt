M3tCYlgvLLbQfU0ybHiing Order Delivery tonight. First off when I called I was asked if I could please hold ad before I could even answer I was put right on hold. I held on hold four And a half minutes. I placed my order and was told it would be 45 Minutes to an hour before It Would be delivered. No problem I expected that on a Saturday night. The pizza was awesome. So it makes it worth the hold time.
