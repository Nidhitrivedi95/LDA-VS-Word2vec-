1U9lgJoEhxaCMP0PsuSJgA Just when I thought I was sick of pizza, I ended up at Barro's. I've never seen such a squadron of youngsters so friendly and helpful. When they say "20 minutes", my pizza's ready in 15. These kids are on the ball.

The crust? Not too thin, not too thick. Just right. Tasty. Soft.
Sauce? Great! Not too thin, just the right amount, not too salty or tangy.
Great cheese, generous toppings. My mouth is watering.
So many specialties I have to try...I wonder about that kona pizza with terryaki sauce, chicken, and pineapple. Sounds yummy.

It's also nice that they're always doing some sort of fundraiser in there; they really enjoy giving to the community. This is not your average parlor.
