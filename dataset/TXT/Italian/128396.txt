HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA Terrible service, the waitress who was the ONLY waitress could have cared less if this was our first time here, pizza was meh, I've had better, given the fact that it was crowded, I thought the idea of an appetizer was that it came before your entree, not here we got out pizza first how backwards is that!!!!! NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!!!!!!!
