2i0dDzxLuQQAwzxDZVR-1g I really liked Oretta!

I was recently in the neighbourhood and decided to drop by. I had a latte that was DELICIOUS and a veggie panini that was really really good too!

The place was clean, well lit and so cute. Not sure if they have wifi.

The only thing I would say is that is does get quite busy during the weekdays past noon and I feel like they should staff more people. Other than that, great place and I'd definitely return again!
