Zja7ykq3icDzkN20XX6j1w Okay, here's the thing . . . 

Aiellos is the best pizza in Pittsburgh. I'm telling you . . . It is the best. Yes, I have had Mineos. It doesn't compare. I wouldn't care if the inside of this pizza shop looked like a prison (side note: it kinda does right now because it is undergoing a major remodel) because the pizza is THAT good. 

I have been going to Aiellos consistently for years. It was love at first bite. They even back their pizza up with a: you-don't-like-it-you-don't-pay-for-it guarantee. 

I bet it has never had to be honored. 

On a practical and helpful level, here are a couple things you should know:

1. It's cash only 

2. You pay after you order AND eat (hence guarantee) 

3. You grab your own drink(s) from the cooler and pay for it/them after 

4. A true measure of a pizza is its ability to stand on its own as a regular cheese pizza. Order that. (BUT my friends also swear by the white with feta) 

5. You can park for free on side streets like Douglas (where I always park) up the street a bit (because there are some pay spots closer to Murray)

This pizza is worth you going out of your way to experience. AND it might not be far fetched to say the pizza SHOP wouldn't be worth your time to go out of your way to experience too once the remodel is complete. Aiellos pizza originated in 1978 with a recipe straight from Italy. I hope that recipe is locked in a gold chest somewhere. 

It's that precious.
