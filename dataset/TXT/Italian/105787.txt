fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg Although at first I got confused with the concept or the setting of the place, different kind of menu, The menu offers sushi, Italian, ramen, rice, noodles, meat, tofu, seafood, and desserts. 
The calamary crispy enough although I still could see the oil left on the plate. 
The service was nice. 
I would like to go back to try something else.
