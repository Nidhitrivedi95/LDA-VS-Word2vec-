Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw I read so many good reviews, that I have to think this was an off day.
- My two slices of cheese pizza looked nothing like the pictures on the web, and was barely average tasting.
- My Philly Cheese Steak was skimpy and the peppers and onions were not sauteed like I asked
- Garlic knots - they were forgetful
- Veal parm sub - it was forgetful

There were so many good reviews that I will definitely try this place again, but what a disappointment for the first time visit. The best thing about this place was all the Italians, it felt like home.
