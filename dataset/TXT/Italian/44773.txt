8CRoFhyVzple6ji3S1_L-A Don't understand why people are raving so much about the views.  I mean, I guess you can see some of the skyline, but it's no better than the view you get from the RTA as it crosses the bridge after the Tower City stop.  Also, there's a large building in front of the restaurant that blocks... basically all of the water.

Went on Valentine's Day.  Apparently on Valentine's Day they force you to choose one each of appetizer, salad, main course, and dessert, for $50 per person (actually, with tax and mandatory 20% gratuity, it came out to $127 for two people - yikes).

The food was awesome, but the portions were small.  For instance, the wedding soup tasted fabulous, but came in a bowl the size of one of those little dessert cups you get at chinese restaurants after your meal.  The filet+scampi entree came with all of two shrimp that were absolutely delicious.  The sugar coat on the creme brulee was probably the best I've ever tasted.. but again, the bowl was tiny.

The service was on the spot.

Bottom line:  Food tastes great, but the portions are very small for the price.  And the view isn't worth it.
