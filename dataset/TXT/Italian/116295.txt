GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA I had high hopes for B&B, unfortunately, they disappointed. Maybe the poor service was due to the fact that we weren't catching a show...Next time, I will lie. 
We were sat at a broken banquette, then when moved, sat for 15 minutes without menus, water, bread or a waiter to greet us. When the waiter finally greeted us, with menus, it was another 10 minutes to get bread - and we had to ask for olive oil (which was fantastic). It was another 10 minutes before we were given empty champagne glasses and another 5 before they were filled. 
Okay, so the squash blossoms were delicious and the corn sformato with porcini - divine. Then we got our pasta course. The hot plate given to me, was dirty and had to be sent back. The spaghettini with one pound of lobster in a spicy tomato based sauce was fabulous, the gnocchi with oxtail was flavorful and tender, and the mint ravioli envelopes with spicy lamb sausage - spectacular. Once again, however, the service was horrible. We took the suggestion of the waiter for a red wine to match our pasta course. Unfortunately, this was served 10 min after our pasta - which was stone cold by then. Difficult to enjoy the wine suggested to compliment the meal, when served in this manner. 
All of a sudden, the timing of service picked up and two waiters asked if they could serve our fish course - whisking away our partially eaten pasta. 
The Orata was beautiful in it's parchment paper package. Opening it, we could see a lovely piece of fish on green beans, tomato and clams. But, the smell was very industrial - almost as if sprayed with rancid oil. I asked if the fish was fresh or salt water, but no one asked us how it was. We would have told them.
Dessert was fine - grappa scented panna cotta with Mission figs stuffed with honeycomb, but the service was so horrible and distracting, it made this special occasion difficult to enjoy.
