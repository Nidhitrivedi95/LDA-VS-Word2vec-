eHhBGqQbDpCcSpz7SZPTbA I finally came back because I was in the area and starving. 

I ended up having to wait a good 45 minutes for my gluten free pizza. They did end up comp'ing me the meal because of that. The pizza was pretty good but hard to really enjoy after the wait. 

The manager was super nice and came over to apologize, he even had us do a taste test for a new version gf crust (the older/current was better).

I may indeed end up going back 1 day..
