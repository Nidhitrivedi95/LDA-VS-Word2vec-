esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA Great little place.  Fast service and the food wasn't that bad or bland.

Half of the group ordered the $15 special (smaller portions, but there was a salad).  

There was free bread, and lots of it which helped some of us fill up due to the smaller portions, although some were still left hungry.  

Service was fast.  Table for 10 was ready in a minute.
