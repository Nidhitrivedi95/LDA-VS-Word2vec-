The ambiance is okay, nothing trendy or hip it's more old school restaurant look but missing a few key pieces to making it charming. If you go for the food, which is for sure worth it, you won't be disappointed. Top on our list is the veal osso bucco and any pasta that has their fresh sweet corn sauce!
