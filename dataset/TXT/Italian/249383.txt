VjaHHmV-rSkFaOAnU3faxg Drove up to Salvatore's from Illinois. Being a Jersey girl and brief Trentonian I have to say I absolutely loved it! We ordered the pepperoni and portobello to go and dove into the sausage, onion and goats cheese..... Omg yummmmm! My mom and I both agreed the sauce was delicious. I have absolutely nothing negative to say. Everything was fresh, delicious and plentiful:)... The salad is large but a great starter and heck you just share:)...the staff were friendly and knowledgable and this place was doing some good carry out business on a cold Thursday night. Sun Prarie you are sooooo lucky!!!
