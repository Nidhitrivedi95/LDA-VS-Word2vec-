XeUm1QS078kgjwONhul0ng absolutely awful service.  Eaten here for 20 years and cannot believe they can't get a simple pizza order right.  Sat there waiting for ONE hour for the pizza, took it home and open the box and got a vegetarian pizza (I ordered the meat lovers).  Tried to reach them on the phone, waited 5 minutes, got hung up on called back and finally got the rude cashier who took my order.  No apologies, nothing.  Just Oh there must of been a mix up in the kitchen!  

Drove back over there and she pushed the money in my hand (DIDN'T GET MY TIP BACK THOUGH!) and again uttered excuses about the kitchen making a mistake.  Never will go back.  this is the SECOND time they haven't been able to produce a correct order.  My time is valuable and I wasted 1.5 hours waiting on a pizza for nothing.  Very disappointed in the service and ATTITUDE of the cashier.
