Anyhow, I'll make it brief, waiter took forever to bring a cocktail menu, then they forgot us after we moved tables because it was too chilly out, the cocktails we ordered (spicy martini) was straight up cheap tequila with pepper flakes aaand they forgot to salt rim per our request.  It didn't matter, I made better cocktails when I was 15 years old. Dinner was underwhelming but quite honestly that was the least of the disappointments we experienced while dining here.
