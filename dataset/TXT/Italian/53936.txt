A7waf6G3cvnLfAqKeLL8DA This has been on my list for quite some time and I finally decided to try it for my birthday dinner a few weeks ago. I heard it's usually quite difficult to get reservations so I made one for a table of 2 a few weeks before the day we were going to come for dinner.

The location of Buca on King is quite hidden as you have to walk through an alleyway to get into the restaurant. The service from the beginning to the end was quite attentive which is always a plus. They were very helpful when we wanted some menu items explained.

With that being said, we ordered and shared a few dishes:
Bruschetta - whipped buffalo ricotta, figs, raw wildflower, honey, pistachio, preserved lemon 
- This was quite refreshing with an overall balance of sweet and sour from the lemon. 

Bigoli - duck egg pasta, duck ragu, venetian spices, mascarpone, basil
- The portion was smaller than expected for this but the overall flavours were quite rich. You could definitely taste the duck ragu. 

Brasato Misto - tomato braised beef short ribs, cotechino sausage, stone ground polenta, parmigiano, basil
- The short ribs were super tender and broke as soon as you touched it with a fork. It was balanced well with the polenta and sausage. 

We also ordered two glasses of wine along with the meal.

Overall, the meal was enjoyable but it is definitely on the pricier side with smaller portions but authenticity wise, I thought it was pretty good. However, I don't see myself coming back for a while as it seemed like a place I wanted to always just try once.
