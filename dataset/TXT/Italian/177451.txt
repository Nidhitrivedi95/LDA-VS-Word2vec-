NnOAwa0A2tNPnZl9IHVLPQ Zeppe's is a good pizzeria in a town full of pizzeria's. I haven't been inside the store in a couple of years, but I recently had their pizza at an event. It is very good pizza. I went ahead and had pepperoni and enjoyed it. There was the perfect amount of pepperoni; not too much but not too little. The crust is unique to other pizza places. It's crisp but a little chewy at the same time. It doesn't look like your average pizza crust. I've never had their salads or pastas before. There is a dining area inside, but again, I haven't been inside in a couple of years and have never eaten in. Overall, Zeppe's is a good pizzeria, but nothing special.
