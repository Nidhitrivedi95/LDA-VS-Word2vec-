7bkA-nYNZTAAXF9i5-o-Kw When it was announced that A3 Napoli was going to be offering a pizza in collaboration with Porchetta & Co, I know that I'd be there sooner or later.

We started out with the special Il Fritto, which was fried cauliflower atop a couple of tasty sauces. This was definitely a decent dish, but for some reason it wasn't even a little hot when it arrived to the table. The breading wasn't terribly crispy, either, so I would say this wasn't exactly the best way to start the meal.

But then the Porchetta & Co pizza arrived. Topped with porchetta, bechamel, Provola, pear, sage, pistachio, honey, and crackling, the pie was nothing short of delicious. All the ingredients worked beautifully together - even the pear! - although I will admit that I would have never guessed the porchetta connection had I not known. (It probably didn't help that the cook seemed to have forgotten the crackling.)

I'll note also that we were there at noon on a Sunday and were the only people in there the whole time. It's surprising because the food is really, really good.
