6PQve0oFCLPSh4wnIzvJtg I love the candlelit charm of an Italian restaurant and Buon Gusto has exceptional service and food to go with that charm. Expect to wait if you visit Buon Gusto during peek business hours. Buon is a small and very popular restaurant; the food, service, and charm are exceptional.

I had the clam chowder soup to start my meal and that was a perfect amount of food to hold me over until the eggplant parma appetizer. The eggplant parm is made with garlic, pancetta, and sherry wine. It was great! Honestly, I might try it next time as my entree.

Have you ever had pumpkin lasagna? For my entree, the chef had created a lasagna experiment. One of the owners sold me on the lasagna with a pumpkin sauce. If expecting a red meaty sauce, you might have been disappointed. However, I was forewarned about the substitute and details of the creation. I tend to enjoy trying new and different cooking creations, so I was excited to try pumpkin lasagna. The owner's enthusiasm sold me. His description was spot on. I really enjoyed the off menu creation. You'll have to beg the chef to recreate this pumpkin sauce next season. 

All meals are served with warm bread and soft butter. The restaurant is clean and the decor includes checkered tablecloths and hanging grades, garlic, and peppers. You'll see jars of peppers and pasta - and of course no Italian restaurant would be complete without the "Buon Appetite" prominently displayed. I will definitely visit again next time I am in Henderson.
