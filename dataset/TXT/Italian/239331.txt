U7fZfH9C4hj5BFRYaPOo2w Went for Sunday brunch. We made reservations for our party of six by phone in advance.  

Beautiful restaurant, killer view. The brunch was buffet-style, cold plates of cut fruit, cheeses, antipasti, salame, etc. Hot foods in covered chafing dishes: bacon, sausages, potatoes, quesadillas/breakfast tacos, pancakes, waffles, etc. Omelet bar with name-your-own omelets. Bagels/lox/cream cheese. Very tasty food, and there will be something for everyone.

Everything VERY fresh, constantly restocked, and high quality.

Coffee cups sometimes not refilled, waters not refilled, OJ only offered at beginning of meal and then not refilled. Waitress was not busy, so this is why we only give four stars. If she had more "hustle" we would have awarded five stars due to the surroundings, the food quality and variety, and the friendliness of the manager who stopped by our table three times during the meal to make sure we had everything we needed.

Classy operation; we'll definitely be back.
