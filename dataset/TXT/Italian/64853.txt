bHqJQxPF-VL95tjAUYtK6w First time eating here and I ordered through delivery . Figures it has decent reviews and looked yummy I got a Greek salad and the pasta pesto after emptying one of my dressing containers I noticed a black hair in the bottom very gross I couldn't finish my food what a waste of $30 .
