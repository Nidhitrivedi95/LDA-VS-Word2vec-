It was a beautiful Friday morning when the Lunch Bunch assembled and got some delicious steamy food.  After browsing the menu, I decided on ordering the mascarpone cheese and butternut squashed filled ravioli in the browned butter sauce.  

That first bite was a surprise!  I had ordered it thinking it would be a nice savory dish and instead, sweetness was the first thing I tasted.  The browned butter sauce had sage and sugar so it felt like I was eating little pillows with pumpkin pie-esque filling.  It's not exactly a bad thing but it was definitely unexpected.  I feel like I can say I had dessert for lunch.  The garlic bread included was super flavorful.  Bread is made fresh daily and they even sell loaves [and they sell out fast].  Everything was homemade and made with love.

At 11:30am, the quaint little place filled up fast and we sat in the outdoor patio to enjoy the nice, brisk, December air.  They have patio heaters set out so don't let it deter you away if you want to enjoy a nice dinner outdoors while staying toasty.  We also got to speak with the owners Carlo and Emilie and they're absolutely adorable and charming.  I wish them all the best in their new business!
