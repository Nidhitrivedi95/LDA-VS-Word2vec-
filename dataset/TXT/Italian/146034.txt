K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ Location. Location. I went to Hyde for a pre-dinner cocktail, so I can't comment on the late night club scene. The open air view over the fountains has to be one of the most visually stunning experiences in Vegas. The cocktail list looked interesting, though overdone like most Vegas beverages right now. I stuck to a glass of bubbly and the spouse had a Macallan 25. The staff was friendly and competent, though I did feel a bit sorry for the waitresses who had to work in bandage dresses and 5 inch heels. Overall verdict is that I will gladly return.
