eQo4kIwIWJbAnfXYl3k5BA After a long road trip, I was interested in trying out a unique or "buzzworthy" local restaurant as a first-time Charlotte visitor.  When my host pulled up to Portofinos in a non-descript strip mall, I was a little disappointed.  Italian restaurants from my hometown of Indy mostly offer bland-tasting, Americanized muck, so I was immediately biased against Portofinos. 

However, I was pleasantly surprised by Portofinos...décor, food, service, and all. Our table split both a bottle of dry spicy Malbec and the delicious Hot Antipasto sampler (clams, mussels, stuffed mushrooms & eggplants, and shrimp).  In an attempt to avoid a too-rich meal, I ordered the caprese salad and a cup of Italian wedding soup for dinner. While the mozzarella didn't meet my ideal (i.e. buffalo-milk-based bits of heaven), the salad was fresh-tasting and hit the spot. I also tasted my dining mates' salmon salad, baked ziti, and shrimp scampi. All were good, but the grilled salmon salad really stood out.  It came with a diverse assortment of marinated vegetables (artichokes, mushrooms, red pepper, etc) that really elevated the salad beyond just plain ole lettuce & fish.

I regret not getting to try out Portofinos' pizza, as I was repeatedly told how delicious it was.  You can watch the pizzas being made through a glass partition, which was a nice touch. Next time, no more negative Italian food bias ...and anchovy pizza, you will be mine!
