z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ Andiamo Steak House at the D Hotel is a blast from the past to Old School Vegas! Our server, Hugo, could not be more "on point". From our cocktails to our desert Hugo provided service excellence. I can't remember the last time I had a Caesars salad prepared tableside. The olives served with bread were the best I've ever tasted. We shared a tomahawk steak and some sides and  were very satisfied. Five Stars!
