mIlwCZYr8uQH0mHJEhuf4g Absolutely love this place! I would not have known about it except for the article in azcentral about Pomo Pizzeria being one of the 10 best pizzas in the Valley. Looking at the website this morning, I saw the site for Forno as well. They are the only place in town to find a cornetto con crema like I had on my recent trip to Italy! This place is a true slice of Italy, walking in I immediately felt like I was back in Rome or Florence. The pizza is awesome, the selection great and the cornetto was perfect! I highly recommend Forno and if you have not had one before, get yourself a cornetto con crema, they are delicious!
