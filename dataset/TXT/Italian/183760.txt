OgANEur7Bt8YJSd2uSm6yA I have been a Pizza Hut customer for over 20 years. I received the worst service from this Pizza Hut. First of all, I called my order in..very basic order, just cheese sticks and a personal pan. I was told it would be 20 minutes. I get there exactly at 20 minutes. I was told that they were behind a little and that my order was just now being put in the oven. That was cool..I understand things can get behind. So I go and run some errands. I get back almost 20 minutes later to find out (after waiting a few more minutes) that my food still had not been prepared. I requested a refund. The manager came up and gave my money back and said he would just give me my food for free. After waiting a while, my personal pan came but no cheese sticks. I asked the cashier about my cheese sticks. She went back to the manager who told her to tell me (1) he never promised me cheesesticks (lie #1) and when I countered that lie she said (2) that they ran out of cheesesticks (lie #2). I will never go back there. Very incompetent, ghetto staff there. But lucky for me, I found who owned this Pizza Hut location. A company called America's Pizza Company, phone number is (337) 289-0404. Ask to speak to Nicole! I don't play when it come to customer service. I called Nicole who apologized (although she seemed uninterested in knowing which store it was) and claimed she was going to send me coupons for free pizza (I have yet to receive them). Also there were other people who were waiting a long amount of time for their pizza and was equally frustrated with the staff there.
