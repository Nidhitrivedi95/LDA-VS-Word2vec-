yPgUkQxj8CYPKF89HV65kg This is still my favorite restaurant ever!  We recently went to Chicago and ate at places like The Girl and the Goat and Acanto and guess what?  Although the food at both places was delicious, Lombo's remains better in my book.  Lombo's continues to serve food that is the best in Madison.  And don't forget about the best drink in town...the orangecello martini.  Brad, the bartender, knows his stuff as well.  I have a love affair with Lombo's and I'm proud of it.
