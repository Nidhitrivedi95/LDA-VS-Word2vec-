zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g DeMarco's serves up great pizza no doubt about that but it also is a great space with beautiful indoor and outdoor seating. Any seat near the fireplace in the evening is prime real estate. Very good wine list as well; theres something for everyone here. Though I didnt care for any of the small plates on my last visit. This part of the menu needs some love in my opinion.
