r38xMabrCDVLhkkiVKBtSQ I am a frequent customer of Vinnie Zucchini. I have even recommended this restaurant to friends and family in the past. But yesterday when I went to visit with my wife, I was served some very bad chicken. I even noticed that afterwards, the owner (or whoever was in charge) realized there was something wrong and went to try it and then spoke to the chef. It seemed that they had realized the chicken had gone bad or something, and tried to cover it up by placing peppers on top. We did not say anything to the waitress, as she was very nice and we did not want to upset her or make a big deal out of it at the time. I will no longer be visiting this establishment, and will no longer recommend it to anyone. I really enjoyed going to this restaurant, but I am very disappointed and will not be going back.
