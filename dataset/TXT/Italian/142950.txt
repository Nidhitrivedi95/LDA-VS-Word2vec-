js9rQZAlA5rr7oSBRRcCDw My wife and I were turned away by everyone else in the area but the very friendly staff at Dinni welcomed us in and sat us in a very packed restaurant. The service was impeccable. And the food was even better. The pizza was perfect and the gnocchi was delicious.  Very highly recommend!  The staff was amazing!!
