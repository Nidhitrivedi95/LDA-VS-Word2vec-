gyDTYm_NDWXEHBPGnL-oRQ I was a tourist in the area and this looked like a good place to get a healthy meal that would taste good too. There are plenty of beer and burger joints around but I wanted something healthier. The day before I had a great burger so today had to be a better choice. This was different than any other place. They have a variety of cuisines represented. Some sandwiches, salads and noodle dishes, Thai, Med, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, a little of all. 
l had the Med, with chicken, mushrooms, onions, spinach, bell pepper, cilantro, cucumber on a flatbread, with soup or salad $5.99. I had the Thai curry soup and also tried the Bangkok Curry noodle dish Small $4.39/ Lg $5.49. The Med had grilled white meat chicken, with fresh vegetables. The Thai curry soup and the Bangkok Curry noodle dish looked like the same ingredients. The soup just had soup over the noodles, and vegetables. Meat or tofu could be added to the noodle & pasta,  and salads. The meat choices, naturally raised pork, Parmesan crusted chicken breast, chicken breast, marinated steak,, shrimp, oven roasted meatballs, and organic tofu for $2.39 to $2.69.
Over all I liked the choices, what kind of meat, no meat, size of dishes, and one of those new style touch panel multichoice soda machines. The people were friendly and the service fast.
When I got there at about 6PM on a Tuesday nite, there were about 8 people in line to order and it took about 20 minutes from end of line to food. The Med with soup, small Bankok Curry, and a drink for $12.84. Yes! 5 Stars.
