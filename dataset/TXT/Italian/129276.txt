i53HvxUdQEMllZ1XmpjjyA We were all in the mood for pizza tonight and decided to order from this restaurant. We placed our order around 9:10 and were told it would be 40 minutes until our order arrives. over an hour and a half later our pizza still wasn't here, so we called the pizza shop and asked them where our pizza was. The lady said the driver was on his way. Another half an hour passed so we called and asked to speak to the manager and asked him where our pizza was. He said it was on its way. Finally almost 3 hours later our pizza arrived, but of course we didn't want it. The pizza would have been cold and after reading other reviews on here I noticed everyone else who ordered here had issues with the time of the arrivals as well. The manager was very rude as well. NEVER order from this place. There are several reviews on here stating how long the deliveries took for myself and others.
