LqO_983CEmi1_X1En4mZow My husband and I discovered a wonderful "secret" last evening, it's called Desert Rose. New 2 in 1 restaurant in downtown Glendale. It offers a steakhouse and a gastropub as well as a beautiful patio with live music and games. The food at the steakhouse was fantastic. My husband was delighted with the Chioppino and I enjoyed some beautiful lamb chops with a rosemary balsamic glaze. We will be frequent visitors.
