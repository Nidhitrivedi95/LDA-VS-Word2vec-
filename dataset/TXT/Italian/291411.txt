zYb4kj2R54R2YPeNm829BA We've been here twice after being convinced by RAVE reviews from friends of ours... and it's just not that good.
The bruschetta is pretty good. The meatballs were tasty.
The garlic knots were extremely undercooked inside and slightly burnt on the outside. I actually LIKE my breads a little undercooked... but this was to the extent that there was no taste other than 'raw dough'. This was after waiting nearly 30 minutes for appetizers in the middle of the afternoon in an empty restaurant.
The alfredo sauce tastes like warmed cream with no seasoning and is the same consistency you'd get if you actually just poured un-reduced cream cream over noodles.
The tortellini were so overcooked they were actually half dissolved in the sauce (all 5 of them we managed to find in the mountain of crushed tomatoes).
The chicken pesto panini was... just awful. The chicken was burnt and rubbery with no seasoning whatsoever on mediocre, half-toasted bread.
The spaghetti and meatballs was pretty okay.

Service was AWFUL. We were there over two hours for 4 people to eat while there were perhaps 10 customers and we were so starved by the time we got anything that we opted to eat food we didn't like rather than wait another 90 minutes for something else.
The staff could be over-heard laughing about how "drunk" a patron at the bar was.
I was curious about their deserts but not willing to wait long enough to find out if they were as disappointing as everything else.

The establishment itself is clean and seems well maintained.
