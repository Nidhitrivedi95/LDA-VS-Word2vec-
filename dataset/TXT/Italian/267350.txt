XD0LjNuPPwJPsTAHecUh7A Initially had a tried making a reservation at Mangia e Bevi and couldn't get one on a Friday night so our group opted for Terroni's.

Wasn't my first choice as I've been to their other location at Yonge/Adelaide and wasn't overly impressed.

This place definitely is much more spacious offering three floors and a patio. Initial impression not the friendliest of greetings when entering- cold and matter of fact.

Seated on the second floor the decor of the restaurant is gorgeous offering a modern take with great mood lighting. Our table was waiting for one person so we started with drinks and an appetizer. 

Pane, Olive e Taralli- bread, olives and handmade taralli- $4.95
Served in four separate small dishes the portions were a lot smaller than expected. The bread was mediocre, no balsamic vinegar, and the olives- green and black with red peppers were tasty especially the black ones as typically I find they lack flavour, not these ones.

Our table ordered pizzas and Tagliatelle alla Bolognese- everyone was happy with their dish. Be warned- no substitutions are permitted. Although a simple request was made to switch the black olives to green we were told it was not possible.

I ordered the San Giorgio- tomato, mozzarella, hot calabrese salame, fresh mushrooms- $16.95

Good flavour, thin crust and the calabrese had a definite kick to it. The crust itself was a little harder than I like it. Decent pizza but I have tried better.

Our server was pleasant but did not check in with us until later in the evening. Water was not replenished until the check was brought to our table. We asked for separate bills and were told we couldn't do that. 

I would come back once it's warm enough for patio seating or if in the area. If your going to try Terroni's visit this location.
