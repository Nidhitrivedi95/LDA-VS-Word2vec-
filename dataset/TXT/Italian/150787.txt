We went there for breakfast! - not really breakfast more like brunch  (breakfast at 1 pm). The coffee was great.
Pancakes are huge: there were 3 of them and I barely finished one. Freshly made with butter and syrup. 
very nice bright purple sofas - perfect place for pictures.
Thus, I recommend this place for breakfast or lunch or casual dinner.
