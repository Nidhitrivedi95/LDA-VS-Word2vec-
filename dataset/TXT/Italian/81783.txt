ddlnpDxGDDxGGoG_dVXwiw Food was OK. Combo meat/cheese/veggie board was really tasty, but small for $18. They appeared to only have one server for the entire patio. She was friendly but way too busy to ask for refills on drinks and getting our first drinks took 15 minutes. We were told 30 minutes after waiting that they were backed up in the kitchen and it would be a while longer for our appetizer. Appetizer was missing an item which the server said she would go get and ten minutes later we still didn't have, so flagged down our waitress to get it. Ribs and pork chop were good but overall service was very slow.
