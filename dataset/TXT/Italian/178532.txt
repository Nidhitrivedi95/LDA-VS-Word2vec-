NrjzI_RhWLJBqWVustL2sQ I wish i could give the restaurant and dance club two different ratings, because my experiences were completely different. Ok to start of the restaurant, its a little cramped but has an great atmosphere. The waitresses are hands down some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. I went here in the evening with 10 other friends to celebrate a bachelor party. We got there about 10 minutes past our reservation but were seated very quickly. Here's my biggest and only issue with this place. It took us over an hour and half from the time we were seat to the time our food got to our table. It got to the the point that i was so angry when my food came, i didn't even want to eat it. When our bill came I asked to speak to the manager about the poor service and he simply replied with "what do you want me to do?" I was literraly taken back by his response. The group next to us, came in after us and were being served dessert before we even got our meals, it was ridiculous. After dinner the staff moved the tables out the way and the restaurant turned into a night club. The night club was excellent, one of the best I've been to, but the service before hand still left a bad taste in my mouth. Overall i would give the club 4 stars.
