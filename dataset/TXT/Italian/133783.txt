INU7l2FWbISp9xnJpmqlsg I've been ordering from this location for ~20 years, but lately the service and quality has gone drastically downhill. When they get it right it's good and they get it right. But this is becoming less and less often. This is my first ever yelp post and I only am posting because I'm getting fed up. I never order delivery because even on football weekends they typically have only 1 driver and it takes forever, never when it says. From what I see this problem really started a couple years ago when I started noticing new faces every time I picked up. Ever since there has been zero consistency in the food, more than likely because there is zero consistency in staff! Before there was a manager named John who was on point.

One of the main reasons I keep going back is because my 5 yr old loves their thin and crispy, but I doctor their mistakes before she eats it (too much sauce when I order light sauce, toast it if it's not crispy, etc).

I sincerely hope management sees this and puts some effort in correcting the issues.
