rIcEm0o8Xk413HWD4-f2QA This is the first time my family has completely different opinions about the food. I personally love there thin, crunchy  style pizza. However, for rest my family it was too thin and the crust was too crispy. If you like thin crust pizza then you should definitely try this one.
