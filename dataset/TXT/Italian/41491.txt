7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA This place is heaven on earth. My wife and I flew in from New York and this was our first experience in Toronto. I had the cheddar and spinach waffle. Best waffle I had ever. There was a line to get in but its all worth it. I will recommend this place to all my friends visiting Toronto
