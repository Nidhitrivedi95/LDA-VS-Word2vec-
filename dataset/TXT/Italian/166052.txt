mbPaXByWZBZUGqvh8ewmTA This meal was amazing!  I had the marinara with a touch of alfredo! The pasta was perfectly done, the sauce was amazing!  I also had bruschetta and the caprese salad!  I am definitely going back!  If you are in the area you must give this eatery a try!  Bravissimo!  Well done!
