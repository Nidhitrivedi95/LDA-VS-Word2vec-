1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ My family flocks to this place like cattle to a watering hole on a hot day.  Theres usually 8 to 10 of us in a group and the service is always fantastic regardless of how busy they are.  From Salads to Entres everything is fresh with modest portions.  The atmosphere is very nice, casual dress not stuffy just a little noisy at times.  I would have rated this place a 5 star if the food had just a little more of a WOW factor that can only be found in an authentic mom and pops italian restaurant kinda like those found in New Yorks Little Italy.  Prices are reasonable. Highly Recommended.
