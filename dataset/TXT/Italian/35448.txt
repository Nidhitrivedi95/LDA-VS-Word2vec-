6MdCffJQcKGrmVeNPTykwg I visited this restaurant for a beautiful workplace Christmas lunch. Their foccacia is excellent but the showstopper is what I was warned was a giant chicken. They were not kidding, I was unable to finish it though this may have been related to my liberal use of their wine which was also delicious.
