wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg My gf introduced this place to me as its her fav Italian restaurant and she loves the pasta. I on the other hand didn't enjoy it as much as my gf. The server was extremely nice, recommended a lot of dishes and you can tell he actually tried it or knows about the dishes and also recommended wine to pair with the dishes. We ordered 3 different pastas (not sure the names are but you can see in my pictures) and a pizza. The noodles are freshly made everyday so it does taste fresh but I wasn't too crazy about the dishes. They were just mediocre for me but I love how all ingredients are freshly made!! 

For desserts, all of them aren't in house made except for the flourless dark chocolate cake. And it was my fav!! It's bitter and sweet at the same time. Yum 

This wouldn't be my choice of my Italian restaurant but if my friends wanted to go I wouldn't mind going with them.
