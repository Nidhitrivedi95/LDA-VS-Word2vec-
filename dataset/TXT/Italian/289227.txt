Zt4ljpwfmBufatNM1zPNcQ I absolutely love and appreciate this place! I was overwhelmed and surprised by all the gluten free options. From pasta to pizza to soup to cheesy bread! There is a satisfying amount of choices. I chose the pasta Bianca and was not disappointed! The portions are smaller- just enough to finish in one sitting and my plate was around $14. The staff is very friendly, and they use all locally grown organic vegetables. I definitely recommend Picazzo's!
