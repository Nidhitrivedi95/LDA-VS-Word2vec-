YvrylyuWgbP90RgMqZQVnQ Not bad! Ordered the JZ pizza and the chicken pesto pasta. The pizza crust was a consistent thickness throughout, but it wasn't that chewy/fluffy which is my preference. Lots and lots of raw garlic flavour though  which I liked. Penne pasta had a chewy texture and tasted fresh. The sauce was good too. But I thought maybe both dishes were overly seasoned (for my tastes). I tend to like when the seasoning is more subtle, so that I can taste more of the ingredients themselves. 

They're working on getting a liquor license, so should have alcohol soon!
