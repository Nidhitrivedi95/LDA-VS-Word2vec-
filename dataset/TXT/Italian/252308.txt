VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Came here for dinner as we were looking to find a place close to Wynn/Encore for an evening of clubbing.

As you walk into LAVO, the decor and ambience is really nice.  The conversations are pretty loud, so it's hard to have a discussion over dinner as the tables are rather close to each other.

Our group ordered the following dishes:

1) Spaghetti and Meatballs
2) Linguini Seafood Alfredo
3) Bone-In Filet with Truffles and Carrots on top 

The meals were done pretty well as the pasta tasted really good (not over-cooked) and the sauces were tasteful and flavorful.

The steak was cooked well and I had a great meal.

The pricing was pretty decent for the quality of the food, so, we didn't feel that we were spending way too much for a nice dinner.

Maybe next time, we'll come back for another dinner and also for the nightclub upstairs.

Recommend.
