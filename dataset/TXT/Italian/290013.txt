zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA I was craving red sauce and angel hair pasta, and kind of limited on where to go since I did not want Olive Garden or a Pizza joint.  I saw this place on Yelp and it was very close by.  Driving up to this strip mall establishment I really had low expectations, despite it's numerous good reviews. Upon I walking in I was immediately taken by the nice comfortable lighting and warm wood interior.  We were sat quickly at a nice table near a window.  There was a nice crowd already enjoying themselves- mostly- if not all couples and a couple of 4 tops.  No giant groups of children or bridesmaids!  Thankfully, it was peaceful and pleasant.  I could hear the music being played- some 70's classic light rock. Perfect.
My Caesar salad was fresh, appropriately sized and slightly different in flavor from typical Caesar Salads.  A little extra tangey-in a good way!  My dining partner and I decided on the same thing- A tossed sausage, spinach and angel hair pasta with a creamy tomato sauce.  Amazingly good!  A mall basket of garlic bread came with so we could sop up the extra sauce.
Prices were fair and the service was nice as well.  I will definitely come back.  the only thing that was strange was the fact that the hostess stand and immediate surroundings are shrouded with jewelery, knickknacks and silly gifts.  These wares for sale were distracting from the otherwise unassuming 'Old World" decor.
