aYjZc-3aVbPIPaJgGiUK_A I dined here with my date during Restaurant Week. We were extremely pleased with the food taste and presentation and pleasantly surprised by the portion sizes, which were generous. The menu is refreshingly different with tasty twists like candied olives on a salad or taboulleh made with farro. Decor and service are also very nice-a lovely place for a special dinner.

The menu changes, but we ordered (and loved):

Marinated Olives

Little Gem Salad
Farro Tabbouleh

Smoked Pork Crepinettes
Orecchiette (with spicy chicken sausage)

Lemon Ricotta Cake
Baked Chocolate Ganache
