fSYdQCfFF5zsOapeUcY25A I'm not really sure why it took us so long to get to this place since its about 2 minutes from home. Came for dinner on a Sunday and there was a line but it went really quickly. 

I really liked the way they designed the place, nice clean lines, simple decor. 

We ordered one vegetarian Piada and one chicken salad to share. The man at the stone very easily up-sold us on an artichoke Piada stick. 

The Piada wrap veggies tasted fresh and weren't overcooked. The pomodoro sauce accompanied them nicely. The actual Piada wrap thin but also had a little crisp to it. It was surprisingly good! The salad - boy they pack a lot of ingredients into that bowl! The salad was large and also very fresh tasting. The Skinny Vin dressing was a nice touch and they didn't overdress the salad. Chicken was nicely seasoned. And last, the artichoke piada stick - how can you go wrong with artichokes wrapped in cheesy goodness? Awesome. 

$20 for the whole thing. Pretty comparable to other similar restaurants. 

As a couple who frequents the Panera next-door more than I'd like to admit, I think this will be a nice addition to the repertoire. I'm excited about this place! Yum!
