80qlT-7liqYBXUQCeRLmUg If I owned a restaurant and wanted to attract new clients I would definitely create a groupon.  I would provide over the top service as well as top notch food in order to impress and to retain them as future clients. 
Sounds simple........ We purchased a groupon for this restaurant and I must say that they did very well in regards to providing excellent service however the food wasn't the greatest. There are so many wonderful Italian restaurants in the GTA therefore you have to stand out and be over the top if you hope to have repeat business. 
I am Italian and love to try Italian restaurants and unfortunately I won't be rushing back to this place anytime soon.
