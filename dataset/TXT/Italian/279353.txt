yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w This place is a bit overrated. The garlic bread is delicious but basic dishes, like the chicken parmigiana, isn't spectacular like I hoped it would be. For the price you pay, I would expect the food to be flavorful. 

Overall, if you're looking for nice atmosphere in Vegas with good sized portion dishes and "free" wine with your meal, this place is for you.
