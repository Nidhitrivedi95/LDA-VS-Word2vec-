UHPjDgiEHnTe7-MP-b2kyQ The patio was great and the server was nice. The food was so bland and expensive for what I got. I ordered the seafood papardelle pasta special. It was a pile of dry noodles on top of a little flavorless olive oil with a few shrimp and small amount of crab for $26. So disappointing.
