AOEHe6uKrnC_Aje3kT8-7w This place is great!! We ordered pizza for the first time and we loved it!! It is definitely New York style.  We are extremely hard to please when it come to pizza. We will order here again for sure. The only bad thing I can say is the girl I ordered pizza from gave me a hard time about a coupon I had just received  in the mail that day.  She did honor it but it was not the experience I would expect..... For future note it's your coupon ( and it's valid) and I'm buying pizza, honor the $2.50 coupon with out the threats of not taking it next time.
