vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA Quick little Carbone report for two people. Easily the best Italian meal I've ever had...and I've been to Italy multiple times. The lobster ravioli, rigatoni penne, and veal parmigiana were just amazing. The bottles of wine were near the cheapest on the list, but it's one of my favorites. They charge $160 per and you can get it at Costco for $50 just to give you an idea.
