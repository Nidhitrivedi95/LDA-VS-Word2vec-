PSRZaGGxXmOmabL2si8pKw had a wonderful time.  Wine was good, the appetizer, grilled asparagus with prosciutto, was tender and very flavorful.  My friend had the Chicken Bryan with pasta and I had the Pollo Donna Maria with baby spinach and garlic.  It came out hot and was yummy.  Karen cleaned her plate and I couldn't finish mine.

the only draw back was our server, who's name I can't remember, had a tad too much cologne on.  He was very personable and nice but when I was tasting some wines, I couldn't smell them, all I could smell was his cologne.  

Other than that, it was a wonderful evening with a great friend who was heading back home to Canada!  Much thanks to all.
