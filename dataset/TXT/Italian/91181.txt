EdPpsG0GujcVefs3ANGEGA Well, after one of the worst days of my life, I was subjected to staying in a motel that I will not mention near this pizza place. I was originally searching for my go-to Papa Johns but it was too far, so I decided to try out this pretty horribly named pizza place. The crust, the sauce, and the staff were unbelievably unbelievable. I was so stoked to find out about this joint! I ordered pizza and wings back to back days while at the motel that shall not be named. Hopefully, I persuade someone to do themselves a favor and try this place out.
