-3oxnPPPU3YoxO9M1I2idg Tried this place for the first time.  The service is is GREAT!  You can tell that the employees really like working here.  So friendly and helpful.  As compared to other like pizza joints (e.g. think Subway of pizza) this one is definitely the best.  Fresh ingredients, great price, crust is good--a little thin for my taste but next time I will get the double crust for just a buck more. Oh, and the beer and wine choice... awesome.  They have local craft beers in cans and on tap for a little over $4 ($3 during HH) and top rated local wines for a little over $5 (also $3 for HH).  Just go, you can't go wrong here.
