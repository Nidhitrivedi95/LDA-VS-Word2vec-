5OO2qsLunRpdyEoQkBrfgQ It is Pizza Express so no real surprises. The conversion of the building in Morningside is really lovely and it is pretty airy and has a slightly different feel from the Pizza Express I visited at The Shore a couple of weeks ago.

I did enjoy my visit but why a different rating from The Shore? I think the Morningside branch is definitely successful and this is part of the problem. Morningside doesn't have a huge amount in it - a few bars, cafes and Indian restaurants but for kid friendly places then PE is a magnet. Combine this with the offer of take away then it is bloody busy. Good for a manager, not so good for a customer who is hungry.

We arrived (after booking) and got our table quickly. We did arrive at 6.15 so if you are not a fan of little people throwing tantrums then eat later. This didn't bother us. 

We had a voucher so 2 courses for £10. Starters we had were sweet potato risotto and a tomato and mozzarella salad were well received. Tasty and we were looking forward to our mains. 

Now I like a break between my courses but we must have been around 45 mins between courses. I am still not unconvinced our two gluten free pizza's were not given to another table. Anyway, it was a long wait and it did spoil our experience. My pizza was softer than The Shore version, not so much crisp which I very much enjoyed before. Still good but not as great as before. We were right beside the kitchen area and it was clear there needed to be more people on this section to cope with all the orders. People who arrived after us were out before us and 1hr 50 mins for 2 courses is not great. I was pleased I was heading home and not to the cinema. 

Staff are really nice and friendly but my stomach isn't that forgiving. I'll probably come here again as it is local for work but I'll probably eat more before, just in case I have a LONG wait...
