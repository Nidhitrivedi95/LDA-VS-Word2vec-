nybEvSB5y3deFPOP7rE46A I have eaten at Pastina's 3 times since they opened in Mentor. The decor is pleasing, classy and welcoming.  The drinks are fresh, unique and very good. (try the Urban Meyer or Winter White Cosmo) We have eaten the pork shank (that was so tender it fell off the bone), The homemade pasta w/rosemary and shrimp (very good) and the cavatelli was a good size serving, we have also enjoyed the calamari, fresh mozzarella and different brick oven pizzas (homemade sausage made it flavorful).  Everything is impressive, homemade and delicious. The freshly baked Focaccia Bread is wonderful when dipped in the olive oil/marinara/pepper dip.  Their chicken is organic and from some local farm, my husband thought is was the best tasting chicken he has ever had on his caesar salad.  You can tell a lot of thought and hard work went into the menu and presentation.  Every server we have had, is knowledgeable on the menu and attentive to our table.  It's great to have a NON chain restaurant in Mentor that offers a wide menu, if you want dinner, apps, salad, panini or pizza.  The patio looks like it will be a fun place when the weather warms up.  The owners are hands on and visit your dining table to make sure you are happy with your food choices.  The bar is active and we saw many people we knew, so that always makes it a fun stop. Of course we will be back!
