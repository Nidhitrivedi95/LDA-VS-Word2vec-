ukAUNyzUcBA4Su8UKjaJKg Great place!  We visited it during Summerlicious and there were a couple of vegetarian items on the menu which was great.  My pasta was delicious and my boyfriend's panfried eggplant was amazing as well.  We were quite full and took our desserts home for later but they were amazing too.  Filling, a variety of items.  Seemed like a fair price for the other items as well.  It was a bit packed but that would be because of Summerlicious.
