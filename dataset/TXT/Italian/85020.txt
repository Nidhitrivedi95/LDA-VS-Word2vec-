dNHDXn2ot4mFc2YfIFBNhQ We had a girl's night out at Carrabas. Bad choice of restaurant. we saw the menu on the website and had our dish picked out but was informed they stopped making it 3 weeks ago. The food was blah. Our server Mike in the bar was the only good part of our visit. Mike kept the glasses full and made us laugh. But we won't be returning this place.
