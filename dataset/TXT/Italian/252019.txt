The eggs paired sooooo well with the mac n cheese. It was also very rich, but hey, we're in Vegas so it's all good! Haha! We also ordered the Wagyu meatball and Seafood penne Alfredo. Both were good as well, but the Breakfast Mac n Cheese was the best one. I would definitely return here again! Prices weren't too expensive either, considering this place is located on the Strip and inside one of the big casinos.
