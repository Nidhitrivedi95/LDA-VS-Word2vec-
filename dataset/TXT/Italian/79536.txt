d1_Ko1DQ4QyB9BjnCFjVLw This is a great Italian restaurant.  I had the papa B combo(lasagna, spinach manicotti and Veal parmigian).  It was superb.  Large portions great price.  You've got to try dipping your garlic bread in olive oil and oragano.  A real Italian ambiance.  No other Italian  restaraunt compairs.
