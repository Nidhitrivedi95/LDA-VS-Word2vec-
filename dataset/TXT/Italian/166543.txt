mE-isLpfMbdQpOmb-WWo3w Came here once a few years back for a romantic dinner which turned out very well. The pasta was delicious and the ambiance of the place was great. The bill was a bit higher then I expected so I didn't return until a few friends invited me for happy hour. I've been back there once a week since. The wait-staff has been very friendly (although you may need a little patience when the place is packed). The happy hour menu isn't long, but what's on it is good and is priced fairly ($5 8" Personal Pizza w/ 1 topping, and $3 for garlic knots with a tomato soup dip, both DELICIOUS).
