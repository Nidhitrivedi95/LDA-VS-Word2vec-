zyPGYeXF4XKCqNN1pjFWhg Welcome back to Scottsdale, La Locanda. We missed you!

We had dinner there last night and it was delicious. Loved the gnocchi.  Perfect texture and flavor.  The grilled trout had just the right amount of seasoning and grilling.  The veggies were yummy.  The service was attentive, but not intrusive.

We look forward to going back soon!  Can't wait to have the Lobster Risotto!
