SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ I love good food, and good quality food, but am not always into the ritzy foi grais, black truffle, and bone marrow crap. With that being said, this restaurant was a perfect balancing point between 'fancy' and just good, traditional Italian. The bellinis were awesome at the happy hour price, and the crispy crab and pasta bites were definitely the highlight of the meal. The lasagna was the best my husband has ever had, and the gnocchi with marinara was exactly what I was craving. Top notch, decent prices, and good quality without being snobby about how rare and fancy their ingredients sound
