Yo8ODT7aFMM2xKUd1yaBVw Just average. Server was nice, busser didn't bring refill until after I got my check (maybe 10-15min after I asked and maybe 4 tables with guests?), lukewarm calamari, heavy Caesar dressing on my salad that made it a bit soggy. After a $31 check for 1 person for lunch, I'll spend my money elsewhere.
