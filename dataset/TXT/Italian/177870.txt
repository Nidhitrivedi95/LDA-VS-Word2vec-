NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA Excellent food. I had the fettuccine pesto pomodoro and it was delicious.  Wished the portion was a bit larger because it was so good.  My sister-in-law got the primavera pizza and that was delicious too.  Excellent crust and fresh ingredients.  The desserts were fantastic as well.  If you are a chocoholic, the flourless chocolate cake is right up your alley.
