74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw Honestly the best overall dining experience I have had in Las Vegas and I've had some great ones.  
Chris Zadie, Portofino's GM, is fantastic.  He went out of his way explaining the restaurant, the menu, and the ingredients.  His passion for the restaurant and the food was obvious and contagious with the rest of the staff.  The service is truly a cut above.
Diners are encouraged to sample multiple items on the menu as most dishes can be ordered as full or half orders.  The pasta is made fresh and cooked to order....haven't had pasta this good outside of Italy.
Truly an excellent experience.  Kudos to Chris and the staff.
