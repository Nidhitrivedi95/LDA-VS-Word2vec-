We had dinner reservations for 18 people in our group.  They only had one waitress serving us and she seemed like she had a chip on her shoulder.  Someone should tell her that a smile goes a long way and when someone says "thank you" it won't kill you to say "you're welcome."  As for the food, well the bread in all of the baskets was cold. But the wedding soup, and main entrees were good.
