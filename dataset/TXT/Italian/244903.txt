uwT7CppiYkek-Z-661sndQ I liked this restaurant and in summer is great with the doors/windows open.  We had our orders taken and never saw the waitress again until we asked for the bill.  She said she had a big party and was told we were taken care of.  We weren't.  We each ordered a pizza and they were good.  The disappointment was the caprese salad.  I thought it had a nice presentation but it was seriously the most boring salad ever.  It's as though no seasoning was put on it at all. It was slices of plain tomato and plain mozzarella so overall it was bland.  We may have ordered another glass of wine or dessert but no one ever came back to our table.  I did mention this to server because I don't think leaving a minimal tip is very enlightening so she explained the situation.  She offered a splash of wine or dessert but we were ready to leave.  I will have to give it to the server assistant who took our silverware and replaced it with fresh.  You don't really see that anymore.  They just need to note seat numbers when ordering so delivered food doesn't need to be auctioned off.
