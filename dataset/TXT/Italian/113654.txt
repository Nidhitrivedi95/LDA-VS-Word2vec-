ghpFh6XpH1TYZhjAGdx-xw Lunch is awesome and very fast. You get your pizza usually within 5-10 minutes. The range of choice for the toppings is pretty good. The only problem is the noise levels during lunch time. If you are looking for a quiet place this one is not for you. A lot of people come for lunch and it gets noisy but I like it.
