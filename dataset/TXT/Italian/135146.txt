ITde2CeOZ6fUG9h3xb-Nag I wish I could give this place a good review. I really do. They make it look like they're trying. But unless you want to pay 20+ a plate for stale bread, or waiting 2 and a half hours for 10 long neck clams so well done I can only compare them to chewing gum, over linguini (severely over done) then this is this place isn't for you. My dining partners got ratatouille that was so sweet they described it in horror like the famous (infamous) pasta sauce called Ravi. As far as ambiance it is unbearably loud. Don't expect to hear your dinner guests. I rarely write bad reviews but my experience and everyone around my table's was terrible. Two couples got up and left.

Dear management, get a new wait staff or do some retraining. If you would like to discuss my review/opinion with me please pm me.
