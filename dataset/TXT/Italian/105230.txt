FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q It was our first time here and the waiter wasn't really informative when we asked about the veal. He just assumed we know what ways they cook veal. 
Other than that the food was great!! The salad actually taste fresh. Garlic bread was perfect and my pasta al vodka was to die for!! I haven't had it taste this good since I had it at RAOs in  Cesar palace. I live near here so it's great that I can come here.
