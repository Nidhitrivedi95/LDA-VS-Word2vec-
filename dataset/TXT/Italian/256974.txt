w2b0ve7xpuCQkwYICFIUOg Average, in the modern mediocre sense.

We were (still) looking for a new italian restaurant close by, our old favorite having disappeared a few years back. While driving along, I found this place on Yelp.

My only rule for restaurants, especially Italian, is I do not want a food factory. None of the chains for me. There too much room and too much talent in this town to waste time eating in a chain.

We went in and found a strange mixture of modern metal art and bright bud and miller beer signs. Not bad. Not great. Just average.

We were greeted by, I will assume, one of the owners. A pleasant enough fellow. He, nor any of the staff ever introduced themselves. An anonymous group serving us dinner. For the rest of the service we got the bare minimum of interaction. Drink order taken and served. Food order taken. Salad served. Dinner served. Dessert menu and check. Average. Mediocre.

I am usually a two drink during dinner guy. My beer ran out and no one ever noticed. I didn't bother to do their job as hosts and ask for more.

On to the food. A fantastic plate of, well, average. There was nothing wrong with the food. Chicken was well prepared and cooked. The raviolis were still al dente, properly drained and served. The marinara sauce is the only thing to find fault. Tomato sauce you could safely serve your entire family without complaint for too much salt, pepper, oregano, or spice. A flavourless endeavour. Overall my impression was that the chef has lost his passion for food and is phoning it in. Uninspired average fare. 

Pricing is where I have issue. Two people with one drink each came out to $30 per person. For what it was, its overpriced. $20 per person is appropriate.

Would I eat here again? Yes, if someone else invited me and bought dinner.

Three nice average stars for this place. No hard feelings but the hunt is still on.
