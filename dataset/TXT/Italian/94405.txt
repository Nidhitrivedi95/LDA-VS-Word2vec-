ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Went here for brunch on a super busy Sunday so we ended up sitting at the outdoor bar and absolutely loved our experience. Our food was some of the best brunch food we've had in Phoenix for quite some time and the menu was fairly large! The actual space was beautiful, hip, and so much bigger than expected. Our bartender/server was AWESOME, despite how slammed she was. Great spot for a large group brunch but I can't wait to come back for dinner!
