5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g I went to Rooster's for lunch and we were all very disappointed. They must not have prepared well, because on Monday they were out of a lot of menu items. After three of my top choices were out, I settled on the iceberg, bacon, blue cheese salad. It is listed that way on the menu, but it is actually just iceberg with bacon topped with blue cheese dressing. The bacon was overcooked. My server didn't come back after dropping the food off for 15 minutes, by which time I didn't have any more time to order another item. My friends fries were cold.
