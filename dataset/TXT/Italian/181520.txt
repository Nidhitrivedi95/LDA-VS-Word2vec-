O54jXbKjZte4qVYabYjGjg I love Zappitelli's. For a neighborhood homestyle Italian restaurant it is terrific. I've been many times, but this visit my companions and I had veal parmesan, cavatelli with meatballs and the veal + veal special which was a smaller portion of veal parmesan and three veal cannelloni. The veal cannelloni were amazing. Tender pasta stuffed with ground veal, ricotta cheese and spinach covered in mozzarella cheese and red sauce, it was really delicious The veal parmesan was tender and nicely fried with lots of cheese on top, just the way I like it. The cavatelli is always good. I've been dining here for years and was persuaded to write a review after reading some of the negative reviews. This is not high end dining, it is delicious comfort food in a small, family run, neighborhood place. The sauce is good, the service is good, mostly young teenagers who really work hard. This place is always busy and does a tremendous amount of take out as well. If you need take out, I highly recommend! The containers they use ensure that your food is still piping hot when you get home and the portions are so large that you are actually getting two or three meals for the price. A great value!
