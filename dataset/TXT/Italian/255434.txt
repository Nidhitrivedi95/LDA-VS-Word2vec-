VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g I saw mystery diners 4 years ago and saved this restaurant in my phone because it looked great and I always wanted to go. The thing that intrigued me was it was Italian, nice atmosphere and had a classical pianist!!! The pianist makes this place unique and worth going!!!

I finally got to go this Labor Day weekend 9/4/16 and it was phenomenal!!!!

This is truly a hidden gem and I can't believe no one knows about it. Get off the strip to eat people. The food around the strip is better than what's on the strip!!!

The waiters are all super friendly, attentive, talkative, etc!!!! Some are flamboyant, so if you have a problem with that, this may not be the place for you. 

The food was amazing and they give huge portions!!!

Calamari fritti - the batter itself has great flavor!!! Doesn't really need lemon, but I love lemon anyways! Comes with a lot of sauce so you don't need to ask for extra! Super easy to eat and not chewy or fishy. Def one of the best calamari I've had.

Pollo alla marchigiana - chicken was a little chewy but the sauce was fantastic, and the veggies were a perfect addition.

Linguine seafood - not sure what it's called. It's a hidden menu item but it has clams, mussels, calamari and shrimp in a tomatoe sauce/broth with noodles... It was delicious and orgasmic!

Minestrone - was ok. Nothing special

Pasta e fagioli - was delicious and one of a kind.

Free bread - was delicious!! Especially that pesto butter they have! Yum

Spamonie - was decent. Not the best ice cream I've had. Tasted like it had been sitting in the freezer a while but it was ok.

You get a free shot of liquor after dinner too. 

The price range is 20$+ don't expect to get a meal for cheap here. But remember that the food is worth it. The quality is phenomenal and the service too.

Plus u get serenaded by a live pianist!!! Which was why we came and the highlight of the night.

. I will be back here every single time I do Vegas from now on!
