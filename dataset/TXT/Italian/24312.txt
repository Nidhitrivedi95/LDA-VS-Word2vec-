47y08rotkJr5gYMgG5IvTA Very good Italian spot with very authentic pasta, pizza and other bites. The pasta and pizza are made fresh and by hand! It's never super crowded, so I can always get a table, and the prices are quite reasonable. 

There is one waitress who could use some lessons in manners, but it doesn't detract so much from the awesome food.
