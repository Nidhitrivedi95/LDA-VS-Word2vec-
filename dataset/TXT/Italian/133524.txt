im8sxT2V-drSvxP17qdb2A My friend and I had brunch here. NEVER AGAIN. The food waas below average and more importantly, the service was horrible. Our server forgot our orders and when the food arrived, we received everything we did NOT order. When we told her, she was quite annoyed. We are not picky people in any regard but the service was something that had to reflect in our tip. Will not return or recommend.
