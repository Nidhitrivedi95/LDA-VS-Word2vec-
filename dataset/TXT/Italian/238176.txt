u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Love the wine selection, incredible bruschetta, but questionable service. Went here with a party of 10 and the service was terrible--probably because we were a big enough party to add automatic gratuity, so the servers (we had several!) didn't seem too concerned with us. But again, the prices, wine selection, and bruschetta make it worth the visit!
