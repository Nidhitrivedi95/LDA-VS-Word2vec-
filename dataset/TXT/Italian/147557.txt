kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ We went there earlier this week for our wedding anniversary. When we arrived, I wondered why we never noticed the restaurant before. it is right across from our favorite dessert place, The Gelato Spot. We were seated immediately, and were soon greeted by our servers. So far, so good. After perusing the menu, we started with drinks and the drunk bread. The menu described the appetizer as a swiss fondue with white wine and day old, crusty bread. To be honest, I thought it seemed more like cheesy bread you'd get at a pizza place. 

Sometime between our appetizers and dinner our service took a turn. A couple sat down next to us on the patio, and appeared to know the manager and staff. They all doted over them, and gave us "so so" service by comparison. For instance, they attentively checked on them and chatted ever few minutes, and would stop by our table one out of every eight times they spent with the other table. What made it that much more  noticeable, was just how close our table was to theirs. When our dinner arrived, it was really quite good. I had the wood roasted half chicken and my husband had the New York strip. My meal was $19, and a ridiculously large portion. My husband's meal, was slightly more, at $32, but still well worth the money.

By the time our meal was over, we had every intention of ordering dessert.   But by the time we finished looking over the dessert menu, service had become so slow by that point we took a pass  and went to the Gelato Spot. 

All in all, the food was good for a fair price. I noticed they had happy hour and weekend specials as well. I guess, being that it was our wedding anniversary my expectations were high, which made our "meh" service that much less acceptable to me. Our total experience was good enough that we plan on returning for the food.
