qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg Yep! I'm back because I am a fan, especially of 3 words on their menu! 

Pumpkin Mushroom Soup! 

If you like pumpkin with flavor.. you will love this soup... Drove all the way across town to have a cup. Met my expectations! 

Then I decided to order something different and simple... of course, a gyro! It looked delicious, a generous pile of meat, lettuce, tomato, onion with cucumber sauce all wrapped up in pita bread!  The pita bread was soft, warm and tasted great. Unfortunately the meat had no seasoning which resulted in no flavor. A few too many diced onions for my taste. Ok to eat, but I have had better. This is the first thing I have ever ordered here that I didn't like.. But that won't stop me from coming back! 

The service is great! Rose greets you at the door as though you are coming into your home and a server immediately greets you! If you have a question about the menu, everyone is very knowlegable about all the dishes The food is always served hot and tastes great!

Even though I didn't like my gyro, I will soon drive across town again for the Pumpkin Mushroom Soup and something else I have not tried yet on the menu!
