4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ Went there finally last night. Had stopped in once before when they renovated and purchased Cannolis, which are amazing. Had the bruschetta and fried squid. Bruschetta was just as you'd expect and the squid was very tender and had a great seasoning to it.  Next I had the Spaghetti Carbonara and pretty much cleared the plate. Our table spilt a few desserts and while they were all good, the tiramisu was amazing. The tiramisu was fresh, moist and the espresso or coffee powder in it was amazing!

Great place and service was quick and on top of us and our drinks.  Will be back.  Nice to have good places like that in our southwest side of town.
