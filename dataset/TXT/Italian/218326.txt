S0Hu5K-iAMI2pkQEyAJIcw This place is huge and packed. It seems like a mix between a restaurant and a café. It takes up a good amount of outside seating as it has many places to sit inside. The seating was comfortable. The staff seemed very busy though pleasant. The front has a large array of desserts to try and the bartenders well dressed. The atmosphere was nice and very lively.

The deserts looked decent. I'm thinking the deserts here are better than the food. But we only came here for a drink and we were on our way. Based on the looks and feel of the place, I would definitely say this is the local meet up spot or local diner like spot. It is nice touch mixed with average type of place.
