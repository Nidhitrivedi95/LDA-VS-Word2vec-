g9iIBuh-g4ld3w3kUWLMqw We were greeted by an awesome young lady who sold the brand.  Unfortunately while we waiting for a table the owner and manager made comments about our party leaning against the jukebox.  So they have a free jukebox that you can play....if you ask them to turn the "IPod" down.  I question the managers why they would offer something for free if it came with restrictions and they said that is our choice!!  So our choice was to leave!!  I understand conceptual values, but this made no sense!! 

Good luck!  I will not spend my hard earned money here!
