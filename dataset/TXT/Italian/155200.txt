L0XbcMxTi80hFEtrV3qZsA With possibly the most ludicrously comfortable seats in Edinburgh (I mean that), Gaia is a nice little Italian deli/coffee shop on Leith Walk. Actually, it's better than nice. It's really really good. 
The counter had the front has a great selection of cured Italian meats - prosciutto, bresaola, parma ham, salami to name a few. They've also got the usual cheese suspects - gorgonzola, dolcelatte, mozzarella and so forth. And a selection of mouth-watering cakey treats.

What I really liked (besides the unbelievably comfy seats) was the little salads in the fridge. They were more interesting that your bog standard tuna and sweet corn drowned in mayonnaise. Herby leaves, cured meats, fresh cheese drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. And not expensive either (about £3). Coffee was nothing to write home about (not bad, but not amazing), but I was so blissfully relaxed in those seats I didn't care.
