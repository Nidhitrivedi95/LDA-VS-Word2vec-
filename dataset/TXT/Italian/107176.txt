Fast, smooth service by friendly people, and the only place I get pizza from anymore, period. I've ordered from them now about ten times and it's 100% consistent. I'm only sorry I didn't find them before, because I'm sick to death of bad pizza, or even worse, some of that "designer" crap pizza that the "in crowd" seems to like. Once you start screwing with pizza, it starts to suck. Some things should be left alone and should remain traditional. If you don't like this pizza, you need to have your head examined.
