3QS2Wgedv3jjKC5vJXJTcA My friend and I finally got to meet up for dinner yesterday and we ended up at Osteria for some delicious food.  

We saw the menu LAST week, and there were about 4-5 different times of gnocchi - including one that had eggplant.  "WE MUST GO," my friend said.

I'm supposing they change their menu quite often -- because when we went, they didn't have the eggplant gnocchi anymore (sad face for my friend). 

Anyhow, I ended up order the gnocchi with the shrimp, and my friend ordered the orecchiette with the eggplant.  We had the antipasti to go with it - and it was pretty good; I thoroughly enjoyed the croquette.  My gnocchi was absolutely delicious -- I love gnocchi and it was absolutely well done.

I ordered dessert: a flourless dark chocolate hazelnut cake.  It was okay - I liked the dessert selection better at both Terroni and La Bettola better.

Service was mediocre.  I don't know if the waitress was having an off-day or if she's always like this.  She was being a bit b*tchy, which I didn't really appreciate.  Otherwise, I had a good time there, but I would prefer the sister restaurants more.   (However, if you're craving good gnocchi, this is a definite recommend).
