GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA The more I go here, the more I really like this place!

I have decided that we'll always enjoy our meals at the bar.  It's far more interesting to sit there, people watch, and enjoy some drinks and food.  Everyone behind the bar has always been super nice, friendly, and informative.  This time we had the pleasure of chatting with Adam and Ian.  They were awesome!  Ian answered all our questions about the food and the wine.  He steered us in the right direction in our wine selection and provided good conversation when we wanted it and time to enjoy our wine and food when we needed it.  

The amuse bouche (it's been the same for years; maybe change it?) was the best it's ever been. The chickpeas were very moist and had great olive oil on them

The Lonza (a type of salumi) with fresh peaches and arugula was great! Nice combination of salty, sweet, and overall fresh.

Orecchiette with Spicy Lamb Sausage: So good! Pasta is clearly homemade and cooked properly. Nicely finished with fresh Pecorino cheese.

Special of the day was a Roasted Pork dish; I didn't love it. It was cooked nicely and had fresh flavors, but it wasn't for me.

Adam made me a delicious Espresso Martini to end the meal perfectly.

Grab a seat at the bar and enjoy your time there! I'll be going back next time I'm in Vegas =)
