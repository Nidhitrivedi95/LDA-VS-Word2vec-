BlrvqjGanZvjlNsnIyvAXQ I gotta give big props to Regina Pizzeria. 

The pizza here is just absolutely amazing. I'm not even a big pizza fan but this place makes me go crazy (in a good way). I'm salivating right now just typing about it.

If you dine in, the pizzas are brought out on the big pedestal-type silver serving platters. The flavour of the pizza is just WOW...I don't know if it's the sauce, the crust or what but each mouthful is just delicious. I usually get the one made with grilled chicken and various grilled veggies (eggplant, red peppers) and sundried tomatoes.

Pizzas are hefty in size, not thin crust but not quite deep dish either, a medium size serves two hungry eaters.
