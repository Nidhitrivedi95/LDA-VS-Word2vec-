w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q Amazing staff and fantastic service. They also totally helped me out because I had reservations someplace else that were cancelled for a power outage, so I was thankful to have anywhere to eat! 
Food and drinks were great, my companions that ordered steaks were very happy - and the only negative is that my tuna steak was way too crusted with pepper (couldn't taste the tuna or get all the pepper off). Sides and salads were delicious, and they make a very good Irish coffee!
