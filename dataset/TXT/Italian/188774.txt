OXrFWgoz533T8tMRemkiww The original Mt. Lebanon establishment is still doing what it has done consistently well since 1996. That is, to offer food and pizza similar to what you will find in the city of Naples. While I was happy that Mr. Molinaro opened a place in the city at Market Square, I refuse to return to that restaurant for the reasons that follow. First and foremost, Mr. Molinaro is no longer involved in the Market Square operation. It is well known now that he went back to Mt. Lebo full time due to pressure from his partners who decided to cut back on the quality that has made Mr. Molinaro one of the most respected restaurateurs in Pittsburgh. Perhaps a lot of folks will not notice the difference, but when you start fooling with the pizza by switching from Italian flour to a domestic knock off, then I have a problem with that and it undermines the entire idea of the restaurant. More specifically, prices are not reduced commensurate with the cheaper ingredients. So, at Market Square, they can employ this culinary sleight of hand to an unassuming public but I will not give them a penny more of my money.

Therefore, I have been back to the Mt. Lebo original for a while now and it is still excellent. Everything from the espresso to the Pizza is infinitely better than downtown because Ron Molinaro has not deviated from his idea of offering food that is true to  Naples. His steadfast refusal to reduce quality for the sake of profit is what I respect about him. He maintains friendly and knowledgeable staff who know the food and the wine list. You cannot go wrong here and I will continue to support this place and any other that Mr. Molinaro opens.
