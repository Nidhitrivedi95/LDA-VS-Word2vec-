FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA One of my absolute favorite spots in Phoenix. The atmosphere is fun, romantic, and relaxing. Music is always cool too. The food is fantastic and prices on wine by the bottle are great. The bruschetta combination options never disappoint. My personal favorite is the prosciutto, marscapone, and fig spread. Perfect combination! Close seconds are the smoked salmon/pesto, Burrata/bacon/arugula/tomato, and the classic Mozarella/tomato/basil. The service and food are always great and consistent.
