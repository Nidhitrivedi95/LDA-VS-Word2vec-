0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg After reading the most recent reviews I thought it could be a little risky but the menu looked great and the ambiance was what we were looking for to take out a client.
Bummed we ended up going.  The food wasn't great and the server was rude and clearly needed to turn the table.  He literally kept returning to the table every 2 minutes until we ordered and then would stand at the table while we were in mid conversation and I stare until we stopped talking.  Not what you expect at a nice restaurant!
We ordered the $70 porterhouse which came smothered in a cheese sauce (who puts cheese on that cut of meat?!), the cod which looked like a dry pork chop when it came and was smothered in a tomato paste, and the duck which was far from tender and cam in these two huge chunks.
All in all super disappointing.  Maybe pasta is the way to go there.
