e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw My husband celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary with Sinatra-Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. We wanted to dine with a place that had impeccable service and great food. Sinatra did not disappoint. I had a reservation for 6pm on a Friday night. We were going to be late to the reservation so I gave Sinatra call, Jennifer answered and re-assured me that my table will be waiting for me when I arrive. When we arrived at the restaurant we were greeted, escorted to our table, and given a hand written note to congratulate us on our anniversary.  Suzanne, our server, was great!  We had the Caprese, Frank's Clams Posilipo, and the Pork chops that were a Special for the night. For dessert, Suzanne surprised us with some chocolates and a pistachio custards. I would highly recommend Sinatra to anyone. From the food, to the drinks, to the atmosphere, it was wonderful!
