Xra1TtWtf069Am5hHWs3Ug Very nice local gem of a restaurant.  Cheerful waitstaff, good menu variety.  I had the lobster mac and  cheese - very good.  Meal with tip (entree, two glasses of Malbec, salad upgrade) was $40 for one, so it's not a bargain basement place.  But the "feel" is very nice, and remarkably European.  Certainly worth it if you like genuine Italian.  Expect a wait after 7:00 most evenings.  A few dollars less and I would have rated it a 5, but the locals like it, so who am I to niggle?
