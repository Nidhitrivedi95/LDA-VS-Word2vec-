e_yxY8iYwK6WDnUSz3v8ng I debated between 3 an 4 stars on this one.  I had brunch on Valentines Day with my wife.  First, the Shrimp and grits was honestly one of the 10 best dishes I have ever eaten!  It was that good.  My wife enjoyed her veggie omelette, and the side of fruit was generous.  That said, the atmosphere was not enjoyable.  The tables are on top of each other so much so that you feel like you're in someone else's conversation.  I spent my brunch listening to two bitter women complain about everyone they had ever met.  The other issue is the massive closet in the middle of the restaurant.  They have some wine racks on one side of it, but it's just a massive closet in the middle of the dining room.  Strange.  So, on the whole.  Food:  exquisite  Atmosphere:  unpleasant  Service:  unremarkable
