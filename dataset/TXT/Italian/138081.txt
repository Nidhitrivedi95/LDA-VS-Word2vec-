JBivZu1L1VpYf6kwspXYIg I'm a Jersey girl who grew up a few miles outside of New York, so I grew up with and have always loved NY style pizza.  When I have pizza from Luigi's, I feel like I'm back at home.  The first time I visited Luigi's and waited for my to-go order, the owner (originally from Italy) introduced himself and offered me a small piece of pizza while I was waiting.  He said he wanted me to taste the pizza fresh out of the oven.  So delicious - I return again and again for a little piece of home.
