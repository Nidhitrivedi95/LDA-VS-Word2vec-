pzLXZ0qeiRilQ3vM-gS1wg I bought a half off deal from a website for Avanti's b/c I live in the area and are always looking to try something new. Upon reading the somewhat terrible reviews I was definitely apprehensive going in but made a point to try and form my own opinions.

At first glance the bar was cool - had lots of charm. The dining room, not so much. Huge booths were nice, but the water marks on the ceiling, large scuffs and marks on the walls (is it that hard to paint?) and outdated italian dining decor. It was a poor mans olive garden in that sense - you catch my drift. 

My boyfriend and I each ordered a dinner salad before hand. For $2.99 is was very small, but very delicious. I ordered the pan style pizza and he ordered the chicken parm. He said his was very good and mine was also pretty darn tasty. I have no complaints there! 

Service was fantastic - our waitress couldn't have been friendlier.

So really my only complaint was the unkempt feel of the restaurant - which is actually a big thing for me when i'm dining so that's why i gave it 3 stars. I'd give it 3.5 if I could.
