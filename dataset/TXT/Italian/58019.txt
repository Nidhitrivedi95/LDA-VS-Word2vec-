ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg The service was really bad for a Friday night. We took friends from out of town and our waiter rarely came over. We wanted to order more wine but the waiter didn't stop by. Also towards the end the waiter dropped off a dessert menu but never came back to ask if we wanted dessert and instead just brought the check. I wanted to order dessert! The place wasn't even crowded so not sure why our waiter was too busy to come around. Too bad because we would have spent a lot more money. The waiter seemed really inexperienced and like he didn't care. At one point another waitress came over to us and she was really nice and apologized that our waiter never took a second drink order.
