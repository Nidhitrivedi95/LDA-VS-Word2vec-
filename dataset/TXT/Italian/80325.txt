d5n5CsoJNu-tKEbfI6U3tA I really don't care for this location very much. Its not the lines or anything like that, I fully expect it to be busy. Its actually how customers are treated that makes me mad. It starts with the hosts who almost always quote your wait time wrong and then when they do seat you they act confused when trying to find your table. Once seated, you get slow service from the server who is usually working with 2 or 3 other tables. I don't fault the servers necessarily but it can become annoying. The food is very good, so I do enjoy that part. The one thing that really makes me mad at this location is how all the employees think no one can hear them talking amongst each other. Usually, while waiting you can expect to hear a server and host argue over where or when a party was seated at least once. However the worst offenders seem to be in management. I overheard a manager telling servers, "customers are nothing more than paychecks, so to speak, nothing more or less. That's how we treat them". I get they are a businesses but to say that within earshot of said paychecks, I mean customers, seems like bad business to me. So I guess their logo should read "When your here your family.... the awkward cousin that you really don't like but you have to deal with anyway".
