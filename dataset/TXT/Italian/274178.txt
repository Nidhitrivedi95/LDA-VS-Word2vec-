Portions are huge. Pasta quality is pretty decent, not the best but considering the prices they charged it's awesome. One downside is that the restaurant gets super busy during dinner rush even on weeknights so it can be very hard to get a table. 
Calamari is quite good, very lightly breaded $8.25. Entrees also come with home-made garlic bread which was so nice and warm. Our group shamelessly asked for an extra helping of garlic bread; the nice server brought it right over. Carbs overloaded!!!
Overall, huge portions, decent quality, very cheap.
