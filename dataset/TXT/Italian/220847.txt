SE594hJrunTVaALEy8Guzw Tried this place Friday after some recommendations, delicious!  Great phone service, 25 min carry out.  Ordered a 1 lg 1 topping and 12 hot wings.  Everything was perfect.  We added mushrooms to the pizza, they were so tasty.  The pizza was crispy and oh so good!  The wings were crispy and hot.  This is our new spot!
