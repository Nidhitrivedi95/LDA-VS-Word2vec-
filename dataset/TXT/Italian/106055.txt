fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I had the Yakisoba and my girlfriend got some salmon special. Mine was so-so but her fish looked like it had been cooked on a greasy hot plate and apparently tasted bad also. What she ordered came in a box with a bunch of other pretty terrible things I cant recall since it has been a year. The salad was ok for a side salad and the sushi was about as good as store bought. The service was nice and helpful and the place is a little divey to me but could be described as quaint by some. I see some other recommendations but I doubt I go back with so many higher caliber dining places with all around great food so close by. The pricing was right around the price I would spend for much better even then. To each his own I suppose but I know two people that weren't pleasantly surprised.
