9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg Today had to  try the meatball sliders, great idea. Meatballs , provolone in a garlic knot roll sprinkled with Parmesan .   

This is not your everyday boring slider, someone actually thought about it. The slider was very good, tender meatball covered in cheese  in a buttery garlic roll sprinkled with parm cheese and served with romano fries We also had the fried calamari it had a light crispy batter with a spicy marinara. My only gripe with calamari  ,lemon was sliced , if lemon is to be squeezed , wedges more appropriate . We also had the Steinbrenner calzone stuffed w/ eggplant parm , ricotta and marinara. Beautiful golden crust  , crisp and chewy. 
      Very tasty combination of flavors Service was solid .
