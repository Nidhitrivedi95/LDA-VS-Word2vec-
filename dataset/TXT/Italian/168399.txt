mLP-jIIRdoaYM7fJqqFurw Stopped over Murray Ave to see what was shaking at the banjo shop and stopped in Napoli for a couple slices. It was right after lunch and not too busy, there was only a couple tables of Cops loitering, er, I mean lunching and that's it. The Pizzeria is set up like your typical slice shop, with the added bonus that you can buy Beer(+1), also. I tried a Pepperoni roll and a slice of pepperoni with a Coke. The roll came with a side of sauce and was quite tasty, well, where there was pepperoni it was tasty. I had a couple bites that was only dough(-1). The slice was also good, a nice thin slice with thinly sliced pepperoni that curls when cooked. As I was sitting down the Owner pulled a sausage pie from the oven, mmmm ground hot sausage(+1). HELLO! So, I had one of those, too. And it was yummy, too. I had a great conversation with the owner and another customer that came in after me.
 All in all, even tho I am a big fan of Mineo's, I would and will definitely give these guys more business.
