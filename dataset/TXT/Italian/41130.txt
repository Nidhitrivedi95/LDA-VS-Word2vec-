7JWWeXqil03Ua_wV9KN8ZQ Nona, e molta MOLTA maleducato!  Perche Ti comporti come un opsite del tua ristorante e un intruso? Il cibo e solo medicore (at best) e tu servizio e terrible. After living in this neighborhood for nearly 2 years, I have given Luna Rosa every last chance. Only Miguel, the 1 employee who is not a family member, seems to understand what good service is. The rest of the family are slow, rude and completely oblivious to the fact that some patrons parliamo italiano. I can only suspect that they survive on tourist patronage. Please do not waste your money on this outwardly rude and underwhelming family establishment.
