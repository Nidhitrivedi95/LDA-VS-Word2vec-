eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg What I like most about this place is the location overlooking the pool which makes for a nice glimpse of outside and hotties in bikinis.  I don't eat downtown that often but I do like that this place is clean, attentive service, and quiet enough for a nice lunch with friends or work reasons should you find yourself downtown.  This isn't the best italian food in town but it's what I consider one of the nicer places downtown and open for lunch which is rare.
