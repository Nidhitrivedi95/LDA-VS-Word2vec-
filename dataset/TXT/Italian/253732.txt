VtiHtLI2t0OjFjbrnR70lw Terrible, but convenient location. I think I prefer Earl's.  Overpriced for what you get and doesn't taste good. We ordered the cured meats platter, crispy squid, artisan bread basket, and iced olives. The ice melted very quickly so it was more like olives swimming in water. They also charge you based on the number of people at your table for the meat platter, even though we asked if only one of us could have it. Very, very average and poor value. Also no complimentary bread. We paid extra for it and we got a few stale and hard pieces (the end piece of the loaf). 

My bf got the ribeye steak and it tasted pretty sad. The quality of the meat was subpar, and it was overcooked. We saw people having the pasta and pizza, which looked more appetizing.

Service was ok, but kind of slow, and waiters were clearly inexperienced. 

Not impressed at all. Just terrible. 

Our meal came out to about $100 after tax and we were very  unsatisfied. Definitely not coming back.
