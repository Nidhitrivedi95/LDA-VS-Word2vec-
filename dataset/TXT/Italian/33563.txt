 It was easy to find and it's a nice roomy restaurant with plenty of seating indoor and outdoor. Their menu is rather small which isn't a bad thing, but their prices are on the high side. They also offer some salads and have some desserts like gelato and Cannoli's. 

 Of course we went with a small Pistachio Pizza 16$ which is typically the price of a large pie at any NY or Chicago pizza joint. The pizza wasn't horrible, but it was not a good combination. A real Pistachio Pizza comes with cream of Pistachio, fresh mozzarella, smoked provolone and crushed Pistachio. Adding Pesto to the pizza overwhelms everything on the pie making it a Pesto Pie not a pistachio pie. Not impressed. 

 I also noticed that they offer no daily specials on pizza which is very strange! They have daily specials on wine, beer & gelato, but somehow left out the pizza! 

My search for good pizza in North Carolina continues! I won't return.
