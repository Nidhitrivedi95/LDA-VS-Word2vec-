9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg I love Scaddabush! I love the great atmosphere when you walk in - the scattered candles on tables look great. Service was on point - host at the door was very friend and our server, Elisha, was super personable. She chatted about the food really well. I had their fresh mozzarella to share w my friends which I am so glad we did - soo good!! Followed by the zucca pasta and finished by ordering their cheesecake for the table. The food was incredible, very filling even though we shared most of our food. I cannot wait to be back! They have a few different mozzarellas that I really want to try!
