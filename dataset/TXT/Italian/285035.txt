zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g Went out on a date here. The place is eloquent and cozy. The server was a sweetheart and very personable. We had the eggplant appetizer which was very good. I had a couple glasses of the Lost Angels Moscato wine. Delicious! I ordered the baked ziti which was good and he ordered the biano pizza which he ate the whole thing. For a "small" it's definitely not small lol Even though we were literally the last ones there obviously enjoying the food and our date, they never made us feel rushed to leave. My date even mentioned that president Obama came here when he was in town. Overall great experience and would definitely come back!
