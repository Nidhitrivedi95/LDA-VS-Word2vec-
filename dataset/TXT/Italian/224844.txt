sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg Finally got back to try the first floor, meatball floor, at Sienna Mercado.  I am a fan!!!
I was a little hesitant to go because I dont eat meat.  They DO have a veggie option.  Yeah!
They have a great selection of beers on tap which I loved.  They also have a large bar in the back of the restaurant, so if you dont have a reservation you have a place to hang out while waiting.  
The meatballs come in 4 different ways.  They come as a slider, a panini, a grinder and just plain with sauce.  I tried the veggie balls with a pesto sauce.  They were super flavorful and the texture was great.  I was very impressed.  My husband tried the beef with a spicy tomato sauce and loved his as well.  We got the mac and cheese as a side to split.  It was tasty as well.  
I highly recommend!
