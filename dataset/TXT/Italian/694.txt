-7d3UqQYYcBxbDH2do86sg I am so happy that they finally decided to open up a diner where noodles is the speciality. I thought I'd try this place out for lunch one day, and I was impressed. The customer service was outstanding, and I was pleased to hear that they had gluten free noodles as an option. I wasn't too impressed with the portion size- I think it should have came with a little bit more noodles and salad for $9. Other than that, the quality was great. I think I'll try this place out again soon.
