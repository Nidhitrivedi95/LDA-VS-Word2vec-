aidcfUzZLOjWgwlxfv3UlA Ordered a grilled cheese sub, the menu says it comes with tomato and fresh basil. Food was delivered and I received a sub with melted American cheese. Period. Also ordered a cold sub, which was fine. Both were supposed to come with chips and a pickle spear, according to the menu, so I ordered one small order of fries. Both subs were delivered with fries so we ended up with way more than we wanted, and having spent a few extra bucks on an order of fries that was unnecessary. I won't be ordering again.
