So we ordered from this Pizza Hut because it is the only one that would deliver to us. They show up with two pizzas. One of them was the wrong pizza and the other pepperoni pizza barely had any cheese on it.  Calling the store about the order, the guy pretends that he doesn't understand what I am talking about, until finally he understands when I practically scream, You. Brought. The. Wrong. PIZZA! Okay he says, and he says he will send out the right pizza, and another pepperoni pizza with the right amount of cheese, after making me look online to make sure I had placed the right order. He let us keep the wrong pizza, but we had to return the pepperoni so he could show the cooks. 

30 minutes later. Yeah, I know, 30 minutes later, and the store is literally 5 minutes away, the pizza shows up.  

The next day, my wife had diarrhea all day, I kept going to the washroom, my 5 year old son had a stomach ache and went to the washroom multiple times, and my 3 year old daughter,  who only ate a bit, was complaining of stomach pains. 

I should have reported this Crap Hut.  But, I think I'm doing the next best thing.
