yLrCSSrSnpxB-0ZEPt19jA For what Pizza Di Roma is, it's perfect. 

If you're looking for a nice place to sit and have a nice quiet dinner, this is probably not your jam. But, if you're looking for some quick DELICIOUS pizza by the slice, to take on your way or to sit down with, then this is the right spot. 

The inside is nothing special. Large murals cover one side of the restaurant, and a wall of mirros covers the other. The murals are nice to look at. The rows of booth style seating are older and outdated, but why fix what isn't broken? 

There is always a nice selection of pizza available. Anyone would be able to find something they like. Spinach and feta is probably my favorite offering of theirs and it's almost away available when I stop in. 

They do offer other menu items such as sandwiches and pastas. I've personally always just gone for the giant slices of pizza. 

It's a similar set up to Ian's, but much less to-do and a lot more calm. Usually a much shorter line, too! 

I've been coming to Pizza Di Roma since I was a kid. It's one of my State Street faves and I couldn't say a bad word about it. Love it!
