sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg I'm a fan of Sienna Mercato in general but for me my favorite is Emporio, the meatballs are delicious and personally I'm a big fan of the risotto as well. My go to meal is two turkey meatball sliders, one with the pesto sauce and the other with the government cheese then a side of the tomato risotto and a nice cold beer. Could eat that every day.

I've only been to Mezzo once so far and was a fan but think I need to go again to really solidify my opinion. The meat and cheese plate was a wonderful assortment and the pizza I had was quite good. The wine selection is also impressive.

Il Tetto is the place to go after your meal, it's an amazing place to have a drink and look at the sky with the glass roof or when it's nice they have it open. The food is more snack food but it's definitely high level bar food with bruschetta, fried brussel sprouts and of course the cheese plate.

Overall the space is amazing on all three floors and you really can't go wrong by going there for a night on the town, a special occasion dinner or even just casual. You can always find what you're looking for.
