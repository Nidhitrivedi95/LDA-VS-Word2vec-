TLbx_MR2dyFztoyR5d9H2A The pizza is not the best, especially if you are use to NY style.If you like real Italian food this is one of the best in the valley,a little place in the middle of Gilbert.Try the cavatelli  with white or red sauce, they are homemade,as well as the gnocchi, if you try these or the zucchini parm I guarantee you will be back.
