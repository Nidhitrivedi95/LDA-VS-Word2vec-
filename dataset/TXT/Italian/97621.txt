eU_713ec6fTGNO4BegRaww After a bad experience at TGI Fridays, my boyfriend and I decided to check out more local restaurants to support local business as well as open up our taste buds to things other than chain restaurants. Having family in Mt. Washington, I pass it occasionally so it's always been a place I've wanted to try. This was our first stop...

The food was excellent and a great start to more of a finer dining experience. It's fancy, but not suit-and-tie fancy, so if you want to come in a nice pair of jeans and a dress shirt - you're good. The food was great! We ordered the Pasta Carmela and it was enough to take home. The garlic sauce was light yet satisfying and had a zing of spice which perfected the meal. We also were served garlic bread and a salad with a wonderful house dressing that reminded me of an Italian/Balsamic mix. Also note that the place is BYOB. Enough said... The place itself sort of crammed which was one of the only downfalls, but overall the experience was pleasant. Service is great, too. I definitely would like to come back and allow others to experience this gem.
