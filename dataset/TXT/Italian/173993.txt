nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g I came here for lunch the other day with my friends from work. The ambiance was nice and modern, it does not have that corporate tone that many other restaurants around the area have.  Initially me being me, the second I saw chickpea on my dish, I asked the waitress if they can remove it. As I hate chickpeas. The waitress kindly encouraged me to try it as they won't change the dish. I've order the Purpietello
sauteed octopus, escarole and nduja with fried chickpea on chick pea puree

It turns out that I loved the octopus and the fried chickpea and purée. It was an amazing marriage of the three items. This dish provided me a new perspective on how chickpeas can work into a dish. In order to do a comparison and to satisfy if I have made the right decision between ordering calamari vs. Octopus so I can be sure what to order for next time. I took a piece of my friend's calamari. It was way less flavourful then the octopus and I was glad that I didn't order the calamari dish. Moving on to my main, I love truffle, to the degree that if I was missing in action, If you light up a truffle infuser, I will come running. So of course I've ordered the following dish. 
Tonnarelli alla Norcina
Italian black truffle shavings, homemade spicy sausage, pecorino, garlic

The pasta was not bad, I would have preferred a little softer. However, I did not taste the spicy to the sausage. Overall, the octopus was amazing. I will definitely go back for more and recommend the octopus to my friends!
