eQNApV0-OpYJec3y1OoBvg There's a lot of Asian newspaper flying around the Junction, I don't know why.  Also there are tons of cardboard boxes at the curbs of the streets and the garbage cans are overflowing. What does this have to do with the Magic Oven? Nothing.  I'm so confident in the quality of Magic Oven's food, that I can waste your time talking about Asian newspaper.

I'm at Magic Oven most Wednesday nights for the comedy show upstairs. I've tried the Hawaiian pizza, the garlic bread and the beer; all of them were cheesy  (one of the beers were organic/gluten-free/quinoa beer or something hipster-friendly). They've got other beer; like the pumpkin spice beer mmmph! soo good!  Anyway, the pizza was pretty good and came out quickly and the comedy was excellent as always.  There's a $4 beer special on comedy nights and the show is FREE.  I'm gonna go ahead and give Magic Oven 5 stars because I host that comedy show from time to time so FIVE STARS!!
