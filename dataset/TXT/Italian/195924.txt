PKjdnTWQSygpOjlWl8VzrQ I reserve 5 stars for the absolute best of the best so 4 stars (from me) is not a knock at all - in fact you have to stop by The Pizza Rak if you are looking for a cozy sit down pizza joint with quality fresh ingredients. My wife and I started with the Bruschetta and they hand picked fresh basil for our dish! We loved the heaping diced tomatoes on toasted italian bread with fresh basil and mozzarella cheese. Then we had the specialty Veggie Pizza (comes with caramelized onions, green and red peppers, and green and black olives) with added sausage (that is homemade in the shop) - delicious and crispy! We finished off with yummy ice cream comes (36 flavors)! The service was very friendly and we paid $15 for a regular 8 slice pizza. We highly recommend The Pizza Rak!!
