SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg It's a unique dining experience. The craft cocktails are amazing. I really enjoyed my filet. Also, their pastas are to die for. It's a great place to bring your spouse and have a great dinner. It's not cheap but well worth it. I love this place. Take an uber cause parking can be tight.
