wxzG81ZyWpBje_mU4aFLaw I was excited to try this place on our side of town as we've had takeout from another location and loved it. 

We came in and there was a wait for a two top. No biggie, we both got a glass of wine and waited just a short while before our table opened up. We sat down having had maybe 4 sips of our wine. 

We waited. 

And waited. 

We had our wine....


But no menus. 


I joked that it was like Costa Rica and the slow service there. I was in a good mood and happy to sit down after a long day on my feet. 

Still with the waiting.


No... STILL MORE with the waiting!

Now it was not funny anymore and we were being completely ignored. I checked my clock and it was 7:57pm. Clearly not a closing time issue. I tried to assuage my companion by telling him how tired I used to get after a big rush and they were probably trying to catch their breath. 

Yeah... that argument only holds weight for so long before you realize you've still been sitting there with a glass of wine from the bar and NO MENUS OR ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM ANYONE. Seriously the guy who seated us was really nice. Where was he?

A girl came around and put place settings out at 4 tables. ALL AROUND US. 

Still. No service. 

Fuck. Are you kidding me? I was seriously patient. I know what working in the service industry is like. This is ridiculous. 

"If we finish our glasses of wine and no one has said a single word to us... we are leaving". 

"But you are not allowed to chug your wine". 

"Deal".

{{{insert witty conversation for 5 minutes}}}

Alright. All done. We have not sped up our drinking. We were very fair and patient... up we go. 

And we left. 

Would you have done anything different?
