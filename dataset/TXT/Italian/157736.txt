Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA So if you stay at NYNY, you get BOGO breakfast at this eatery. Sounds like a good deal until you pay $5 per person for coffee. After tip we paid $25 for an omelet and 2 eggs with bacon. Both plates came with home fries and toasted bread. The food was typical Of an east coast diner. Nothing special, especially for the price.
