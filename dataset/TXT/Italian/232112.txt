tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg We came because the other places we wanted were too busy or closed for repairs.  I got the lunch special.  Its a 1-topping personal pizza and drink for $3.99.  I would say this was a pretty good deal.  The pizza was a little bit more dough than pizza, but for 4 bucks I was full.  The cashier guy was really nice.  My daughter got the chicken fingers and an order of fries and this is why they only got 3 stars.  The fingers and fries are baked in the oven.  The fingers were pretty good.  You can get plain, hot and something else (I forgot).  The fries were burnt, which happens when you use an oven.  I tried to put lots of ranch on them but the burnt flavor was too overwhelming.  Also, the other reason they got 3 stars in because it was to-go and like many places they used styrofoam, which if holes aren't poked on the top, it make the fries super soggy.  So I had soggy burnt fries.  Which was no good.  I will still give it another shot, but will probably eat there.
