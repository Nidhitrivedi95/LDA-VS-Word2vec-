u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg I think my previous review was for another restaurant entirely.... whoopsie, my bad. 

HOWEVER!
This weekend I went to Postino's for lunch, for the first time ever.  EVER.  I know!  

I thought it was lovely.  I loved the proscuitto sandwich I had, I thought that the menu was concise and a perfectly priced.

I will return.
