c8DsYusKjQYUxnTj9BtVvA Excellent authentic Italian restaurant - small, cozy atmosphere, superior quality food made from scratch, with a wood fired pizza/pasta oven! Great selections on the menu! I particularly recommend the seafood - all the options I've tried - from the antipasta to the griled platter to the zuppa di pesce - is delightful; done to perfection!
