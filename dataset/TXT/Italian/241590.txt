UirWbEXBYqw9cE63Ph-Png What a GREAT restaurant!  We're new to Solon, but Jimmy Dadonna's has quickly become a favorite.  HUGE portions -- we always count on having enormous leftovers.  We come here for anything from pasta (yum!) to carbonara (yum!) to pizza (yum! yum!).  In fact, it's our favorite pizza place in town, too!
