FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A Great food and great atmosphere. Had never been here before and now I want to go all the time. The grilled Mac and cheese is amazing. The service was awesome out cashier was very helpful. Everyone in the party tried something different and they were all great. I would definitely recommend Mac Shack to anyone who likes pasta!
