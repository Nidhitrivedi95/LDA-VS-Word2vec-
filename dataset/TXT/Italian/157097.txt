lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ We came to this restaurant as a couple and wanted to have a lovely dinner. As soon as we arrived they sat us inside near the bar area. It took 10 minutes to get the food menu and the drink menu. Within five minutes they took our drink order. Mind you it took another ten minutes to get our simple margarita and iced tea. The server wasn't only serving us but also serving 3 people at the bar. 
We were ready to order and kept eyeing the several servers passing through but none offered to help or to see if we were ready. After another ten minutes of waiting they finally took our food order and brought us bread. No silver ware no napkins, nor any offers of oil or vinegar. After 10 minutes the server was going to the back and we had to call her over just to help out to get our silver ware.
Mind you the food was wonderful, but the service was awful. Only come here if you have all the patience in the world. As for us we arrived about 30 minutes late to our show.
