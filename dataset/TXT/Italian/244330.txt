USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg We were visiting my parents in Charlotte and looked for a bit of fine dining to enjoy their company. My lovely bride found this online (here or elsewhere), and we made an online reservation. As we drove up, our hopes were confirmed, as the restaurant is in a lovely craftsman cottage. We were not to be disappointed. Please note that the restaurant is on two floors, so those with stair difficulties should request less strenuous seating (good job Mom, as we were on the second floor), though there is outdoor and first floor seating. 

The following is somewhat plagaraized from my reservation site review, but rings true:

"What a wonderful culinary meal. All items were beautifully assembled, well presented,  and most of all, delicious. All in our group of 4 found their food (all ordered in a different manner and style) to be properly and wonderfully prepared. Tying that in was the service. The waiter (ask for Zach!) was well informed, properly attentive, and had a great sense of humor. The package made for a super evening out.

The foie gras  was wonderfully tasty (though a bit to tiny, as we order from the same purveyor that the restaurant uses), and others enjoyed the trout, elk, duck and filet. The wine list was excellent. The roasted garlic puree for the focaccia, along with rosemarie olive oil was terrific. 

Overall, we would not hesitate to recommend this as a gourmet dining experience that did not disappoint. FYI, we visited from out of town, and joined our parents here. My bride and I were happy with the choice we made, and expected the check.
