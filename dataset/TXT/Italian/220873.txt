SEH79jbg5Q8cCozCnhqMHA We stumbled upon this restaurant by accident last weekend. It ended up being a rather happy accident for us, which I hadn't anticipated based on reading the menu. To be honest, I read it and nothing really jumped out at me, but we were hungry and decided to try it out anyway. 
Everything changed after our waiter brought out the platter of that day's made in house pasta specials. There were about ten different dishes, and every single one sounded fantastic!  I got a pasta dish with sundried tomato noodles, scallops and shrimp in a spicy red sauce. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had!  My husband loved his pasta as well. Definitely a very pricey meal, but it was one that we walked out feeling okay about because it was so good.
