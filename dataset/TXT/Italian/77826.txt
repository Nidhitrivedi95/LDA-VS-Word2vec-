CZF9Nm8CFY2R9ZhfwYIARQ Clean, friendly, nicely decorated.  The food was very good, salads were excellent, we had spaghetti with meat sauce and the house lasagna.  The lasagna could have been warmer and was a little dry.  The lasagna is the type that is made with no sauce inside it, they cover it with sauce and because the portion was so large, they didn't get enough sauce on top to keep it all wet and saucy while it was being eaten.  As with many restaurants, the lasagna portion had to have been warmed prior to bringing it out to us and they didn't get it warm enough.  Prices were very reasonable.  We will return, but we won't be in a rush to do it.
