The bar had a row of TVs which took away from the expected atmosphere. We sat at the kitchen counter which was a lot of fun and it also meant no wait for a table. Service was slow for us and less attentive. Overall, the food was decent. Fried ricotta balls were on the bland side. Margherita pizza was above-average and reminiscent of Pomo but the crust was not as good as theirs. Fettuccine pasta with escarole and mushrooms was garlicky and delicious. My wife's sangria was great. My first glass of wine was the Etna rosso. I don't recommend it. It didn't have the unique and funky ashy (volcanic) and minerally profile that I was hoping for. Second glass was the Brunello. I was so excited to see that a restaurant was offering it by the glass! Alas, these wines typically need an hour or two to open up. So I didn't get too much out of it.
