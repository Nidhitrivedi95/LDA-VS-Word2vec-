j_PL_u4SWW1LoEd2dCu0Iw I think the dough is the most important part of pizza and that's where this place fails.  It was a little on the cardboard tasting side without crunchy chewy texture.  The toppings were ok but missed a little also. The garlic knots were good but the fried zuchinni was tasteless.
