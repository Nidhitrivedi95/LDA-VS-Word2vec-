The dishes here are packed full of flavor and creativity. It reminded me of a homier, more affordable version of Cheesecake Factory pasta plates. The half portions allow you to indulge in more than one plate if you want to mix it up. I love gouda so I tried the Sweet Home Alabama, which is mac and cheese in creamy gouda topped with bacon, onions, and popcorn chicken drizzled with barbecue sauce. I loved every bite.

For a cold noodle dish, I tried my friend's One Night in Bangkok, which is their take on Thai rice noodles with chicken. The noodles were cooked spot on and I loved the sweet chili sauce. If that isn't spicy enough for you, try the Nights in White Satin - the red pepper really gives a kick in your mouth. Enjoy some classic 80s rock while consuming your meal. Don't forget to ask for a piece of garlic toast!
