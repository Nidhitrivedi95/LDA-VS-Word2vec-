clL0-uy-DH0bJgBFEfoxFA Very average restaurant and really just overpriced for the quality.  They give you free bread to start which comes out hot so that's nice.  I had the Calamari Fritti as an app which wasn't bad.  For my main I had the Mediterranean pizza - Grilled zucchini, eggplant, mozzarella, roasted red pepper, tomato, red onion, olives, San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh oregano.  Nothing special, just a regular thin crust pizza and it came out kind of cold.  On the plus side it came with a side salad :)

Ended with Ciambelle -Deep fried dough, sugar dusted, chocolate hazelnut sauce.  The sauce was really good for dipping the donuts, i basically cleaned the small cup it came in.  Also had the Cheesecake -Mascarpone, Amaretto, hazelnut crust, mixed berry compote.  This was a bit dense for my liking.  Note that it is MASSIVE and I would recommend sharing it with at least 2 other people!
