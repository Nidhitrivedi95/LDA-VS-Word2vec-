5aRyuqJZSGp1fNXHQHMLjg i love the army, but they make me wake up wicked early.  then i work, work, work and when lunch rolls around, me want tasty goodness FAST.  mamma mia's is the solution.

i got their 2 slice deal, mushrooms.  this cost me $4...that alone makes it rockstar, but you have to ask yourself...does it get any better?!  oh yes, it does!!!  the crust was crunchy, the cheese ooey-gooey and the mushrooms PLENTIFUL, which made me disgustingly happy.  i think pizza places never put enuf mushrooms...today, i met my match.

the joint is hoppin, but they still manage to get you out in about 10 minutes.  plus, you get to stare at frank sinatra while you wait (young, cute blue eyes, not the older, less attractive version) and listen to the tv blaring.  and if you are me, the QUEEN of movie trivia, you enjoy your wait as a time to school co-workers in "the Game" while you wait for your AWESOME slices.

moral of the story, go, young ones and enjoy.  the food is plentiful and cheap, atmosphere friendly but small.  its easy to miss...KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED!!!
