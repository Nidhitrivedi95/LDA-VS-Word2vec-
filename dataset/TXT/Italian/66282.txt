bNNF6Z91L7Omfdi8QSo2_w Jared and I went on a date to Il Terrazzo for dinner on Friday night.  We had a gift card valid for dinner for two, and we were waiting for the perfect night to use it.  Friday night was just cool enough to sit outside and enjoy the patio at Il Terrazzo, and we did just that...

Service was spot on, ambiance was great, and food did not disappoint either.  I forgot how much I am a fan of the Phoenician's homemade bread until our basket came... pair that with the dirty martini I ordered and I was one happy camper!  But of course we didn't stop there.  I had a Caesar Salad and J went with the Caprese Salad to start.  He ordered Veal Ravioli for the next course and of course I had to try it... it was creamy and heavy but in a good way.  We definitely could've stopped there but too late - our entrees were on their way!  J went with the Kobe Flat Iron and I had the Scallops.  Way way way too much food, but we did take home leftovers.  We passed on dessert but still left with full bellies.

Il Terrazzo is on the pricey side.  As a matter of fact, our gift card covered everything but my drink, and my one martini was $19.77 before tip!  Pretty insane, right?  I'm not sure we'd rush back on our own dime, but we'll be there in a heartbeat if someone else foots the bill!
