QeShrs6cUNBjJoTCkJiB0g Just had lunch here today - my second visit - quite a few years after my first when the food and service was great!!!  Today, not so great!!  The food was average at best - certainly nothing to write home about!!  I had the gnocchi, my friend had a penne and sausage special which she enjoyed, but my dish was bland and the wedding soup was a huge disappointment as was the bread served to the table when we first arrived!!  Even more disappointing was the service!!!  Our waitress was very matter of fact - not at all friendly or welcoming!!!!!  She really needs to find something she enjoys doing!!!!!!  
I had planned to take a few of my friends there for dinner in the coming days, but now I certainly will not!!!  I hear rave reviews about the place all the time - but now have serious doubts about giving them another try!!!
