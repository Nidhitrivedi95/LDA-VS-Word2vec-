TVKenh65WwJX3zEr36zKCA I've been coming to this fine establishment for about 4 years now when I need some time away from the missus (lol) and i've always ordered the Oysters which are very good, especially when I pair it with a glass of wine. Their combination pan roast which I just tried recently is excellent despite its $20 price tag. The staff is friendly, the cooks are good and the ambiance is cool. The Oyster Bar in Sunset Station - check it out!
