N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ Probably 3.5 stars.  I love pizza.  And I'm no pizza snob.  I can enjoy a good slice of Domino's.  Heck, I'll even wolf down a piece of Little Caesar's if times are tight.  But if I have my choice, it would be high end gourmet pizza (think, Grimadi's, Due Forni). 

Overall, I found Biaggio's to be a little greasy for my taste, but the sauce had a great flavor and it is definitely cheaper than the high end pizza places I like to frequent.  We had a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and I was a fan of the crust.  Not too thick, not too thin.  Got a salad too but was nothing to write home about.  My man seemed to enjoy the food, so if you aren't worried about grease, Biaggio's is a great choice!
