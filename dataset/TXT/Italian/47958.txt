9_UHuIMHDjrxuh2qlHS-UA Dined here for the first time yesterday evening.  Cozy restaurant with 10 tables.  Very friendly owner and staff.  Started with the garlic cheese bread and sauteed calamari.  Both were very good.  Chose the eggplant parmesan off the menu, not the special that evening, with the pasta olio/aglio at a price of $16.95.  Eggplant was very good and pasta was on the dry side but had flavor.  I felt the portion was really small for the price...really small.  Finished with the spumoni roll and it was very good!  Glad we tried it but would not go out of my way to return.
