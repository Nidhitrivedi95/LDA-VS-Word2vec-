Toux3q1WwY2vNV5AhbR6wQ We moved to Pittsburgh from Orlando 3 years ago and slowly have been trying a variety of restaurants to find our favorite go to.  I think that CIBO has hit the mark.  We went to the original one and loved it and waited for the new restaurant to open and it is even better.  Last night we shared the beet pear and arugula salad and the crab beignets.  Both were delicious.  There are 5 beignets and easily shared with two or more people.  They were light fluffy and the crab tasted so good.  The salad was light and fresh.  It was small but also easily shared.
I hate when you are given huge salads before dinner and this was just right.  We then had
the flank steak and the pasta with mushrooms and blue cheese.  Both were delicious.  The service was perfect and BYOB was appreciated.  Prices were good and location in Regent Square had fairly good  parking.  BTW, we had dinner night before at AvenueB and CIBO's
meal was the better!
