nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A This restaurant was really great! I went with my family at 11:30 for brunch and was very satisfied with my experience. The restaurant is huge and the little details make it special. You can tell that it is inspired by Buddy's family which gives it a homey and comfortable feel. The coffee and food was fantastic as well as the service. We ordered the eggplant Parmesan, buddy's pizza, pasta carbonara, calamari, caprese, spaghetti and meatballs, and the tomato soup. Everything was so delicious and satisfying. The dessert menu was a nice touch as well because it is like a family photo album which I thought was a nice detail. Service was excellent and our wait staff was very attentive. We ordered in advance from Carlo's bakery and ate in in the restaurant along with our coffee. Overall this place was excellent and I will probably be back in the future.
