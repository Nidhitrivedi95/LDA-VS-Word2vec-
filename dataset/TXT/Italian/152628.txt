KuxDPl6UYNLxFChPm0_MNw This is our first visit to Toronto and we decided to stay on Yonge Street, Downtown. Day two, early evening we started our walking tour.  Our first stop was Brownstone Grill because it looked nice, modern and classy from the outside.  Inside we were pleasantly surprised to see beautiful chandeliers with modern dark brown decor.  They also have a very nice outdoor patio for the warm summer nights.  We were warmly greeted by the owner who offered me a tasting of their featured wine of the day.  I prefer a big red so he recommended the Argentine Malbec which I loved.  We plan on going back tonight for their mozzarella stuffed meatballs and pasta and perhaps something else yummy to eat.
The service was excellent and I would highly recommend it!
