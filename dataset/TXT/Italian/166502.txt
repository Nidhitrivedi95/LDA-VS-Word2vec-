MDoI5wE1eCLEZUNL-IVerg Tonight was our first trip to NYPD Pizza and it was very enjoyable. My wife and I ordered a 14" pepperoni and artichoke heart pizza with hand tossed crust. We also went with cheesy garlic knots as an appetizer. 

The garlic knots were were a doughy texture with good flavor, served with marinara dipping sauce, and my wife absolutely loved them. The pizza had that New York floppy crust that you need to fold over to eat. The sauce was mildly seasoned with a strong tomato flavor, and the amount of cheese was generous, no need to pay for extra unless you're just cheese crazy. It looked and tasted very fresh, not at all greasy. 

The employees were very friendly, helpful, and quick. Despite the restaurant being almost full, we were in and out in just over 30 minutes. Our bill with 2 sodas and tax was $27, very reasonable for the amount of food we had. 

We enjoyed the food and laid back atmosphere and will be back again soon.
