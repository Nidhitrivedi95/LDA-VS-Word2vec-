USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg I was in Charlotte this Monday December 1st on business and we were brought here by the guests.  Everything was splendid; from the food to the excellent customer service.  I has the Lamb dish was well prepared, generous helping, and beyond SUPERB!  The bartender(kind of a bald guy) was such a gentleman!!  The waiters and hostesses went above and beyond with service.  Will return again on my next visit.
