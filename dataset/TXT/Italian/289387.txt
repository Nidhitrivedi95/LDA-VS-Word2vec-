ZtJ6sTq7-5rL9ORUtQJHAQ This could be my new favorite place to grab a drink and eat at the bar. There is something about eating at a bar that I really enjoy, and I loved the ambiance here. Had a groupon to use, my friend and I were dressed casual, when we arrived we felt slightly under dressed to sit in the dining area (I'm sure they wouldn't have mind but out of respect for the owners who were walking around) we decided to sit at the bar. It sat about 10-15 people, had two TV's, dark lighting with candle on the bar, a friendly bartender and a large wine list and specialty cocktail list. The bread basket was filled with soft, tasty bread and a side of oil AND vinegar (I appreciate it when balsamic is added to the olive oil). We ordered the prosciutto stuffed figs with arugula that went perfectly with my Sauvignon Blanc, it was delicious. The menu was extensive, filled with the usual Italian favorites, one in particular, cioppino, which I will come back to try. When the bill came, our bartender informed us that an 18% gratuity is automatically added to the bill PRIOR to the discount, which I don't think is a big deal like other people have complained about in other reviews, I'm sure it's to help prevent the cheap skates from not tipping properly. If you read your Groupon you would see prior to purchasing it, it states it plain and simple. Will definately return.
