j54J0Ky4ruVbN_NTJ3daFg I've eaten here several times (often with members of my very Italian family), and it has never disappointed!! The space is small, but the ambience is authentically Italian--exposed walls, close quarters, etc. The salad is unique with sunflower seeds, chick peas, and fresh greens, but it's delicious. I've had ravioli and a number of other items from their seasonal menus--all great! It's certainly a little pricey, but well worth the splurge. One of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh!
