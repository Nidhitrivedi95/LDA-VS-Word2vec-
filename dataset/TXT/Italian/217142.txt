rxcZiqu2hQDJgULxwtJqug Couldn't tell you about the food since we didn't even get that far before we walked out.

When we walked in the hostess greeted us...more or less.  When we asked to sit at a specific table we got a ton, and I mean a ton, of attitude from the hostess.  She took us to the table and basically threw the menus on the table and then walked away.  Strike one.

Next, as we were waiting the wait staff were cleaning menus with windex.  We asked them to stop or go elsewhere (really??  I'm getting ready to eat and you want to put the smell of windex into the air next to my table??).  More attitude.  Strike two.

So to this point two strikes, aren't even close to ordering yet.  We threw in the towel.  We weren't going to spot them the third strike.

Just an observation here, but there at least two tables that had card table chairs (you now the fold up type) in the restaurant.  Weird.
