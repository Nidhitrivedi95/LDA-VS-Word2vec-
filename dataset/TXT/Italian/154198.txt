kz7O0_o6WrDQk1Kl8dKeHQ Yumm! I can't wait to go back--though my wallet might not appreciate it. 

Stock and Stable is perfect for a trendy date night. So far, I have tried the Beer Butt Chicken ($16), the NY Steak ($21), and the Eggplant Parmesan ($12). While the Beer But Chicken is good, I don't exactly think it's worth the price--plus, since it's boned chicken, you might want to factor in how elegantly you can dissect boned chicken if you're out on a date. The NY Steak on the other hand, is hard to find fault in. It is well sized and comes with some amazing dipping sauces.

They have happy hour from 3-6pm, which serves as a great opportunity to try out some of their cocktails for $3 off.  My favorite drink so far is the perfectly sweet bourbon based cocktail called Church on Time ($11 Regularly/ $8 HH).

Also, if you're up for drinks after your meal, ask your waiter or bartender to show you how to get up to the speakeasy-style bar called Honor Amongst Thieves upstairs for some unique drinks.
