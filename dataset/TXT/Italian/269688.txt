xJKVVTSIAwmSiY3cGJYwfg I came here with a group of vendors for dinner and we were not disappointed.  We started out with some of their signature cocktails which were good, I didn't have any of them, I'm a vodka soda kind of girl so I can't comment on the quality or taste of their drinks.  We also had an amazing bottle of italian red wine that complimented our meal perfectly.  The bread was fantastic...not only did we have different dips (marscapone butter, olive oil and eggplant tapaenade) but they also included meat and cheese stromboli!  Delicious!  

For dinner I coudln't decide so my friend and I shared the proscuitto wrapped veal loin and duck and foie gras ravioli.  The veal was good and the sauce was delicious.  The ravioli was the winner for me though, great combo of duck and fatty foie gras and the sauce of balsamic complimented it well.  For dessert I tried a bite of the blue cheese with dried fruit preserves and that was excellent as well.  

All in all and enjoyable meal and I would go back again.
