Kerry one of the Bar tenders is a great source of information for anything that is happening in the city. He even hooked us up and allowed us to drop his name at a couple of clubs which helped get us easy  V.I.P.access. 
The food is out of this world and the 800 wine selection is the BOMB. BOOM!!!! Delicious. If you want to impress a nice person in your life take them here and tell Kerry that Keenan from LA says Hello.
