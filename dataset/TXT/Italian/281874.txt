yXiDD18UV49-7UhA6dWjAw We had a call in order. We were told it would be ready I'm 15 mins. We arrived 20 mins later to be told that they were changing the oil for the wings and it would be 30 mins extra to complete our order. Are you kidding me!?!? If I wanted to wait at your restaurant for good I wouldn't have called it in.  They deliver but only for orders over $100 and I told them I live 3 miles away and they need to deliver it to me for this complete in inconvenience . The "manager "said he would resolve this now and get our wings with their fresh oil.  How can this happen?? Oil takes a long time to heat.  We then had to sit for another 12 minutes waiting on our order. To make matters worse, the wings are totally from the old oil and they didnt even give us a discount.  The good may be good here normally, but this service will not be accepted.  Never again!!!!
