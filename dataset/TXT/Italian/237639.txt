u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Great lunch place with good food and good service, but not so sure about five stars... I dont give those out that easily.

I ordered the bruschetta plate:
- Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone - delicious!
- Brie & Apples with Fig Spread - delicious though a little sweet
- Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato - delicious but gets a little soggy
- Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil - good but the tomato was not very ripe

My sister had the chicken salad, with pecans, apples, gorgonzola and raspberry vinaigrette - she said it was alright. I tried some of her Prosciutto with Brie panini, that comes with fig jam and arugula - that was really really good. Heavy on the prosciutto, light on the fig jam - an excellent balance :)

They also have happy hour drinks 7 days a week -- all wines $5/glass, draft beers $5/pitcher -- worth noting!

Overall I liked the place and the prices were great, but I think my expectations of a soulful renovated historic post office were maybe too high.
