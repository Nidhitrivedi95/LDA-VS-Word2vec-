YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg This was probably the best dining experience I have had in Las Vegas! Not only did they have a vast menu, they also cater to vegans and had a full plant based menu. My boyfriend and I were both able to enjoy a fine dining experience and I was able to really enjoy my food instead of ordering a huge salad and some sides. The people who work there were amazing and super attentive as well.
