tVyLQzyhhinKcGzlZIFZjQ This may be my favorite Oregano's location. Even better the ASU Oregano's and definitely trumps the Elliot one closer to our home. 

Seriously, the food at Oregano's is consistently delicious no matter which one you go to. But the Germann and Dobson location serves up more than great food. We're talking customer service, here! 

We came here on a Monday night back in July for Dude's birthday *cough, OLD MAN! cough*. Normally I love me some air conditioning; however, I had just took a shower and was fuh-reezing. Patio it is. Two high power mister fans out there. 

Our server AJ was a total sweetheart even though it was her day before her weekend began. Suggested some great drinks to us, the D'Liscious Rootbear float for Dude, and Red Sangria for me. 

I'm not a big rum girl, but Dude had to put his beverage on lockdown after I took a few sips! So good. You can skip the pizza cookie if you're so inclined and just get this as dessert. 

We ordered one of our usuals, the Oregano's Favorite Salad (Jr. Size) and the Big Rig Pasta with Sausage. Plenty of spice! And apparently, they fly in the sausage from Chicago. That explains a few things. 

To garner herself a nice tip, AJ hooked Dude up with a free white chocolate macadamia nut pizza cookie for his birthday. Half baked goodness! They're definitely meant for four people . . . But let's be honest, we weren't exactly "behaving" in the dietary sense that night. 

Thanks for making it a great birthday, Oregano's and AJ!
