D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA Went in for my first time December 31, New Year's Eve night.  It was very crowded and busy but our server was attentive and very efficient. The food was amazing, from the meatball appetizer thru the butter cake finish, and the filet and sea bass main courses were insanely good! Chantel was our server and even though the place was packed she made our dinner one to remember! Recommend this place highly! Food, service, atmosphere were all the best and can't wait to come back next year which happens to be tomorrow? Great Old Town Scottsdale dining spot!
