LMdUoR00jPxQDWLYRq93FA If you've been reading some of the more negative reviews about Quiessence let me explain some things.  For starters the restaurant is in the middle of a working farm, so the driveway is gravel and the grounds are covered in wood chips.  My wife and I rather enjoyed that, if it's something that's going to wreck your evening then don't come.  The dining area is somewhat cosy, if you're looking for a cavernous area full of shadowy corners this is not it.  Which is not to say you can't have a romantic meal, you just have to be willing to be near your fellow man.  The food was absolutely fantastic, and the wine pairings were superb.  The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt when we needed something.  Here's another point, dinner takes a while, if you're looking to shovel food down your maw and bolt then you're in the wrong restaurant. Courses are served in a laid back fashion, with plenty of time to look deeply into each others eyes and enjoy your wine.  

So if you're looking for a nice dinner, in a quaint environment, with a wonderful service staff then Quiessence will suit you just fine.
