hcKl9pAuB6E6ndh8anbgFg WOW.  WOW is all I could say for about the first 5 minutes, UNTIL I asked about wines and the head chef, Joe came out to talk to us about some menu items and wine pairings.  He's from the area so he understands what we Cleveland-Lorain residents like to eat.

I asked about the rack of lamb, and as soon as he said "Lebanese rub", I stopped him and immediately ordered a full rack.  5 chops came out, and I was NOT dissapointed.  I've tasted lamb from all over the world, and this is some of the best I've ever had, including what my family raised me on.

I had a Romanian sweet wine that was so good I had 2 glasses (and I don't drink wine).  My good woman had a ribeye steak with a semi-dry red that went perfect.  Desserts as well, and it was a night to remember.  

I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant, with reservations, if you want a romantic dinner, you're looking for the best food in the county, or you are trying to impress someone.  This is the place you'd want to come to.  I made a reservation online with an app for restaurant reservations, same day, and had no problems at all.  I will come visit here each time I come home now!
