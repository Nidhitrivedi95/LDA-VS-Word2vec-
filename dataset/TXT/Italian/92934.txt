Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag I came here with a few of my coworkers since it was one of my boss's favorite restaurants. It's located in the Crystal shopping center next to Aria.

We started off with some appetizers: The Salumi & Cheese board, Bruschetta and Fritto Misto (calamari). The cheese board had a nice variety although I didn't like that the olives were not pitted. The calamari was cooked perfectly and had a great garlic aioli to accompany it.

Since we dined there on a Thursday, it was Gnocchi night and I decided to go with their daily special, the Veal Gnocchi. I was tempted to try their Ribeye which was the other daily special but decided on something lighter. The veal was cooked perfectly and flavorful but I wasn't so much a fan of their Gnocchi. My coworkers who ordered the ribeye said that it was very good. 

Overall, the food and service were great, would definitely recommend this place!
