EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw On a quest to see what the Phoenix New Times Best of list was all about this was our first stop.. Best Margarita. It is not this fancy schmancy craft combination that gives this drink the best of but perhaps its simplicity. This margarita allows you to appreciate the true essence of an agave spirit, Tequila. With only two other simple ingredients I would say this margarita was top notch. We stayed for dinner and boy am I happy we did. The bartenders, Lauren and Brenon, were artful, creative, passionate and the true meaning of mixologists and hospitality extraordinaires. We did a coursed menu which included burrata with a pancetta vinaigrette, ahi crudo with a horse radish drizzle, lamb neck gnocchi and pork belly. This was a culinary experience that takes you on an palatable adventure craving for the next fix. I would recommend this place to anyone but especially those of you that want to challenge your pallet with something more!
