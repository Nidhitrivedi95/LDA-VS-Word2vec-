Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw Food: sandwiches are about $9 each and took about 15 minutes to come out. 
We ordered the meatball parm sandwich and chicken parm sandwich which were very good quality sandwiches.   Meatball one was super moist and the bread had the right amount of crunch.  The sauce didn't make the bread soggy which was to my surprise.  
The chicken was Katsu style which I did not find to go well inside a sandwich. The Katsu got pretty soggy after being inside the sandwich so I had to remove it as I was eating. 


They do have some free samples on the cashier counter for small chips and what not.
