Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A I visited this restaurant while in town on a business trip. This restaurant was by far the best thing I experienced in Tempe (ok, the weather was pretty nice too). The menu was creative with lots of nice salad and starter options and a decent selection of pastas. My kale salad was really good, but the squash ravioli stole the show. The pasta was perfectly cooked, the filing was moist and plentiful and the goat cheese garnish really tied the whole dish together. It's been days and I still find myself wishing I could have it again!
