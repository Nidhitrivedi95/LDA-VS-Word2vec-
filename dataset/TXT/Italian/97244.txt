esnvHQxunLTAckQpntqbCg My expectations for this place were pretty high, considering the previous reviews. The restaurant itself is really lovely - the decor is beautiful. I was disappointed with the service and food, however. There was only one waitress for the entire restaurant including the patio, so service was incredibly slow and the waitress kept forgetting things (I don't blame her, it was just way too many tables for one person to handle). My friend had their signature pasta dish, the pizzoccheri, which was good, but my braised beef with polenta, while beautifully presented, was incredibly underseasoned and pretty much flavourless. Maybe I just went on an off night, but I was pretty underwhelmed.
