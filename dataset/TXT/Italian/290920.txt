zxfb_EWIjK2rzkSRIboTMA It's nice to have something new in Imperial! I love the lunch special they offer of half a hoagie, fries and a 20 oz bottled soda...great price and the half a hoagie is a good size with a good amount of toppings. A co-worker and I also do the 2 gyros and 1 order of fries special which is great, their tzatziki sauce and ranch dressing is amazing. Fresh Cut Fries have a great seasoning on them, you don't even need ketchup! The hoagie rolls are Mancini's which make them even better! I haven't tried their pizza or stromboli yet but I hope to soon!
Super convenient to order/pay online with spaces for comments if there is a topping you don't want. On my lunch break I can easily order, run home to let my dogs and pick up my food on my way back to work.
