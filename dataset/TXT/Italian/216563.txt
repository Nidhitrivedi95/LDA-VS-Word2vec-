RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ I don't know if it was an off night. I have been a long time fan, but it has been a few years since I've had their pizza. The staff were friendly.   It is a cash only establishment. It took about 45 minutes for the pizza to be ready; when it came out, it was soggy with grease to the point it pooled on the platter. The crust was off as well; you could taste the baking soda. My wife, a first time visitor, couldn't eat it. Fair warning to everyone.
