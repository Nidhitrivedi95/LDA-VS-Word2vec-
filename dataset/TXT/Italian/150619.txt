klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw *rumbly tummy* I neeeeeeeeeed food.  OOOOH! That place is cute!  

We walked in and the hostess said "2 for lunch?" and we said "we just want to get a drink and some apps."  She seated us in the lunch area.  We ordered some Vegas priced apps and a drink.  My man decided to go to the bathroom and sees that all the food and drinks we ordered are part of a happy hour that is inconspicuously on a sign...and were neglected to be told about.  

He comes back and asks if the things we ordered are covered by the happy hour.  The hostess (because our waiter has disappeared into a space-time portal) says no because we are having lunch not in the bar.....uh....don't you think you or the she or the waiter could have mentioned that a) there is a happy hour for what we said we were interested in or b) everything we had was on the happy hour menu if we wanted to sit 20ft away at the bar with plenty of space?

We requested to shift to the bar and get 2 for 1 drinks and the same food for less.  This apparently got everyone's panties in a bunch.  The hostess kept having to "ask the manager" who for some reason refused to come over to the table.  The waiter popped back in from the portal to said that the food was made so it was not possible.  We eventually got up and addressed the manager ourselves because we watched him avoid dealing with the issue by personally by pouring water for other guests and bringing their food (isn't that the waiter's job? Oh right he went back into the space-time portal).   

Once we had resolved the issue with the manager, we had perfectly wonderful service and pretty good food from the sweet blonde bartender lady (she got great tips).  

I'm sorry that we were not super drunk and thus willing to be over charged for our food and drinks.  I'm not sure why that concept was so hard for them.
