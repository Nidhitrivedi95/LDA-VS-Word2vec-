64o_nYvzIKwHFOSYSEm-qw I don't think I'd know "good pizza" even if it was force shoved down my throat.
(Open invitation to anyone who wants to buy me "good pizza" to teach me the difference haha)
Anyway...I think 99% of pizza is good. It really is hard to mess up.
I think the only bad pizza I've had has been the school lunch pizzas they would give me when I was little. The cheese was oddly white and a quarter of an inch thick, uninspired over added tomato paste, and white as a ghost crust. Then there's the pizza where when the cheese goes cold it turns to really gross plastic. For the most part, I figure it's good pizza when it's almost as good cold as it is when it's hot. 
Ok...so enough about other stuff.
I think we got a white sauce ricotta spinach pizza.
I'm a meat lover but I was going to share this pizza and I know not everyone shares my love for meat (wink wink). I guess I've always been curious about non meat pizzas but always figured I wanted to get my moneys worth and go for the meat.
Pizza was really yummy...It was good pizza....i think....I wanted to get everything on the menu...it all sounded super awesome and so many varieties!
I think the only problem was that we weren't greeted or acknowledged...but that's the story of my life so maybe I shouldn't hold it against them. 
It's off the main strip on a pretty calm side of a mall lot and was like a mile from our hotel.
Fun times.
