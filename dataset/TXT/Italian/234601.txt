It's the Olive Garden. You know what you're getting when you go to one. This location is up by Northlake Mall, so if you don't want the food court here's another option.

The big pro and con here: the staff. I've been here for lunch, dinner and take out numerous times. The one consistent: the workers are all really nice and friendly. Unfortunately, the service is hit and miss. If you are on a strict time limit for lunch, this may not be a good option for you.

I'll still come here. Why? I just can't stay away from dipping breadsticks in the chicken and gnocchi soup.
