zluk4cL7Ch-uRlRply42ZQ Outstanding. Found it on Yelp and glad we did. 
It was a Saturday night and we were glad we made a reservation. The food was outstanding. I had pork ossobuco from the list of "specials" and my wife had pasta Bolognese from the regular menu. Both were very well prepared and served. Out waiter did a good job.
The location in a strip mall would not inspire confidence but proves once again you can't tell a book by its cover. Inside the decorator did some interesting things to break up the space - pretty well done too - not genius, but pretty well done.
We found it a little boisterous - not overwhelming, but too much for a romantic evening. 
We had one bottle of wine (fair prices) and two entres, Total with tax & tip was a shade over $100 - fair price for what we got.
Although we had more that enough to eat, as we were leaving we spotted the  candy store/ice cream place in the same mall. (It's open to 11:00 PM! -  and we found out why.)  Okay, I had an extra 530 calories. It was worth it. I will cut back on breakfast, lunch & dinner today to make up for it. They make their own ice cream and have unique sundaes I have never heard of before. My wife had the peanut butter cup sundae made with peanut butter syrup! My brain is foggy and all I remember about mine is 1) I never heard of it before and 2) It was great.
