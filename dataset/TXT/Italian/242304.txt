umxki_So2--o08q9bkXK6Q We have been here twice now and have had nothing but delicious food and great service.  The staff has alway been attentive and the food is great .  It is often difficult to find a restaurant with an all organic menu. In some of the reviews people complain about the prices, but don't forget, if you go to a market and purchase organic products it is going to cost a bit more!  We prefer to pay a bit more for healthier food for our family.  We will return next time we are in town!
