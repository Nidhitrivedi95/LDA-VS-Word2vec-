iFZpyiDUgwldTWuW-5YW6A I went for my bday and had a great time! The ambiance is fabulo use and sexy. The outdoor space is just as nice as the inside. The food was delicious. We really enjoyed the meatball appetizer and the calamari appetizer with peppers and shrimp. For an entree I would recommend the lasagna. The pizzas are very good as well.
