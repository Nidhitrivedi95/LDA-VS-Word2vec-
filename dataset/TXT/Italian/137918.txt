Jadp-zRKLOmav3aECRjALw Came here a month ago. The food was okay but overpriced in my opinion. The chicken wings are these little mini wings and they charge the same price as what you would get for larger wings elsewhere. We didn't order pizza but we saw many people did and many people were complaining about them. I would go somewhere else.
