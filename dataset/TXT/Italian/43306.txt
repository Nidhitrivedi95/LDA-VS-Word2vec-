7YpipG1N4nsvQZ_WGiV9PA Without a doubt, one of the best eateries in the Las Vegas/Henderson area.  This "sub" shop has much more than meets the eye.  The Rigatoni Bolognese and the Chicken Francese are our regular fare but my wife has tried a number of different dishes that she loves.  This little hole in the wall specializes in take-out food and catering, as well as having seating for about 60 people for dining in service.  Everything is home-made at Parmezan Subs

If you are looking for takeout food or a casual place to hang out and grab a quick bite before going out, this place should not be missed!!!  Oh...Parmezans is also open for lunch.
