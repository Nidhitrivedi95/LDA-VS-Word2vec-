c-l4nDPZcEwapEiV-Xf08w This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  You usually need a reservation.  Friday and saturday can be a 1+hour wait without it.  The food is excellent.  We eat here all the time.  Our favorite things:Htipiti, lamb sovlaki, wild mushroom pizza, greek ribs, and pretty much all the deserts.
