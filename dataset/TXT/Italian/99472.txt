F2Ic0wqZkWz2cSwSWkJ5mA Been meaning to try a pizza from Paoletti's for quite some time and finally ceased the opportunity last night for Boyz Night with my son, and we weren't disappointed! We ordered a large pie with the traditional tomato sauce, pepperoni and half mushrooms - it was seriously delicious. It was just the two of us, so there was plenty. The size could have easily fed a family of four. Nice large sized slices and they weren't shy on toppings. Of course we also ordered some wings (they offer one style - baked versus fried medium/hot Buffalo), and they were a very tasty addition to our night after hard week of work and first week back at school. We'll be ordering again from Paoletti's - definitely two thumbs up for Boyz Night. Great local pizzeria (and much more) that left us feeling completely content! We're gonna tackle our leftover slices for lunch today....maybe breakfast. Can't wait!
