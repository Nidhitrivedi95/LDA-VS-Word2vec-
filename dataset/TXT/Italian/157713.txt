Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA this fine dinning italian restaurant is inside the chaos of New York New York Hotel and Casino.  We wanted to have a good sit-down dinner where we could have a romantic mood and no so close to the noise of the casino. Well, this spot is very nice, very romantic and we had an early dinner so it was very quiet.  I had the Insalata de Capri and Fettuccini Tuto di Mare... delicioso!  my date had the roasted chicken.
