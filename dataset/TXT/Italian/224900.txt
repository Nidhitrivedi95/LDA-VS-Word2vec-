sN0EFTle0pW77DUgl8i-Rw I will start by saying the service was awesome

For starters we had the calamari, stuffed eggplant and the anchovies 

For our mains we had the lobster stuffed ravioli penne vodka chestnut gnocchi and the salmon

Us gentleman had the the smaller steak cut into slices cooked to perfection with arugula 

For dessert we had ice cream tiramisu and the Mille foglie 

Everything from start to finish was excellent, the server was informative and made some very good suggestions 

This has need my 5th time here and I will say it's been very consistent 

If you like pasta pls try the lobster ravioli, I have even included a picture of them..... absolutely delicious
