kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg My boyfriend and I stopped by Grape Street for the first time back in December 2014 to grab a quick glass of wine before our movie started across the street. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were all nice and cute and made friendly conversation with us. The wine and service were good. 

Went back with a girlfriend for dinner last night and we were able to sit outside and enjoy the patio. Our waiter was a bit late coming buy our table but was very friendly. He didn't stop by too often, but was very nice and helpful when he did. We had the Burrata for a starter and it was good - nothing out of the ordinary, but in my opinion, you can't go wrong with burrata. We both ordered salads - Greek and Caesar - and they were good but nothing to rave about. They were a little drenched in dressing, but for the Caesar salad they did have a small option which was perfect for me. 

The dessert menu was pretty big, in my opinion, and our waiter suggested that we have a look at it. We did, and had a couple in mind. Asked him what his favorite was - not on our list - but decided to give it a try.  We had the Apple Tart and it was pretty amazing. 

The atmosphere on the patio was very nice - some people came in with their dogs and the dogs behaved just fine. The sun started to get in some people's eyes as it was setting and the restaurant staff were able to move some shades or something around and get the sun out of their eyes which was nice and accommodating.  

I'm sure I will come back to Grape Street Cafe because of it's convenient location for me, and the nice relaxed vibe, but I wouldn't say it's on the top of my list or a "must go" place. Overall an enjoyable experience with Grape Street Cafe.
