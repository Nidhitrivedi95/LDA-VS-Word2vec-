FfF8XGFf8_BSlWSjIgqeQg Came here on a Tuesday for lunch at around noon. Place was fairly empty but beginning to fill up. The dining area is really spacious and the decor is very rustic. 

We ordered the regular size pesto pollo fettucine, the butcher pizza, and a side of polenta tots. The water tasted kind of weird...Had a garlic bread taste to it which was off putting. 

This was my second time coming here and the pasta never fails to disappoint! It tastes fresh and not processed at all like at other chain restaurants. I do believe it is made in house! The portion looks small but it really does fill you up with the heavy sauce and toppings. Super delicious. 

The butcher pizza was well made as well. Hand tossed dough and a bunch of toppings that complement each other. The pizza cutter it comes with is pretty unique too; you get to cut it how you like and can even share amongst your table members. 

The polenta tots were a nice, sort of "fried" side with everything. It is basically hand tossed dough balls with cheese and breading. I'd recommend getting this for 4.97 instead of the sociables version because that costs twice as much for the same amount (it just comes with cheese and tomato sauce). 

Overall, it was a nice experience here. The service was friendly and it seems consistent even when I went on a packed night. I believe if you go here before the end of 2016, they will give you a coupon to use for the month of Jan 2017 which is $20 off a bill of $50+. That is what I received at the end of my meal at least. Great discount!
