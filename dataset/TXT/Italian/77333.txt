cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA Go hungry!!! The stuffed pizzas are ginormous! My boyfriend and I ordered a large , and took half if it home. Be prepared to wait to get in and wait for the stuffed pizza, it takes about 45 min to make. I didn't care too much for their sangria, didn't taste like much and wine list was pretty pricey. Friendly staff, clean restaurant...a must try
