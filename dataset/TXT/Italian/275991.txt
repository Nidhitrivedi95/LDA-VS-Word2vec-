yc_5xqXkGTRKlFzN7o2CQQ I've been here twice for dinner (upstairs) and once for brunch, and I can say that it is one of my favourite Montreal restaurants, especially in the Downtown/McGill area. The cuisine is both creative and delicious, not to mention beautifully plated.

As is usually the case with such restaurants, the menu changes constantly to reflect what is fresh and in season. Regardless of when you go though, you can rest assured that the food will be delicious.

For my most recent visit, which was for brunch, I had the crab and shrimp omelette with béarnaise sauce, which was absolutely decadent. They also inadvertently served me the mushroom and spring peas omelette, of which I had a bite, and it too was bursting with fresh spring flavors. Both were prepared with exquisite care. These were not your garden variety omelettes.

The ambiance here is very relaxed and casual, and the servers are very helpful in explaining everything on the menu.
