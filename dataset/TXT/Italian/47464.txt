8yiLVWzJyyTEhYE0fVNvlA I was on the fence for a 3 star verse 4 star review here. It really was a wonderful meal and dining experience so I went for the 4 stars. The only thing is how overpriced it is. I ate alone, for lunch, on a Tuesday while shopping at The Forum Shops in Caesars. I literally could have made a meal out of the "starters" they give you - fried zuchini, wedge of pamasan cheese, garlic bread and sticks, and brushetta and salami. All of that was so tasty. Because all of that came with my meal I didn't mind that my lunch entree was $36. I definitely think that is overpriced though. It was paparadelle in Bolognese sauce, very tasty! I was also a tad annoyed that I was charged $7 for water and then I asked for an iced tea and that was $8. Also, when I went to leave the tip, on the receipt it had a spot for a tip and then also a tip for the table "Captain" - I never heard of that before. So I wound up giving both of them a tip and my grand total for lunch, just for me by myself was $71! It was good and the service was wonderful so I can't complain. Plus I did want t o splurge on something nice. I probably won't go back next time I am there though because I think that you can get just as good food for less. Plus I hate that $7 water tactic.
