0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw I had the chicken breakfast tacos.  Good bargain, with coffee, only 10 bucks.  Tacos packed with chicken, which made them a challenge to eat, but that's a challenge I like!  As in all things Phoenix, the question is - would I drive 50 miles round-trip to eat here?  Yes, I would. Not every day, but for a once in a while special treat.
