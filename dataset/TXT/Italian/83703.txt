DjvpsmdtEvnyMk2vXxpc-w Nice little bar on the lake in "The Lakes" subdivision. The night we went they had live entertainment (2 acoustic guitar players/singers). It kind of gives you the feeling of being somewhere else - not in the middle of the desert. 

The drinks were good. The food was good but, in my opinion, a little over priced. My wife had the Mahi Mahi  ceasar salad and I had the Mahi Mahi tacos with onion rings. I happen to like spicy foods so the tacos were good - However, If you do not like spicy hot, do not order these. The onion rings were good - they were fresh made and the breading was unique.

All in all, a nice evening - good food (although a little over priced), good drinks, top notch entertainment, and great ambience!
