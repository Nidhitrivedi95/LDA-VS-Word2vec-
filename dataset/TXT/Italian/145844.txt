K74HYkFjYwhEpJt8HTOxnQ I rarely leave reviews on here as most reviewers usually say similar things and if there's a consensus opinion about a place there's probably some merit to that opinion. However, last night, I had a bad experience at Johnny's Bar and thought it was worth a Yelp review. We had an 8 PM reservation for 4 people and weren't seated till close to 8:45. Look, I get that stuff happens and sometimes people don't get up from a table and there's not much a restaurant can do. But a 45 minute wait in the most overcrowded and loud restaurant in Cleveland was really annoying. The only area for us to stand was where waiters and waitresses were running food and we had to keep moving around. Also, if it was just the 45 minute wait, that sucks, but the hostess and managers were rude and basically ignored us whenever we asked if our table was almost ready. When we finally got seated, the waiter we had was good, the appetizers really good and the entrees just meh. (Stuffed peppers and fried mozzarella were good, my pappardelle was awful - the noodles were all stuck together like a casserole or something). But they never came over and apologized for the wait or gave us anything complimentary or anything like that. No dessert, drink or appetizer. I know this place is always slammed on the weekends so they probably don't have to treat customers very well and it will still be crowded but I know I'll never come back here after the inconsiderate way we were treated last night.
