Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A My wife and I met up with some friends for a late dinner/get together type of thing. We each ordered a glass of wine, which was reasonably priced. I ordered the Heirloom Tomato and Baby Beets appetizer as we had eaten earlier and it was absolutely amazing! Next we decided to skip just to dessert. We attempted to order the bread pudding but they were out, but said they had banana pudding. My friend ordered that and I decided to get the huckleberry jam and lemon curd. My dish came out quickly and was absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, the waiter told my friend that they were actually out of banana pudding as well. That's embarassing. Overall, it was a good experience. I was surprised at the service for it being a Wednesday night. I would hate to see what they would be out of on a Saturday!
