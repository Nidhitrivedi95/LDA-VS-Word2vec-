zINKP9rtvo2IUKTZoYJUvQ Visited with my wife and another couple recently.  I have eaten at Lombardinos a bit so that was my point of comparison for higher end Italian.

Pros:
  * Service was attentive and competent.
  * Appetizers were pretty good, wrapped dates, beats were both good.
  * Good bread.
  * specialty cocktails were ok.
  * desert was great.

Cons:
  *Of the four of us everyones entree was poor.  Two got the prosciutto wrapped fish special and they were all fishy tasting, not the quality one would expect for the price and generally gross.  I got two pasta half orders and both were not flavorful or memorable.  The fourth was another pasta dish that was equally bland.
  * The whole place put on a lot of airs from the servers to the menu it was all trying to scream IMPORTANT FANCY RESTAURANT.  Unfortunately the food did not stick to that narrative. 

On leaving we all agreed that there were some nice parts but the entrees were such a disappointment and made up such a bulk of the bill that we would probably not go back.  Lombardinos is not perfect, but for the same price I have had many better Italian meals there.  Maybe if you just got appetizers it would be a better time.
