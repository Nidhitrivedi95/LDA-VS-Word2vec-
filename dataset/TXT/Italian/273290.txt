xzQn9smeOhgqCH-S-K-lgg As previously stated, curse of the Chain.  In a chance to meet up with another couple, we entered the Macroni Grill.  We had a forty minute wait at 7PM.  Which any idiot willing to go near a mall on a weekend night shound be subjected to on pronciple alone.  I like half of the people decide an over priced, under alcoholed drink could help bide my time.  Well, there was the impression twelve tables were not being seated.  Stunned that someone else had spoke a suspicion I long held "they just want you to wait so you think this is a really good place"  We waited only thirty minutes, and were placed next to kitchen.  Three of us opted for the well advertised Chianti BBQ Steak.  Well the medium was rare, one medium rare was medium well, and one was rare.  The procuitto mac n cheese was very dry, like overbaked and needs some milk/cream/butter dry.  The side were grilled vegetables, the three of us shared one tomato, half zuchini, and piece of eggplant.  The smart person ordered the Salmon and had best food at table.  We have had a slightly better experience on our last visit, but just enough to meet someone here (2 for $20 was reason last time)
