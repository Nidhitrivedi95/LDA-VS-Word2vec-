They ended up bringing the wrong items and some of the orders were brought to our table twice, despite ordering once. The dessert is not part of the deal and you have to pay separately, which sucks!
The only thing I liked about this place was that it looked a little more fancy that your average AYCE restaurant. Each of us ended up paying around $50 that night.
