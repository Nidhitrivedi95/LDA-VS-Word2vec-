3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A just an FYI, when I went they were no longer serving their carpaccio and marrow dish as their guy can't source good marrow anymore. Bummer. 

we had a seared tuna app to start and it was great. lots of sweet/citrus flavours  with the tuna. Really good and refreshing. 

shared the cacio e pepe pasta and toasted spaghetti, bottarga, chili and garlic. the cacio e pepe was obviously very simple but very wonderful. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. pasta and cheese. so good. the toasted spaghetti was interesting and also wonderful. no complaints on either mains.

dessert: carrot cake with marscapone cheese. it's carrot cake and cheese. What is there to not like? amazing.
