It's no surprise that you get what you pay especially when dealing with Las Vegas types of buffets. Hear it all the time about the beef being shoe leather tough or the shrimp cocktail having grasshopper sized shrimps for the bargain hunters. For the locals it's getting the best value especially when it comes to Asian buffets.

In particular the Palms' Bistro Buffet comes to mind. The Asian dishes are amazingly authentic and delicious. I think you can place all the credit to their predominantly skilled Asian chefs. 

Thursday lunch is especially lucrative for those who are age 50 or over with a Palms Club card. Why Thursday lunch?  The regular price is $12.99 and discounted another $5.00 for club cardholders. 50 and over cardholders are entitled to a second discount of another 50% thus dropping the Thursday lunch to an unheard of $4 bucks and it includes wine and beer. A beer at a restaurant will cost that much alone.

Caveat Emptor... stay far away from the desserts. For they will only sour your buffet luncheon experience. Of course there are those who like rock hard like desserts.

If you stick to the Thursday program, seniors 50 and over with club cards are all winners....
