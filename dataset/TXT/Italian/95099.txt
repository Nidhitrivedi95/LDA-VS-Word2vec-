I have been to the Golden Nugget, where this restaurant is located many times, but never ate here. Oh man, I was pleasantly surprised. I went in expecting typical Italian fare, a la Olive Garden, but I got much more. The calamari appetizer was amazing, tasted fresh and not too over fried. I ordered the chicken parmigiana, while my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Marsala. His came with an Italian salad, which was also pretty good for a salad. When our meals came we were amazed by the portion sizes. If I wasn't starving I probably could have saved half for another meal, the chicken piece was about the size of my face. Not even kidding. The boyfriends Chicken Marsala was about the same amount of chicken, just cut up and laid over a bed of mushroom risotto. Everything that I tasted here was amazing and the service was on point. I will for sure be back next time I come to town.
