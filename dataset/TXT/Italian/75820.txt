cs1qJvnWUg_f8g020z_3PQ We wanted to try the pizza here after reading it was the #1 pizza in the valley per Phoenix magazine. We went for lunch. Smaller inside than what we expected but very nice, feels like an Italian cafe. Great service. You can see the kitchen and the big pizza oven from the dining room, we enjoyed that. The margherita pizza was delicious, not too much sauce and cheese so you can taste that delicious crisp crust, I would have liked more basil since I love basil. Hubby got the Wiseguy pizza, wished there was more fennel sausage it was so good. This pizza doesn't have sauce, so he asked for half with marinara and the other half original. They are very accommodating. We both liked it with the marinara. Onions on this pizza are roasted and cut in thick rounds, if you love onions you'll like this, we didn't care for that. We also asked for olives from the extras menu, we thought it would go on the pizza but they brought it out as an appetizer which we loved! A little expensive for us for lunch, but very good and we'll be back.
