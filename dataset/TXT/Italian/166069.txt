mbPaXByWZBZUGqvh8ewmTA We were visiting our daughter who lives in Chagrin Falls and were looking for a casual Italian close by. Based on the yelp reviews we selected Cibo.
What a great choice. It was a Saturday evening and we called ahead and were told that coming after 8 things would open up. We arrived right around 8 and had about a 5 minute wait. The restaurant is small and while they have outdoor tables it was raining so the restaurant itself was full.
Cibo specializes in fresh homemade pasta, (cavatelli is the only pasta they serve). A variety of sauces as well as several add ones, meatballs, ground Italian sausage, grilled chicken and vegetables are offered.
In addition to the pasta Cibo serves about 10 different thin crust pizzas.
My wife and I shared a pasta with marinara sauce and a tomato, mozzarella, Italian sausage pizza and a bottle of their house Sangiovese.
The pasta was wonderful, very fresh with a light tasty marinara sauce, and a large delicious meatball. The pizza was also very good, light, crisp, flavorful not greasy.
The wine was better than what I expected for $20.
The wait staff Saturday consisted of 3 of the 5 daughters of the owners. They were attentive and very helpful in describing the menu to us first timers.
All in all an excellent experience and we will certainly go back when we are in Chagrin again.
