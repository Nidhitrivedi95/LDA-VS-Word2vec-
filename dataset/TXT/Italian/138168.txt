JBrBsKpw0bbXK5nlrXVOYQ I had my son's 8th grade graduation party here tonight. The food and service were out standing!! perfect!! I have been talking to Barbara for week with the planning. Didn't know she was the owner. So nice and friendly. Making sure that everything was perfect for my special night. I talked to Kevin in the banquet room, didn't know he was the owner either. Both were so friendly! Everything was just so perfect! I order here a lot for my company during the summer months. Everything is always perfect, food is so delicious. This is my only place of choice for Italian Food. I highly recommend this place for regular dinning and parties! Their customer service and attention to detail is always TOP NOTCH!
