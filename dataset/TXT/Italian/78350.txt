D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA Outstanding new restaurant in Old Town - looks like 3rd time's the charm in this location. 

Previous owner(s) had tried a few different things that apparently didn't pan out. Well, the new owner of this spot apparently knows what's up.

The specialty cocktails (which I'm not normally into) are fantastic, and their wine on tap is awesome. The food is out of this world - it's all different. They are really into locally sourced fresh ingredients and being earth conscious (which I really appreciate) and you can taste the difference in the food. 

I had a pepperoni pizza and shared some bruschetta that was crazy good, and my girlfriend had a chicken dish I sampled that was also amazing. The cheese on the pizza was creamy - it was really unusual, but I scarfed down every bit of it. The crust was delicious as well. 

The best part is that I don't feel boated or whatever. I was full, but didn't have a gut bomb. We even split a dessert that was like their take on an adult s'more. It was ridiculous. 

Evo should be a yelper's paradise. This is going to be a really hot spot for an after work happy hour when you don't feel like having a Corona and chips and salsa. It's also a fantastic spot for a date night. It's an awesome place for locals to come and unwind with a drink and some noshes.

There's a really comfy atmosphere and everyone that works there seems passionate and welcoming. I hope they keep it up after the "we're new" wears off. I wish this place all the success and I hope it's around for years to come. I'm definitely going to be back here lots. Had a wonderful time and a happy tummy.
