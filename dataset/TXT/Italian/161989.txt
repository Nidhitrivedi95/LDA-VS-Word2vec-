LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g I love going to Fellini's. The service is always consistently great, and so is the food. The dining rooms are quiet little escapes painted to look like Italian villas, and it makes it very easy to forget you are in a casino. And that alone is a huge plus. Let's face it, I can cook better Italian at home, but sometimes, you just wanna go somewhere nice and have someone else do the work. 

The prices are very reasonable and the portions are sure to fill you up, and then some. I am a creature of habit, and always tend to get the same thing. I order the chicken parmesian and my ex always got the fettucini alfredo with chicken. The servings are big enough that you can share each others food, and still have plenty of what you ordered to enjoy. The alfredo is very rich but that's basically the point. The chicken parm is awesome it's a good sized breast (insert obligatory "that's what he said" joke here) and it comes with pasta. The complimentary bread is pretty good; not "oh my god amazing!", but good. The garlic bread is decent. The house wines are pretty reasonable as well.

I never have any complaints and the prices are on par with most Italian restaurants. So I say you shouldn't be disappointed giving Fellini's a shot.
