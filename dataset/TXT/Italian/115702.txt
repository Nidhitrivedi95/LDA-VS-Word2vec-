gtfLQysuCBEAQk3wwWxwTg Best authentic Neapolitan pizza - my fave is the Margarita.  Ask for the house made hot chilli oil!
Family owned, the staff is always friendly and helpful.
House wine is only $5 a glass with generous pours and the house made soft serve ice cream dessert with fresh fruit is always free.
I quickly became a regular and took all of my friends here.  
Now that I've relocated to Vancouver, I"m in search of something comparable.  I doubt I will find it.
Viva Napoli truly is one of a kind.
