JK_DiDwbl7HX5OhCAh3h4g Not much luck with restaurants lately. Has not been here in a very long time, decided to go down to College street for a nice evening out. Made a reservation (only for the inside, can't reserve for the patio), good think because the patio was packed and there was a long wait. Most of the food was very disappointing. Ordered bruschetta...waiter did not ask if we wanted cheese on it (it is extra) and it was ok. Ordered the meatball appetizer to share, it came freezing cold to the table. My veal scaloppine was nothing special and cold and my daughter's ravioli was equally cold. The pizza that two people had got good reviews. The salad my wife ordered for a meal was barely an appetizer size. Good thing there are a ton of other restaurants on College, Cafe Dip won't be on our list for the next time.
