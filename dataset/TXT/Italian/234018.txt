tpesKzKbcPFekdThYZ4UpA We recently held an event at Bar Italia - a brunch for our two year old twins. I was looking for a place that both kids and adults would enjoy, and having been to a few events upstairs at Bar Italia and eaten many good meals there (best gnocchi around) I thought I'd find out if they were able to accommodate us (with only two weeks notice). From the moment I received a reply to my email from Amanda, the event coordinator, up to the last minute of the party, everything was amazing. 

Amanda went above and beyond to accommodate our needs and was an absolute pleasure to deal with. I was worried that a "bar" might not be kid friendly but found the total opposite- we had 30 kids and 30 adults in attendance and all the kids had a blast. The upstairs event space was the perfect venue, our buffet brunch was super yummy and plentiful with dishes being replenished so that everyone had more than enough, and the service was absolutely amazing. Everyone did everything they could to make sure our guests had a great time and I could not have been happier.

Amanda even came in on the Sunday morning to supervise the event, though she was not scheduled to work, to ensure the party went off without a hitch (which it did). Can't ask for more than that!

Huge thanks to Amanda, Joe (the owner) and the Bar Italia team for helping us pull off a great party on such short notice. Could not have done it w/out you!!
