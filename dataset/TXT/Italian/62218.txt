b24sTA2JkHB4joNlNkBkfQ They forgot the cheese on my breakfast sandwich. I had to repeat my order like 3 times, once to the first lady at the counter, then again at the register, then they asked again if I asked for sausage or bacon. The organization is terrible. Also ordered a coffee and had to walk all the way around and back to where I first ordered to get cream and sugar (and silverware). Pretty disappointing for Venetian standards. Never again.
