KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ Nice, Italian ambiance with an obvious selection of traditional meals. Prices are inline with what I have come to expect for Vegas - you're going to pay a premium for things you're used to eating. I had the ossobuco over risotto and it was amazingly tender and flavorful. I accompanied the meal with a house Cabernet Sauvignon. Delicious.
