NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA I was in Pitt for a conference and went to Proper from the Yelp reviews- the only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of service. The food is awesome and the drink selection fantastic. Since I was alone, I sat at the bar and unfortunately was ignored by the 4 staff behind the bar even though the bar and tables were less than 50% capacity... I ended up borrowing menus from a person near me and then only got attention when I raised my hand to ask for a drink - after waiting about 10 minutes! Seemed the bar staff was very attentive to the other parties at the bar, but for some reason I was overlooked. It just may have been the person assigned to serve me specifically though, as I overheard one of the bar staff (he seemed to be 'in charge') say " I really have no idea where he is, he keeps disappearing". Overall- worth the trip and the $ needed to eat there, but be prepared to be a bit assertive to get the service you need.
