L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw We went here for lunch. My 12 year old son said his sliders were good, but he didn't care much for the sides (salad and baby potatoes with sour cream). My wife and I had bruschetta appetizer for 10. It was tasty and fresh, but quite small. She liked her burger fine and it had nice grilled flavour with tasty toppings, especially the onions. I had the  bolognese pasta which tasted good as well. No sides come with the lunches, except the kids lunch.

Overall the food was good, but the kids sides could have been better choices (they do prefer fries or kettle chips rather than boiled potatoes). We also felt the prices were rather steep for what we had. We headed over to a food court to fill up my son directly afterwards. We spent $90 with the 15% tip, and I was the only one who ordered a drink. I guess you have to pay for Jamie Oliver food, and my wife is a fan. However, even she says that it will be her one and only visit.
