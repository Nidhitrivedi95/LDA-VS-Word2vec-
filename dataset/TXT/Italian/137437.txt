j54J0Ky4ruVbN_NTJ3daFg The food is great, but the atmosphere is my complaint.  I have been going to this restaurant for years but have now made the decision to stop going.  On my last visit, I was stuffed in a corner in the very back.  We were seated right next to the kitchen and also where cocktails are made. 
 The wait staff was bumping into us constantly, spilling drinks on us, and it just didn't make for an enjoyable experience for a rather pricey meal.  Where we sat should not have even been a table. Sadly this is not the first time that I have experienced something like this at Girasole. I am tired of this type of experience at this restaurant, especially after being a customer for many years.  I've found another Italian restaurant in the city with amazing service, great food, and space.  At some point, you just have to say enough is enough. Different leadership might go a really long way. Goodbye, Girasole.
