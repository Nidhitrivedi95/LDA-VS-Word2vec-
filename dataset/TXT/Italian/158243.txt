LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Went to Maggiano's after looking for 4 stars.  Firstly the good points of the place.  The atmosphere and the location is too good..  Service is too fast,  would say unexpectedly fast.. The prices are reasonable for a Italian restaurant..  The waiter were friendly and the services were really good.  
All the above can be enjoyed best when your taste buds are really pleasured. The food I would say is average, or below average than what the location demands. Their is a room for improvement.
