GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA Holy awesomeness!  I love you Mario!  My friend and I found this place on a whim while wandering around in the Venetian and we are so glad we decided to eat there.  It was pricey yes, but so worth it.  Our server was very professional and knew his shit!  He sold us on the burrata cheese appetizer with ramps and it was great.  Again, we found the cheapest wine on the menu and again, didn't feel bad about paying $40 for it because it was a delicious rose and went well with our meal.  I ordered the bolognese as my dinner and it was so good...I can't stop dreaming about it.  I know, it's just bolognese but it was done correctly and that's saying a lot.  The noodles were cooked to perfection and the meat and sauce had terrific flavor, oh so yummy!  We shared the mascarpone bruciato for dessert, kind of like a creme brulee only better with lots a fresh berries on top.  We got a cute little tray of chef made creations when we got the check too and they were all so cute and yummy, the meringue probably being my favorite.  I would highly recommend this place if you love Italian food done right!
