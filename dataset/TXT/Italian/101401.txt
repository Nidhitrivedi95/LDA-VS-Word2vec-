fckUjXz1GKpafT4x7-MVJA We had dinner at this location tonight. The hostesses were not to friendly or attentive and alert when you first walk in. Which adds to first impressions. Our server however his name was Chico was very very good. He met all of our needs and had a smile on his face throughout our time dining. We had some individuals with allergies and he showed us the allergy menu and took our complicated orders in perfect stirde. The food was decent. The Alfredo was a little on the dry side and we did have to pile plates  to the side a few times because they weren't cleared often.
