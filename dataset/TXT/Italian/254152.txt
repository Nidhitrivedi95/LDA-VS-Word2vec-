VVeT1XqQYwrB_fbp3efdUg This place is pretty good (not great, but hey, you are in Charlotte NC, not Chicago IL!).  I had the Italian sausage and bratwurst sandwiches; if you come with an appetite, you could easily eat both.  The food was served very hot and the ingredients were good.  They focus on sandwiches, and do not offer pizza like so many Chicago-style establishments do.  

Decent food and convenient location.
