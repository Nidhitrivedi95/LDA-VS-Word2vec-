RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ Very slow service from they kitchen.  I was asked to be seated at a table, as only a few were occupied. I was told no, we are at capacity.   Then they seated me at the bar.  Not sure what the difference was as I was still ordering food..  maybe they didn't want me at a table because I had shorts on.  

I ordered veal parmesan, it took about an hour to be served. The veal was good, but it came without pasta or any side of any kind.  Not even bread.

In spite of knowing about the wait, the manager did nothing to address the issue. 

Amanda, Jody, and Christina were excellent.  If I could separate it it, the wait staff would get a 5 and the restaurant a 1.
