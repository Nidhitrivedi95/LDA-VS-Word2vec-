I ordered the filet mignon. The color and flavor were good. But something wasn't quite right with the cut. It cut too shredded to be a filet. Filets are supposed to cut like a stick of butter. This cut like a shoulder.

My fiancé ordered the seafood fettuccine which came out in an awkward shaped fish bowl which made it difficult to toss and the sauce was very watery and scallops rubbery. 

On top of all of this the server seemed generally annoyed with our existence. Like us being there was an inconvenience. Won't go back. Which is a shame because we are looking for a local go-to restaurant to satisfy our wants.
