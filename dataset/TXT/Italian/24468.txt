4BBda3yy_8GXGmYLcgggHw Fantastic meal last night! The Arancini balls were a huge hit, the beet caprese salad was good (but could have used an extra kick, like regular balsamic w/ the white balsamic). We also ordered one white (the mushroom) and one red (the eggplant) pizza and I would reorder the mushroom pizza for sure. 

3 of us shared the order, and left full and pleased!
