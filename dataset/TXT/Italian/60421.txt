We were on our way to Chicago for the weekend and I got the brilliant idea, "hey, I'm addicted to TV food shows, we need to check out Ian's."  We were in Madison for a concert last spring, but we were in no shape to be visiting Ian's that night, so this was my opportunity.

I knew right where it was, but with the Occupy protests (or maybe it was just a regular protest, I have no idea which) and the heavy traffic around the lunch hour, we ended up driving around and finally parked in a ramp.  My travel companion was irritated, so I just kept my mouth shut.

We walked in and I just couldn't wait to see what I was going to have.   The conversation went like these -

Travel Companion, "how many slices are you going to have."

Me, "they are big, just 1.  What about you?"

TC, "not sure."

I ordered 1 slice of the tomato pesto and 1 slice of the Florentine.

TC, "I thought you were only getting 1?"

Me, "They all looked good, so I couldn't decide." 

The ordering system was interesting, 4 orders or so, and then a break for the cooking of the pizza, the 4 more.  I didn't get it at first, but then while I was the first person in group 2 waiting for my food, I appreciated the fact I didn't wait long at all.

Travel companion had a Philly cheese steak and a BBQ bacon chicken.

Sat down at one of the only empty tables and took a big bite.  Mmm, that is crispy crust!    As I was plowing through both slices I couldn't decide which I preferred.  After the fact, I think it was the Florentine.  I liked the bite of the feta with the tasty tomatoes.

I'm not a Badger, but I've had some fun in Madison and this was a great place for a quick tasty and affordable lunch.  4 slices of pizza, 1 can of Diet Mountain Dew and an hour of parking only ran me $16.
