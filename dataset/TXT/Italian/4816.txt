_MHUEErH3KW_KvVSOjyYhg I had forgotten about this place but I worked in the area in my early twenties and some coworkers and I would frequent this place for their awesome lunch specials.  

I came here recently while staying  Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak at the for an alternative to the terrible frozen pizza they serve.  Call it in, 8 mins round trip from the hotel. Delicious pizza.
