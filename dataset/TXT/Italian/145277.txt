k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ A friend took me to dinner here the other night and I was excited to try it out.  It did not disappoint.  Love the decor and ambiance...from the beautifully lit entranceway with the fireplace to the dining room to the bar area.  It is dark and elegantly candle lit and yet very unpretentious because it's not a fine dining establishment.  I am in love with this restaurant!  An all around great place to get some great grub.
We tried the Arancini (good but a little pricey for 3 of them),  and 2 pizzas-I had the Autunelle and I highly recommend.  It's basically all my favorite things on one pizza.  I had to stop myself from devouring it all so I could take some home and have my hubby try it.  Salads and pastas seem a little pricey but I didn't order them so I don't know the serving size.  I will be coming back to try out their house made pasta.  Pizzas are a fantastic deal.  Not authentic Italian pizza but I really don't care right now because they were delicious.  I am already thinking about when I get to return with my family.
And our service was top notch.  He recommended a delicious wine for me to try which I thoroughly enjoyed.
