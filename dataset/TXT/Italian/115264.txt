gQbfVuWEElYFqsS0qbUbpQ how can a pizzaria go about completely effing up a slice of plain cheese? just ask amato queen east! .... crust that is still doughy and overly salty, sauce that barely tastes like anything except canned paste, and barely any cheese to speak of. looks okay, but tastes unfathomable, no bueno.
