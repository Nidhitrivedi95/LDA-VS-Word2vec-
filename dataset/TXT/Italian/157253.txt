lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ So, it's a super hot day today, but that did'nt stop me from craving eggplant parmesan. YUM! So me, and two other friends decided to order to go from their lunch menu. I used to eat buca regularly, so I have very high expectations for their food. When my food arrived, My eggplant parmesan tasted like charcoal. It was burnt to a crisp!!! Disappointment reigned as I tried to chew down my burnt, tough, eggplant. My friend ordered the speghetti and meatball, and the meatball was pink/red inside!!! My other friend ordered the chicken limone, which was supposed to come with fettuccini alfredo noodles. He a small piece of boiled chicken, a lemon, and pasta with no sauce. Hmmm.... we looked at his dish and analyzed it for a while, thinking this must have been a mistake. 
     So I called them, and they were very nice about. Although I do not agree with the justifications, I realize that accidents happen especially in the food industry. He said the meatball should be cooked because it sits in the sauce and has had at least 4 hours to cook. I dont know about that seeing as the meatball was pinkish red. Apparently he said that the chicken limone is supposed to be like that. In that case, it was  a HORRIBLE dish!!!! Boiled piece of dinky chicken with noodles and no sauce... for $10.00. They were nice enough to send us a coupon for free entrees to compensate, so I will try them once more, and retract my comment if they are good. Otherwise... stop being so cheap buca! keep your standards even though the economy sucks!
