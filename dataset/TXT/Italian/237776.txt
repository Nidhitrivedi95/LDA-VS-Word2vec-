u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg OK. I realize that I look like a huge softy with the stars but I really do love postinos. My world revolves around their bruschetta. I mean, ricotta with dates and pistachios (!) Most amazing thing ever. The apple, brie, and fig spread is pretty spectacular as well, not that I've found one I don't like. The wine, sangria, and prices are all good. The only thing that tends to be lacking is the service, but only in speed. I'd say they need a few extra hands but that would just add more bodies to an already packed house ( I have never seen this place slow) so I'm perfectly content sitting back and waiting. Give yourself some time if you plan to visit, just sit back and relax, when your server does get there they will be friendly, the wine will be good, and the bruschetta will be delicious.
