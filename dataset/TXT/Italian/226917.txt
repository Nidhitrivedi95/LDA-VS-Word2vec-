SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ My husband and I love Trevi and come out to this restaurant every time we visit Las Vegas.  The service is wonderful and they are very attentive.

We've ordered the lasagna and the chicken parm--both of which are fabulous.  I have also ordered their sald (Caesar) which is large enough to split among two people.  They give you large entrees and those too could easily be split.  It is easily one of the best Italian places I have been to in Las Vegas.

The only thing that is so-so is the bread...and really who cares much about that? I mean, bread should be good but it's not the deal breaker.  It just has too much herbs in it for my taste.

We will be back again.
