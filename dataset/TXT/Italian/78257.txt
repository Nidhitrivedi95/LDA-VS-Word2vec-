I've been to Bar Buca several times for cocktails over the years but never considered them for brunch until I took a look at their online menu and thought it had strong enough offerings to risk taking in-laws to a place I had only previously known for cocktails in late hours of the night. I'm happy to report that the menu really spoke to the overall experience! Really delicious and interesting food that everyone enjoyed.

My choice was chickpea flour crepes stacked with walnuts, crispy prosciutto and apple, and it was really quite delicious. Mr. Beef's choice - bay scallops with eggs - certainly rivaled my choice in terms of tastiness as it was perfectly cooked, tender and full of flavor. Everything else on the table looked fantastic as well.

Bar Buca also features, unsurprisingly, great Italian coffee and nice, unique brunch cocktails. I had a latte with Italian custard and it was great; beef's cocktail was also amazing and the table at large raved about the quality of the coffee.

The service was good, nothing really notable either way, and the ambiance is casual. The one very minor thing everyone complained about was that the place is hard to find from the outside, and it's true: the sign above Buca is quite small and not super well lit; complicating things is the fact that it's in the base of a residential condo complex and it's not super easy to spot. So keep your eyes peeled when you turn down Portland and you will find yourself something a bit out of the ordinary but entirely tasty for brunch!
