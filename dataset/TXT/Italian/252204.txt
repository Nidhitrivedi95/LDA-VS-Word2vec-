VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Had dinner here last Friday night.  We made reservations ahead of time through Open Table which I highly recommend.  When we arrived for our 9:30pm dinner they were running a little behind so we grabbed a drink at the bar.  Great service from the bartender.  Dinner was very good.  We dined on the patio and had the Calamari and Meatball for the appetizers.  Literally the best calamari I've ever had and a pretty darn good meatball too.  For the entree I had the Chicken Parm which was outstanding.  I wish I had been more hungry because it was outstanding.  

The only reason I'm not giving this experience 5 stars is the way the payment was handled.  Our server brought over the check and when I gave him my credit card he insisted that I had to select either a 20 or 22% gratuity option and sign the original check on the spot before he ran the card.  I've never seen this before and it may be how they handle things at this restaurant but it struck me as odd and very awkward.  I had planned to give him a 20% tip but what if I hadn't planned to.  Weird....
