ivugOYd-QcXVEfnm1OyqZA Beto's Pizza is a "must have" when I'm in Pittsburgh. This place is full of nostalgia for me because we used to get it when we visited my Gram and Pap. It's definitely one of those love it or hate it places. 

You order the pizza by the slice. I've only ever had cheese, extra cheese and pepperoni. My favorite to order is just plain cheese. They bake the crust and put on the sauce (with these big, sweet pieces of tomato) and then slap the cheese on cold. If you get it to go, you close it up in the box and the cheese is the perfect bit of melted by the time you get home.
