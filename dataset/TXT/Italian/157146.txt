lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ One evening after having dinner with my family 
Thier computers went down. 
They couldn't even give me a total to pay cash forget the credit 
We had show tickets and couldn't wait around 
The African American manager asked for my credit card 
Send he would send me a bill in the mail
Provided my local address 
After he used an old school swipe of my credit card. 

Days later I received nothing when I checked my Marriott Rewards visa there was a Whopping $220.00 charge

No alcahol. No dessert 
Me my mom and pop, and my 6 yr old son

Needless to say I never ever went back here again
And I told all my friends what they did to me. 
They took advantage of my credit card and added what they wanted 

God knows how much tip they left themselves
Avoid this restaurant at all cards 
Not all Buca DiBeppos are like this. 
I've had great service in the past and been going there from time to time for over about 8 years about 3 times a year. 

Never again. 

Look at your bill! Lesson learned!! 
As far as I'm concerned they owe my family a 100.00 gift card! But I won't hold my breath
I should take this matter up with corporate
