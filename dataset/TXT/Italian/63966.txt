BcLFIr4wtd3GQ3fnz15yDQ I went here for brunch this past Sunday with a group of friends.  Let me start by saying how great the space is....bright, roomy...the perfect place for brunch.  The service is also excellent.  Our waitress was to the point but very good at her job and clearly was concerned about making sure that everything was perfect.   In terms of food, we started by sharing the Italian doughnuts and ricotta pancakes.  The doughnuts were fresh and tasty but nothing spectacular however the pancakes were excellent.  For my meal I ordered the frittata with stew meat, however, since they were out of beef they substituted crab.  It was tasty but a little too crabby/fishy in flavor than I would have liked.  My wife had the eggs with arbiatta sauce which I tried and thought were excellent.  I would love to come back here for dinner sometime soon.
