9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg One of my favourite restaurants! I'm actually planning to have my birthday dinner here this year. It has a great environment and I love the decor. It's great if you're planning a group dinner. The food is FANTASTIC! The mozzarella is made from scratch right in the restaurant and you can actually watch the chefs making it! They have a great selection of appetizers, pizzas and pastas. Prices are very reasonable. Can't wait to go back!
