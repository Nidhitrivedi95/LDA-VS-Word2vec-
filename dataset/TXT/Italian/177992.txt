NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA Stopped in on a whim. The 2 of us sat at the bar. Our bartender was Dan. Very nice guy. We had the mussels to start and they were very good. Then we split a Primavera pizza...all I can say is WOW. It was very good.  Mascarpone cheese, asparagus and prosciutto. The crust was very good, with great flavor from the brick oven. The food was reasonably priced.  They have a few outdoor tables too, but it was a little too warm when we got there. Highly recommend, great place to take a date..
