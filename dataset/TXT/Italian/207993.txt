QnfAHUr5-HTiaA5-va3glQ My sister, brother-in-law and I just got back from having an early dinner at Streets of New York. We're originally from Chicago and have really missed the broasted chicken that was a staple there. The broasters at SONY are even better than the chicken we used to get back home. Our server, Sterling, made our dining experience even better. He greeted us as soon as we walked in, gave us menus and took our drink order almost immediately after we were seated. He was very pleasant and attentive. He's definitely an asset to this restaurant. We ordered potato skin appetizers that were some of the best I've had. Our chicken and broasted potatoes were piping hot. The chicken was moist and delicious and the potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft and tasty on the inside. I have a feeling we'll be spending lots of time at this restaurant.
