72_6srKAdZPSHCGNwK2Hfg Thanks to the Yelp community, as we came from Newmarket and them from Hamilton, this place looked to be half way. This place is on the ground floor of a new condo across the street from Humber Bay Park. We shared appetizers, 2 person antipasti and grilled calamari and shrimp, both were excellent. For my main, had the beef tenderloin (I know what's with that, at a Italian restaurant ) with a mushroom cream sauce, again very good and very rich. Asked for pasta instead of the vegs and it was so so. Shared a banana cake of some sort and it was fantastic! They do not take reservations and by 7 o'clock Sat. nite, waiting room only. Being across the street from the lake with a great view of the city, will try it in the summer, if I can find a parking spot.
