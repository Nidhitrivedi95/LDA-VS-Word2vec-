This place is super busy on weekends and since they don't take reservations it is always hard to go here in large groups. However, the staff is super friendly and will happily serve up beers and wine with a fun filled conversation in the lobby while you wait. The wait is worth it. The Mozzarella in Carrozza comes drenched in their all so yummy marinara. This is a dreamy concoction that can be best described as just loads of flavor in each bite where the fresh mozzarella blends with the crunchy texture of the bread and the tangy marinara that has the natural sweetness of vine ripened tomatoes. You will want to get that plate clean with the fresh bread they have at the table which is a nice good hearty crusted loaf with a tender white inside. My personal favorite is the Pollo Parmigiana with substituting the angel hair pasta for fettuccine Alfredo. They put on a big smile to accommodate changes. If you are in for a sweet tooth, then their cannoli's are authentic and fresh, and they are Italian sized. None of that wannabe dessert size here. The penne ala vodka is equally delectable, the sauce is simply unique and if you are a vodka sauce fan then theirs is definitely very zesty and flavorful. Love this place and the folks who run it. Always smiling and always cheerful. I think a ton of love goes into the food they serve, I always see people leaving with big grins and just amazed that this little place exists in our neighborhood.
