WLzXQunB0L0H5VOqLEVbhQ I owned three pizzeria back east and I know what good pizza tastes like I wanted to try this fast food  of pizza just to see how bad it was and it did live up to my expectations... I felt I was eating a sponge the sauce tasted sour and I think they use that phony baloney plastic cheese... For the life of me I don't know how they stay in business there's just a lot of people out there that do not know what a good pizza taste like
