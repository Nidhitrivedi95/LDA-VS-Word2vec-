5sZyYGQH4k-WwvVJk_LIvQ I made a reservation for my husband and l. The food was tasty but it was really expensive and the portion sizes were extremely tiny for that price! 
What made me really upset was that when I called l asked the guy if they did anything special for anniversaries and he said he would give us a slice of cake and sing for us and asked if that would be ok. 
Everything was ok until the server brought our bill!!! I went over to the front desk and the man who spoke to me was not only rude but also impatient!! I was trying to tell him what the person who took my reservation said but he cut me short and said "oh no you have to pay for the cake!!" 
That would not have been an issue if they told me that when I called and actually remembered to sing for us!!! I was mad but still wanted to surprise my husband so I paid for the cake! 
When I wrote a review the manager called and told us to go for coffee and desert so he could fix it for us, the greeter treated us like we were lying when I told him who sent us and even wanted to see the email!! 
He told us the manager was busy after driving for 20min to get there!!! 
Will not be going over for any other occasion l got $20 service after spending $100!!!
