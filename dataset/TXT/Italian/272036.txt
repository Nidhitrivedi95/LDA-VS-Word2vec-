XT25YpQoNDuzAZHur-HZ8g If you like saucy pizza, this is where it's at. 

Pizzeria Libretto specializes in Neapolitan pizza. 

Libretto has a great $15 pre-fixe lunch deal from 11:00 am - 3:00 pm. You get a choice of either their Beet Caprese Salad or Arugula Salad as an appetizer. Your main is a choice of Margherita or Marinara pizza. You can also pay a little extra for additional toppings. Dessert is either gelato (1 scoop) or biscotti (3 pieces). 

My favourite pizza here is the Margherita pizza. 

Dinner is also reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a casual dinner especially after work if you work in the financial district. 

Tip: Libretto allows takeout on their $15 pre-fixe lunch deal.
