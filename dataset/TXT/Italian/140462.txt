JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw Chinato has been really hard for me to review. I'd say it should probably have four stars at least by "objective" and/or "foodie" standards. However, it wasn't my type of place. This is just my opinion!

I am really into old-school, old-fashioned, traditional Italian restaurants. Chinato is modern in decor, menu selection, and presentation. The menu is very electic and almost bordering on ridiculous in a way. There's a load of tongues, livers, and at least one if not two items in each section that I have never even heard of. Not to say that the adventurous type should not partake. But it's a little too esoteric for an "everyday" type of dining experience. I could totally see the cast of Top Chef being asked to cook here and use only the kitchen's ingredients. Putting it simply: they don't have lasagna, spaghetti and meatballs, or chicken parm here.

I don't mean to sound like a bumpkin, nor do I wish to complain about Chinato in the least. Everything was very elegant. We were treated very well (however, since they were busy, drink orders took much too long to come out - even just a sparkling water, which I asked for 3 times by 3 different people before finally getting it). We had a large group for a business dinner and they accommodated us nicely (of course, make a reservation, even on a weeknight).

The portions were a bit small, too. The salad was great, but pretty much the size of my palm. The half-orders of pasta were truly half-sized, if not smaller. I was a bit disappointed in the tomato/basil gnocchi because it seemed to be drowning in butter and oil, with just a finely shaved sprinkle of basil and a few teenily-diced tomatoes.  

Ok, maybe I AM complaining (sorry). It's just that if you want your thick, red sauces, your big hunks o' meat, and your bowls overflowing with pasta, this isn't really the place for you.
