JogUSDKa1xyG3lLEmD4Xjg Fiamma gets 3.5 stars from me on this outing.  My prior two outings would have netted it a 4+.  Stay with me thorough the good and I'll tell you a little story.

This gem is located in an unlikely strip mall but once inside it's clear that one shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  All white tablecloth chic with lovely place settings and an elegant presentation.  For a small place, it knows how to use the space well.  The staff is welcoming and accommodating given we were a party of 12 and not everyone arrived quite at our reservation time.

Appetizers and salads were great. While it's nothing really sexy, I love Insalata Caprese and this was superb - no doubt due to use of the absolutely freshest ingredients. The mozzarella was amazing.

On to Chilean Sea Bass which I loved.  Pan-seared with just the right crispness on the outside, delicate and flaky on the inside.  Wonderful preparation.

Most of the rest of our group seemed to really enjoy their meals, with special emphasis on the Osso Bucco, which was described as tender, flavorful and worthy of eating every bite.  Nice wine list - all Italian I believe.

The Bad (well, really bad I guess). Upon being seated, we were welcomed by a bug of the very worst kind for a restaurant.  The staff took care of the matter while our group considered our options to leave/stay.  In retrospect, maybe we should have left and you're thinking you would definitely have turned tail.  But I think many restaurants have seen a bug or two given all the food around and do their utmost to ensure cleanliness (95 rating here).  I dunno - we were a bit grossed out but stayed anyway.  The management was extremely accommodating,  Complimentary sparkling wine, several dessert trays, no charge on our drinks/wine - and obviously new seating.  Our server could not have been more knowledgeable.

I'd go back again so perhaps that's an endorsement worth considering.

Bon appetit!
