nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Huge fan of Buddy and his family and this restaurant did not disappoint. The bread they bring you is delicious. Our waiter (wish I got his name) was extremely kind and made small conversation with us which I loved. I got the cheese ravioli and it was amazing. My mother got the meat lasagna which was absolutely amazing. Definitely recommend that. My brother got the scallops and fell in love with it. The portions weren't huge (the turkey lasagna was a pretty good portion but the ravioli and scallops weren't huge), but were very filling! We had Canolis and lobster tails for dessert which were amazing. We had a great experience and it was 100 % worth it. So good in fact we are going back tomorrow for brunch!
