zfOum9_rEhaLAqoAV3nYaQ The food is delicious!!!  I am craving it right now!  It definitely makes you want to come back again and again.  I have been back again and again and it is consistent.  It is not a typical middle eastern restaurant.  With lovely soothing ambiance, friendly service, and extremely fresh flavorful food, I give this restaurant 5 stars.
