caq9CTtWB-8K0tdFUhTfAQ Food was great! Pasta's are super fresh. However we waited for an hour. But I guess that's a compliment to them that they are so busy. 

I just have no patience and don't like waiting.  I also don't think they take reservations. That's what one of our friends told us. 

Great place to have in Vaughan and you feel like your in Italy. I really like the authentic glasses we had our wine in. 

I do recommend if you go mid week rather than weekend.
