UBW3Asjmih0nARbBNK3oEA Came here for an espresso at night before going out. Didn't try the food.

The espresso was really good. This would be an ideal place to go for an evening coffee date if you order something espresso-based. I didn't try a latte though so I'm not sure how good they are at those, but for espresso and I'm assuming americano as well, they'd be a good spot.

The hot chocolate tastes like some no-name brand powder where you add water.

Based on the other reviews I WOULD NOT go for food here. It's never crossed my mind. Espresso is great though.
