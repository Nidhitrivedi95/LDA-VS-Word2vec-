nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow Sat outside on a very pleasant day.  Menu is not extensive, but good.  Nice complementary Italian bread is fresh.  Mussels are a nice appetizer.  Salads tasty, especially with house Italian dressing.  Gnocchi is excellent.  Ordering with shrimp adds protein, but not much else.  Would probably order without.  Wine list is short and sweet.  Desserts are good.  Tiramisu served in a parfait glass, but tasty.  Service is spotty.  Our server was slow, but nearby server was very active.  Portion size is generous for entrees.  You will be taking food home.  Overall good, but not excellent.  Very pleasant experience.
