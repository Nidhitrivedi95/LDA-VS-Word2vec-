PKjdnTWQSygpOjlWl8VzrQ Great food. We've visited several times with similar experiences each time. 
Wood fired grill for the pizza and steaks. They recently added a bar with wine, beer and I believe liquor. The small menu is all excellent. We've had the salad, steaks, pasta, calimari, pizza, and all are excellent. Not a big place, but a great date atmosphere in the bar side area. It's quaint and quiet. Other side is like a pizza parlor with ice cream as well. Great spot for family with kids. Same food on both sides. 
The service is excellent and the chef will likely come out and talk with you. 
Seriously good steaks, better than other local high priced steak houses. 
I hope they don't change. Keep the menu small and stick with what they do well. 
We will continue to visit.
