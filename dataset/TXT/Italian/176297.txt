NhMEvtG8TA6AnCLFC63v_A I would like to start this review by stating that I love and support locally owned businesses. Annie's is not a cookie cutter meal like Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill, it seems to be a local family owned restaurant. For this reason is why the food may take longer than those big chain restaurants, because it is probably made fresh to order. 

My wife and I enjoyed our dinner at Annie's, the servers were very pleasant and attentive. We ordered the Meatball Scampi as an appetizer, and oh wow what flavor!!! The meatballs were so tender and fluffy, covered with chopped garlic and butter and served with two pieces of bread to soak up all that sauce. I would seriously have to have this with my last meal!!! For the main dish my wife ordered the pasta primavera and I had the baked rigatoni with sausage. Both dishes were great, I would recommend them to anyone with plans to visit Annie's.

Is Annie's the best Italian I have ever eaten? No it's not, but it ranks right up with some good ones. So it took almost an hour for us to have some bread, an appetizer, salad and our main dish. We never went with an empty glass for an extended period of time and we were made to feel right at home by our server. Food cooked fresh to order is a different animal and we understand and accept it. Remember, slow down, enjoy the experience and lets support small local businesses!!
