Zja7ykq3icDzkN20XX6j1w Good pie.  In a side by side comparison with Mineos, it comes in a close second.  However they are nothing alike.  The sauce is heavier, obvious of a good (great) quality tomato.  There is also a mystery spice in there...they wouldn't tell me.  Marjoram?  Thyme?  The cheese drier, more mozzarella and maybe little to no provolone.  Pepperoni rolls were good. Subtle in flavor, very nice crust.  White pizza was excellent.  Not over garlicky, same great crust.
