BaVtTt9pBoI8rrN35tsj_g Things I liked
- Put out little snacks for people waiting due to long line
- Portions were very large
- Can't beat breadsticks/salad
- Waitress was nice and accommodating

Things I didn't like
- No toilet paper in the men's bathroom
- They don't take reservations
- Chicken in the fettucine alfredo tasted like it had been frozen and the fettucine was stuck to itself
- Herb grilled salmon was overcooked and the parmesan garlic broccoli did not have much parmesan or garlic, this dish was essentially a piece of salmon with  1/2 a pound of steamed broccoli
