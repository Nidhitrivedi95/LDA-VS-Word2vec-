D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA I went back over the weekend with a few girl friends and I just have to say I am (once again) thoroughly impressed! It was pretty busy on Saturday (they let us know they were running 30 minutes behind), but the staff are so friendly and accommodating it's amazing! They have fun with the patrons and also each other while maintaining professionalism and urgency when the hustle and bustle was on and poppin!! Haha. We had a great time with the staff, Dominick (sp?) in particular was a riot! Everyone enjoyed their meals, myself included. Love the penny check-in shots they offer via Yelp! Definitely a fan!
