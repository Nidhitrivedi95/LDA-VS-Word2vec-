z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ What an amazing addition to downtown dining.  I ended up here for a work meeting on Wednesday night because the lighting at nearby Vic & Anthony's is far too dim to read by.  I made a reservation for 3, and despite arriving a little late, we were seated right away.  The privacy we requested was easily accommodated by the big booth that basically encloses your group.  The lighting was much better than Vic's and we were able to review documents and discuss work without any interruptions.  We did manage to enjoy ourselves though.  

Now let's talk about the goods.  Service was flawless from start to finish.  Our waiter looked like he stepped out of the pages of a Little Italy tour book.  He was authentic Italian New Yorker and very helpful.  When we asked for antipasto suggestions, he recommended the sausage and peppers.  I would never have ordered this otherwise, and this dish was amazing!  Spicy grilled peppers, onions and homemade sausage.  Had a great spiciness that was tempered by the sweetness of the peppers.  I had the tableside Caesar salad (2 people must order), mainly because I just love seeing anything prepared at the table.  In addition to the fun presentation, the salad was probably one of the best caesars I've ever had.  Instead of chopping up the romaine, you get full romaine leaves which are tossed in the homemade dressing (made right in front of you) and the croutons are very fresh.  Definitely a must.  

For my entrée, I had the 8 oz filet.  It was perfectly cooked, but by this point, I had to box half of it because I was stuffed.  We also ordered the truffled potatoes as a side dish.  I thought they were incredibly rich, but delicious.  Wonderful experience.  At the risk of being struck by lightning, if you are in the neighborhood, I may have to recommend Joe Vicari's over Hugo's Cellar.
