znH36RmIAI4wcHy9WiEO5Q Delicious food! We got the bread combo and the arancini to start.  I haven't had arancini that tasty in years. I had the chicken parm, it was so tender I didn't even need a knife to cut it.  My wife had the soup and a steak salad and said both were delicious. The tiramisu was amazing.  All the portions were very large. 
 The staff was wonderful. Our waitress Natalie was sweet and very knowledgeable about the food and drinks. She even recommended a new way for me to enjoy my dirty martinis.

We will definitely be back.
