Vf64uaRzgdsCSCRUJDcsHw When I first walked into Daddy Dukes it was before St. Patrick's Day and they had the place decked out in shamrocks and lots of green.  I wasn't sure about how quality food could be with a Christmas tree decorated in everything Irish and was quite skeptical. 

BUT my fears were put to rest when not only did they serve Coke products (a big must with my family), but their pizza and antipasto were delicious!  Giant pizzas that could easily have fed more than the 6 of us that were there!  We go two to share between all of us and we got to take some home, and it was a tasty treat the next morning for breakfast (cold, as left over pizza should be in my opinion). 

My parents, my fiance's dad and his fiance, and my fiance and I enjoyed the place so much we decided to have our rehearsal dinner there!  And they went above and beyond to make sure the party was delightful!  During the first weekend of 2012 to hit 100 degrees (thank you Phoenix) we enjoyed pizza, salad, and wings.  (I don't personally like wings, but most everyone in the group was covered in sauce and going back for more, so they must have been good!) 

I look forward to going back to try other dishes they have to offer, but can safely say their pizza is delectable!
