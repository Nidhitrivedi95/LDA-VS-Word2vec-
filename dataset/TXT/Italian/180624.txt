NvG2KYObJujUeswSDmww_w Came in a couple of times with my wife, wanting to have a local favorite bar in anthem, summer 2014. I can say after several uncomfortable experiences we won't be coming back.
The chicken and salmon skewers as well as the vines burger was often overcooked, and at that, nothing to get excited about. The best part of the burger were the fries, which were more than likely store bought. The skewers sat in a warm goo that overpowers the chicken by being too sweet and tasting cheap. The wine was fair, they have a decent selection albeit a little overpriced. 
The servers there were all over the place. Andrea, while nice enough, tried to be welcoming and polite, but was intrusive and shouted at us from across the bar. And Whitney, what a joke. She had a scowl on her face the whole time, gave our wallets more attention than us, and let our food sit in the back (there's a little window into the kitchen) until we asked if that was our food. Lastly, she would scold and bark at one the busboy, saying all manner of things that he was the reason she was behind on our orders... He was doing dishes and washing windows while she was on her phone. Lastly, for the "Red Party" they had, it seemed cheap, overstaffed, and the owners sat in the corner drinking and eating for a lot of the night. Lastly, we remember hearing two servers tall about food code violations and that they worried about an inspector coming in. That was why we didn't come back in the end.
I will say that the male server (forgot his name, had a beard) was very friendly and got everything out to us on one of the busier nights. All in all, if you're in the mood to drink at a dirty bar (not for a date) and watch a poorly coordinated and clumsy staff give you a sub par meal, Wild Vines is the place to go.
