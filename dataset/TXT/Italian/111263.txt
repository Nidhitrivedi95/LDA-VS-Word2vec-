G099MT9cwtwgdsR71JLp6w Excellent. I ate my first Italian sandwich here for lunch. For $10.95, you get the sandwich + soup or salad. A solid lunch deal. I ordered the pepper panino, and it was an utter delight! Portion size and taste were both there. 

The space is quaint and relaxing, making it ideal for a group of people to stay a while and linger or for one to grab a solo meal (can eat at the bar). The lunch hour I was there for got pretty busy, however, and there was one waitress attending to folks. I was there in a group of seven, and I think it took 35-40 minutes for the food to come out. Don't expect a quick meal here. It is quality though. 

One of the places I will return to in future Madison visits. As long as you have some time, make your way to Osteria for a fantastic lunch!
