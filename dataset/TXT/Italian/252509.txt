VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Lavo! (for nightclub) Not bad, not bad at all!

Went for Halloween night with my girlfriends. Two group of guys tried to group with us because they thought that they would be able to get into the nightclub faster.... and then issues arise. 

Girls: "Oh gaawwwwd.... (where's the girls only line?)"
Guys: *fight fight, we got here first, blah blah blah*
Girls: "Oh look! So and so is getting us in because she found us the all girls line!" "BYE GUYS HAVE FUN HAH!"
Guys: *got owned*

We walked in and were were directed straight to a table somewhere... by the DJs. Nice! We were kicked out of the area after awhile though because the tables were actually "reserved" for people who paid money for it. HAH! ok, no problem but thanks for letting us dance around your area in the meantime :D.

We walked around, got some drinks, played some guys, got some more drinks, had enough drinks, got more drinks, then some gangster looking dudes grabbed my hand and invited me to his table. I grabbed a handful of girlfriends to follow me and keep me safe (but at the same time thought it was a good thing, I'm pretty sure my girlfriends are tired of standing around and would like to sit down and enjoy some more drinks). OMG AZNpRyD3 Table. 

It was so Asian... Let me tell you (those who are from San Jose). I felt like I was at Lion Plaza on Chinese/Vietnamese new year. Or at one of those Vietnamese coffee shops. HAHAHA.  Oh man, so funny. I lost them in the crowd, or they got the hint when we went to "dance".

Bartenders are wonderful and beautiful. The staff here are VERY nice. :) I don't mind coming here again, it's a very nice venue. I thought the music was better than XS, but just like XS they started playing trance towards the end of the night...
