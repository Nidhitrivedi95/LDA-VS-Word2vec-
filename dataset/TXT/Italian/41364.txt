7o4SWZDKYHYfv6X0U21ErQ Went with a delightful business group. Service/server, bread, cleanliness, ambiance, promptness, basically everything was on par! But the food was mediocre. Pasta was a little soggy. Not bad. But not quite a 4. But everything else was amazing, which personally to me is equally as important or even more! Solid experience.
