Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA Overall a good place to eat. Not too fancy or over the top. Service was ok. I ended up sitting in the outside of the restaurant which was ok next time I would ask for inside. Reason being its distracting and we ended up having some people just poke their head over and started talking to us. 

Good food and pricing was reasonable. I would recommend this place but if your looking for 4 or 5 star dining I won't recommend this particular place. Just my two cents.  Enjoy!
