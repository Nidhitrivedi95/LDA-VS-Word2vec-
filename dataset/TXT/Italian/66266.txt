bNNF6Z91L7Omfdi8QSo2_w Staff is friendly for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Even when they're busy there is good service which is what you get when you eat at a five diamond property with a four star star restaurant. They change their menu enough to keep a frequent guest interested. I truly think the mussels and beef tenderloin are absolutely a must have for dinner! Brian, one of the managers, will always take great care of you if you have any concerns or needs. It's definitely a place worth trying, so try it!!!!
