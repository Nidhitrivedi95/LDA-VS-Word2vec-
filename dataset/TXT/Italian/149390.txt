kihL3ob1VOlAaGNeJ0fClw I am eating it as I type this..

I am so unhappy with this pizza. 14 dollars, just wasted. Delivery guy had to call me to find me, because someone put the address in wrong. Took extra time. 

Pizza cheese is so rubbery.. Just awful. Sauce is chunky.. Boring... 

I feel bad that my friends, I invited at my party has to eat this...  next time Frozen pizza...   :(
