qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ Best wings in the East Valley if not Arizona.  We have been there twice now, the thin crust pizza first time, excellent pizza, might also be #1 but at least #2 on my list and yesterday had the Chicken Parm which also is excellent.  The flavor of the sauce is outstanding.  This is actually a 5+ rating.  Most definitely going back.  It's our new favorite Italian Restaurant.  Special KUDOS to the owner Tony, who remembered us from the previous visit and welcomed us back.  Extremely friendly and customer "satisfaction" trained staff.

This is one of the best and friendliest restaurants I have ever been too.
