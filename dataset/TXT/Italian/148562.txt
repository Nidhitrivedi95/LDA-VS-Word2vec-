kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg Love the atmosphere! Great looking spot with wall of wine bottles-very unique. Have been here twice- once mid-day on a Sunday at bar w/ my hubby. Tapa platter (or something similar) was fantastic. Today went to meet gf for late lunch. Ordered Cobb Salad- portion rather large & unfortunately a totally 'wet' salad. I finished half...for that & an iced tea, $18 w/ tip--with so many classy options in Summerlin, including the original Grape Cafe on Mead/Buffalo, others will be my choice next time. Will certainly stop for a drink when in DTS. Am hoping for a better experience in a few weeks...
