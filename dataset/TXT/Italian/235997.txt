Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA Love this place! The vibe is chill and the staff is great. We ordered the federal chop salad and a pepperoni with arugula pizza. All very good! Sat outside and our server was awesome. Two other diners had small dogs that were cute and well behaved so I'm guessing Federal is pet friendly. I saw that they gave water bowls to the dogs. Will be a go to when in Phoenix for sure!
