Q6DIU2OnvBUo7KJ3rdjM-w I came in just to have a small lunch after a busy morning. I didn't want a lot of food so I ordered two slices of cheese pizza. While one of the employees was getting the pizza from the hot box one of the slices ripped and she gave be both slices. She gave me 3 total which made up for the ripped but still edible pizza. I come here occasionally because it is close. Not my favorite pizza, but when Im in the mood for barros I'll always visit here for the friendly staff and good pizza.
