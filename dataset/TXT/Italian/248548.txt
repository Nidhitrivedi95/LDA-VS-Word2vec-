VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ Went back thinking, "why not it's been about a year, time to see if this place has changed." The answer to that is no it has not. I honestly don't know why they have a pool table when all the sticks are broken and neither table has a pool rack. So I went and watched a game at a table. The first chair I sat in had a small tear, thankfully there was another nearby which didn't have the same problem.

The bartenders were alright, but they are nothing to write home about and they seemed to be always rushing. I never felt like anything other than another guy in seat, especially after I went through $20.00 in a machine at the bar and got asked, "are you still playing?" I answered, "not right now," and immediately got asked to move down.

I get it the machines are reserved for players, hence the placard on them. But it hadn't even been more than five minutes since I blew that $20.00. I finished my beer and left. Maybe one day this place will be alright, I'm just not holding my breath any more.
