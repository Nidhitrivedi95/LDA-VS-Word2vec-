Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA I have eaten here a few times and I am always reminded on why I don't eat here as often. As a former native NYer  I love eating pizza. The pizza here is just ok. Nothing extraordinary. In fact it lacks  real NY flavor. However my issue isn't with the pizza but more with the price . At $4.16 a slice ,it's way over priced. The only time I ever paid for an over priced pizza is in Manhattan. This location in Vegas so it's not justified by any means.
They even have a slice special like they used to. At least you felt your getting something.
My suggestion at $4.16 it should include a small drink or make the pizza so amzing it justifies the price.
In fact there is other pizza places near by that offer 2 slices and a drink for around 5 bucks.
