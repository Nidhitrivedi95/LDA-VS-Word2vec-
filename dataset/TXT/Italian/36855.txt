6xHAfmlqlpjm9retP20woQ I have to write a review for Jimmy John's customer service because I am always so impressed!  Their sandwiches are lackluster - especially the vegetarian one - but their 5 star staff makes up for it.

The staff here always goes above and beyond - they are always quick, efficient, and do little things that end up making a big difference.  For example, I've had to order box lunches for office meetings several times. When taking my order over the phone, the person will ask me what name they can write on the bag for that particular item - that way, I do not have to go through each box, opening up the sandwich, trying to figure out who gets what back at the office - genius! And so simple...

When they were doing their special $1 sandwich promotion, I decided to stop by, even though the line was out the door and several stores down.  My cheapness kicked in, and I was ready to spend my whole lunch break waiting in 110 degree heat - but Jimmy John's wouldn't let that happen! I had was inside and had my sandwich within 12 minutes. Super impressed! The manager also gave me one of their pickles for free when  I told him I had never tried them.

Keep up the good work, JJs, but maybe add a little more "meat" to the veggie sandwich...
