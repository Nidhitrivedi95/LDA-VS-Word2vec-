DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw If you want to get away from the strip go to this restaurant for delicious Italian food.. Two of my all time favorites are mozzarella and tomato and fried calamari, both are quite sumptuous at this restaurant. I tasted my friends gnocchi and that was wonderful but I had to order the Osso Bucco which is their specialty and I was not disappointed. The meat was tasty and tender but I can't do the marrow though I hear it is very tasty. I will definitely be back to try the pasta!
