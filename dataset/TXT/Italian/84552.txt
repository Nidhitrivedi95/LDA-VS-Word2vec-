DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA I went here because it was on Gordon Ramsay's show.

My roommate roommate and I are 28 y/o males.

I thought the show might be kind of staged... but no. I saw the owner (the guy) be very rude to a costumer wanting a specific kind of cake. It was entertaining and probably made the experience worthwhile 

The menu did not appeal to either of us. Not much I wanted to eat, but that could just be our style in food.

I ordered the burger just like Ramsay did on the show. He was right. It was way too "juicy" and the bun fell apart. Gross. It had a bad flavor and the burger "juice" was all over the place.

I would give a C-. My roommate had a C- meal as well. 

It was a fun experience, but food could be found better almost anywhere!
