mDiFWhywAziq9SKnj6am_Q What a wonderful little treasure to discover.  With a great personality and a versatile menu, Ziggys is a great place to spend an evening. From the wonderful homemade bread served before dinner to the excellent flavors of all 4 dishes ordered we had not one complaint. They have a good beer and wine selection and even offer entertainment. So if you are looking for a nice evening out, this is the place for you.
