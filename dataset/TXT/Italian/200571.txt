The panzerotti are amazing, the cheese is so hot and fresh when it comes out. 

Fettuccine Alfredo is on another level. As is the penne a la vodka. 

The chicken wings fly under the radar but they're legitimately as good/bigger/tastier than Allstars. Try them out next time you're there. 

Whenever I want a quick, amazing meal I head here.
