qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA We almost walked away... My dad wasn't impressed with its size nor its quaint decor, but I can be persistent and with the help of yelp we did circle back around and sit down. Thank you Jesus!

It is a tiny establishment with but a few tables inside sight eh majority of the others lined up out front where people pass you by often checking out the sights and stores of the mall but you soon get over that once the food starts being delivered in the quickest fashion I have ever seen. We had at least two waiters working our tables, making sure we had all we needed. The wine was a bit expensive, only a few we're offered by the glass, but my nevola was damn try and perfect with my entry.

The food... The food... Ummm... Wow... The pillow-like garlic knots buttered to perfection, the 3 large filet minon meatballs in a red sauce that fell apart in your mouth, and the stuffed to bursting lobster ravioli with actual chunks of lobster inside covered in a creamy vodka sauce were all just too perfect. I'm soo glad we stopped, even my dad who went healthy for this particular meal was impressed with the large thin-cut swordfish covered with olives aNd tomatoes in a white wine sauce and large helping of squash And zucchini left him a bit impressed too. Yay! 

The food made it worth the time we spent trying find this tiny little gem but for 5 stars the ambience and overall dining experience need to be top notch and this place just really needs a new location in a much bigger area so that all the tables could be inside and not in the main mall hallway.
