l2Gfm3CA20iCBCBt_GNdDA We've been to Jimmy's of Chicago several times.  We are originally from Chicago so we are always searching for a restaurant that makes us feel like we are back home.  Jimmy's 100% fills that gap.  

Their pizza is Chicago style thin crust pizza.  It's the perfect amount of cheese and sauce.    It's cut into squares which always makes me smile.   

The ambiance is the major reason to come back to Jimmy's between the pictures on the wall, the bar that looks authentic and the clientele during a Blackhawks game, you will forget that you are in Arizona. Plus you can't beat having a red and white checkered tablecloth! 

I would highly recommend Jimmy's if you are looking for a Chicago restaurant and have a taste for thin crust pizza!
