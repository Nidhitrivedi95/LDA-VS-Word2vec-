dSnQTUJC0tCHadU1AGzvrw Wow!   I am not sure what happened to this place.  Very different than after it first opened.  Apparently they are content to rely on the beautiful location.  That really was the only positive.  We have been here before and were happy with it, bu this was a very disapointing Mothers Day visit.  So so food at best and terrible, terrible service  Who trains the staff here?  Not sure if we will return.  We certainly will not be referring our friends anymore.  So sorry...Did the original owner depart?
