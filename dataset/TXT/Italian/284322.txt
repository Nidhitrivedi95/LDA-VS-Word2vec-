zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA Just like everyone else, the food is really very good. I had eggplant parm and my husband had a calzone. Walking in we were seated at a dirty table, we asked one of the waitresses to clean it off and since she saw we got sprayed with cleaner she let us know it was a mild disinfectant. From there it took 15 minutes to get drinks, my salad never arrived and it took 45 minutes for food and an additional 10 minutes to eat (we were never given silverware). Once we had them remove the invisible salad off the bill, we let them know how horrible the service was. 

Definetly get take out, the food is worth it but the service is not!
