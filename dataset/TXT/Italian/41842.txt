7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Came here this morning at 9am for breakfast.  Lady Marmalade exceeded our expectations.  First off, the coffee was delicious and strong(!), definitely cafe quality, not the usual watered-down diner stuff.  They had 4 choices for freshly squeezed juices, we opted for the apple juice for my daughter. We ordered eggs benny and huevos migas as our mains.  Both were cooked perfectly and delicious. The salsa verde which they had in the tiny little squeeze bottle was AMAZING.

I would like to address people who downgrade restaurants for being "pricey".  Lady Marmalade uses organic ingredients when possible and the cooked our dishes perfectly.  For about $13, it was a total bargain in my eyes. Consider other things along with the price before you write a review.
