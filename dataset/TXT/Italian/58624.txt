I had the shrimp Diablo pasta, and he had the pesto penne bake- both were incredible! The shrimp Diablo was creamy and spicy and wonderful- a large portion but not so large that it's impossible to eat. His pesto penne bake was cheesy and delicious, served in a bread bowl- his was also a really good size portion. The server we had was a new-bee, you could tell he was nervous, but he served our table of 6 quickly and without issue, I wish I had gotten his name so I could give him credit!
