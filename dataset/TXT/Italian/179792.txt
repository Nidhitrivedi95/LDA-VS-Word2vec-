nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A My wife and I was at Buddy V'S on 10/3/14 I had Lasagna, which was good but it could of been better with more red sauce, the portion was great the price was high 27.00, the Focaccia bread was outstanding, they put us right in front of where they cook and there was a lot of noise, our server did a great job!!
