oJSa5HCiZXKLXxggQmecEQ My wife and I visit Campagnolo regularly and we are happy to say that it is our favourite restaurant.  We've only had Chef's tasting menu and there has never been any disappointment with any of their dishes.  From the bread to the dessert, every step of the way has been small bits of happiness adding to one big one.  My wife's favourite is the burrata cheese with warm grapes and my favourite is the perfectly prepared al dente spaghetti.  $60/person is a great value for the quality of the meal and pleasant evening you'll have at Campagnolo's.
