3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A Came here for the first time for a Christmas work party with a group of seven at 5:30 in the evening on a Friday (reservations for any size group is probably best, obviously). 

Our server was attentive and very knowledgeable about the wines and dishes, and helped our table pick out a white and a red. Her descriptions of the wines and dishes would make anyone salivate! 

For starters we ordered the artisinal cheese and meat platters. At first the platters may seem small but are more than enough for a group of seven to share, including the wonderful rosemary bread they bring to the table. 

For mains we each ordered a pasta dish. Oh man you have no idea about these pasta dishes!. The homemade pasta will make you question why you ever ate or thought boxed pasta was good! (says the person who will continue to eat boxed pasta because she still has student loans to pay off). 

One of our group had only one criteria, something that was entirely vegan (the restaurant also has vegetarian options). The chef was entirely accommodating and the server came back with a potato gnocchi with mixed vegetables dish. It looked delicious and apparently was! I myself ordered Bucatini all'Amatriciana which was fantastic! The flavour of the cured meat that was cooked until crispy was the best part of every bite, and the tomato sauce had just the right about of spiciness/heat that it didn't overwhelm the dish.  In one word it was perfect. 

For dessert they had a selection of sweet wines and coffee. I ordered the eggnog tiramisu, which was the only thing I found disappointing out of the whole evening. The ladyfingers used in the dessert were drenched in coffee (espresso?) so much so that they were mush and  it left a layer of liquid at the bottom of the jar the dessert came with an overpowering taste of coffee. But this is such a minor thing compared to everything else!

Enoteca Sociale is definitely a place with fantastic food and good atmosphere.
