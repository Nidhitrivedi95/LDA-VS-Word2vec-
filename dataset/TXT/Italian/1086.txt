-CLTZ0cO-ooKDDmXHFoGMg Pi Co is my favourite place for margherita pizzas near downtown. It's fast, fresh, and great value. You can customize your toppings and also make the crust gluten free. 

The crust is cooked to perfection - great charred flavours. They could put a bit more mozzarella, but in all, great taste and great price. 

Perfect spot for a quick lunch or snack.
