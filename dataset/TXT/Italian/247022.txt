v5YvCuj_b26JKAqDcnReFQ I had an hour to kill, so I stopped by this little restaurant. It was so warm and welcoming. I asked the waitress for suggestions and she recommended the linguini with butter and garlic with sun dried tomatoes.. I wish I could remember her name, but I did thank her for that awesome suggestion it was beyond delicious!! And service was awesome too! I will return to try another awesome suggestion
