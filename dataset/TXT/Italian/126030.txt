HrR_2-HUE6cqnoz1zMN9AQ This is the best casual Italian restaurant in Charlotte. Menu has a little bit of everything from appetizers to dessert and everything in between. Everything on the menu is excellent. I have tried them all. You can't go wrong. The wine selection is also excellent and reasonable. The owner and staff are friendly and very helpful. If you go once, you will be going back.
