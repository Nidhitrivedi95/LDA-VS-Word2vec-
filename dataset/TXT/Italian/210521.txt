qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ I encourage the owner to equip a pair of tweezers, and remove the olive slices from a large pizza. Does the sum of those slices equal 2 olives or more? How about mushroom slices. I would bet that there's no more than one entire mushroom on the entire pizza. It sure must be a great feeling, charging loyal customers $2 for a single mushroom. Razor thin sausage slices, bits of onions and green peppers... all the same. All 5 toppings could be fit into something the size of a golf ball. Lackluster at best. And the reviews suggest that this place is something special. Get real. I went here because some east coasters recommended it. Now, I'm going to make it a point to tell everyone how awful it is. By the way, the sausage is fine grained and doesn't have flavor. The meatballs are like firm Chef Boy R D meatballs, same taste. The sauce is most likely from a can, no care given to it. To any disbelievers, get a pair of tweezers and Prove me otherwise. Everything I said here is true and measurable. Before ordering, just ask to see a slice, and make sure you're happy with what's going on.
