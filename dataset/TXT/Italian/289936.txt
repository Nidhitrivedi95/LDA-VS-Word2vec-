zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA Great food! Tried something different this visit.  Ordered pizza I know it's not that original but usually get pasta dish.  Very good .  NExt time hungry for pizza will be ordering from here for sure. Not sure why took me so long to try the pizza.  Crust nice and crunchy .  Husband order his usual cheesesteak sandwich. I can never get him to try anything new.  The  homemade chips are so good you have to try them. You will order sandwich just to get the chipsl
