IjsLANGkmAqCsF6-zgIA8w im not one to complain but DJ Steve SUCKED.... as a regular dj he knew how to keep the music going but for a family/wedding that likes newer club (turn up) music he did not do well. he nagged us for 3 weeks to compose a list of songs and once we sent it to him on the day of our wedding only two..that's right 2 songs from our whole list of at least 200 songs were played the whole reception. many of our family and guest started to leave 2 hours before the reception was over because nobody was feeling the music. he completely ruined our wedding reception. 

THANKS FOR RUINING OUR SPECIAL DAY.....

if you like newer party music then PLEASE do not waste your money.
