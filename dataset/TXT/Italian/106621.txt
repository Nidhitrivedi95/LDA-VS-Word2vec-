FTVDICd-uxoEGYh4pU0pcw TLDR: average pizza prepared New York style. 

Pros: fresh marinara sauce

Cons: 
- Skimps on cheese and toppings in general. 
- Easy to tell dough is of the frozen pre made kind (though it was cooked well).  

I grew up on the east coast and consider myself to be a pizza buff.  It truly seems as if authentic New York pizza doesn't exist in the west.  This is definitely of New York style (big pies, super thin). The crust isn't bubbly like a true homemade pizza dough though.  It doesn't have the crunch and chewy texture either. Looks like the search continues in Henderson for real pizza worth the price.  Looks like I'll just stick to Neapolitan.
