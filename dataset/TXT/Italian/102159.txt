FGJpnAGh_mjCYsJPVhV6kA We really didn't expect to find such an impressive restaurant in a small shopping center but it's amazing!  The owners Tom and Kathy, the chef, Casey and the waiters and bartender are unbeatable.....Friendly and efficient.  Their happy hour is unbelieveable.  The entress are wonderful  and authentic Italian!  The best in town....or maybe the West! We took a group of 18 for happy hour and they didn't miss a beat taking orders, and serving some of the most delicious food!  Everyone was thrilled and vowed to return again and again!
