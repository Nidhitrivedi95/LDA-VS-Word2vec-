EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw This out of the way place is worth searching for. Tip:go to the back of the building.

I've been three times and have loved it each and every time. I tried something different with each visit with the exception of the yellowtail, which I had all three times....and it never disappointed!

This restaurant would be great for a date night or a night out with friends. Not much of a place for kids, which is not a bad thing as far as I'm concerned. :)

Try what sounds good to you on the menu. I'm sure you'll like it.
