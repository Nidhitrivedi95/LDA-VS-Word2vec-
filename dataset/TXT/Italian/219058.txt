s7Pj1mNYqRTGNOXLOiBafw Went to Figo for dinner and overall I had an alright time.  We shared the zucchini fritti, truffle honey house ricotta and wild boar ragu.  The zucchini fritti was lightly fried, it was light and sweet. The truffle honey house ricotta was good, very light but could've used a dab more truffle. The wild boar ragu could've been better, the pasta was way undercooked, so it was quite hard when eating it.  

The service was unbearable, the waiter wasn't helpful and kept coming at odd times to check up on us. For instance - we just received the ragu and not even a min into it, he asked us how it was. So it was quite annoying. I would not come back.
