U7fZfH9C4hj5BFRYaPOo2w We came here for a day at the spa.  We kicked off our visit to Prado for brunch.  Love the place and the surroundings.  We were greeted right away and had the choice to sit inside or outside.  I chose inside since it was a little warm still.  

The server was a little slow in drinks, refills, getting the bill, and she forgot to bring a drink.  She was hard to flag down or get attention of.  

I ordered the ham and cheese omlette, it was ok.  Bland, just bearly cooked to done and just not too great.  The potatoes were not fully cooked, still crunchy.  

Meh...
