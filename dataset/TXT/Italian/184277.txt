oHgCHC8a3QNJiB4-Ld0_kg Called to place an order since its website says delivery, and even encourages people to call outside of its delivery area (not specified). We live east of Ossington on Harbord ... not far. The guy who answered had a dismissive tone, didn't know where Ossington was, and then after checking, asked for the address again before pronouncing us too far. Meh. Was looking forward to trying out the food and delivery service, but no thanks now.
