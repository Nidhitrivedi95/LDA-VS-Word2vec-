eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA I love the food and drinks here but the bar back showed more attentiveness and better customer service than my bartender Jennifer did. She took my drink and food order quickly but never followed up with me. She was working hard to help others but didn't give me the time of the day, for some reason. Customer service is much better at the Town Square location. Not once in an hour and a half did she ask me if I needed anything.
