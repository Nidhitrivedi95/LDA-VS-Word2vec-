d5n5CsoJNu-tKEbfI6U3tA I typically love olive garden it has always been a go to for us when we want to dine out. Today's experience was a complete disaster.  Our waitress was nice and all but my the meat on my lasagna was Uncooked and I mentioned it to her and her response was let me ask the kitchen then she didn't say anything else about it the rest of the night I had to stop a manager and explain to him and his response was we went with a new meat sauce so it just taste different.  Ummmmmmmmm no its not cooked I don't think that is a different sauce taste! Then I get my bill to find I was charged for an extra meal and drink she had to take my ticket back 2 times to get it right. Now I have an additional $50 charge on my card because she ran it twice and now I have to wait for it to fall off! Horrible experience, if you are going to spend your money on a meal pick somewhere else!
