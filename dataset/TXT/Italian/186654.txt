Orgm9nmcClxnAUva4nOKyA Loved it. Their french toast is one of the best i ever had. BBQ chicken, omlet bar, cheese, deserts, lasagna are few that i liked most.
The roasted beef was bit dry and place can be bit crowded. Have to wait in long line up and wait for the french toast to be refilled. 
Overall yummy food.
