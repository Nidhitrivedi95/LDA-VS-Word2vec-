qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA I think the best thing about Zeffirino  is the experience and ambience (the food is pretty good too). The restaurant overlooks the grand canal in the Venetian which makes for a really nice dining experience. Similar to other restaurants in the hotel, there's usually a wait. The wait staff is fantastic - my mom was going bonkers when our waiter started speaking Italian with her! Make sure you go to the bathroom - weird, I know, but the bathrooms are these rustic little rooms decorated really neatly.
