After seeing my father being visibly shaken by the confrontation, I called Franks to express the concern. The manager I spoke with was immediately on edge with me and shouted "YOU HAVE A NICE DAY!" before slamming the phone and ending the call before we could even resolve the matter.

We were long term customers of Franks, but not anymore. We will be sure to dissuade anyone from using Franks for their pizza delivery. Too bad, was a pretty good pie.
