VVeT1XqQYwrB_fbp3efdUg First time checkin out Matts Chicago dogs. Headed there for lunch on July 3, they were one of the only places open. I ordered the Carolina dog combo, with slaw and chili. My hubby went with the deep dish pizza. The only problem was that I got my hot dog 15 minutes before he got his pizza so it was cold by the time I ate. Obviously I could have eaten it right away but wanted to wait. I got the sweet potato fries with it and they were really good. Hot dog was okay. I wasn't overly wowed by it, but it got the job done. I actually thought the pizza was tastier. Would come back for a quick lunch, food Is average.
