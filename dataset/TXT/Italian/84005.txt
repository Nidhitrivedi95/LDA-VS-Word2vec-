DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q Wow!  This was really good food.  No not just really good food for an airport.  But really good food for a restaurant.  
     Quantities are huge especially for what I got.  The vegan spicy chickpea lettuce wraps.  Massive scoops of spicy chickpeas on half a lettuce wedge with fresh avocado and sun dried tomatoes.  My wife enjoyed her tuna melt.  My daughter had a kid grilled cheese with some french fries that were really crispy and delicious.  She topped it off with some chocolate ice cream.  
    Great place to grab a bite at the Phoenix Airport.  Lots of options.  Sandwiches, breakfast, salads, pizzas, ice cream and snacks.
