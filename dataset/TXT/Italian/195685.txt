pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA We are regulars at Centurion, but last Friday night blew me away.  We brought three friends, so had a party of five.  Friday night was the roll out of the new spring menu, which features small plates or tapas.  We noticed that one area of the menu, "How to Be A Centurion," had three choices, one of which was "The Surrender", in which you "let out capable staff choose the entire meal and (wine) pairings for you."  We decided to go all in!

What followed was an amazing culinary experience!  We had 15 small plates and various wines served in three waves of food.  The new menu is inspired and creative.  We had prawns, clams, lamb "lollipops", risottos, salads, filet, mussels (2 kinds), couscous, meatballs, bolognese and more.  Most of the items came with 4 pieces, but one in the party did not eat any seafood, so it worked out great - he loved everything else and we let him eat all of the filet.  We shared and tasted a variety of wines.  The meal was leisurely, leaving us lots of time for catching up.  Although stuffed by the end of the meal, we HAD to have dessert, so ordered two decadent ones - a salted caramel concoction and a velvety chocolate slab of heaven.  We all agreed the desserts were the best desserts ever and the meal was wonderful and just a lot of fun.  Every one of the 15 plates were prepared in an interesting and delicious manner. We never knew what to expect next but our expectations were met in an amazing manner.  Thanks Chef Eric for a great night.
