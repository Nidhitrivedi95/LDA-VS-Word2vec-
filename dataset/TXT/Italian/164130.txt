lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg Giordano's is located in the Bally shopping plaza (there is outdoor seating and an upstairs). I ordered the Chicago classic deep dish 12". The pizza took about 30-45 minutes to bake but it was well worth the wait. I rarely get the chance to dive into a deep dish and I was very fortunate that night. The pizza was extremely cheesy and tomatoey and paired well with a nice ale. The 12" is definitely more than enough for two people unless you guys are famished.

Service was exceptional. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. I never had to wave down a person for water. A+ 10/10 would go again if I crave pizza.
