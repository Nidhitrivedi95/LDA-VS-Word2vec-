wXXqG4igJeJwL9o5sjyMXQ The food is ok, not great. We had the deluxe pizza and medium dozen wings. I had the honey brown beer for $3; reasonable drink price. My only complaint is that they charge for extra ranch. I understand that restaurants sometimes practice this for take out orders, but charging for ranch at a dine in transaction makes the restaurant appear to be cheap/penny pinching. If they are hurting for money to where they need your charge for extra ranch, when a small portion is given to start with, perhaps they should bake the cost of the $ .50 ranch in the price of their pizza/wings. 

Another issue is that were were not told that there was a charge for the extra ranch. If we would have been told, were would have just laughed at the fact that they were being cheap, and still ordered it. But we only discovered the charge when we were given the bill. When I asked the waitress about the charge she said, "Yea we charge here, we make it homemade". I told her that she did not provide us with that information when we asked for it, nor was the extra charge stated on the menu. She replied, "Yea, we charge for it." 

Yes, it's just a $.50 charge, but the way it was communicated, and handled was off. And the ranch was runny; nothing special.
