KiP4NjelCHqNAf36JxXUQQ Was here on a Wednesday night for a work outing. They were very accommodating for my large group of 15 people. Service was nice as they got drinks to us quickly and ensured we were always topped off. Apps arrived quickly and looked great. I ordered the steak and the waitress was knowledgable of the substitutes as I did not want the gnocchi. Had my gnocchi replaced with rapini side which was also cooked well. Steak was a bit on the bland side and the quality of the meat was average. Lots of people in the group opted for the chicken parm which seemed to have been the better option.
