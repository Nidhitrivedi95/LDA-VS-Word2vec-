qfOdKsHejg346k_B7MmmuQ Stopped by for a late lunch with my mom and it was a pleasant experience! I ordered the peperino and my mom got an omelette and blueberry pancakes! The food was delicious and the place itself was quaint and cute! The waiter was friendly and doubled as the cook. I highly recommend it for both breakfast and lunch.
