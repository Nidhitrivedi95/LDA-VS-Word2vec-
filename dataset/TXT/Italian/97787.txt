EUQoB_ph7_xIyj7JZGI3bg Tonight was the last night I got clowned by this place  I like a good Mac n Cheese and thought that I would go back on my word tonight to try it at this place.  I figured it would be good.  Man was I wrong!  First, it was a block 2 inches wide by a 5 inches long by 1.5 inches in height.  It didn't taste that good.  It was horrible if I"m to be honest.  The real kick in the crotch was that I was at the Lux not far from there and passed on their mac n cheese to try this places.  And the Lux's mac n cheese is way better!  Not just better but 7 dollars with bacon and jalapenos.  The size is a little more, too.
