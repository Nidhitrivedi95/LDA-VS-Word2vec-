pt7p4klGicvPZe04mhhVGQ I am a Pizza Snob. I have actually been driving about 10 miles round trip to get quality pizza. ..until now!   Lucky's on Cactus will be my pizza place from now on. The NY Style stuffed pizza was PERFECT!   The toppings were succulent and the crust was amazing. In addition,  they had made a small and understandable mistake when billing my card, so the young man that took my order actually came to my house PERSONALLY to explain what happened and deliver my pizza. How refreshing to deal with a business that chooses to own their mistakes and go out of their way to make it right. BRAVO Lucky's on Cactus!   You have earned my business....and that is saying ALOT!
