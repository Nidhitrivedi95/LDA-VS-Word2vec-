SgSVJWgMwFteYyz4OlHu9Q I'm just curious if I owned a pizza establishment and didn't offer chicken fingers or even wings with a pizza combination special some places offer fingers and Pizza and other places offer wings and pizza specials but the thing that gets me the most as in this industry of pizza fingers and wings which is the basic reason why most people call a pizza company for delivery on a weekend or special occasion or just want to eat something is for these 3 main items so if they can't find a distributor that can offer a fair price to them so they in turn can offer a good price to consumer which is us the specials what does it say about the establishment are they overcharging us in order to make an extra buck does the money mean more to them than their name a lot of questions come to mind I've always tried to do what's best for the people who spend the money but in Las Vegas is so hard to find a business expecially and pizza a company with good customer service great product an amazing specials it's almost like you get two of the three why can't we find a pizza company that offers 3 of 3 that being said I've called around I've even ordered and give him the benefit of the doubt and I have not been impressed yet not saying I have expectations what just looking for a reasonable price I understand the companies make a profit but when they do charge more than $50 to get a pizza and fingers or wings depending on what special the offer to me is ridiculous so I always let the company know I found them on Yelp I always let the person on the phone now please take care of me and I don't mind taking care of you but for some reason its extremely hard to find somebody who even cares that matter and maybe the management or owners talk to their employees before they hire are more screen them we are here for the customer and we want to give them the best experience possible instead of only offer this weight off of that call somebody else so is it better to make more money now then way more money later thank you Yelpers
