vDEf2V-bvRLtwAh2nfkebQ We went for a nice litter dinner. I knew it was a bit more expensive than other pizza joints, but I dont mind paying for great food. Well it was much less than that. We got a large (14 inch) peperoni for the kids and wife to split. We asked for a little extra sauce and it was almost like a white pizza without the flavor. The pizza was $22 for a 14 inch 1 tasteless top pizza. Really? 

I ordered a pasta dish that tasted like like it was freshly microwaved! It had very little taste. Even the sausage was bland. It came with a chincey little breadstick. It was like half the size of a normal bread stick. Just 1. 

The service was bad also. They were not busy at all. All of our cups were empty for at least 10 min before anyone asked if we need a refill. It was probably 20 minutes between waitress visits. 

The only reason they get 2 stars is because the desert was very good. My wife was pissed that the food was bland that she said they couldnt make a brownie sunday taste like the other food. She was right. It was a nice big portion and the kids loved it. 

Pizza, pasta dish, 4 soda's (2 kids) and a desert were $45 before tip. Lets just say there are many other places to eat for less money and a much better meal. 

For a gourmet pizza place in the west valley, this isnt even remotely close to Grimaldi's.
