hcHaWzM5wfdAbCWs4zmmqg I popped into Nodo with a friend after being thwarted by an overly busy Indie Ale House.  I've always thought this place looked cute from the outside, and we managed to get a table in about 15 minutes, although in retrospect, I would have happily waited a bit longer for some more table real estate.

The FOOD: We split an order of the Pappardelle with duck ragu ($18).  It was a rather average execution with noodles that were a bit too thick and underdone.  The ragu itself was rather tasty, although we couldn't discern any of the "seven spices" that were advertised.  The Madunio Pizza ($18) had a nice crust but was otherwise a miss.  The burrata was more like hard mozzarella, the pickled chilis were not all that pickled or spicy, and the rapini was in desperate need of a blanching prior to cooking.  

The SERVICE was fine with a very friendly woman handling it.  Pacing was poor.  

The real problem was the TABLE itself.  It must have been the smallest two-top in existence, which was then wedged up against the wall and between two other tables.  We were petrified that we would knock something off the table the entire time.  Air Canada Rouge in economy class offers more dining space per patron.  it was so uncomfortable, we felt an immense amount of relief leaving the restaurant.  

OVERALL, our impression of Nodo was that it was fairly average.  One can get better pasta at a similar price at Enoteca Sociale.  The food was maybe 3.5 stars, but being squeezed into an airline seat's worth of space really ruined the experience.
