HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q LOVE at first site. I was walking toward the blackjack tables inside the Palazzo when  the beautiful, vibrant colored gelato caught my attention. There were sooooo many different flavors. I was so excited because I have a huge obsession with anything creamy and frozen. 

The guy serving me was really nice and patient with my indecisiveness. But after sampling about 7 different flavors, I settled on mango. Mmmm so refreshing. A tad bit tangy and just enough sweetness. It was $5 something for the 1 scoop and was worth every penny. I walked away with the cup of gelato in my hands, smiling like a lunatic. At that point, nothing else mattered. Blackjack tables? whatevs.
