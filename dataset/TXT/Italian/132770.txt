iL2-xJ4-eMsJk88PsbivbQ Really enjoy having pizza here!  It feels like a true pizzeria!  Their garlic knots are to die for!  My husband and I went to Springs Preserve to a beer tasting.  All of the vendors had insane lines for food.  Good for them, bad for us!  After we left, this was the closest pizzeria I could think of.  I used to work near here and would frequent it.  I forgot how good it was!  My husband was impressed such a good pizza shop was in such an obscure strip mall/grocery store complex.  They have really good combos and reasonable prices.  It's not on our side of town but I'm sure we'll have to make a point of going back!  

Do not forget an order of the garlic knots!!!!
