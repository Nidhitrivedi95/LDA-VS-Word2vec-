wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw What a great experience!  Our server, Bethany was extremely helpful with menu  alterations to accommodate my wife's egg, wheat, and dairy allergies. We ended up ordering a couple of bruscheta items served on tomato slices instead of bread and humus in place of the cheese.  We would never have thought of those alternatives, but the end result was fantastic!  No compromise on flavor or presentation. 
 
A second challenge for Postino's on this occasion (met equally well BTW) was our time constraint. We had tickets for a play at the Hale Theater, next door, and due the the long wait to get seated we had less than an hour to order and dine. I had called the night before and had been told Friday evenings could be very busy around 5 pm; was advised to arrive earlier if we wanted to be finished dining by 7. We arrived at 5:15 and immediately regretted not heeding the advice.  We waited a little over an hour to be seated. I told Bethany about our time crunch and she handled it incredibly well.  She didn't get flustered or irritated. She calmly and patiently explained options to accommodate allergies and delivered our meal very quickly.

OK, we also appreciated the atmosphere/ambiance/decor etc. but I will leave that to other reviewers. Thought it was worth mentioning the special treatment we got, especially with the allergen challenges.
