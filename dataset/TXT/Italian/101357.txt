fckUjXz1GKpafT4x7-MVJA Had a great night. The place wasn't packed and the food was prepared really fast. It was a light dinner anyhow. Just some salad, soup, and appetizers. Our waiter was very friendly and never let our drinks empty. Only thing was I know the lighting is for ambiance and what not but its hard to read the menu with the lights so dim.
