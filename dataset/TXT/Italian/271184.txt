XqSN1PtZkJ6QorOUa9AAdA Ok I gave this place a 4 star for their food, the chef was obviously ambitious, and  thats more than I can say for the wait staff. We came in knowing we'd be a problem since 2 of the people in our group were vegan, anyway it took like 15 minutes for us to get the guy in line for what vegan meant. This lack of knowledge luckily wasn't shared by the chef they both had great meals and had no problems. My food was great I started with the scallops for my appetizer, they were almost perfectly pan seared and tasty. It was served with this kind off sweet sauce, which I like but I'm sure it's not for everyone. Then I had the roasted duck I've had duck before and I liked it, I love the flavor-fulness of it and I'm a fan of the texture so I thought why not get it again. I was glad I did it was tender and juicy and flavorful, they do all their duck medium rare and that was fine with me since I had no real basis to which I would know the amount of rarity I would want for my duck. Then came dessert I had the gondola, which was just creme bule with a cookie like model of a gondola on top. Their creme bule with berries on top, superb. This place was kinda cheesy and they called themselves the Venice of the West....hardly, but regardless of ill fit names they had all around great food, service was touch and go but in the end its the food that counts.
