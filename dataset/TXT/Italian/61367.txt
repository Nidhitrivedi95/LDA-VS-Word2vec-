aYjZc-3aVbPIPaJgGiUK_A Nostrano deserves a lot of praise. They have a simple menu which keeps them focused on just a few items. That focus pays off. The food is beyond delicious. For food in Madison this place is contender for top honors. 

Took a crowd of 11 people here they did an amazing job. I was impressed with how well it handled. Given its size that's quite the crowd for this place. Service was friendly and prompt. 

What makes this place stand out is the dessert menu. I believe at least one of the chefs was a pastry chef and you can tell. The desserts are in a league beyond the main dishes. 

Definitely a favorite spot in madison and I'll keep returning.
