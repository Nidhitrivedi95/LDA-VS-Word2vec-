NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ I love it here it reminds me of back home in Jersey when I could just hop on a quick subway ride and get the best pizza! I love that it's a family owned business it makes it extra special. 

Definitely the pizza I've eaten in Vegas!

No matter how long the wait I'll always wait with no complaints....
