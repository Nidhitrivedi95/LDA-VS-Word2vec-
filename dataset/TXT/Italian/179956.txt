nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A This was my first visit to Buddy V's and it was AMAZING. The ambiance was great with really nice live music and lighting, the service was impeccable and our food was out of sight! Our server Giorgio was probably the best server I have ever had! He was so friendly and really went out of his way to take care of us and make us feel at home. We also
Got to spend some time chatting with the manager who was also excellent at his job and runs a top notch place. He even had a fabulous cake sent to our table to help us celebrate our anniversary. We had an amazing evening at Buddy V's. We would highly recommend it to anyone and we will be back soon!! Thanks Giorgio!!
