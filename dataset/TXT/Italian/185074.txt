oJSa5HCiZXKLXxggQmecEQ While visiting Toronto with my folks, I came across this restaurant on Yelp and scored big. Campognolo is a great space with excellent service. The food was great! We shared the baked fontina cheese with red wine braised leeks. For our entrees we ordered the celery root agnolotti, the Ontario capon and the roasted Ontario lamb leg. They were all delicious. I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant.
