YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ As far a fast casual dining goes I Love this place.  I find myself ordering signature dishes togo despite the fact that I have a pantry filled with dried pasta.  I also bring my two year old twins here often as it is kid friendly and the children's pasta in broth is magical to them.  It also helps that they offer cupcakery cupcakes.  If you live in Las Vegas this is a must try spot!
