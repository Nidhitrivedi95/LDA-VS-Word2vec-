Lgw7MuTeAOOjdIQfq-jaxQ A cheap and cheerful Italian restaurant, very good for a date. I came here on a date, and even though the tables are a bit too small and crammed in, I really liked the mixed seafood pasta I got and would gladly come here again. The waitress who served us was friendly too. I have only come here for lunch, when there is no lighting-dishes-on-fire practice. I have seen them alight at night though- quite entertaining! If there is a big group of you I would strongly suggest booking a table, as space is limited. Also tables are quite close together and there is little space on the tables for dishes.
