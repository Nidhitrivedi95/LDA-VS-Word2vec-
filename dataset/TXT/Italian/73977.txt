cOWXtCz7F9GQhPIks8gm6Q Maltagliati is amazing!! Please please please order this dish! It was some of the best pasta I've ever had and since it's made fresh, you're able to get removed from it what you'd like (ie mushrooms for you non mushroom eaters). The pasta is homemade and in a sauce that is similar to a carbonara sauce. All the vegetables in it were fresh and delightful. 

Make sure to ask for bread because you only get if you ask. It's regular bread but still tasty. Also, they ended my meal by giving me a homemade lemonchello shot.
