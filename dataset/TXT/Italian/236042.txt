Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA No need to add to the raves about the food, but I wanted to speak up about the great service we got last night at Federal. It was a Friday night and we had reservations for 5 people at 7pm. 

We only had one of our party there by 7, and they seated him without giving him any pushback about needing the whole party there. Three more of us arrived by 7:30,and the last person was there by 8. Not once did anyone give us trouble about monopolozing a table, and they even let the last person order her pizza when she arrived. 

The dinner was a going-away celebration for a very good friend who has had a very rough time lately, and it was a much-needed send-off for all of us. 

Thanks, FP, for recognizing that we are going to spend money at your establishment even if we're a little late. Sometimes planes don't arrive on time, trucks don't get packed as quickly as we intend, and emotions run high when you're picking up your life and moving across the country. Thanks for helping us relax at the end of a hard day.
