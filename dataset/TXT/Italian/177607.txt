NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA I'd say it's really a 3.5er but I'll give the round up because they so awesomely sheltered us from the green storm. Cool vibe; dark and quiet which was a very welcome respite from the throngs of St. Patty's Day party people loudly stumbling about the city in their green shirts, beads, hats, tutus, socks, sunglasses, face paint, unicycles, etc. Bar was very clean and extremely well organized and the stools were super comfortable after a day of sightseeing.

Lots of beers of numerous styles on tap, mostly local. My triple IPA (Helltown Brewing's "Idle Hands") was delicious as was my cocktail, a black pepper Paloma, both of which I highly recommend. Bartender offered recommendations and was more-or-less attentive. Bianca pizza ($15 for the only size; shareable as a snack/individual as a dinner) sat for awhile as I stared longingly knowing it was ours and it was getting colder by the second :( When we did finally receive it, it had good flavor but way too much ricotta for my liking and only my first slice was hot because it sat for so long. Crust was good at the top but more soggy than desirable underneath the toppings. Ultimately, I could've done without the pizza. 

I'd absolutely recommend this place for date night drinks at the bar and some intimate conversation or just a relaxed place to sit and drink a tasty beer, not sure if I'd come back for more pizza though.
