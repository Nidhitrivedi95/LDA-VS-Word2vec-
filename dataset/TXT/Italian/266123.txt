x_zNfGIl4O3bvAfCZoGeag I have been hearing about how amazing cronuts are! So I decided to try cronuts at this bakery. It was my first and definitely not the last. I tried their chocolate dipped, cinnamon, and sugar! My favorite was chocolate dipped. I loved how it was nice and soft and flaky-buttery in the inside :)! The only complaint I have is that the bakery only serve on Friday - Sundays. However, good news is you can pre-order them during the weekday :).
