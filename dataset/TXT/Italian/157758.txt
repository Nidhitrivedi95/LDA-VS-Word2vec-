Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA Honestly, I had the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had here, and that is my favorite meal! The ambiance was nice, good lighting, friendly staff. 

The negatives: a little slow, little overpriced (but it's Vegas so, ya know..), and our waiter would not stop trying to upsell me for a glass of wine or dessert or appetizer...it got to be too much to where it was uncomfortable. He also came around maybe once when we got our food, and didn't offer us anymore bread to go along with our oil/vinegar!

Regardless, if I was to go to Vegas again, I might stop here if I was craving some spaghetti and meatballs :)
