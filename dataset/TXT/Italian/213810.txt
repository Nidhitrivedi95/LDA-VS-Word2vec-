r8u48_iu_xyHHD2ZH9GmhQ I've been here twice and both times we got their "3 for $30" deal. 3 courses, $30 per person, plus a half carafe of wine. Not bad!

You will definitely have leftovers: you get an appetizer each, bread for the table, entrée, half carafe of wine, plus dessert. Both of us had veal - 1 parm and 1 marsala - both delish!

It's off the beaten path outside of 277 by Gateway, but the parking is easy, the service is great and I've never had to wait. Granted last time there were only 2 tables on a Saturday night! Maybe it's more of a lunch place? 

Good place though, I would recommend if you are looking for a new Italian option in Charlotte that's not fancy schmancy but still nice.
