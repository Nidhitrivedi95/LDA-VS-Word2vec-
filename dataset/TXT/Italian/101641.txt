fDkQcos3MqqCYGWfl64iiA I cannot believe I have not yet written a review for this heaven.  First off, Chef Capra is a frequent visitor of the dinning room. It shows that the man loves his job and likes to see the happy faces of his customers. And happy faces he sees. The food is godly, there really is no other expression you could have after the 'buds have tasted the food. 

Seriously, the food is so good that even if the venue and service were horrible, I would still give it 5 stars and recommend you went there. Fortunately, the venue is cozy, and the service is excellent. So now you really have no excuse not to go. 

No really, just go.
