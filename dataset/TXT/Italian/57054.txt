AN9sX6Dh8-QAoJssdyno8A Living and working downtown I have my fair share of pizza joints to choose from and I like to change it up regularly to rotate my business.  If I had to choose my favorite pizza it would be Locale.  Why you ask?  Their crust.  It has the perfect texture smooth and chewy inside with a crisp exterior specked with just the right amount of char to add a smokey flavor.  The dough is not tough and overworked like a few places plus it has the right balance of salt and sweetness.  My second favorite thing is the red sauce.  The tomato flavor in the sauce is simple perfection.  My mom grows and home cans her own San Marzano tomatoes so I can be a bit particular about the flavor when someone says they are using these in their sauce.  

I can not speak to the sit down service as I have only ever ordered carry out which is super quick and too easy when the last thing I want to do is cook after work.
