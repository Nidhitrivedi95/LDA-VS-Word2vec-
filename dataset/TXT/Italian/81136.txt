dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw This one surprised me. I was going to the Eagles concert with friends at the MGM Arena and had to make a quick decision about a restaurant nearby. I usually spend some time researching all of our eating and drinking establishments in Vegas. This one took me one minute after reading the menu and some reviews on Yelp. I did make the reservations through Yelp less then a week before dinning. I thought it would be a "good" Italian dinner and off to see the Eagles.

Wow-did I underestimate this place! First-it is very modern and sleek. It is a bit loud and full of energy, just like a fun Vegas restaurant should be. There is a bar area where you could have dinner as well.

Our server was fine. He did all the basics but it seemed he might have had too many tables to handle that night. At one point we were looking for him but overall he was acceptable. 

Wine list was nice and I recognized a Cab. listed only by the glass. We asked and they were happy to get us a full bottle even though it was not normally served that way. It was so nice not to have a hassle when we asked about it and the wine was fantastic.

I started with the beef carpaccio. It was outstanding-some of the best I have ever had. So fresh and full of flavor. My friends each had the pear and blue cheese salad and raved about it. For a main I had the sea bass. Wow-again full of extraordinary flavor and you could taste the freshness. My friends tasted it and I believe they wished they had ordered it. Another main was the salmon and a third had the beef filet 12 oz. (yes-a big piece of meat). I tasted each and they were melt in your mouth good. We didn't have time for dessert as the Eagles were waiting for us.

I knew this would be a good experience but didn't expect a 5 star experience. I highly recommend Fiamma if you are looking for a nice long enjoyable dinner or a quick high quality meal before a show.

Oh - and the Eagles concert was 5 stars as well!
