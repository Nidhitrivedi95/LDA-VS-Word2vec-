CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA This is my 400th review, so I chose a good one.
I keep getting coupons for this place. People I know(friends) say yeah, it is OK. Nothing great. It is alright.
So one day it was raining and cold. I was out running errands and did not want to mess up the house cooking when I got home.

So I had a coupon so I came here to Venezia's!
First I called on the phone to order a large Pizza and some wings.I have been craving Wings,soooo.
Anyway, I got there a little early. Parking for pick up right in front,very nice.
As I sat inside looking around it was clean and well maintained.
Counter for napkins, condiments and such, clean and well stocked. 
They were busy pick up orders, people coming in to get a slice, etc.
They handle it very well. Everyone is calm and it runs very smoothly.

One girl that was cutting Pizza and boxing every thing up made it all look so easy.
She was wearing a hat and had tattoos,I say that because, I do not know her name.
But, she was getting those orders out so quickly and efficiently/ I was amazed how she made it all look so easy. Bravo to her, she rocks.
The smell inside was really good. Italian Food on a cold day smells fantastico!

When We sat down to eat at home. It was fantastic! I love their Pizza. Their wings were meaty and spicy! This is it , I have found my new Pizza Heaven!
I am so excited.

Also I read the menu and took a to go menu home, I can't wait to try all the other items, I am sure they are just as wonderful!
