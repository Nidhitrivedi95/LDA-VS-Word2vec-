sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg I went to Emporio on a Wednesday night. It was busy with lots of customers, but we still got a seat fairly soon. I am not a person who typically enjoys meatballs, but I do admit that their meatballs tasted pretty good. I thought that the poutine and the tater tots tasted just OK. The waiter was nice and brought out our drink refills and later the bill promptly.
