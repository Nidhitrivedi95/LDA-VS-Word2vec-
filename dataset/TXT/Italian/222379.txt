sH9aI3xg-POBMp8R-kSQZg I heard a lot of good things about this place. Walked in and it was a nice atmosphere. However the food was very bland... the mozzarella sticks were obviously frozen and weren't the best and the pizza was completely bland. There was no flavor to it at all. The waiter was nice which was one of the bright spots but spending 20 bucks on a bland pizza is something I won't do again.
