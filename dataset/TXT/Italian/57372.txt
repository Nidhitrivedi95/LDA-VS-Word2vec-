anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg My wife and I went to Vegas this weekend thinking that Rosewood Grill would be the place to hit.  To our surprise it is gone and then we remembered a good meal at Pieros we had a couple of years ago.  The food was better than last time and the service was great.  We had the Osa Bucco and veal parm and both were great and a large portions that neither of us could finish.  Would rec to anyone who loves to eat and a decent price for what we got.
