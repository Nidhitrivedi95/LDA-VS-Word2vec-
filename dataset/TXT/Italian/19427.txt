2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg Leoné is trying hard to win your heart with its glitzy chandeliers, pretty Euro-style interior, and lovely location.  Unfortunately, I am not smitten.  My cappuccino was weak and flat and had nothing to recommend it.  (I'm guessing old beans?)  My companions' coffees were served in paper cups.  Weird and inconsistent, as my drink was in a "real" mug.  (We all ordered our drinks "for here.")  The barista last night seemed to be more interested in getting our orders DONE than getting our orders done WELL.  I liked my chocolate chip cookie -- soft, chewy, and loaded with chips.  Hubby's tiramisu pleased him enough and my friend's cheese sandwich was "yummy."

So, food seemed good, drinks were meh, and overall ambience was charming.  I don't think I'll be coming again soon, as I quite like Sambalatte and would rather patronize a place that supports local musicians (live music!) and installs friendly staff.  Maybe my experience was a one-off 'meh' experience, but first impressions are important (unfortunately!).
