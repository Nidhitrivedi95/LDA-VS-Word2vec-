clL0-uy-DH0bJgBFEfoxFA I've been pretty happy with the food and service at Alice Fazooli's. It's par for the course with the several other restaurants in this plaza.

Italian food + wine. Gotta love it.

I recommend:
+Tuscan Tenderloin: It's a goooood piece 'o meat.
+Whichever fish is on their seasonal menu. I was quite pleased with mine.

I (half) recommend:
Chicken Risotto: I've had it twice. The first time I ordered it, the risotto was a little "dry"(?). The second time I ordered it, I was much more pleased. Creamy and rich like it's supposed to be.

Other notes:
Parking is tough around here even though it's a shopping center. Don't get frustrated though. People are going in and out at all times.
