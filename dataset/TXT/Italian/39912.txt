I want a real medium. So the waist actually scoffed at me.  The girl next to me. ( we had a large party) ordered hers well done. My filet arrived and they filleted my filet. It was extremely well done and super dry. I think they gave my steak to my friend because hers was a tiny bit pink so we traded.  Both of our steaks were cold, I mean not in the slightest were they even warm. So you go to a steak house and pay a outrageous amount for a steak??? Our tables bill was over 1300$ and I've had a better steak at Longhorn.
