38-sjGYYVcQEKrZe5Nu47A When I first moved to Henderson, I literally picked them out randomly. This was 21 years ago and it was awesome! Since then, I have probably visited Johnny Mac's at least a dozen times. 

As it turns out, years later, my nephew (Chris P.) and niece (Katie S.) have worked there for years. Johnny Mac's is a regular hang out for the whole gang. 

Thanks for the years of great food and great customer service. I'll be seeing you guys soon!
