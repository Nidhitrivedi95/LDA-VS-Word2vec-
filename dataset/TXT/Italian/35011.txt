6I27BTuHI5PMvOBG4WS8NQ Although I have been to the Bay St location, I thought I knew what to expect, but this time it was with a large group, and Mercatto (Toronto St.) exceeded my expectations.

Perhaps a large group is the way to come, because you get to sample so many varieties of food. The lovely young ladies that served us were as friendly as they were lovely; any requests were provided immediately.
 
Highly recommended.
