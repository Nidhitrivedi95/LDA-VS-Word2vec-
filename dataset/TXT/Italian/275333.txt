yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg I wish it was possible to give this place negative stars. Please avoid it at all costs and save your hard earned money and go to a decent restaurant. This place was filthy, food was below mediocre and overpriced, and worst of all, disrespectful owner with too much of an attitude. How can you get away with charging 21 dollars for a chicken caesar salad that seemed to be made with leftover chicken scraps, bagged lettuce, no croutons, and of the size of a side salad? I am a seasoned cook and foodie and eat out often, and by no means this is acceptable anywhere. Even when I used to live in NYC they would never get away with charging that, and if so, it would be in a top notch restaurant in the city. 

The worst part was when my boyfriend's mom nicely requested a tad more cheese for her pasta and the owner almost dumped the whole cheese bowl in her plate! By no means should customers by treated in this manner. He was even eavesdropping our conversation and gave his input in regards to the subject. What kind of person in his/her right mind does this? In all, you are warned! Please don't come to this establishment.
