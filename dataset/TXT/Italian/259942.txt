wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg I've been here 4 times since I live in the area and there is almost always a line up after 6pm. The atmosphere and cuisine are very authentic Italian and my favorite thing on the menu is their homemade tiramisu, which some may not find aesthetically pleasing but daaaaaaayuuum it is pleasing to my taste buds. :)

There is always a line outside around 6-7pm so I would recommend coming early or late.
