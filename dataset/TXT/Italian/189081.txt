OYaL_-uxBCgrE94uNQ4VCA I got to tell the truth here and to be brutally honest. I really really wanted to like this place. Lino's had so much potential and mostly all the qualities I truly appreciate in a local Italian eatery, lets go down the check list shall we. 

Family owned...Check
10 or so table hole in the wall...Check
Not far from home...Check
Reasonably priced...Check
Food...Absolutely god awful

Now you may think I'm being a little harsh but trust me people the food was so profoundly horrible I just can't hold back.  I have a moral and cultural obligation to share my less than 1 star dining experience.  I ordered the manicotti, a ricotta stuffed large ziti style noodle with cheese and sauce, not a hard concept to grasp right? Well apparently it was for Lino's.  I guess when I asked for manicotti, he thought I requested a disgusting cheese crape smothered in a discount sauce.  This place sucks and I hope next time I drive by there's boards on the windows with a giant sign that reads CLOSED.
