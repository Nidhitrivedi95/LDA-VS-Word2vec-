RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ I had a gentleman take me here last night for a first date. The atmosphere and views were amazing and the food was very good. My only complaint would be that my chicken was $28 and it came with a small piece of meat, a potato type of cake, and some mushrooms. I left there starving and ended up getting fast food on the way home. I think it would be a much better place for just drinks and appetizers out on the patio overlooking the city and sitting by the firepit or fountain. Very beautiful and the employees were incredible. But really disappointed about the portions for the price.
