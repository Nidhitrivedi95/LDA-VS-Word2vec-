jeTfL2kCyBtmFGSrSQHqVw I have NEVER ever had a bad dish here. The service was always so spot on, but then again that might just be because they know me.
I am always impressed with the ideas Thad's crew thinks of...and I am such a fan of ANYTHING the dessert Chef Allison makes, that girl is incredible!

Sure it is pricey, but it is mostly local products, which makes me more than happy to fork over more. They seem to be particular to detail, which is a plus to me!
The wine is top notch too.

Honestly, anyone who finds Bacaro pretentious must be insecure, or needs to be more social. Good Lord, fine dining people!! You pay for what you get.

ALSO!! Thad has also mentioned to me how he likes his business to have less seating so its about quality, and not quantity. RESPECT that!!

I think I need to save to go there again, so worth it!!
