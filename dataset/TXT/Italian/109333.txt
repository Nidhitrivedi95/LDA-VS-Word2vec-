G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q My sister was very excited to eat at Giada's for her 30th birthday. We called ahead to make the reservation and were told she would get a dessert for her birthday. We ordered a few antipastis to start our meal and were disappointed in all of them. We then had our main course including the salmon and roasted chicken(among other meals), but unfortunately were again very disappointed with the bland and dry flavors. The end of the meal came and we were presented with dessert menus and my sisters birthday was not mentioned or celebrated. It was disappointing overall since we were all very excited but ended up spending a lot of money on overpriced, underwhelming food.
