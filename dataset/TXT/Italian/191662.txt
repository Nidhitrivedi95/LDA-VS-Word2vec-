pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ My mom and I had dinner here recently before a show.  We were seated right away in their outdoor patio (not really outdoor since its inside a mall).  We had a great waitress.  She was attentive and friendly.  She came by frequently, as well as the bus person to fill water glasses and take away empty plates.

I had the Veal Scaloppine mushroom marsala wine sauce. served with seasonal vegetables & mashed potatoes.  The veal was very tender, could cut it with a fork.  The sauce was yummy.  Lots of mushrooms.  Sides were good too.  Mom had the pepperoni pizza.  Nice thin crust with spicy pepperoni.  I had a bite and it was very tasty.

If you happen to be at the Miracle Mile shops or Planet Hollywood, this is definitely a great dinner spot.  Good traditional Italian food.
