DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw If you want a 5 star dining experience with that family owned restaurant feel, this is definitely the spot. From the pristine kitchen and impressive wine cellar, this family owned and operated Italian restaurant, gives you the welcoming as if you are a part of their family. The Osso Bucco is the finest I've had and is a must try for your first visit. Great food and atmosphere. Our good friend and co-workers Larry and Ralph suggested the spot, so I'd not only like to thank them for letting us experience an awesome dinner but extends Thanks to Gino and Mimmo for making our experience at Ferraros a memorable one.
