It is intimate despite being busy and packed and the food is really simple and classic. What draw's me to this place though is there surprisingly good dollar per ounce house wine. The group usually settles on a pizza or apps to share and just go about drinking for the rest of night, enjoying each others company. It's really quite a special place that I've enjoyed all the times that I've went. My only complaint is that service tends to be inconsistent. Some times I'd get very attentive and friendly servers while other times I've been served by a waiter that barely came to check on us. Nonetheless, I keep coming back because who can say no to cheap wine and decently priced italian food?
