A7waf6G3cvnLfAqKeLL8DA We went to Buca for a pre dinner show in January 2013. Yep, I did not forget the experience as it was a mixture of good and bad. 

The good: we went there early so I had a chance to read their Menu thoroughly, the food was authentic Italian "fusion" 

THE BAD: there was only a few tables for our 530 PM seating but they seated us near the kitchen. The service was not great until my daughter arrived and ordered  wine, (I don't drink so I had to settle for mineral water while waiting for her). 

The not-so-sure: the portions of everything were tiny. After ordering  3 breads, 4 cheeses, 4 pastas, salads , meat platter, and desserts, we were still hungry. May be they cater to peopl with tiny appetite. For almost 280 bill, we were hoping for a bit more,

The need-improvement: the servers were a bit indifferent to cold, and may be they preferred the folks who ordered bottles of wine ... We had a pregnant woman and a non drinker...
