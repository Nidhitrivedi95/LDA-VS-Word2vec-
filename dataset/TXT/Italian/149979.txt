KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ My girlfriend and I went to Rao's for their restaurant week dinner menu. The food was mediocre, bland, and exorbitantly overpriced. My bill came to around $100. I have had far better meals for a fraction of that price. Given Rao's New York reputation, I expected a much better meal.
