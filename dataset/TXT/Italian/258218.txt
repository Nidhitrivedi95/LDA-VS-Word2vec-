w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg After Restaurant Week, my stomach was craving something simple. No more three to four course meals. No more fine dining atmosphere. No more elaborate restaurant hoping. All I wanted was the neverending soup, salad, and breadsticks. 

When my friend and I got off of work, we booked it to the OG to get our fix. For less than $8, we could have ate til our hearts content. Our server, Ray, was attentive with drink refills, soup swaps, and salad changes. After two soups and a salad each, we called it quits. Even if we had not, Ray would have kept it coming.
