0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg Best meal we had in Vegas, hands down and, if you check my other dining reviews from this trip, most all of them were 4 stars, mostly 5's.  My wife was really wanting to try Scott Conant's iconic and so simple spaghetti after seeing it on The Best Thing I Ever Ate once on Food Network.  We had done the Steakhouse thing already and were ready for some Italian anyway.  We are SOOOO glad we came to Scarpetta.  Every bit of the meal was fabulous from the stiff cocktails to the impeccable service and the just unbelievably tasty food.  Honey's spaghetti was all she could hope for and my Branzino was a masterpiece, perfectly seared, with the most delicious fish stock based sauce that was poured over it table side. My brother had a seared duck dish and my niece some pumpkin-based filled pasta dish.  Throw in that we had a fabulous view of the Bellagio fountains blasting every 15 minutes and just, wow!

To a person, we all agreed Scarpetta exceeded our expectations!!!
