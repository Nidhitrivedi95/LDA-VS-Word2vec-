cy3Or8iSsDOmHBBu2MwnOg Toscana, how I love thee!  I have dined here a handful of times never to leave disappointed.  The inside is charming and romantic, and the cozy outdoor patio is even more so.  This is an EXCELLENT date spot, and has way more character than one might expect.

I highly recommend the salumi and formaggi as an appetizer.  The tartufo is my most favorite cheese in the world.  Creamy and truffle-y.  It's perfect.  The calamari is crispy and delicious as well. Perfectly crunchy.  

I sampled the Osso Bucco which was so tender and flavorful.  It had the consistency of a short rib.  I had the snapper special which was lemony and bursting with bright flavors.  I loved every bite!  

Tiramisu, one of my favorite desserts, which seems easy to screw up, was outstanding.  Just the right amount of liqueur.  

Split a bottle of wine with your date and enjoy a romantic evening out at Toscana!
