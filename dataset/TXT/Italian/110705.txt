G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I have eaten here twice now and I simply love this place. It's an experience! You feel like you are in a cozy house which is pretty rare for a Vegas dining spot. 

The view is breathe taking over the strip, we watched the Bellagio fountains all night. 

Cocktails- were ok. I had something with champagne but honestly I wish I had picked wine because the food has enough flavors so my sweet cocktail was throwing it off. 

A must - the antipasto platter - just do it! Roasted ricotta stuffed peppers where perfect grilled and the quality of cheeses overall is divine. There was medley of mushrooms that I could have eaten all night. Bacon wrapped dates, olives, and the crostinis are so intricate it will blow your mind. 

Mains: 
Lobster ravioli- done in a light lemon olive oil over spinach. Fantastic and a refreshing change from a heavy cream sauce. 

Prawn pasta - must have! It was a tad heavy on salt but a house hit and rightfully so. 

Rack of Lamb- I'd get this next time. Tasted my mom's and it was so well flavored - no gamey taste at all! 

Surf and Turf- if you love steak the sauce on this is was something I've never experienced. Like a cherry wine sauce - Devine! 

Good luck getting a reservation but man she's worth the hassle!!
