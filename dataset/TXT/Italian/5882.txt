_T2Aa3Vf5t68PqqxvzoX0Q I called for take out and was told about 35 minutes wait. I got there 45 minutes later, the food was not even cooked yet. I eventually got my take out after another 40 minutes wait on site.  When I got home, the  calamari/shrimp appetizer portion was only half size what we got at the restaurant one week prior.  Chicken wings had no flavors. 

Called back to talk to the manager the following day, and he told me that they had recently decreased their portion, but they did not cut the price.  $ 14 for a small portion shrimp/calamari  appetizer is not comparable to their competitors. Monterey Bay calamari is only   12.95  and Atria's is 10.99. Both are much bigger portions.  I would not recommend this restaurant.
