aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ Our first meal in AZ on a recent short vacation--and it started off things with a bang.

We both ordered the 4 course prix fixe. The parsnip soup was light and thick at the same time, with just a touch of cream. Homemade hand-folded spinach tortellini, when cut into with a knife oozed out a rich mixture of marscapone cheese. The wild striped bass was salty and perfectly cooked, resting on a bed of thick, tasty risotto. 

For dessert, they were sweet enough to let me sub in the peanut butter s'mores ice cream sandwich. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. It was decadently ridiculously rich and tasty. And apparently every table gets a complimentary cotton candy to nibble on while you wait for dessert. My husband's toffee pudding was a surprising hit.

Service here was wonderful, friendly and prompt--especially great given the crowd they had this evening.

Lastly, this place is seriously affordable. When the bill came, my husband thought it would be double what it was. That's what living in the Bay Area will do to you. But it could be practically called cheap...for a full 4 course meal and more than a few glasses of wine.

Amazing place. We thoroughly enjoyed it and wish we could return, often.
