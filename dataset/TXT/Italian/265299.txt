wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw I am a HUGE fan of Postino East! The food gets five stars. It is fresh, tastes amazing, and there is a good variety of sandwiches, soup, and salads. I eat here once a week. The service gets four stars. The wait staff is very pleasant but is usually slow. They do a team approach and I often think they assume the other has taken care of you, when in fact no one has been over at all. Overall this place rocks and I will continue to be a regular. This is my go to place for a delicious lunch.
