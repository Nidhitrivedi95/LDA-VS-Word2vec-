J1qzIVBt3lGpiz-8UdjhXg Oh pasta... so great and delicious. I love pasta. I never read the reviews so I don't know what to expect. 

I ordered the chicken breast fettuccine. It was good. It had chicken breast, fettuccine, broccoli, mushrooms and the sauce was Alfredo sauce. I liked it. The person who was with me ordered some spaghetti with meat sauce. I tasted it and it was not bad. 

The best thing, in my opinion, pretty much every meal was a 3 course meal. You start with some warm bread to share (if you're with people) and then either a soup or salad. Then comes your dish. Finally you get either vanilla ice cream or something that is a mixture of pistachio, cherry and chocolate. I chose the latter and it was also good. 

The service was pretty good for what it was. Our waiter seemed like he was in a rush, not that he was rushing us though. He just seemed like he was getting overworked or something. Although he was so fast, he was not bad. 

Although this place is very good, I won't be a regular. I'd definitely come back though, just not consistently.
