I hear the chatters of the people, "were going to Lucci's, Lucci's is bomb" and so on. Not like I have never eaten at Lucci's before, but it's not on the regular agenda. To be honest, I really don't remember what I even ate my previous trips, which leads you to believe that it's nothing to write home about.

I stopped on my travels the other day cause i was in the area. It was just after they opened around 11:15. It was quite chilly in the bar, and there was a few at the bar, and a couple in a booth at the end of the row of booths. Not busy, we were in the mood for a supreme pizza.  there is no supreme pizza. There is a chicken supreme, but know regular supreme. If you build your own supreme it can get quite pricey. So we kindly asked if we could swap out the chicken for Pepperoni..no problem. Just saying...they need a supreme, or you pick 5 toppings.....again, just saying. 

Now don't take that for a bad review. The toppings are fresh, the pizza was crispy, & I loved the crust. It's just that I LOVE me some pizza, so the pizza has to jump off the table and do a jig on my plate to be remembered.

So go to Luccia's, it was good! I just can't rank it over a 3 for pizza standards.

I will be back to try some other dishes.
