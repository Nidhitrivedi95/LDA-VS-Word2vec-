kz7O0_o6WrDQk1Kl8dKeHQ I went to Stock and Stable with a friend just a few days after they opened. I expected them to be packed for happy hour, but we got a spot at the bar. I can't comment on the food, but the drinks we had were just alright. The hh specials include 3$ off specialty cocktails and some food specials, which is a decent deal. I got a very odd green drink that had matcha, honeydew, and wasabi... it was super weird. I didn't love it, but my friend liked it alright. To be fair, the bartender offered to make a different drink, but I didn't think it was bad enough to warrant that. My friend had a gin drink with blackberry that was much more pleasant. The drinks that look the most delicious were the cocktails that came in a pitcher... not sure how large a party you need to order a pitcher, but I would like to try the one with the chai... yum. The service was fine and the food coming out looked good. I would definitely like to come back for happy hour another day and try some other drinks and some food. I also love that they get their pastries from Lux... awesome!
