haGstZfcH0IeRPncH2oFPQ Expensive pizza, long wait and a disappointment when it arrives. We ordered while at Terrestrial (FYI Terrestrial is fantastic please go there) and had to wait 35-45 minutes for a pizza that we had a few slices of and threw out.  I can't remember the last time I actually THREW OUT pizza. 10/10 times would never order from here again. Not good. I hope that this place reads their Yelp reviews and gets it together. Pizza was lukewarm, cheese solid and non-melty and honestly I think their sauce is from a Prego or Ragu can. You live, you learn and you do not return.
