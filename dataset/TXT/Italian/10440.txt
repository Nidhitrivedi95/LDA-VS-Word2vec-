0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg I'm a huge Scott Conant fan thanks to Chopped, so while in Vegas, I had to try his restaurant.  We couldn't get in until 10pm, but it was so worth the visit.   I enjoyed the Crispy Fritto Misto to start, followed by the Apple Glazed Kurobuta Pork Chop.  That pork chop was BY FAR the best chop I've ever had.  
Ever!

Like seriously!

It was charred perfectly with plenty of juice from the chop.  I really didn't even need the apricot mustard.  Honestly, I could have had the chop alone.  Well that and the Il Dolce Lemone.  
For dessert, I indulged in the Strawberry Souffle with vanilla gelato.  

Everything was impeccable.  Even the the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli that  I tasted from my cousin's dish!  It was well worth the splurge and would go again.  For sure!
