My caprese salad was divine with some of the best fresh mozzeralla I have eaten since Rome and the selection of hairloom tomatoes - divine.  The mahi mahi fish tacos were also gluten free and simply delicious.

My server was attentive, funny and charming and even offered me a newspaper to read on the way to my table as I was dining alone.  A lovely venue and highly recommend.
