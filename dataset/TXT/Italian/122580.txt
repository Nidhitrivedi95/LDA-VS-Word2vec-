hh-N1r9O1JpvzGw1mp0bKw First let me say, I was in a foul mood when I said to myself, "screw it just try this place though way too many hipsters have said they like it." Thank you inner I hate the Ogden voice. 

This place is so good I'm Probably going to have a restraining order placed on me because I'm going to always be here. 

I wish I'd made notes of what I had with names but F it. I had some Indian type of noodle dish that I wanted to go sit in a corner all "Girl Interrupted" and just curl up in my chonies with a fork and this stuff. 

Right now over 24hrs later I'm eating COLD leftover noodles with fried chicken pieces on top. Slap my left nipple cause it's twitching from a tastegasm! This is seriously freaking good. I'm talking spotting a republican congressman in a park bathroom wide stancing good. 

And oh my gawd Chandler Bing! The fried pickles. Yes. Breaded fried pickles. Hi, I'm going blind cuz I'm touching myself ever since I put the fork in my mouth. The #foodporn is killing me up on this beeyotch! 

Note: the rock n roll theme is totally authentic. The owner seriously knows his rock, especially the cheesy stuff. I'm loving this joint go support it so I've got a place to get my #snackgasm on!
