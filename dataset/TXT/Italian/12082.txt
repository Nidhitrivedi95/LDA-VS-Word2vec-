0URIvKxCNT-AVgtdYFAX8w Solid Italian fare, reasonably priced and well executed. I'd not been here for years and by the looks of things the ownership has put a focus on reworking the menu to include a wider array of offerings. I went for the linguine and calamari which was tasty and was a generous portion. They've got a good wine list and the desserts were tempting [homemade cannolis!] but I deferred. Service was both friendly and efficient. A word to new patrons: it's best to approach Harley's from northbound 7th Avenue and turn right into the driveway just south of their building; any other method [particularly during rush hour] takes the skill and the sheer determination of a kamikaze pilot.
