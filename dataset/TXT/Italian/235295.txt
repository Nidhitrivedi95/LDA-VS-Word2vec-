TVKenh65WwJX3zEr36zKCA I think I would have a higher review for this place if it wasn't called OYSTER Bar. 

As someone who has been looking for a good local oyster bar near my house, this was why I made my way to this spot. 

I have enjoyed a few dishes here that are off the menu and its delicious!!The guys behind the bar look like they know what they are talking about , however my experience has been at the surrounding tables.

For a place called an Oyster Bar, all three times I have been there, the waitresses (multiple) look at me like I have three heads when I ask what KIND of oysters they have. And in all my trips there, they usually have two kinds only.

Oyster lovers know it isn't the size of an oyster which makes it good, it's the flavor, the brine, the feel on your pallet. 

The oysters are bland here, whether it's east coast or west, north or south.. Doesn't matter. They don't taste like the sea and I walk away missing the oyster experience I was looking for.

Good list of wines that pair well with seafood, and like I said, some of the main meals are great.

I realize this is just a local place where the Sunset Station regulars like to get their drink on.. But WAH!! about the oysters. 

Oyster fans be warned.
