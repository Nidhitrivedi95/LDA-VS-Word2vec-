Although Champaign does not have a Blazed or Pie Guys, Azzip comes a close second. It is a chiptole version of thin crust pizza. You step right up and select the size of your pizza and the associated sauce. I went with the italian red which was a bit under powered in spice/flavor. You get to chose one meat and each additional one for 1 dollar, finally you get unlimited veggies. I found that the selection was quite limited with spinach, sundried tomatoes, baby portobellos (however they are so finely sliced), and green peppers. Avoid the chopped garlic and onions at all cost as the oven does not cook them well enough and they end up tasting raw. Overall I actually was impressed with the thin crust even though it lacked the crunchiness and smokey flavors you get when cooked over a brick oven. For a quick meal inexpensive meal you can't go wrong with Azzip pizza.

Pros: Inexpensive, quick, customizable pizza

Cons: Lack luster sauce, not cooked in a brick oven, very thinly cut veggie ingredients

Hidden deals:
Hooked app gets a big pizza for a little zip price at dinner on some days
