GMriYorKj1v-dhhJ1om-Sg This place is great. One of the neatest pizza restaurants I've been to. 
The service is quick and extremely friendly. The appetizer menu is good but I love and recommend their new fried zucchini sticks. The pizza menu is a bit overwhelming due to the variation. From Mott Street Meat Lover to Joey's Favorite (vegetarian), the're all good.
New York's Finest Cookie n' Cream is my dessert of choice. Warm oatmeal cookies over soft vanilla ice cream. I just can't get enough of this stuff.
