fbLYRHIZAt3q839whhaBUg NOT IMPRESSED. Went in for dinner on a Saturday night. Very slow service, very s-l-o-w. Noticed the table next to us ordered after us and received their pizza long before us. Complained. It still slow service. Ordered antipasto salad, very large salad but not one peppercini on it which was a featured item. 
Will not be returning:(
