38-sjGYYVcQEKrZe5Nu47A Staff was so friendly! We got the family pack with 5 pounds of wings and you can get five different flavors. (The hot is really hot). You also get a salad and a whole pizza with one topping, all for $45. It's a ton of food for a great deal. Pizza was delicious and wings were really juicy and had a lot of meat. Great place!!
