me17NOULVwu40AdKGYHIaQ Our new favorite pizza! Been searching for the right pizza in the area and this is it. Boyfriend likes Joe's NY pizza but something in the crust or sauce always tasted funny to me. I think Rocco's sauce and crust are the perfect combo. Our usual is a cheese pizza and sometimes will splurge on calories for Zeppoles. So good! Wings could be better. Prices are good and pizza maintains freshness for a couple days so you don't have to throw leftovers away.
