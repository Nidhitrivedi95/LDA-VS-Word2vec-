OJ6zfenoK-eBNI7vvNrOsg I went out for a nice dinner with some family here one evening. The staff is incredibly nice. It probably didn't hurt that my father is Italian and he spent a good portion of the evening chatting up the waiter. He told us not to bother looking at the menu and that he would have the kitchen make whatever we were in the mood for.

The food was good, but a little disappointing given the price. (Given that I'm a student, my opinion on financial matters should be taken with a grain of salt.) That said, still a lovely place to pass an evening!
