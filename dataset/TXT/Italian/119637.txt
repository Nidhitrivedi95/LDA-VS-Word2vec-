H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g This was a disappointing restaurant. 

While the service was very good, the food left something to be desired. 

For all the acclaim Mario Batali racks up I was surprised by how mediocre the food and drinks were.

We ordered a wide variety of appetizers and pizzas to share -- nothing stood out.

I walked away from Otto unimpressed.
