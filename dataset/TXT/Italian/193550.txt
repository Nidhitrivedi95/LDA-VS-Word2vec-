If you are going out with just two people I would skip on this place unless you know you can eat a lot or want a lot of leftovers.

Our waitress was really nice and friendly. I was very happy with the service we received.

We ordered the fried zucchini. Even with four people eating it we ended up with the most leftovers of this. I really liked this dish and was impressed and was better than I thought it would be. I wasn't able to eat a lot because it was a bit on the greasy side and quickly filled me up.

For dinner we ordered the ravioli's and a side of meatballs. We didn't get the actual meatball dish because it came with pasta and we knew we wouldn't be able to eat all that food. I was smart because the pasta would have been too much. I really liked the meatballs. They were really tender and melted in your mouth. I would like to try the pasta next time though.

We opted out of dessert because we were all too full but if you have enough room I'd say go for it because everything I saw looked awesome!

Overall, good just very filling.
