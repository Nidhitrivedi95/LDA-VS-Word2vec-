9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg I came here with a friend a few weeks ago for dinner. The ambience was very lively (they had a dj!) and the waitresses are attentive. Although it could be a little loud for conversation. My friend and I had to raise our voices. There is a bar area where you can drink and watch sports and there was dining area with booths and tables. They have a lot of seats and the interior is very pretty. 
As for food, we ordered Tuscan salad ($12.23), classic spaghetti & stuffed meatball ($16.52), and Sophia pizza ($15.23). All our dishes were DELICIOUS! Apparently their mozzarella cheese was made fresh daily, and the pasta and pizza were handmade as well. The spaghetti was very different from what I used to have: it's more dense and firm(?!), in a good way. And the meatball was divine too.
Overall a pleasurable experience, and I'm definitely gonna come back for other items and will recommend to others for a nice, casual dinner.
