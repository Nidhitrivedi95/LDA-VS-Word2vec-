9ziTZnV4H0YNPxCch3sVjg OK, so this Gilbert Red Brick Pizza isn't that much different than the other Gilbert Red Brick Pizza. BUT, one thing different is, I never tried the gelato at the other one. Big mistake!

Red Brick Pizza's gelato is made in the store fresh every day. They rotate between 50 flavors, offering 12 at a time. I thought the pizza was a little shy on the sauce and the store wasn't as clean as the one I usually go to, but it's hard to complain when the gelato's this good!
