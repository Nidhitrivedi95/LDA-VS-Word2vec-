fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w First off, this is my first review and it starts off with a single star rating... not a good sign of what's to come.

We decided upon OTSB after realizing it would be a long wait at Brooklyn Bowl.  We were seated fairly quickly and the hostess was very pleasant and she was just about the only positive on this visit.
We then waited 20 minutes before anyone even GREETED us let alone took a drink order.  Two waitresses argued over whether or not they had our table and finally our drink and food orders were taken at the same time (since we had 20 minutes to review the menu).  
We then waited another 25 minutes before we even got our drink orders.  Meanwhile, I can see the Executive Chef and one of the managers talking non chalantely with no sense of urgency about anything.  
It was another 10 minutes to get our food.  We had a group of seven of us and they brought out two of the dishes.  It was another 10-15 before we got the remaining dishes.   
We spoke with the manager and made our complaints known and to his credit he apologized and comped some of our items.  But the damage had already been done and we were all completely dissatisfied.  
You would think that a restaurant would treat a larger group of patrons with more priority seeing as they can have possibly a larger purchasing outcome.  This was not the case.  It was disorganized and the timing for EVERYTHING suffered greatly.  It's unfortunate that experiences like this can mask other possibly great attributes to the restaurant.  It seemed like a cool place to grab a bite to eat and drink and to be honest, I don't even remember how the food was because of horrible lack of service. Notice I said "lack of service". I didn't want to take away from the server because she wasn't horrible.  She just wasn't there.   I can only attribute that to the management and their lack of ability to manage that situation more promptly.  
Sorry, but as locals, we will not be returning to this establishment.
