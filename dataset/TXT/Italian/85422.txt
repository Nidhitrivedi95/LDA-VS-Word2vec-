He helped us ordered by telling us what was his favorite.  I had the gnocchi with their vodka sauce. It was amazing.  My friend and I also shared their meatballs. Do not skip out on the meatballs they are really really tasty.  Overall this place is amazing and I will be bringing alot of my friends back.  A truly hidden gem.
