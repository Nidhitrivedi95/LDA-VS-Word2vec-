YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ My friend and I went to Mac Shack for lunch and we both loved the concept of "create your own" pasta.  I was informed that the restaurant is owned by the same folks who own Nora's and that they're considering franchising Mac Shack's.  

All of the ingredients were extremely fresh and tasty.  I enjoy I had the special, which was linguine with pesto, portobello mushrooms, green peppers and shrimp.  My friend had whole wheat pasta with vodka sauce, eggplant, broccoli and olives.  I thought her pasta tasted much better than the whole wheat pasta I normally buy in a box at the supermarket.  Neither of us could finish the whole portion, which included a small roll.  There are take home boxes available next to the soda station.

This is a nice, inexpensive place to go with anyone, especially a bunch of picky eaters... they can make their food to their own liking.  You can specify to "go light on the sauce" if you want.  The decor is actually really attractive with Peter Lik photos throughout.  Beer and wine is available - yay! - and the patio looks like a nice place to enjoy dinner when it's not over 100 degrees!
