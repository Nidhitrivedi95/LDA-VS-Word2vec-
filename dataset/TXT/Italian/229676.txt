T7yKffTuhiIZclsgjfgowA Beautiful day in Kensi Village and always wanted to try this place.

I had the arancini balls that came with arugula and un sauced.  I'm use to having marinara sauce with the arancini balls, but these were so good they didn't need it.

I had the Margherita pizza which I devoured. Cheese, crust and sauce was all on point.

Will be back definitely!
