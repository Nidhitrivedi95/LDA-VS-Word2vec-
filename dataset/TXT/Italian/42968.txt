7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw This was my second trip to Arizona that we went to visit north italia and what can i say in 2 days we ate diner there 2. The food was just so good we could not resist coming for a second time. 

The food at this restaurant is really out of this world. All of the food is made fresh onsite and you can taste the effort they put into all the food. The spaghetti noodles are hollow in the inside for more flavour the garlic bread has just the right balance of everything including garlic truffles and cheese. The service was good as well as the ambiance.
