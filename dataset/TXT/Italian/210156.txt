qvQ-i1HgSloSJLkGnXsfhw My dad used to work down the road from here oh, (hack cough) 40 years or so ago, when I was ... wait, I'm dating myself. Stop that Janet. 

Ahem. Anyway, our family ate a lot of pizza here over the years, and I'm happy it's still here. I like mushroom and  black olive pizza... my dad put sausage on his half. Of course he's since had quintuple bypass surgery but I'm quite sure it had NOTHING to do with the pizza he consumed. No, of course not.

I'm  also quite sure we never had pineapple. I wonder when that showed up on the menu?

My mom used to eat eggplant parm,which was covered in marinara and gooey cheese, and my brother would eat a mountain of cheese ravioli. I remember the portions being really big. And I remember the garlic bread as being pretty good. 

I'm headed back here next time I'm in town with my kid so she can check out where grandpa used to take mommy. I love it when places  have been  around longer than I have been.
