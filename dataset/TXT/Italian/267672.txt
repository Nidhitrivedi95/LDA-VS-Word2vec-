XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q First time dining at Olive Garden and I like it. They had me at unlimited salad, soup and breadsticks but we had to try their linguini de Mare and their herb grilled salmon too. Stuffed! 

The salad was fresh with just the right amount of dressing, my zuppa toscana was warm and comforting. The linguini de mare was oh so good with lots of juicy shrimps, mussels and roasted garlic. I used the breadsticks to soak up the pomodoro sauce from the bowl. The husband loved his grilled salmon and  broccoli too. He actually insisted we give Olive Garden a 5*

Our server Shaunte was welcoming, helpful and just wonderful. Oh and I got a complimentary black tie mousse cake just for signing up to their mailing list. 

This is a family-oriented restaurant. We will be back but next time, I'll stick with the soup and salad.
