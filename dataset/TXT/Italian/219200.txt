S8_W8gxq1I5r61iiy_Xt0w Fresh made pasta, good sauce, good service, lots of seating. 
I think their staff needs to all be trained the same way because I have been there on multiple days and each time the pasta I get is all different. Sometimes too watery, sometimes not enough sauce, or too much sauce. The garlic bread is either too garlicy, or not enough. I can't say it has ever been consistent. 
Regardless, on a good day, you can get a great bowl of pasta.
