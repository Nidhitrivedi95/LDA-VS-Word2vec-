esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA five stars for the oysters! this is as delicious and fresh as it gets! especially in the summer when vegas is at its hottest. i cant get enough of their cocktail sauce either.

ladies beware though, theres a waiter that stares at boobies.. and he does not do it discretely. 

but other than that, everything was just fab. ive had a pasta dish there before and it was really good.. the bread and butter is yummy.. and the waiters (minus the boob-staring pervert) are funny and likeable

oh yeah this place is in Harrah's
