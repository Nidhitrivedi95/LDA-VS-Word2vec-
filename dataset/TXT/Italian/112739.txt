Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg The two stars are because the food is good.  They got 0 stars for service.  
I recently went to this metro pizza location for the first time.  I went during lunch since they have a 1/2 off pizza special before 4pm.  
My issue started when I showed the server my check in redemption for one free non-alcoholic beverage.   
This tall brown haired server immediately thought I was probably a cheapskate and not going to tip well.  His demeanor became lackluster and nonchalant as if my presence was that of a nuisance he couldn't be bothered with. 

The worst part is I love metro pizza.  I have Been going to the Decatur and flamingo locations as well as the Ellis island location for more than half a decade.  
I never had an issue with those locations. 

* please do not offer a discount if your workers are going to act in such an imbecilic manner to its patrons for fear of a tipping issue.  If the service is impeccable and well deserving of a 20% or higher of the unadjusted bill prior to discount, the server should not be worried. 

After it was all said and done, I being the bigger man.  Approached the server informing him that his 25% tip was left on the card and let him know I usually tip in cash ( screw the IRS ).  
Now he can enjoy having to be forced to claim the tip on his taxes.  

I was so flustered from my service experience that I had left my box of pizza slices I had to go on the table.   Anyone who knows me will tell you that I never let good food go to waste.
