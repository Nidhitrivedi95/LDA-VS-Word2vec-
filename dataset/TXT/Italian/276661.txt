yFUvKpW66cNsYXD6inDsog First time dining here. The menu is diversified but too pricey compared to other similar restaurants in the Scottsdale area. I asked for the music to be turned down twice and although they weren't busy, it never happened. 

The food was fresh but very bland. Salad was plain and the dressing was non descript. I ordered their evening special-Osso Buco ($30.00 range) and although it was tender, the sauce tasted like gravy. The vegetables in the dish were way over cooked, appared mashed. The sauce can make or break this entree.  I was dining with a business associate and didn't feel comfortable complaining given the circumstance. We were heading to an event afterward and didn't have time to re-order with the service being pretty slow for 5pm on a Weds. night.  She ordered salmon off the menu, it looked good but overpriced at $24.95. There are far better/more upscale places that are superior.  I was disappointed overall and won't be back.
