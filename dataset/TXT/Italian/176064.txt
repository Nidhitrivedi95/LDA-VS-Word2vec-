NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ My mom and I just happened across  Montesanos's by doing a Siri request for Italian food.  What a great discovery!  Just a little hole in the wall place in a strip mall on Eastern.  As a business owner myself, I know how difficult it can be to get staff to do what you need them to do on a consistent basis.   These guys knocked it out of the park.  Genuine smiles, eye contact and service.  Managers greeting arriving repeat guests by name. As I'm originally from the east coast I got a warm fuzzy hearing the New York accent of the manager.  The food was wonderful !  Huge portions that thanks to my doggy bag will feed me for a couple more days.  I had the baked pasta with meat balls.  Highly, highly recommend.  :-)
