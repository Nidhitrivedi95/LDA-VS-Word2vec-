-R2z2womJA-NCA2Pbz181g Not good. I decided to try the lagsania and it wasn't worth the price. And there is a bunch of peppers in it so it's kinda spicey. Gave them 3 stars for turning a old Wendy's into a lucrative restaurant also only tried one menu item so Im giving the benefit of a doubt other things will be better.
