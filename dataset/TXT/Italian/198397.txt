pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Seriously, over 1400 reviews? There isn't much I can say that isn't already said. I'm not a pizza snob either - there are very few pizzas that I dislike (even the frozen Totino's I like).

With that said, the pizza was good. It had a fresh feel to it. Kind of like it was homemade on the spot.

I sat outside so I got to hear the hosting and it seemed like people were having to wait a lot, even if they had reservations. Guess being popular is a good problem!
