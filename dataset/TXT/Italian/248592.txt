VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ After spending way too much time (and money) on Las Vegas Blvd it was nice to get away to a local sports bar to watch a football game. Atmosphere is great, plenty of TV's available from all seats with the ability to watch multiple games at the same time. 
We decided to hang out in the pool table/video game area. Even though we weren't at a table or bar we were given prompt service from the bartender and got our food and drinks ordered. They have a standard bar menu with plenty of items to choose from burgers to seared salmon. As we were here right in the middle of the afternoon I just went with their bratwurst sandwich. It came out pretty quick and was actually not bad at all. It cooked perfectly, bun was lightly toasted and came with a generous helping of fries. They have a full bar available with a wide selections of beers on tap. There is a Yelp special of getting their house whiskey for free if you check in but drink at your own risk! All and all, a great place to kick back on a Sunday.
