QDvUdj36I_oAzXoFzCQnNA Great pizza, nice people, and overall good food.  The place is small, and they seem to be busy a lot so the wait times aren't great, but whenever I'm in the area, I always check them out.  I think it's their sauce, but their pizza does have a distinct flavor, which is good.  It can get a little loud in there, but I like the authentic Italian feel that it gives.
