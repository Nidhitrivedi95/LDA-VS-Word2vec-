wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw Postino's is a favorite due to the atmosphere but the $20 wine and bruschetta board is the best deal around.  The only thing that you must do is get there before 8 p.m.  Even if you don't drink like someone in my party, you can enjoy anything from a salad, panini, soup and other munchie items!
