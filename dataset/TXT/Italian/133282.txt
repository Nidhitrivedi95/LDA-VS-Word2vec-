iLLzOJLU4tPAN9UUHlyZiQ Has some family and friends in town and decided to give this place a try... party of 8 for dinner on Friday night.

Ambiance - good! we ended up eating outside... and while the noise with the traffic and the music and the foot traffic was a bit much it worked with the weather and being outside

Service - good! It felt like there was a team of people tending to us and they were very engaging, knowledgeable, and responsive\

Food - this is where it was a bit of a let down... while the food was good (we had various dishes - Octopus appetizer, Burrata appetizer, Lasagna, Shrimp Scampi, grilled caesar salad, grilled salmon, kids meal... ) and we were told that this was a James Beard award winning restaurant and that the lasagna won is a Food Network Bobby Flay competition... it wasn't particularly notable. Let me put it this way... they had award winning prices... but not award winning food, per se. While it was certainly serviceable and wouldn't have sent anything back... it wasn't quite worth the prices - and would probably prevent me from coming back as it just feels as if you can... pretty easily... get better bang for the buck elsewhere.
