q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA This is my new favorite lunch/brunch destination.  Great discovery!  Outdoor deck was terrific.  The menu had so many great options that I had difficulty deciding what to get.  I finally ordered the chicken sandwich (not doing the actual menu name justice) with brie and a wonderful salad with home made dressing to die for came with it as the side.  Seriously, I didn't think that a chicken sandwich could taste this good.  Can't wait to go back to try the crepes!  Heads up...they are not open for dinner.
