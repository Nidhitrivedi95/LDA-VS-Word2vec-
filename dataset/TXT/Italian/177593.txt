NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA A group of us stopped by for an early lunch before seeing a White Christmas. At 11:30 we were about the only people in the restaurant though by 1230, it was packed. I was surprised to see that the majority of the space inside was taken by the bar. There were some tables in font, on the side and behind the bar but, I imagined the inside space to be bigger the several times I walked by. 
I started my lunch with a half house salad. Within a few minutes our waitress brought out the first course. The salad consisted of bibb lettuce, candied walnuts, pears and goat cheese in a white Balsamic dressing. I opted for no goat cheese. The sweet dressing paired nicely with the crisp pears and crunchy walnuts. There was even a small piece of a savory bread loaf on the side. I honestly couldn't have asked for a better salad. Everything about it was perfect. Speaking of perfection, within a few minutes, my entree - Margherita pizza arrived. This was easily the best Margherita pizza I have had in years. The San marzano tomatoes tasted like the we're picked off the vine and crushed specifically for my pizza, so fresh. The house made mozzarella was melted to perfection. The crust had the exact amount of crisp and crunch one would desire. I almost didn't want to share but alas, I was unable to finish all of the 8 (!!!!) slices so I offered it around. I also happened to get to try a few of the desserts on the menu which changes frequently. My favorites were the apple jack Gelato and the cherry cheesecake with a fruity pebble crust. Who knew that kids' cereal could be reinvented into something so yummy. I felt like we were in an episode of Chopped. Overall, the service was great, the atmosphere was pleasant and the food was incredible. This will be my new go to before seeing a show.
