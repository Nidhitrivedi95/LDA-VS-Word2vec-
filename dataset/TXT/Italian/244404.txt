uTBm1BXwhdUcLJy2-IIQTA You know what, good for you Angela's...against all odds, you hold your own...Kudos to you!

This place is located in a very unassuming shopping center off of Margaret Wallace Road.  There used to be a snowcone place on the same strip and it was robbed so they closed down.  The gas station across the street tends to bring about every criminal in the greater metro area and truly there is nothing else on this side of town worth your while so you have to be intentionally seeking out Angela's if you don't live in this area.

All that to say---even though it doesn't have the glitz and glam or the notoriety of other restaurants, they truly do hold their own.  Their pizza is very good (crispy crust, not soggy), their meatballs and marinara sauce are very good (trademark of any good Italian restaurant), their calzones are tasty and even their salads are good.  The atmosphere is that of a typical, old school Italian restaurant..nothing great. 

I would say if you happen to be in this area then stop by...but chances are you aren't going to be in this area if you don't live over here but I would advise making it your business to give Angela's a try if you are craving good solid Italian food.  We all know that Charlotte is hurting a little bit in terms of authentic Italian restaurants and Angela's definitely puts a band-aide on that problem.  Give them a try, they won't disappoint.
