HnQI-Beh6W9iX23hPgSTRg Went here on a Friday night with friends from work. The whole night was excellent. The decoration, ambience and all the small touches (silent buzzer for getting the staff's attention, even leaving reading glasses in the bar area for people to read the menu ) made us all feel very special. 
The service was excellent, the food was fabulous all home made fresh pasta, breads and desserts. 
Would thoroughly recommend this restaurant, can't find anything to fault. Must be the best place to eat in Scarborough it was a great evening and can't wait to go again.
