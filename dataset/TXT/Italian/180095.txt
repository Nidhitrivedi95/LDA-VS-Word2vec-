nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A This isnt SPECTACULAR Italian food but it is pretty close. We went with two 70 year olds plus a 9 & 11 yr old and everyone liked their meal. This is one of the few restaurants on the strip that actually has real windows to the outside world (no fake ceiling here) which was refreshing. A little loud in the dining room - but then is Vegas known for being quiet? 
We had:
Salumi plate- salumi was terrific, cheeses better than average, olives OK
Eggplant parm- on app menu & can be shared even though waitress said it was too small for sharing. Easily enough for 6 to share
Scallopps- not very Italian, was it bacon? too over cooked but polenta & scallopps were perfect
The lasagne was HUGE & very good.
Kids chix parm was a large sized portion and excellent. 
Chix marsala came with 3 pieces of chicken!
Ceasar Salad was tastey but way over dressed. Very soggy. Ask for less dressing.
With a bottle of wine & tip our meal for 6 was $300. Not an inexpensive night out so don't be misled by the lower $ on yelp. 

Perfect if you have a mixed crowd & need something for everyone. Can't beat the Ventitian atmosphere either.
