_qA2HPqgLiBc-M4wRyml0g Yum yum and more yum!  Enjoyed a date Night out with the hubby. We ordered:
The burrata appetizer- if you love burrata you will love this yummy combo! The Sicilian and the White pizza with arugula- both fabulous and we had left overs!  Then we could not pass up the sticky cake- wowza!!!!  Everything was perfectly prepared and our server was also great and made great recommendations!  We WILL be back!
