GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA We had an amazing dining experience here six years ago, a dinner befitting the Batali name. So we were excited to return. Unfortunately, this visit was like going to a mere shadow of the previous restaurant. We ordered two apps and two mains, and none of the food rose above the level of "average." Sadly, this place shows its age in terms of food quality, and the place is Batali-in-name-only. If you're reading this and deciding whether or not to eat here, I'd try somewhere else.
