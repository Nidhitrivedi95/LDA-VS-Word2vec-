PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ We have lived five minutes from this restaurant for five years and never ate here. I wish we had sooner now. 

Great food and atmosphere and reasonably priced. We shared a Caesar salad, pesto garlic bread, chicken Parmesan sandwich and rigatoni vodka. 

All were outstanding and generous portions. By far, the rigatoni was our favorite. Great vodka sauce! Sandwich was good, but I would just get chicken parm as a dish next time.

Service was top notch and we didn't wait at all. On top of all that, it felt great to support a local, family owned business!
