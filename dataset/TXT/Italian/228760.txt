SXgVJz5aIvbeCXWvg0ZuNg Pizza peel is AWESOME! They have a ton of tasty options. My friend and I stopped in at the end of the night on a Friday and were VERY excited to discover ALL pizzas after 12:00 were only $5!!! How did I never know about this!? We had the Tongs Thai and Buffalo Chicken... Both scored a 10! Our service was great as well, Scott and Michael were helpful in our pizza selection and were very friendly! Would highly recommend this to be everyone in Plazas last stop of the night.
