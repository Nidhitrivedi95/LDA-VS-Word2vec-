MtvN8vMiKcLkkz_tCvBx3g The portions here are ENORMOUS. Came here for restaurant week and hit up the price fixe.

My first course was a pizza. It was delicious! Very good for a place that doesn't claim to specialize in it. The cheese and sauce were the best part: creamy/salty and sweet/tangy without being overpowering. Nice balance. It was thin crust, and that was okay, too. However, this "personal pan" could have served as my ENTIRE MEAL.

My second course was the NY strip. Good. Tasty. Didn't knock anything outta the park but no complaints.

Ended the meal with a slice of cheesecake which was awesome. However, it is not as good as the Palm's. Not as sugary, not as big, not half as good!

Washed everything down with a red wine that was on a pretty good deal. Came here last year for restaurant week as well and I must say neither time have I been disappointed.
