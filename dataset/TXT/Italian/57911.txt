ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg Very poor service, came during sports hours. Staff refused to change it to a station we of our interest. They do have 5 T.V.s  Was actually told "I am busy."   Beside that the pizza was doughy with a minimal amount of cheese. Salad was overpriced and just average, and calamari sauce was watery. Staff were advised how upset we were after telling them I had a groupon and suddenly tried to be cordial.  Left wanting to go to Costco for pizza.
