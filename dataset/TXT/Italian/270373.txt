xmWs-su5eB5_57CIw4sqfw My niece wanted pasta tonight so we decided to yelp a good pasta place.  We found Ginas on yelp and decided to give it a try.  We both ordered the spaghetti pomodoro and it was fresh and delicious.  Great service! Restaurant isn't very big but it's a great romantic spot to take your loved one or significant other.  Can't wait to surprise my husband and take him to this cute and romantic restaurant!
