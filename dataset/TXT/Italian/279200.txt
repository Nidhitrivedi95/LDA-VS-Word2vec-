yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Battista's will always have a special place in my heart. My boyfriend proposed to me here. The food is great (the garlic bread is the best hands down) I love the atmosphere, and the service is all done with a smile. The menu hangs on the wall at each booth, free wine, and hearty portions of food. You will not leave hungry. 

The parking is a mess and the strip mall is very questionable, but they have a posted guard which made me feel safe going to and from our car. 

LOVE THIS PLACE!! Just try it!!
