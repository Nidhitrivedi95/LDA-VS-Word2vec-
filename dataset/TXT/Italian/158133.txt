LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA We really like this chain. Good quality food, fair pricing, large portions, nice decor and excellent service. The family style is great for large parties, everyone gets to share. We ate here tonight for our anniversary. Our server, Christine, was excellent. We had the chicken parmesana and the tomato basil soup, with a bottle of 14 hands merlot. Everything was delicious! 
Only suggestions, please notice water glasses and bread need refilling. Also, a few more options for vegetarians would be appreciated. There are usually more items to choose from when eating Italian food. We always know we will have an enjoyable meal at Maggianos
