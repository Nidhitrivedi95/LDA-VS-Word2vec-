EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw I went to Crudo last night starving so I knew I needed lots of food! We came for happy hour at the bar. Luckily, it wasn't too packed and found a place to sit quickly. Hubby ordered the Dark and Stormy and I ordered the Daquiri - I must say, they make a "mean" cocktail! It was refreshing, sweet and strong, but not too strong. I barely can taste the alcohol but after a few sips, I started feeling a little too happy. 

We first ordered the Ricotta Mozza - it was delightful! It was gone in 2.123 seconds, I think. They only give you three pieces of bread, but they will give you more upon request. 

We then ordered the Ahi Crudo and the meatloaf burger. The Ahi was amazing - just like everyone said on the reviews I've read. The meatloaf burger wasn't that bad either. 

So here's the issue: I normally assumed that these three dishes would be enough to get full. Hubby and I normally share one burger at other restaurants, but this time, it wasn't enough! I needed more! I ordered one more meatloaf burger and finally, I was calm and ready to take a nap. 

For happy hour, our check was a little high - $62 plus tip for two. However, I loved every bite and every sip. The service was good as well.
