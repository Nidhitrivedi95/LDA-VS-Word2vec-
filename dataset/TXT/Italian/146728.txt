Never get the escargot they were not good at all - but to be fair that was clearly a terrible menu pick at the italian restaurant by the gf. Veal marsala was pretty forgettable. They do give you little garlic rolls to start, unfortunately the marinara sauce was very watery and bland. Overall solid 3 star establishment.
