aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw Very disappointed in the service from the beginning. Initially they refused us entrance because my husband wears a Scottish kilt, they stated that their dress code required a collared shirt and pants. After speaking to more than one manager and the concierge, they allowed us to eat at the bar.  We watched them admit several men in torn and faded jeans and sloppy polo shirts and were pretty upset when they allowed a loud drunk at the bar in a plain t shirt.

The food was very good, and though the bartender was friendly, he knew nothing about the fish on the menu and recommended the special because he could tell us what it was.  I am very allergic to gluten and he told me that their breads were gluten free.  After sending him back twice to check again, he finally confirmed that it was not.

The fish was amazing and the desserts were a perfect ending to a good meal.

The food might bring me back, but I will probably never return or recommend this place because of the service.  If I am paying that much, I expect a little more!
