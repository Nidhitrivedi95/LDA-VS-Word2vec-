PebX-Sf_h4FJGgsRAA5Fng A great app. And glass of wine to top off a beautiful day here in Az! Salmon with asparagus drizzled with a pesto sauce. The asparagus was cooked to perfection. This is my favorite dinner or drink and light bite at the bar place.  You can never go wrong with the specials and Clara, Giovanni and staff always make you feel welcome and at home. I love to see the support this local mom & pop place is getting from the neighborhood. **** I would recommend reservations on the weekends.  There is something on the menu sure to please everyone in your party.
