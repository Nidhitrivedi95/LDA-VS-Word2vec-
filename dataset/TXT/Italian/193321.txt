pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Local gem, similar to Ferraro's .
Terrific ambience, bread delicious and desserts of tiramisu and spumoni ice cream fantastic.
Spinach faro salad w/chicken was very good and lasagna was some of the blandest I have experienced.
Noodles tasted doughy, meat sauce had NO meat and when I told my server Sebastian, he simply shrugged his shoulders. No credit given , no replacement offered.
