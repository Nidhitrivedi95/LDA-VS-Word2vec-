klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw Outrageous in price with mediocre food and a snobbish atmosphere. For the amount of money you pay, one would expect better quality. The society salad I ordered was totally bland and chopped into such small pieces that I almost had to use my spoon. I didn't realize I had ordered baby food!! 
The service was not any better. There was just an air of arrogance that made our experience uncomfortable.
