KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg I'm rating this place so low because the service was flat out HORRIBLE tonight. I'm always generous with gratuity, but I only left 10% tonight and that was kind. Believe me, she didn't check on my table once. The drink I ordered at the start didn't come until after the bread was eaten, the salad was eaten, and the pizza came and was eaten. We were done, then our drink comes? Going out should be a nice experience, I liked the pizza and the salad, but I'll have to give my business to a place that values their customers.
