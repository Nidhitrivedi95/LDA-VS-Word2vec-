FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA This place rocks. I enjoy this location even more than the other. Yeah, parking sucks but the secret is come early. We arrived around 6:30 and were seated right away, had no problem parking and service was fast. 

I tried the Soup of the Moment, which was a tomato based soup with a cheesy bite. It was delicious. 

We also ordered the brushetta. Their brushetta is the number one reason I frequent Postinos regularly. As far as the brushetta goes, you can't really go wrong. I've tried everything and have loved them all. The newest one on the menu is a sheep's milk cheese with tomato jam. It is probably my 2nd favorite. The prosciutto with figs & mascarpone is my number 1. 

If your looking for a hip, fun and delicious wine bar/restaurant your search is over.
