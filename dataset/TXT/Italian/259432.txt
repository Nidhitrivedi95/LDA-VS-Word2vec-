wkZ6P5fDw0G_iFRU-hzBhQ I was excited to try this place based on recommendations from friends.  I must admit they were a little pricier than I thought $21 for 16 inch pizza, with upcharges for certain toppings.  I ordered a vegetarian pizza topped with jalapenos peppers which came at an extra charge and a peel pepperoni with pineapple, which came with lots of pepperoni and $1 extra charge according to their menu.  The lots of pepperoni was a bit of exaggeration.  I guess what turned me off is how they nickel and dime you for extra toppings. They even charged me for a side of balsamic dressing.  I guess given the initial cost I expected the little extras to be free which they weren't or the pizza to be extraordinary, which it wasn't either.  It wasn't bad just ordinary.
