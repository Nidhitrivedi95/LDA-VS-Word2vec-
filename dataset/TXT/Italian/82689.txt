DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw I have no idea how this restaurant got such high rates!
We have been there for the "happy hour" menu.
The spagetti with meatballs ($12) was litteraly one scoop of pasta and one dry and untasty meatball on top. The sauce tasted industrial...seriously it was less than a kids portion wish I had a picture of it.
Rest of the food came in tiny portions as well and way overpriced for the taste and quality especially for a happy hour menu.
We paid $50 for 2 tiny pastas with tomatto sauce and a sample of ceaser salad including tip.
Will never be back again.
