P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw I would never even have given this place a second look had I not seen it on Triple D. I decided to try it because I figured it would not be on the show if it wasn't any good. It was only alright. First of all, it is definitely a bar. It looks like a strip club on the outside and when you walk in, its dark and smokey. I'm not really a bar guy so I kinda felt out of my element. I will say however, the staff was really polite and helped me get what I needed. I ordered the Naked City Pizza and an order of Suicide Fries.

The pizza was only okay, but the fries were delicious!. I loved the creaminess of the buttermilk sauce and the spice of the suicide sauce! 

In the end, it was okay but there are better places with a more comfortable atmosphere. Not for people like me but not bad.
