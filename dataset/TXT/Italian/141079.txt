jluEI1ZDQDeJlbl-M3YH3Q Came to Toula from a recommendation, and decided to try out the summerlicious menu. 

Food:
I ordered he Caesar salad with the hopes it would be a gourmet or more elevated Caesar, but it was a regular salad you could make at home, with one tiny shrimp on it with dried bacon. The menu said it had Parmesan chips on it but it didn't come with that. The scallops were also sandy and not cleaned properly. We got the steak as our main, and asked for medium rare, and it came to us medium well. Nothing was seasoned and the veggies were pretty much raw. Our friend ordered the sword fish and it was dry and overcooked. The mashed potatoes I'm almost 100% positive were boxed powdered potatoes. They were like glue and tasted like boxed mashed potatoes (I lived off of boxed mashed potatoes in college, it's a taste and texture you can't forget) It wasn't the worst food but definitely not the best, especially in terms of quality, definitely not worth the price had we paid regular price.

Service: 
Service started off good, but when we declined to buy drinks, the waiter became almost immediately rude. He would pour everyone's water and skip mine cause I was in the corner, he would pick up everyone's plates but mine and make me give him my plate, and he was very inattentive and didn't ask us how the food was once. For a place that's supposed to be a bit classier, I would expect much better service, but the waiter just seemed like he couldn't get rid of us any faster. He also yelled at us when we asked where the ATM was in an annoyed voice "Around the corner!!!" Without providing actual direction.

Overall:
We are not fancy people and we rarely get to go dine at nice places, Summerlicious allows us to try fine food without burning a hole in our wallets. We felt like the waiter was annoyed with us the whole time and wanted to get us out. The food was okay but had too many mistakes. I give the view a 5/5, food a 3/5 and the service 2/5. We will not be back.
