NILiO6pq_0vLnCUn7KuU0Q While driving through Madison i had to stop for lunch, so i jumped on the trusty Yelp and found out about Fraboni's and made it a point to stop. I got the Otto sandwich, I really enjoyed that. my fiance got the alfredo fettichini and liked that, the prices were right for the portions, I liked the little store they have as well which seemed to have some great intalian food, next time i'm in madison i'll have to stop.
