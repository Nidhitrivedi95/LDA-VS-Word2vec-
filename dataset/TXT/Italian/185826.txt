OMf69ePEdHXvaqAlCCI01A If you love GREAT food - that is reason alone to dine at Cibo e Vino.  Our family of 5 had dinner here during a visit to the Phoenix area.  The service was great and the food was unbelievable!  The restaurant is a great family style place tucked in the corner of a shopping center.  From the starting bruschetta to the finishing homemade cannoli, the food was just amazing.  All five of us loved our dishes.  I had the Cioppino and it was outstanding.  I was surprised at some of the other reviews, but many seemed to be service related complaints, which can be hit or miss with many places.  I can tell you that even if I knew I was going to get bad service, I'd still visit Cibo e Vino because the food is THAT good!  Definitely recommend if you are in the Cave Creek, AZ area!
