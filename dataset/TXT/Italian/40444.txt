The last time I was with a large group and they treated us very well! Not an empty glass in the house! No problems with the service. 

They do try to steer you towards the more expensive entrees (the meats), which is kinda off-putting, and saying that the pasta is not eaten as a main (basically telling you how you should order) - if I want to order a starter and pasta only, I will, thanks! It's one thing if you're informing the guest on portion sizes or whatever, but phrase it that way vs telling people what to order. 

The bread, butter and tallow they give you at the start is delicious - maybe my favorite thing! The mashed potatoes with egg yolk and bacon is very impressive looking but not sure it added anything to the already creamy potatoes. 

All in all, you can't go wrong with some antipasti and a petite filet!
