GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ My friends and I got settled into our hotel @ the venetian and we starving when we arrived. We thought a burger was a good choice and this place is in a super convenient location. So, we went to B&B

HANDS DOWN WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER GOTTEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE
I never usually complain about something like this but, it was BAD at this place.
It took us 5 mins for a host to seat us when there was no line up. 20 mins to us get waters. Another 20 mins to get menus and another 20mins for them to take our order! The only reason we actually got service is because we had to flag down someone to help us...
It was rediculous. There was a different person bringing us stuff everytime. Plus, the food was pretty over priced for what it was and just mediocre. Never coming back to B&B again!
