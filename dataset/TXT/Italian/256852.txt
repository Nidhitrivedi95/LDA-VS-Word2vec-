w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q When we think of fine dining, we think steakhouse.  This place is top on our list, and that's hard w/all the fine steakhouses in Las Vegas.  First our waiter was so awesome, great NY personality and just added so much enjoyment to our dinner.  He treated us well!  Must check out their online specials, we ordered the steak and lobster special and it was such a deal.  Our waiter also allowed us to change our choice of salad and sides.  We also brought our own wine bottle and he didn't charge us a corkage fee!!! Unbelievable!  I am so sad that I didn't write his name down, but he has a shaved head.  Hopefully that helps, make sure to ask for him.  The lobster was like buttah!  It was soo good, plus the steak was done the way we wanted.  Our side of beans and potatoes was great too!

The ambiance is great, lots of cool drawings and caricatures on their walls.  I believe this restaurant started in NY and if you are a frequent diner, you can have yourself drawn on their wall!

We have also come here for their happy hour.. cheap eats and such a deal, but just be forewarned there are no specials on drinks, so that can get your wallet.  Must place to go in Vegas!
