SEH79jbg5Q8cCozCnhqMHA We ordered take out for my father who was just getting out of the hospital. They couldn't have been more efficient or accommodating. The food even though take out was authentic and amazing.  Portions are good- it's pricey but worth the money for a great meal and experience.   Pasta- homemade and cooked to perfection.  The veal w/Gorgonzola that my dad had put a huge smile on his face.  Pear salad not great but it was take out so I can't really judge.  Going back to dine there this weekend.
