wSpUTl9Bho2WRo9C5p_-Pg My girlfriend just had brain surgery and she was having difficulty hearing and was depressed. Another friend said to take her here for lunch. It was a quieter place and she could hear us all talk! We went and they were having this terrific deal 2 for $20, salad, pizza and two glasses of wine. The pizza was delicious, we shared the Chicken Pesto and it was just enough pesto, not too much. The wine list was extensive! They could not have been more accommodating (turning down the music), checking on us multiple times and ensuring our lunch was perfect!
We will be returning soon!
