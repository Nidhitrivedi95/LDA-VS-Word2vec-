abIpel3j-MAAW4EzsRRl9w Food and price was good. But the service was lacking, the waiter never came to the table. He gave us a picture of water to serve ourselves! The first picture of water had  something floating in it by the way!! He opened up a bottle of wine and did not  serve us our first class!!! He gave us bread  without butter! He never check on us  to see if everything was fine. It was like he did not care ....
