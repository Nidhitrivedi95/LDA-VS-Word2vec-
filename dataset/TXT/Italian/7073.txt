0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw Just a little update. My husband and I ate breakfast here the other day. The line to order wasn't too long, but I have heard it can be out the door some mornings. I ordered the smoked salmon omellet with a side of fruit. The omellet was stuffed an a massive amount of cream cheese and minimal salmon. I found the salmon to be salty and there was simply too much cream cheese that I had to scrap off a big chunk. The fruit was good and fresh.
I do enjoy eating outdoors when I come to Joe's, but I find myself trying to get away from bugs and making sure none fall in my food, so I may have to stick to eating inside.
I'll still keep the four stars as I do enjoy dinner and the service has always been friendly and quick.
