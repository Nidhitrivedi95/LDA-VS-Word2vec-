366FaRQ1MWEHBhaEKTcriQ The Excellent: 
* Spicy Italian, with added Feta and Black Olives. Yum. 

The good: 
* Price was a little high, but it was a delicious pizza... Price would have been better a few bucks cheaper. Delivery fee is high ($5). 

The Bad: 
* I had a hard time finding a current menu on their website - The link doesn't work. This lead me to order a thin crust pizza I didn't know was thin crust (I prefer thick). But hey it was awesome, so no big deal. 

Overall though, awesome pizza, and it hit the spot.
