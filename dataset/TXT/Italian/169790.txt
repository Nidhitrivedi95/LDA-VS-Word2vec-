mSWNf1muSy9wgGtMRgt7Fg If you like poor service and overpriced food this is the place for you! We used to come here regularly after work but I declare this will be the final visit. Our table of 9, one of two parties at the tavern, were asked to quiet down.  Fortunately we can now sit quietly and enjoy the awful music.
