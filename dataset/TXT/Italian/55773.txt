aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw This place is beyond overrated.  I don't want to knock the service because that was very good (though I feel we were somewhat pushed to order more than was needed) but seriously, what a scam.  One dish was just bad. Pasta was fair and the fish was good but way to expensive (and why not bring the potatoes after they filet the fish so they are at least warm).  Bartolotta was too busy kissing the ass of the people who bought white truffles for 90 bucks a piece, and hanging with the truffle reps to care about what was going on in the kitchen. I wanted to say something to him but ultimately decided against it but am now regretting it.  I usually use Yelp to write about good meals that I've had.  Enough people complain about bad meals.  This was one situation that I felt I needed to share about.
