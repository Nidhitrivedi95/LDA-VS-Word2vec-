AKQbrvRBZvU5kB9Ut4gVkg We were here twice during our visit to Pittsburgh one weekend.  Our hotel was right on Market Square, and we were looking for good restaurants within walking distance.  The first time we visited was for lunch and we split a pizza - Salsicce and Rapini and it was outstanding.  Wonderful, thin crust authentic pizza.  The second time we needed a light night snack and sat at the bar.   Il Pizzaiolo had no Cabernet (my red of choice) but the knowledgeable bartender offered me a few options and I picked one and was really happy -an Aglianico.  I would definitely order it again.  We split salumi - excellent stuff.  The kitchen was open late on a Saturday, the service was friendly and helpful, and while there were lots of customers, seating was available.  There is a wine bar upstairs, but we didn't have an opportunity to visit that part of the restaurant.
