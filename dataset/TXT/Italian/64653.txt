Bgf9B9d_2rDQHQvE9TnOZg Delightful little place just East of Roncy on Queen. Sat out on back patio and shared Burrata (mozza cheese ball) with tomatoes, radish and balsamic. A dark rum and saffron martini for me and a Pear & Earl GreyTea spritzer for my lady. But the crostini was the star.
It's Thai-inspired, but menu (mostly appies) had a more Italian bent. Will stick a pin in this one to come back.
