OTWUYSpnNT9q18oep5WmAg Have visited here numerous times within my 2 years of living in Stow and have always had friendly, courteous service. We are always seated fast, bathrooms are always clean, service is friendly and always with a smile. The only real complaint I have is that their jojo's are horrible! But it's not because of the staff, you can just taste that they're frozen. Otherwise, weather its pick up or dine in I have always enjoyed this location & its staff.
