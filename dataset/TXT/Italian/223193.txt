sKrt4CMGyG8YAjxVkk4hPQ Having walked by this strip on an almost daily basis for the last year or so, I had no idea Fusaro even existed until a friend who works and lives nearby suggested that we come here for lunch.

For a tiny place, this restaurant has an abundance of choices on their menu, on display, and plenty of places to sit, including a quaint little patio, perfect for a summer's day like today (the inside is a little bit hot)

You line up long their display to order your food, whether it's panini, fried foods, salad, pastry, pasta and pay for it up front. If you are ordering it for here, they will deliver it to your seat. I had their Sciliana, which is a penne with tomato sauce and hot italian sausage for $11. It's a bit pricey but the portions are ample and tasty. The best part is while you're standing in line, they have free snacks while you wait, including brownies and appetizer flatbreads. 

The line is long during lunch time, but it's definitely worth the wait.
