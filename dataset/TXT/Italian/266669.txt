x4mhAhgIVUd205iXMoyzCQ You would think after visiting Italy and cooking italian food so much when I came back that I'd be sick of it by now.
Nope.
Can neva be sick of it!!

Stopped by here on my way home from taking a drop in local Aikido class.....
Was in an odd area of Eastern, seems to be in the middle of no where but perfect spot to stop off and great parking.

Craving pasta. 
After about 18 yrs since my first trip to Italy - I pretty much ruled out ever finding that similar dense pasta I had in Italy here...
 

First thing I noticed coming into this place: It was full of Italian customers. Good sign.
(Sorta like any Asian resto - if its full of that same culture as what it is serving, it is always a good sign)

Just had the pasta - Plain ol' Spaget and Meatballs. Wasnt plain ol' tasting though. Dense heavy pasta cooked perfectly ! Hit the spot!! Had the home cooked hearty feeling. 
Apparently some of their pasta is home made but not all of them, but still pretty good. 
My friend loved their dish as well.

Gave us complimentary warm toasted  dunked in olive oil bruschetta which was so yum. 

Very friendly staff. 

Did not rush us out of there.

Prices were reasonable too.

Will go back and will recommend! For family, friends or even a date. 

Yummy!
