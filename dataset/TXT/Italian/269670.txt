xJKVVTSIAwmSiY3cGJYwfg Had a birthday dinner for 9 people for 8:30 pm on a Friday night.  By the time our party arrived and we were seated it was 9:00 pm, and this was not an issue.  The server was very attentive and carefully took our orders, making helpful suggestions.  When queried about wines, the sommelier was sent our way -- and proceeded to make excellent white and red recommendations tailored to our likes.

The meal itself was well presented, and quite good.  The short rib I had for a primi was well portioned and had a delicate blend of flavors.  The spaghetti which was highlighted as the signature dish was quite good and subtle in its preparation, with the tomato and basil flavors present but not overpowering.  At our instruction, the server even had a chocolate dessert with candle brought out for the birthday girl.

Overall, it was an excellent albeit pricey meal.  Expect about $100/person for both appetizer, entree and wine.
