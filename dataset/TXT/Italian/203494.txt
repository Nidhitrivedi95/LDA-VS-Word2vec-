q5GKRL_u3YsP8ADaU4uNbw I LOVE Carmine's Pizza Kitchen! Best pizza and food! 

In response to John M. below, I have been going to all of Carmine's restaurants for over 35 years here in the Las Vegas valley. I am absolutely shocked at your experience. I have only ever felt as if I am in nothing but a family atmosphere. After all these years I find it very difficult to believe what you're saying. And, why would he give you $20 of he only owed you $4.05?
