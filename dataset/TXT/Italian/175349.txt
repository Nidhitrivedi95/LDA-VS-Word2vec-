I've eaten in there a couple times and they are always on the ball when it comes to taking care of the customers which is a big plus. They bring out complimentary bread and oil/vinegar with every meal so you get a free mini app when you dine in. Their best pizza is the grandma pizza in my opinion but it is all good. The only down side is that while it is still in downtown charlotte it is kind of too far out to walk it to anything else if you are going out after dinner. Just a kind of weird "in between" location. Oh yeah, as far as pricing goes it is probably what I would call moderate. I had a app and lunch for 18$ the other day so if you go there with a date you could easily hit 50$+ for dinner if you added drinks onto that.
