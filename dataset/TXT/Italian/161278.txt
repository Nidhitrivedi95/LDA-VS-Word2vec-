lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ Being a Saturday evening, it's hard to find a good eatery without the long wait.  This place, located in the mall between Mandalay and Luxor, was still half empty around dinner time so we sat down right away.

My BIL got me an Italian Creamsicle to start with, as I needed a drink (one of those days).  Pretty yummy if you like sweet drinks like me.  I ordered the Bowl of Pastabillities (create your own pasta) with rigatoni, pomodoro sauce, and shrimp ($14.95 pasta/sauce + $5.95 shrimp = $20.90).  One of my kids got the spaghetti and alfredo sauce with sausage and shrimp (+ $3.95 sausage = $24.85).

The pasta was just okay, nothing special.  My hubby's meatball sandwich ($12.95) was okay too.  My mom and sister shared a Caesar salad ($11.95) and an 18" Choked Pig pizza ($29.95), which had pesto aioli, mozzarella cheese, bacon and artichoke mix, topped with chopped basil and whiskey sour cream (they wanted to try something different).  They said that the taste of anchovies in the Caesar salad dressing was strong, and the pizza was eh (I tried it and I didn't really like it).

Overall, the food was average at best but overpriced.  Service was nice so I gave it 3 stars.
