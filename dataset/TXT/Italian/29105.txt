The pizza was excellent - a tad bit greasy but nice, crisp crust.  The sub was as good as any I've had back in New England;  very soft, juicy meatballs, toasty bread and a side of shredded lettuce/tomatoes/onions dressed with a vinaigrette for toppings.

My girlfriend and I would certainly come back, Yelp deal or not.  An excellent slice of what we truly miss from back home in Connecticut.
