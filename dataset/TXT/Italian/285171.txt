zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g Happy Vegan! My man loves the meatballs here but for me its all about the vegan cheese you can add to any pizza. For the longest time we only made pizza at home for lack of awesome vegan pies available at restaurants ... well Dom's has done it for us and the pizza is fabulous! *and this is coming from a new yorker*

 We usually get the arrabiata w/ vegan cheese roasted red peppers and mushrooms and OHHH LALA  I am in love! Great for take away or eating in...and they will make their salads w/out cheese if you ask ...
