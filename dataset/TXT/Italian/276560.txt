YFqlMM1tFn0C4b9aHdzOgg Was in a party of 20. The server was overwhelmed, but handled the situation like a 'trooper'. 
My wife had a couple of glasses of house wine which was priced at  $9/glass. Mind you, this is the 'house wine' which was Chianti. At those prices, the server should have recommended getting a bottle.
My wife had the Veal Marsala, which she said wasn't worth $24 and came up short in taste. I had the Spaghetti and meat balls which was. decent @$15 but I thought the sauce was really thick.
Wonder why you can't view the menu on Yelp?  Other sites where the menu is displayed, the prices are out of date.
