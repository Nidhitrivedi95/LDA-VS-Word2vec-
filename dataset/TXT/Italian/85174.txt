The waitress was awkward and seemed to be confused by the menu prices and the wait time to actually get our pizza was a good 40 minutes and we were given paper plates to eat on. I don't think I've ever had that happen at a sit down "restauraunt" where I had to pay 25.00 bucks. Right before we had to go ask for a to go box an older couple came in, sat down, ordered there pizza and we're brought Real plates by who appeared to be the manager or owner. After only 15 minutes which was less than half the time it took to get ours, their pizza was brought to them with a warm and friendly greeting. Not to mention our drinks remained empty half the time we were eatting. Needless to say we felt snubbed and will not be returning.
