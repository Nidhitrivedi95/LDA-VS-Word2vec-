lgWB0yGXpZvupYREWxtV7g Went here for brunch,  and since it's next to Lux why not get a coffee.  I brought coffees for all my gals and the staff have me an attitude about it... I thought,  rude, but didn't make much of a fuzz about it.  My other friends got good service,  me, it was like i was invisible.  Sorry,  I promise not to bring coffee in next time!  ;) the food is good,  but not worth the cost.  Great bread,  pizza  dough but really not enough to go crazy or recommend others to try.
