H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g Honestly I had pretty high expectations for this place seeing as I've been to multiple Mario Batali restaurants in NYC. This place was such a disappointment. The waitress was pretty snippy and unhelpful during the meal. The pasta we ordered was all way too salty. I'm a huge pasta fan and I was so sad I couldn't enjoy it. I would not recommend coming here. There are so many other Italian options in the hotel that I imagine are much much better. The only things I enjoyed were the wine, croquettes, prosciutto, gnoccho and some of the salad. While that seems like a lot, I left with a disappointed heart and a stomach half empty.
