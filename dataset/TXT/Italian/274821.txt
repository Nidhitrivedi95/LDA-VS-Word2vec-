y769FA7VJOW4QQYdYlR62A This place is so good I 've probably had every pasta on the menu.  It's freshly made and you can tell the difference!

As per pasta my favourite is bucatini, carbonara and pomodoro.  Depending on my mood I alter between the three.  Bucatini is a thicker noodle, red sauce, and a spicier sauce with pieces of guanciale.  This is my go to dish.  Pomodoro is a basic, simple, delicious red tomato sauce.  And carbonara is carbonara.  Rigatoni is also good but too much in my opinion.  Skip the cavatelli it's too pea tasting and the tagliatelle is almost too oily.  The only thing I would mention is that sometimes there is not enough meat... however I've provided feedback and they given me additional meat free of charge!

For pizzas, they're kind of focaccia... I would say fungi and suppressants are good.  Note that the pecking duck pizza is not served at Sudbury location.

I've had both the panna cotta and semolina cake... they're good however rich.

The staff and ambience is great!  Definitely a must!
