TaTjCuAu6digyuZNBo0fag Takes too long. Everything is great, food is delicious and decent value, but they are slow slow slow. Make sure you are not in a rush! Even ordering takes too long - there is a fair bit of streamlining that needs to be done. You pick up the food when the pager rings, and you pour your own water, and you clean up your own table (they expect you to sort your dirty dishes too, onto specific shelves for each item) which is fine, but then why does the credit card reader ask for a tip? Get rid of that...
