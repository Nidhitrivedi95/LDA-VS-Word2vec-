muvmtEIt9XhDkMwYwALSGA Hubby told me about this place when they first opened but didn't get to try until today. We took our 20 month old with us for lunch and were happy with our experience.

The place is big and airy, and decor is clean.  The 2 pizza ovens are in eye catching gold and they have impressive appliances in their open kitchen.  We ordered the meatballs appetizer, a Caesar salad, and a classic margarita pizza with meat.  Along with a latte.  Everything was delicious but what was the most satisfying for me was that crispy sweet basil on top of our pizza! Just YUM!  Would have loved more sauce on our meatballs coz the crostini that came with the order was a little dry. The Caesar was a bit over dressed for me but my hubby liked it so this is just a personal preference.

Last but not least I must comment on their spa like restroom. I fell in love with the lemon verbena lotion and now I am on a hunt for it! Apparently I am not the first who took photos of their restroom because it is that nice lol!
