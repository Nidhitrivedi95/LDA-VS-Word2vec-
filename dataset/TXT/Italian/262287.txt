wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg You know when you have that long-time crush that you finally get to go on a date with, and while you're there you're all giddy and smiling, but once you get home you realize that it wasn't all it was cracked up to be?  That's my experience with North.

I went to meet a friend for their happy hour, and it was an absolutely gorgeous day so we sat at the bar outside.  The patio is very inviting, comfortable so it was nice to enjoy our meal out there.  The thing is, that is honestly the best part about North; the atmosphere.  Overall it's hip, casual, and seemingly a great date place, but the heart of the matter (the food) is solidly mediocre.  We got the cheese and meat board, which was enjoyable but nothing extraordinary, and I took a salad and pizza to go.  Now, while I was there swilling my glass of wine, I was thinking about how much I was enjoying North and how I couldn't believe I hadn't been there earlier.  However when I got home with my food I realized that I had been under the "everyone thinks that guy is hot" aphrodisiac, because my salad and pizza were pretty disappointing.  The salad was TINY!!!  And I mean smaller-than a-side-salad tiny.  For $11 I expect to at least be half full after that.  And the pizza was okay, not great so it was an 0 for 2 on the take home scale.

I truly did enjoy the dining atmosphere at North, so I would go back to try the happy hour again, but if I'm looking for an all-encompassing food, wine and ambiance experience, then I will definitely go elsewhere.
