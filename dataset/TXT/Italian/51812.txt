The beginning didn't start off too well.  I had made a reservation using their online system.  The email came back as invalid. Their twitter account was infrequently used and only pushed their product.  Nevertheless, we took a chance in going in.  Not that it mattered because there weren't many tables filled. 

 We were greeted by a French waitress who seemed pretty friendly.  The printed menu was off.  Someone forgot to used left or centre-justified.  

Then between the time we got our drinks to the time to order, it was well over 15 minutes.  From there it went uphill.

We ordered the Linguini Gamberi (shrimp) and Gnochetti Sardi (Chicken confit with sauce).  The owner/manager asked if I wanted to try the pepperoncini.  Of course given my taste buds, I couldn't resist.  I was very spicy, yet tasty.  It didn't spoil at least my Gnochetti.  Very flavourful dishes.  

When the desserts came around, we were disappointed that the Nutella Bread pudding was off the menu.  They must have redone the menu because the waiter cam back and we were in luck.  Why would they have taken that off the menu if it's absolutely delectable.  I had the vanilla cheesecake, which was awesome as well.  

Although we had many servers at our table, the overall experience was pretty good.  I just think they should take the time to promote their business even more so with social media, an improved look on the menu and it will make their end product that much better. It would be a shame to waste such excellent talent and food if they don't pay attention to detail.
