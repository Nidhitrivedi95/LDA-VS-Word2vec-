BcLFIr4wtd3GQ3fnz15yDQ Another great food find in the Strip! Authentic Italian food, this isn't one of those places that claim to be Italian, it's classic Italian! So good, I got the prosciutto panini it was so good! I also took a bite of the pignoli cookie (pine nut), it was also so good! Highly recommend!
