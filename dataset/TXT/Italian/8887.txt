0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ I recently visited this amazing restaurant and it was just that amazing. I have never had brick oven pizza and this place did not disappoint. I mean from the second I walked in to the moment I left it was spectacular. I enjoyed their Roma Brick oven pizza and it was more than I expected. The customer service was threw the roof and they were very informative. I would recommend this place to all my friends who come to Vegas. Thanks for a great experience and lunch! 10 out of 10.
