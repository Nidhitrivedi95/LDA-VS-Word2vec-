sH9aI3xg-POBMp8R-kSQZg I have never been to this location before and I liked it.  The inside was very cozy and inviting.  The hostess greeted us right away and there was no wait.  The waitress was just wonderful!  She was attentive and helpful throughout the entire meal.  I ordered what I always get from their Eastway location: fettuccini with spicy marinara!  I'm a little boring, I know...but it's just so good.  I love spicy food and this sauce is great.  It tasted even better than the other location, more fresh.  The food came out quickly and I have no complaints!  I would love to come back when I am on the area.
