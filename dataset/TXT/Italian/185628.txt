OlvsH2r5A82qVVP1eSDNDQ Thank You Full House Pizza!  After an excruciating 1 mile drive home (the amazing smell of the pizza was killing me), I got to dig into my first Full House Pizza.  This is the BEST pizza around and it is run by really cool people.  We ordered the deep dish and it was cooked to perfection (see photos).

Let's keep these guys in business, order from them tonight!!!  If you are in the area, and you like Rosati's, you will love Full House, trust me!

On a side note, don't pay any attention to Nate A.'s review.  It is his only review and who gets sick from pizza anyway, especially for 3 days!?!  I don't think so Nate A.!
