N20Z6CmL1ZnCHYd2aojRyQ We brought my parents here for my Dad's birthday and it was an amazing experience!

Firstly, the service was top notch! The servers were really helpful about the menu choices and they treated my son like he was a little gentleman (he's 5).

Secondly, the menu options were unique and the food was delicious. If you are up for something adventurous try the "Linguine al nero di sepia" with squid, octopus, and squid ink...it was so unique and flavourful. But maybe don't have it if you're on a first date because it makes your teeth a bit black. :) The squash and sweet potato gnocchi was also incredible, and the spaghetti in the wine braised venison sauce was very rich and delicious.

The atmosphere was fun and the restaurant is decorated in a rustic Italian fashion. It was a great experience!
