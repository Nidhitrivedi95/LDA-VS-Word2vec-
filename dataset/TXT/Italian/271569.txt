They're pretty serious about the non-mainstream beers they keep on tap except for the Lagunitas which I was surprised to see but all the other ones. A really great range too, from stouts, to sours, to ciders. Food is really good here to. I'm used to great craft beer at a craft beer bar but great food too! It's an all win here.
