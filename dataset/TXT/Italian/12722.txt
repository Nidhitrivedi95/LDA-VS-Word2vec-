0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q Just celebrated my birthday at Sirio and everything was top notch! Since we had a party of 28, we were able to reserve a private dining area which was truly wonderful. The staff was very attentive and the food delicious!  They were great about keeping us on time so that we could leave in time to attend a show.  I highly recommend celebrating a special occasion at Sirio!
