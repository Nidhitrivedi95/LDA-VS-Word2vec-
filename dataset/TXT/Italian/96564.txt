ES8JP18I4sz72HEAWjk_KQ Reservation for two at 6:30 on Friday evening; were warned that the table had to be vacated by 8:00. Service was so brisk however, that even with soup as an appy, we had the bill by 7:20. Very noisy as there is little to absorb the sound. I had to ask a server not to bang my chair each time they passed (in fairness, they have v. little room to maneuver) We had two 6 oz glasses of the house wine, the soup of the day, and for mains I had the vegetarian risotto (runny.) My friend had the beef daily special, which she liked. The bill was $122.00. The tables tops are bare woodgrain arborite as in a cafeteria. There were no extras such as flowers or candles.  I've no reason to return
