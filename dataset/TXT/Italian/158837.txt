LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA my first time at maggianos overall..and it did not disappoint.  had such a great window seat, where you could see wynn and people busying around down below, since the maggiano's was in the 2nd floor of the building.  
i think this particular location would be great for lunch, or anytime the sun is out because the sun shines through the big open windows.
ordered 4 big pasta dishes (to share with four other people of course, but i would be down to eat all that), have to rave about the Rigatoni'D!! the sauce...made it what it is. a pesto, white creamy sauce sooo good, i definitely recommend it to everybody.  our waiter, i forget the name, was awesome..he had this cool accent and was so nice and helpful. the calamari was OK but ..the cheesecake was pretty good.
