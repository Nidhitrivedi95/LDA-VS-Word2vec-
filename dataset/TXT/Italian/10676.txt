I also ordered the yellowtail which was bland and overpriced, though the fish was really fresh. For my entree I had the veal ragu with fettuccine. It was ok, but something I could have made better at home. Plus, it was overpriced for what it was. The best part of the meal was the bread basket that contained a Stromboli with a side of marscapone, caponata and olive oil.

Overall, it's fine, but there are better Italian places in Vegas.
