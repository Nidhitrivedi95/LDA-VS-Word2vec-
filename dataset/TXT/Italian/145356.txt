k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ Went in with a few friends the other night.  Our server was nice but I wish he had been a little more enthusiastic when we asked what his favorites were on the menu.  The bruschetta was the best thing we had and we had four courses.  The food was good, don't get me wrong.  My issue was not with the flavor of the dishes (the toppings and seasonings were great) but more so the foundation of the food.  The crust of the two pizzas we had and the texture of the two pastas.  Just was expecting a little bit more of an approach that would set them apart.  Although dessert definitely satisfied my sweet tooth.

Overall I think this place would be great for happy hour and some girl talk and plan to do so again.  The patio is inviting and the ambiance is vibrant.  However, if you are looking for authenticity in the Italian dishes offered, I'd recommend they work on getting back to the basics.
