qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA Love this place!  The food rocks!

The establishment itself is small and it's in a casual area of the Canal Shoppes.  But the Spaghetti Aglio e Olio for a vegetarian really rocks!  There are a number of other vegetarian options.  I believe my wife has ordered the Tortelloni Alfredo and that's really good.  

Last time we were there we were with friends.  We ordered a bottle of cabernet sauvignon for the table.  I won't say any names, but our female friend poured her Pepsi into her cabernet sauvignon.  First off, I'm not sure why she ordered Pepsi.  Secondly, I'm not sure why she mixed the two but the pre-party might have had something to do with it.  Lastly, I had to try it out and it wasn't as bad as one might think.  Although, I still won't recommend that!  Order a bottle of wine and keep the Pepsi on the shelves!
