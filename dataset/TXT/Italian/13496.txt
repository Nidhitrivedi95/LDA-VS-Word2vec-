18NP-qL3VIJEBJGpns7aTw i've eaten at barro's locations in the east valley.  it's nice to have one in our neighborhood.

we ordered a pepperoni and ham & pineapple large pizzas.  they tasted so good.  they blew, LC, PH, and NNY pizza out of the water.  we loved it!  the wings had a lot of meat and sauce on them.  the cheesy bread sticks were great too.

we walked into the restaurant to have our orders to-go and there were 4 registers taking orders!  i thought that was cool.  we had our orders done in 20 minutes max and we were out the door.

BARRO'S MY STOMACH THANKS YOU!
