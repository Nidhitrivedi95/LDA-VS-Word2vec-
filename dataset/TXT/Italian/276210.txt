yE0f7SPDqafcaE1D8WsmDQ Went to Goodfellas over the weekend, The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, Hanging meats and cheese in a display case the Pizza and prep station on full view.  Now comes to the menu, prices range from $15-35, The pizza menu is a bit of rip off seeing a cheese and tomato personal pizza starts at $15 and the most expense one ending at $30.  As for the selection of Pizzas i found when reading over them that you tended to find one or two ingredients that sounded appealing but the rest left to be desired.  I ordered the steak at $29 quite frankly should have headed over to Ruth Chris instead.  The steak arrives apparently it is a NY Strip looked like a cheap breakfast steak pretty small no thickness whatsoever and is floating on a bed of Peas and Mushrooms.  Wife ordered the Risotto with mushrooms and Sausage, tiny bits of sausage and mostly cheese and rice handful of mushrooms as well. Order of Sangria to share came out in this over sized  beer glass which you are required to have a member of the wait staff come over to your table and ladle out some into your glass. Will not be back.  The service is excellent no issues there the only problem you leave feeling hungry and not satisfied.
