JsUprRhyzQyukZmAhcOg0A Great place for lunch after walking the mall or to even make the trip solely to come here! 

Tuscan inspired food with well developed flavors and plenty of attention to detail in the presentation as well as the preparation. 

To start, the bread... oh my... the bread!  Warm bread with perfection when it comes to the outer crust vs. soft inside ratio.   I should mention that there was also a crispy flavored flat bread  but honestly, I just could not get passed the Italian bread and butter!

We shared the Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip
 Served bubbling hot with Parmesan flatbread  ($8.95).   It was good, pretty standard restaurant dip but the flat bread served with it definitely kicked it up a notch. 

I enjoyed the Pasta Pomodoro with Chicken
 Angel hair with grilled chicken, tomatoes, pine nuts and a cilantro pesto drizzle ($13.65).  It was fresh with the chicken prepared and seasoned well.  The flavors complimented each other very well and made the dish satisfying but not overwhelming.

My companion had the Brio Bistecca Burger*
 With bacon, Provolone, lettuce, roasted tomato mayonnaise and Pinot Noir onions. Served with housemade chips. ($12.35) (sub fries for the chips)  Yes, a burger and fries at an Italian restaurant!  He seemed very impressed with it and commented several times that it had really good flavor. 

Service:  Very helpful, extremely pleasant and very accommodating.  

I should mention, if you sign up for their email club you receive a free meal of Steak and shrimp scampi for your birthday.  Being that I don't eat red meat and don't like shrimp they allowed me to substitute my entree for that.  By the way... definitely worth signing up for the email club! :)

Love this place whether for a casual lunch or would be a great date place too!
