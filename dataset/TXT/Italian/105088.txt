FQM4pVt1jeZcBGLIsXhXNA Wow! What an awesome restaurant. 
Though we went on a super busy Friday night- the staff could not have been more courteous or professional. 

We ordered the calamari for an appetizer and each had a salad. His ceases salad was delicious- dressing was fresh and seemed house made since it was distinctly good. It was a nice size and we would definitely get again. 
My house salad was very weak for the price and in comparison to my hubby's. It was super yummy but it was puny and was a bit of a bummer since I was starving from the wait. 
The calamari was really subpar as well. I wouldn't get it again because it wasn't anything special. 
I think the salad and the calamari were casualties from the very busy kitchen. I saw  others getting the same dishes and they looked different. 
Regardless, this restaurant still gets five stars!!! They were really struggling from the kitchen backup- but they handled it so well! True professionals. 
Also, when we got our entrees all was forgotten! I got the chicken rollatini and it was DIVINE. The fratellos sauce is what this restaurant is known for and rightfully so! A creamy, but light, but rich, unique sauce. Yum. I want to eat this again- huge portion of perfectly cooked and stuffed chicken covered in fratello sauce and mushrooms. Served with a side of pasta. Wow- this was one of the top meals I have had in awhile. 
My husband had the chicken Parmesan. Huge serving and so delicious. A classic done very right. The cheese was perfectly browned and bubbly and the chicken well seasoned. These two dishes made the evening. 

This is a real gem of a spot! I can't wait to go back.
