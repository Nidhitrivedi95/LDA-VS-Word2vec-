rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ My friend and I decided to give the happy hour a try last week because it's pretty much in my neighborhood.  Total hidden gem!  The atmosphere is warm and inviting with decor that sets a cozy/trendy vibe.  The customer service here is amazing!  The owners both take the time to meet and greet.  We ordered the Fire & Ice Scallops & Tiger Shrimp.  It was just spicy enough and delicious!  We also ordered the Samosa Purses and the Maple Leaf Farms Sliced Duck Breast which were both very good.  For dessert we went with the Chocolate Molten Lava Cake (see photo) which was delectable!  Catherine, one of the owners, is a total sweetheart!  She made our experience extra special by giving us a complimentary dessert tasting of the bread pudding she had made that day and chocolate chip truffles (see photo) which were super yummy!  If you're watching your calories or are a diabetic you can call ahead and make a special request for a sugar free dessert!  The happy hour is $2 off tapas and all cocktails even wine (i'm a complete wine-o so this makes me happy!) I would definitely recommend this spot to locals looking to take a break from the ordinary.  Hit the happy hour!
