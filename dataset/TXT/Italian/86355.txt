DtERMhgmOnKX2G4ln3MR4g I always crave eating at Nino D'aversa, there is something about it that feels like home and comfort Italian food at it's best is hard to deny. I've had 3 not so great experiences in a row lately so I'm expressing my frustration in hopes that something might change. Today I went in to pick up lunch for my office last minute. There was no line up so I proceeded to order. The lady behind the counter began lecturing me about the regulars not having any food left because my order was too large, and that I needed to call ahead. I ordered 12 lightly breaded, very thin chicken cutlets and found out they were $5 each as I was paying. My bill was $115 which was so over the top for what we had actually ordered, I paid and left because we were all starving. The food was all completely soggy, old, flavourless and really just a comical letdown considering my office was ok with McDonalds (and it would have been better and cheaper). The previous times before we had ordered pizzas and they came back 3/4 with wrong toppings. 

No need to go on, I'll leave you with this... Nino is a fantastic place that I have fond memories of. I think they need to work on the quality of the food, the length of time they keep it on the line for serving, and the general attitude of the staff. I might not be back for a while, hopefully they can change that though.
