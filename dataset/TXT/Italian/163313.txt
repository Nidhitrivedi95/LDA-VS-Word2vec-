lwpQQflP1CGJPV7QLybzOg Had a group of teachers come here twice on lunch breaks where we could actually leave school. They have some great lunch specials for pizza and we do enjoy the food.
However, we won't be able to keep doing this as it's pretty necessary for teachers to be back on time. Both times have been slow service, getting slower each time. The first time we went, we were only 3 minutes late getting back to school. The last time we went, this past week, there was only one other table in the restaurant when we came in. I specifically told the waiter that we had only an hour for lunch and needed to leave by a certain time, figuring this would fix the issue of last time. 
It didn't. It took so long to get our pizzas that we had to ask for the check as the food came out. 2 of our orders came out wrong and he tried to charge us for the fixes of their mistakes. He finally realized the mistake and fixed our checks but it took a while. Our checks came out right as we were supposed to be leaving. We gave him our payment methods and we didn't see him again for 10 minutes!! We were literally standing up trying to run out as soon as our cards were handed back! We were 20 minutes late getting back to school. It's too bad the service is so slow because we would have loved to make it our regular lunch stop.
