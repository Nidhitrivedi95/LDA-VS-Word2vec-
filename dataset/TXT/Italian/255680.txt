vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA Wow! Unbelievable food and experience! Literally the best pasta I have EVER had.  (and yes including Italy)I went with a friend since we were staying at the Aria, we got the spicy rigatoni and the tortellini al ragu and honestly can't tell which one was more amazing! The bread, pickles, salami and cheese they bring out before dinner is a nice touch. I am from LA and can't wait to go back and have this place again. Definitely a must go to...Best restaurant!
