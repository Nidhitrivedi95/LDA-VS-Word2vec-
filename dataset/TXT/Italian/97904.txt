EUQoB_ph7_xIyj7JZGI3bg the pros: 
a) freshly made pasta has to be the best i've had in a very long time. i think it's even better than any restaurant i've been to in manhattan's little italy. 
b) the veal osso bucco and bolognese were really good. 
c) the shrimp & calamari in squid ink pasta was unique. 
d) the mac n cheese was scrumptious. 
the cons: 
a) the meatball is too small and lacked flavor. 
b) the bread was nothing special. 
c) if u have more than 3 people in your party, u may wanna call first or try to get there before the crowd because it's a small restaurant. 
overall: come here to try the freshly made pasta, osso bucco, and the mac n cheese.
