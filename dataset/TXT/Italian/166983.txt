I was disappointed in the selection of "Italian" food, it was mostly pizza and sandwiches.  The only pasta dish they had was spaghetti with bolognese sauce which included Italian sausage, aka pork. Being that I don't eat pork it left me with only sandwich or pizza options which I wasn't in the mood for, especially when the pizza is pre made and reheated to order, so we left.  I would be willing to give them another try but it would be nice if they had more pasta options.
