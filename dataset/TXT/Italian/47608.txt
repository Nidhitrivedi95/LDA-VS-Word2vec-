8yiLVWzJyyTEhYE0fVNvlA Went here in early 2008.  

Service: Very condescending, made us feel uncomfortable throughout the dinner.  I think he was upset we did not order wine or appetizers.  Busboy was very nice though

Food: "free" appetizers were excellent. Dry cheese and a zucchini dish.  Main courses were not enjoyable at all...Shrimp al diablo and Canneloni. Portions were very large though..if only they tasted good :( 

Price: Extremely overpriced

On our first trip to Vegas, this was our one really nice meal.  The place was recommended by a group of guys on our flight in who told us they went to Vegas once a year for the past 7 years.  We were extremely disappointed and felt robbed.  Perhaps it was our meal choices....

Would only go again if meal was free.
