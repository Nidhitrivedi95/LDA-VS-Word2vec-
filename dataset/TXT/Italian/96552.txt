ES8JP18I4sz72HEAWjk_KQ Ok, so I will never go into Vero ( on Bayview) again. Although the ambience is nice, well it's average anyway, the waiter is awful. And it's always the same guy! Lol

He is rude, completely disinterested in his customers, and looks overall like he could care less. He acts bored with his cusomers, comes across like he is just going through the motions, and really he has no desire to actually deliver quality customer service.

I've been in there 3 times now, and will now officially not go back. I am always friendly to wait- staff, was a waitress myself for years. This waiter barely acknowledge's you when you walk in, and subsequently throughout your entire stay there. When my friend and I wanted to pay, we placed our debit cards on the table. He blurts out in such a crass manner, 'we don't take debit here!' That was it. No niceties, no friendliness. Our bill was $100.00. So it's not like we had a cheap bill. Not that that would warrant rude service anyway.

Useless. I was there this past summer , and he acted the same way. Blase, bored, 'whatever' attitude. Had to ask for a glass of water atleast 3 times before he brought it, with no apologies, no acknowledgement of the fact that I had to keep reminding him. God, who needs it! There are SO many places to go in Toronto. I will not waste my time there ever again.
