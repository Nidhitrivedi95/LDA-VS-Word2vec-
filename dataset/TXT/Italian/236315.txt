Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA Great good, great atmosphere, and great service.  

Federal Pizza serves up some delicious pies.  

The restaurant is decorated nicely and the lighting is nice and dim.  
The servers, hosts, and bartenders have always been kind and welcoming on every occasion.  

A great date place; you can have some ice cream at Churn across the street after dinner.
