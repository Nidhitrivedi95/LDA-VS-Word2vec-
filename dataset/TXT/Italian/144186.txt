jz4jg_OTw32IMr_sXFwj9Q Monte Cello's serves average-tasting Italian food. It's probably not going to wow you, but if you live close by, than it's a good option on days you don't feel like cooking. It's got a better atmosphere and staff than Olive Garden, and they use the No Wait app, which is convenient. 

I normally stick with the ravioli. The wedding soup is pretty good too. Steer clear of the lava cake - it tastes like something your kid might pull out of their easy bake oven. 

We've only had their pizza once, it was alright, once again, nothing special, but no complaints either. You always know what you're getting at Monte Cellos. The definition of a solid 3 stars.
