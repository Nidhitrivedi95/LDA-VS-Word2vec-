r4HkiC71nB9k8Fe8zIORFQ We live nearby but just never tried them. FInally we went. 

Food: Just not that good. Pizza was tasteless. Salad blah. Pasta nothing special. Neither of our tummies felt good afterwards (probably too much grease). 

Service: Good. Friendly. 

Atmosphere: Just above fast food. Bathroom dirty and not maintained - which means they probably aren't keeping up in other areas. Workers coming and going wearing aprons. 

Conclusion: Seems to be a family owned place that is on the decline. Food just isn't good enough to return.
