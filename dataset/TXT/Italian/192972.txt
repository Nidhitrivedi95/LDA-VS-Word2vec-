pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Nora's is probably my favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas. It caters to an older crowd but the decor is very modern and sophisticated. There's always a wait so either snag a set at the bar or make reservations. 

I've come here multiple times and get pasta every time. Their penne with vodka sauce is delicious and creamy. The pesto is very rich but a whole bowl of it can be too much. Their wild boar perpedelle is also wonderful but sometimes can be on the saltier side. 

My favorites are the pasta all Nora ( basically spaghetti bolognese with eggplant) and their rigatoni special but I sub the tomato sauce with vodka sauce for a creamier richer taste.   

They also offer complimentary garlic bread to go with your meal and the garlic bread is delicious. Sometimes I'm guilty of filling up on that too quickly but thats ok because I'll have leftover pasta for the next day!
