VeBNqe1pI5QBxVbquv0uoQ Pizza, salad and pasta was delicious. Went here while on vacation and found it to be a little mom and pops shop. The flavors for the pizza are spot on. Our waiter, she was absolutely wonderful. She was professional and courteous. I will come back when I'm in town again. The kids loved it since the waiter gave them actual dough to mold while we waited.
