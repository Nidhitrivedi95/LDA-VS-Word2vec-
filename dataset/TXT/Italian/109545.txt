G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I went in for a mock service and was really pleasantly surprised. I was shocked how nice the design and layout of the space was, the staff knew their stuff. When entering Giada you will find an anti-pasta bar and a very cool bread station. 

The service was great the drinks were amazing and our server was really on the ball. I am now a fan of Giada and wish the team a very successful opening. I look forward to entertaining guest's at the bar with small appetizers and craft cocktails.

Giada thanks for making a very sexy and attractive restaurant on the best corner of the Las Vegas Blvd.
