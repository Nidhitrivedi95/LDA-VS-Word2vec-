X3UyZfplYAXdSJpWPaxUIA I enjoyed dinner here several years ago, and was craving pasta.  We popped in to get takeout about half an hour before closing. We were greeted by a charming server who took our order promptly and delivered it piping hot in about 15 minutes. Spring rolls were a beautiful and tasty surprise! We devoured our gnocchi in rose sauce and penne alla vodka without complaint. Panino Cappuccino did not disappoint. Next time we'll sit in for dinner.
