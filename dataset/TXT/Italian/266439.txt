x4aHNNo1osWNCB75q_PijQ We've been to Pomo on two occasions to eat in and a couple more times for take-out.
I've been very impressed with both the food and service. This place has a very nice atmosphere but still caters to people with children. From the host to the waiter, the service is always with a smile. They have crayons and paper menus for the kids and a great kids menu. They get the kids' orders in right away which makes everyone happy.
We keep going back because we absolutely love the pizzas. They are so delicious. We've had the salads too which are great, but really the pizzas steal the show. They are the perfect mix of crisp and doughy. 
This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale.
