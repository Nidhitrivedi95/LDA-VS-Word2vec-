lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ I guess I expected better pizza in Vegas with all the former east coasters that have set up shop here. This place goes down as another fail in my book. Service and atmosphere was just fine, but the pizza was just meh and bland. Got a large with meatballs and ricotta to share with wifey and I, a lover of pizza, had one slice and decided it just wasn't worth it. Crust was dry, had no flavor, and I guess same went for the cheese and sauce. 

If you are looking for good pizza on the strip, my bet is still secret pizza.
