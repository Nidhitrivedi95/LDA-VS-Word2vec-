H9QvGwjFPnUULD0y8i7FkQ Seriously best steak and cheese sub around!  Get it with onion and mushrooms and mayo and what a delicious heart clogger. We spilt the dish it's so large and add a side salad to share as well. I mean doesn't the salad make it all ok ;)

Pizza is also very good but doesn't travel well since it's very thin crust. We tried getting it to go and it was cardboard by the time we got home. We've had it fresh there and it was quite tasty. The pepperoni they use is also very very spicy (I love it but the kids think it's too hot).
