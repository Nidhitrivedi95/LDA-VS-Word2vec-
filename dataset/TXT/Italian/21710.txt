3bYHVaEMAS35PAinUdnDdw I had a slice of the stuffed pizza.  Can't remember what they call it.  It was a large piece, it was flavorful but awfully greezy.  This place was conveniently located right across the aisle from my gate, so, I suppose that was a plus.  Ok, for a quick bite when you're running on empty.
