hWsG4A-7x0i8wRBBtNBYeQ I visited Mike's Kitchen today and it was fantastic. The service was terrific! Someone in our party wanted eggplant and the server recommended eggplant Parmesan, which wasn't on the menu. I tasted and it was really great! All of the food was great. I shared a Greek salad that came with two types of dressing. We got the Italian and Greek dressings and both were equally loaded with flavor! The salad was packed with cucumbers, feta cheese, garbanzo beans, kalamata olives and more. We also split a 10" chicken kalamata pizza which was delicious! Super tasty. Very unique and for a place that I don't think specializes in pizza, the crust could compete with any pizza place! The decor was nice enough - not the fanciest of restaurants, but you could tell they put some effort into it. It was a nice homey feel. We'll be back!
