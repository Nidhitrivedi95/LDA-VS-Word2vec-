Caesar salad with the lemon zest was amazing and they split it for the two that were eating. I had the tuna avocado salad appetizer which was the most amazing app ever!  For entrees we had branzzino which was very flavorful with a kick. The orecchiette with homemade sausage and broccoli rabe in a clam sauce was fabulous!! . The final entree was pici a pasta with lobster with a chili kick.  We shared them all and eaxh of them were exceptional. We also has the best service with Julian as the most amazing server. He was a best server and also got our silly sense of humor and went along wth it.
