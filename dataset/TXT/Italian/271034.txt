XPLSNGSClW8gR5BTcvyOhQ Came here for my dad's birthday tonight. Ok service, but the waiter took my dad's drink to refill and never gave it back, even after asking again. We usually get my dad's favorite dish that is now off the menu, but they make it for us anyway. Tonight, they didn't, which is understandable because it's not on the menu anymore, but they made some weird excuse about being out of ingredients that were never present in the dish. We chose the penne San Remo, which was flavorless and not that appetizing. We barely touched it. The noodles are supposed to be al dente, which I love, but were really undercooked. A lady who I'm assuming is the manager came over to ask how are meal was, and when we told her about the hard pasta, she told us that's how they do it so next time order it another way. Funny, because we have been here plenty of times before and it was never like that??? The family next to us complained about the noodles as well, but the manager didn't seem to care. Place has gone downhill, and it's sad, because we have been coming to this place since I was a little girl. Won't be coming back.
