H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g We went here for a family dinner the first night we were in Vegas and really enjoyed it! I would go back again, as there were many things on the menu that I'd still like to try! The fried cauliflower was just as delicious as the other reviews say. We got the corn pizza and the prosciutto pizza and spilt them between the two of us. I think we both agreed that they were both good, but the corn was better! It feels like you're eating outside (even though you're inside) and it's really beautiful. Yum!
