fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg Our excitement to try this spot was sadly not realized in the taste of the food. Sickening amount of oil and wah wah wahhhh.. no flavor. Ordered the hataka ramen and spicy beef from all the raves from Yelpers. Boo on youuu. The place is cute, but we won't be back. Our search for great Asian food in midtown continues!!!
