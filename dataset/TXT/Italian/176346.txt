NhNO2lN-p1RvA4MfR1wk1A Outstanding authentic Italian, Sicilian cuisine. The arincino(rice balls) were as good as I have ever had. We also had a entree salad with chicken, spaghetti and meatballs, gnocchi and a penne carbonara. All dished were fresh and flavorful. The bread is homemade and fresh baked to order. Huge portions for great prices. We will be regulars from this point forward. a+++
