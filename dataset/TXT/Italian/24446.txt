4BBda3yy_8GXGmYLcgggHw Great selection of wines in various sizes, and great service. But the pizza! Meh, I've had better. Much better. I ordered the Nepolitana (anchovies, fried garlic, tomato sauce and olives). The crust was nicely blistered and the pizza smelled great. But there was far too much sauce and within a few minutes the pizza was very soggy. The sauce was also not my favourite-- really acidic and thick. Maybe this was because of the amount of it, but this was not the Libretto I remembered from years back. 

Calamari was ok. But the red pepper sauce that it came with was not very good. Nice on it's own but  really not well thought out with the fried calamari. It almost tasted like there was carrot in it. Flavours were very disharmonious and I really can't see why people flock to this place. Maybe it was an off night, but this was not great pizza. 

I gave 3 stars for the nice staff and the great wine list.
