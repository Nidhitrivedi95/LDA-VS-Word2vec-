Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw The food is good, but the delivery is terrible.  At 3:30pm on a Saturday they quoted me 50 minutes through eat24.  Since I am an 8 minute drive up a single street away from Cugino's that seemed like a long wait to me already.  I ended up getting my food after 1 hour and 15 minutes.  The driver then lied to me saying "NASCAR is in town, traffic is crazy".  I had just been out and there was no traffic, I looked on google maps and confirmed that there was no traffic.  Just own up to the fact that you messed up.
