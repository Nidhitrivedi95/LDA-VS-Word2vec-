MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg Honestly it wasnt so-so, I had the fettuccine alfredo and my gf had the chicken parmesan fettuccine.

The alfredo needed a bit more salt but the quality of ingredients was really good.

The chicken parm on the other hand needed way more salt, you can taste the quality but there isnt enough taste in the first place! Sauce needed it and so did the chicken.

Otherwise I would come again for the pizza maybe.
