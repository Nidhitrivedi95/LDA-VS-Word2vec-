LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Had lunch at Maggiano's in the Fashion Show mall. It was a nice setting with an outdoor area. We sat indoors, but we had a great view of the Palazzo hotel. Overall a gorgeous window view.

Ordered the veal scaloppine piccata style and an Arnold Palmer. The veal scallopine was flavorful, especially with the pickled capers that had almost a tangy sensation. There was also spinach placed at the bottom of the veal. It was a light bed of spinach and I felt that I could have benefited with a bit more. The dish came with a side of angel hair. As for the drink, it was just your typical Arnold Palmer, half iced tea half lemonade.

Our server seemed really versed with the various menu items and the ingredients. At first I thought it was only our server and his personality that made him a great host, but after listening in another table it seems all the servers are well-trained and sociable. I applaud the servers for their knowledge and service.

Overall it was a good experience, but not a restaurant of choice since it's a chain. When I am in Vegas, I prefer to dine in locations that are exclusive Vegas restaurants. I feel as though that would add to the experience versus eating at a chain that is readily accessible in my hometown.
