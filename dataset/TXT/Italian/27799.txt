4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ Well, came here for pick-up at around 7pm (2 orders of chicken marsala) for my girlfriend and I. As i was getting rdy to pay i witnessed the chef licking his fingers and touching the food for taste. ..nasty. Especially when i found out it was my food! I feel bad for the other people that are unknowingly making out with that guy.  The manager was nice but there is no way we'll be back.
