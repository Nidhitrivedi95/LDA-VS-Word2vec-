Uqs18_AgDYsByvtSSOMzkw The food that I had was really good. I got the Chicken Penne Pesto and my friend got the fruit de mar. Mine was delicious and my friend also loved his dish. 

The only downside was that two of the mussels on his seafood plate were closed (as in you cannot eat them because they're poisonous). If he had not known that, he could have gotten really sick. Also it was not as if the chef could have missed the closed mussels as they were carefully placed around the edge of his plate. 

The service was also pretty slow but not excruciatingly bad. 

Overall it was good and I actually would come here again (my dish was Delish)
