pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I'd really like to hold back a few stars because of the absolutely ridiculous, idiotic, and insane (four hour) wait, but I can't. I waited for three hours at Sally's in New Haven one time so I guess this is only a little longer. Bianco is as good as any "Neapolitan style" pizza I've had in the US, but that's not to say that it's better than all the others. Bianco doesn't have that perfectly even char on the crust that a lot of places seem to be able to produce, but they've got more than enough char (maybe even a little too much). I think their pizza compares most closely to A16 than the other places I've tried (Settebello, Spaccanapoli, Tutta Bella, Una, Antica etc). The crust has great - really great - flavor, has a very good rise at the edge and is perfectly soft and chewy. The cheese is also perfect: it tastes great and melts without burning or breaking down. The basil and tomatoes tasted fresh and great. So really, no complaints other than the wait. It will be nice when the Neapolitan trend puts some more places like Bianco in Phoenix so this isn't the only option. It may be really difficult to make pizza this great faster than Bianco does, but other places seem to be able to pull it off so hopefully that will happen in Phoenix at some point too.
