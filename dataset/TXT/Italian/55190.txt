afc3QwjxDI79Rglr5jYqMA I think that I have found a hidden gem here!  I have walked past their storefront location many times but last week I decided to go in and take a look.  I found a nice clean retail store/restaurant that serves some amazing fresh pasta and homemade sauces.  

I did not have time to eat there so I picked up a to go package of their spaghetti with bolognese sauce.  I ate it when I got home and WOW the sauce was great.  The sauce was not too salty or acidic and had a nice amount of fresh torn herbs in it and cheese on top.  The pasta was al dente and had a nice bite to it.  I ended up eating the other half the next day for lunch and it travelled well.

I had a nice conversation with the woman there and she said that they also are avaliable to do parties, festvals and corporate gaterings ect.

I will not hesitate to come back and try some of their stuffed pastas and some of their different sauces in the future.
