G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I have been wanting to go to Giada's since it opened. I finally went and loved it! The menu has a lot of options but we decided to go with the tasting menu because it had their best dishes. The tasting menu is $120 per person but you get a lot of food. We started with the antipasto of crostini, dates, and peppers. All were just ok but not anything I would choose to order again. Then came the pastas, you get the lemon shrimp or the vegetable bolognese rigatoni. Since there was 2 of us, we got 1 of each and we added truffle shavings on the rigatoni. Both were amazing! The pasta was perfectly cooked and deliciously flavored. I can't even decide which one I liked better. Then you get the main course and we choose the salmon and rack of lamb. The salmon had a light flavor but was good. The lentils that were in the sauce were bland and added really nothing to the dish. The lamb was delicious! It had a mustard crust and was just melt in your mouth good. And lastly you get to choose desserts from the extensive cart. I choose the chocolate tiramisu, lemon ricotta cookie, and white coffee gelato. All 3 were awesome! Overall, I very much enjoyed my experience at Giada's. I only knocked off a star for the antipasto and bland salmon sauce.
