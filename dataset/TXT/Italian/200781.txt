pwtTn72x7Nqp1imaXw9LvQ Great "working lunch" spot. By the way, Mercatto is located in the Mars building (and what a nice building to boot!).

Lunch resos DEFINITELY required as it was packed. I came here as a group of 12 (business lunch) and service was fast and efficient. Our waitress was great and initially offered wine/beer (no one took the offer) so we just stuck with waters. Around the table ordered pizza's and pasta's. We had some Ottawa peeps and they thoroughly enjoyed their meals, saying it was delish. I can agree - I opted for the artic char with cauliflower and it was just right.

Portions are great for lunch and you won't go hungry. 

Highly recommend this place for business lunches. Great food. Great service.
