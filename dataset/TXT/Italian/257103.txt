We both like Italian and so I did a search for restaurants in Green Valley. I saw that the Pasta Shop Ristorante had excellent reviews so I made a reservation. We were not disappointed. Not only was the food amazingly good, so was the service. They serve classic dishes with home made pasta. Caesars Salad is included with every entree. My wife had the Ravioli Bianca and I had the Chicken Parmesan. My wife especially love the pistachios in her dish. We started the meal with an artichoke appetizer that was not only visually stunning but incredibly delicious. 

The owner, David, greeted us and introduced himself...made us feel welcome in his establishment.  It was very special treatment and he was the same way with all the other customers. As we were finishing our meal, David spent some time with us after bringing my wife a birthday desert on the house. He then gave me a pound of fresh home made pasta. 

This is now one of our favorite restaurants and we will be returning often including tonight (Valentine's Day).  Even if you don't live in Green Valley, it's worth the drive. I suggest making reservations as seating is limited.
