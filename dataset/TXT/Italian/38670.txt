7CPGGNwHibzQtnERq7u2Hw My husband and I used to eat there occasionally. We would have our Anniversary or Birthday's there but the last two times they must have changed the cook and there dishes were dry not enough tomato sauce, we would get the eggplant parm full plate it was huge but it got smaller and smaller and was dry as well. The steamed mussels used to be good too,with the white and red sauce mixed the last time we went the size was smaller and they barely put enough sauce, The calamari was very fishy smelling. I think it went thru some transition so we are going to try it one more time. I am going to ask for extra sauce and extra cheese. They did not even warn you the last two times that the servings were huge? Wish us luck.
