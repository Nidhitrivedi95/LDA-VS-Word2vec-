CO8MpD1bSkBPArXKBKkIfA I come here alot and love the food but it is a nasty place otherwise. The men's room is always disgusting... sticky floors, trash overflowing, etc. Tables are never cleaned off and piled with trash and dirty dishes. Flooring is covered in debris, trash and food. Surprising since the service is actually pretty good. Employees are friendly but stand around when it is slow. Your food doesn't take to long to arrive and is very good. They have something for everyone.
