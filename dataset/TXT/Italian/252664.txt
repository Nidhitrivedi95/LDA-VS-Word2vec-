VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Four of us dined here last night before a show.  The atmosphere is chic and inviting.   The food was average but very expensive.  I ordered Branzino and received two small fillets which were dry.  It was served with a small salad which was tasty.   My dining partners had ravioli and another had a gluten free pasta dish.  She appreciated the GF item on the menu.  The fourth person ordered a flatbread pizza which was the best meal of the four of us.  Very nice crispy crust.  The wine was probably the best item on the menu.  The Italian red blend was delicious.   Service was average.  Friendly but not particularly attentive.  In Las Vegas there are definitely better choices.
