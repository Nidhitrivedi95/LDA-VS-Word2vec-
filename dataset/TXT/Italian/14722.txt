1J69KdlcuXRMCyOFqtQNgg My husband still currently working on having a massive coronary before 35 loves this place.  I stop here after work to pick up food for my grease loving hubby.  The folks who work here alway have a smile on their face, though I may be a little bias seeing as they see me at least once a week.  The food is pretty much the same as any other Sbarro but the people who work here make it a fun quick little trip.
