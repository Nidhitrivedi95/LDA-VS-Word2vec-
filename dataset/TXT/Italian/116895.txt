Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A Scottsdale is lucky to have this place. I put it behind Bianco but just slightly. This is amazing pizza. Ya its thin and wet in the middle. Its supposed to be. Great ingredients. Great deserts. This is an A+ restaurant. Get the mushroom soup to start with it is so good. I've eaten at many of the top rated pizza places in the country and this is the real deal. Go and enjoy..
