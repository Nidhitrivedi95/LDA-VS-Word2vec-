4V_dIB038vy53RHYgEvUcw Metropolitan has now become my new favourite place for the best pasta sauce in Toronto. Their menu isn't all that big and the place isn't all that large, but the food is awesome.

I had the Sausage Penne  and I was instantly impressed by how authentic the pasta sauce was. To make it even more amazing was the fact the pasta was gluten free.

I also had an order of the beef back ribs; again, amazing. They were tasty, meaty, and not full of gristle like some beef ribs are.

The manager was also very gracious, attentive, and punctual.

All in all a great experience.
