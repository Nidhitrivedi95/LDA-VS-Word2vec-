eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg Came here on the way back to our room for a quick bite after a long day of gambling. I must say, better than I expected. Our bartender (Jeff) was just all around outstanding. The drinks he made from the specialty menu were perfect! The mango martini is a must! He was always very personable and attentive. The food was great too. The spinach dip was one of the best I've tried and the Meatzza was very flavorful. Although I won't be staying at the Nugget again, I will be stopping by the Grotto for the drinks at the very least!
