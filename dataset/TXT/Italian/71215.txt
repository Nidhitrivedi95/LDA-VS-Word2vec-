It turned out that it was almost several evenings. Specifically made a reservation through open table for 6:45. We arrived at 6:42 and was greeted by "Oh, well sorry it will be just a few minutes longer" After 32 minutes of "just a few more minutes and I'm sorries from the young hostess we were seated at 7:17 by the owner(?) and she reassured me that we would enjoy my birthday dinner. Well.. She was wrong. We had waited so long that my 17 y/o son chose not to eat since the hour was later and his diet. When the caprese salad showed up 21 minutes later it was edible at best. Finally the food arrived at 8:16. Starving was passed a long time ago and we paced our eating but still completed the veal limon in 9 minutes. The waiter offered dessert but we declined due to the hour. 
Not another apology was made for the wait or delay, not a comp of a meal, not a birthday offering. At 2 hours almost exactly to when we arrived we walked out dissatisfied by the food and the restaurant. And $81 dollars lighter. This is not the first time but probably the last time we will go to Arrivederci. Went in to celebrate my 55th bday and I think by the time we left I was about to celebrate my 56th. Arrivederci to Arrivederci.
