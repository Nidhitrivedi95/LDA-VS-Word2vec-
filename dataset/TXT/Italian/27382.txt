4S7vWgarCkYjSaN8vrTV9g I had some really great food and the service was excellent. I had the crispy ravioli to start (sumptuous, rich, wonderful), veal piccata (veal slightly overdone, but still lovely and flavorful). Serving sides a la carte is a bit steep at this price, and my risotto was bland and not made with arborio rice. My dad's gnocchi were similarly bland.

It's a bit too bright inside. Also, this might seem a bizarre criticism, but I wish the menu were a bit smaller. There are so many items, it's hard to choose! I think they'd do better to have a slightly smaller, more seasonal menu. Also, the portion sizes are huuuuge. This is both good and bad -- leftovers are nice to have, but they're never as good as the original. I ordered a starter and main course, and had to box part of the starter so I'd have room for the main. I had no room for dessert! 

I think they could halve the portion size, knock 25% off the price, and have happy customers & more profits. They'd end up with more people ordering 3 courses and feeling satisfied.

Definitely a great place to eat -- the food & service were truly enjoyable -- but the experience is what falls short because of the size of the menu and portion sizes. I'd definitely go again but I think I might split dishes.
