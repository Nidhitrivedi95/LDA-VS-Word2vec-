1rebduwtmrHQhl32djRS7A I've ate here 4 times now. After navigating the menu and asking the staff, I went with the staple sandwich which is the Super Sicilian. Super happy I did. All of their subs come toasted on sesame bread from what I've seen. I never thought to much about sesame buns however toasted really sets those seeds off. 

I think the secret of success for this sandwich peddler is their combination of good ingredients, toasted buns and family business small town curb appeal. I'll keep coming back with a smile. C
