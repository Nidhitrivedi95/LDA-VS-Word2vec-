EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw Crudo is amazing. Best place to eat in Phoenix. I did the 3 course meal. The ahi plate was small but incredible. I also tried the butterfish and yellowtail plate but you can't beat the ahi.

I had the gnochitti fig plate which was amazing as well as the short rib plate.

The apple desert was my favorite of the 3 offered. Crudo was lare and could accomadate large parties.
