PxTKXsdYqoFHWAG2amz0XQ We made a reservation on Friday night for a date night dinner and had a great experience!  The staff was great - super friendly and welcoming.  The restaurant and bar area are nicely appointed and very comfortable.  The food was fantastic too - we started with the arancini and meatballs as our appetizers (great choices) and I enjoyed the salmon entree with cauliflower mash and squash with chili oil - so tasty!  The dessert menu sounded amazing, but we were anxious to close out and go to the speakeasy next door for a nightcap.  We'll definitely be back again soon...maybe for cocktails and dessert at the bar next time!
