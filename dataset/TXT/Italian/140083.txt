He served us but barely checked up on us. At the end when we were getting our bill, before we even received our actual bill we received a lecture from him about tips and how much would be appropriate for him and HIS OWN suggested amount. The fact that he did that was just mind blowing. He gave us some bullshit that he had to pay out of pocket for his group tip if he didn't meet a certain amount. I'm sorry I thought tipping was a gesture and not mandatory. Anyways we gave him $25 and he flipped shit when he saw it and started cussing. It was just a very unprofessional and hostile environment. I would avoid this particular waiter. 

Back to the food. Our table ordered various dishes. Most were very delicious and the others were decent. The price isn't too bad but for a chain it could've been less expensive. I would come back again for the food but definitely would avoid this place is Danny the waiter is there. Also the hostess we encounter was a bit pretentious also.

Main takeaway: Food is good and can be delicious. The staff was borderline anger management material and perhaps bi-polar.  Be careful with such people.
