EosF_LUsz19yvqkAMYLltA Well I am not a huge fan of Streets of New York but this experience was just horrible.  I was with some friends after hiking and went to Streets of New York to grab a bite to eat as none of us had dinner before the hike.  We ordered wings and pizza to all share as none of us had huge appetites after hiking.

First our drinks took way too long to get and then refills were almost so bad I was going to go refill them myself.  The food was very sub par for Streets Of New York.  I don't think I will be back to this location and I am not the only one as a Friday night it was pretty empty.
