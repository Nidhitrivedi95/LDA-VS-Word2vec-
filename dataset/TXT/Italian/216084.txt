rrfe1RPh6t3QG7BRghzjYA Expected better.... not great not bad..  Boulliabassie was not right... more like seafood on top of a smear of Lobster Bisque.... so dry we asked for more soup.   Did not appear to bother them much either that we had a valid complaint....  

The Chocolate Souffle however was exceptional... maybe next time just for dessert ...  

Hope they get  a grip .... could be so much more ...
