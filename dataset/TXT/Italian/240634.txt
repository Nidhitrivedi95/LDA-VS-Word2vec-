UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ This restaurant is in my "hood" and I had heard good things about the pizza muffins so I had to give it a try. 

It was busy on a Friday night but we only waiting about 10 mins for our table.  The servers were on top of things as far as I could see.  Our server was at out table in two seconds taking drink orders.  Since it was our first time there I wanted to look over the menu.  He gave us sufficient time and then he was back, took our order, and salad and breadsticks for my daughter arrived in about 5 mins.  The pizza muffins were right behind........ahhhh....these are like crack to me.  I'm instantly addicted!  Little wheels of pizza dough with chesse and ham, fresh and hot and gooey.  YUM!!!!  I should have just made a meal off the pizza muffins but I had to try the pizza.  My daughter had a Jr. Pizza with her favorite topping, black olives.  She gave it a big thumbs up.
I tried one with sausage, salami and mushrooms.  The dough was soft, cooked to perfection and has a nice flavor.  The toppings were generous.  It was good and I took the rest home.  

It seems as thought everyone there were regulars, locals.  The service was fast and friendly. I thought the prices were very resonable. When we were ready to leave my daughter needed a to go cup for the rest of her drink.  Our server kindly obliged and brought her a to go cup.....filled with more of her drink!  We will be back!  I'm sure I will be craving pizza muffins very soon!!
