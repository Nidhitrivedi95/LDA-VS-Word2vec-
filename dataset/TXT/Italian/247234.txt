v9jNkOIBfP4aW2ru50Rn-A We came here because it was right outside the MTCC & wanted lunch. We decided on take out so we wouldn't have to sit & wait too long. But heck! We ended up waiting an HOUR for our take out. I was starving by then. I had the portobello Padini (sp?). The food was passable. But nothing special. Next time I won't order food here. The lady who took our order was acting as bartender & hostess so she stepped away quite a bit. She also couldn't seem to figure out how to punch in our orders. I think the staff here need a lesson in efficient customer service.
