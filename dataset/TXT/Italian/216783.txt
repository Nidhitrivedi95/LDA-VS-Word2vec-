RuU1P-CW3DJtiLoNTahUHA We went to Zizi for my husband's birthday for the first time. It was a group of 6 people. Because I read good reviews about this place I was expecting the best Italian food. Well, the food was not the best I had. Out of 8 dishes half was great and half was just ok.
Service was nice, but I had to wait for water a few times. I didn't feel that we were checked on regularly. I ordered icecream for dessert, it was delicious, but it could be presented to much better. I think I do a better job at home serving icecream to my family. Overall I have seen a better Italian place.
