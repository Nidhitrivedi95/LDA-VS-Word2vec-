cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q I feel a little bad giving Olive Garden 4 stars because I've given non-chain fancy Italian restaurants 4 stars before. Just a disclaimer im not comparing Olive Garden to all Italian restaurants. If I was this would get 2 stars. I'm comparing this particular Olive Garden restaurant to other Olive Garden restaurants and other casual chain Italian restaurants. 

What I like the most about this place was the customer service. Everyone was really nice and we got our orders in quick, our waters and drinks refilled, all with a great friendly attitude. It was buy one get one time which is awesome!  You pay the same price but get an extra order of pasta to go for free!  I got the spaghetti with meat sauce, and the rest of our table got cheese ravioli, and mozzeralla chicken. 

The endless soups were delicious. I had two. I got the zuppa Tuscano and the chicken gnocchi. Both were cream based soups with good flavor. I really enjoyed my pasta. I love bolognese and this sauce was not bad. I just wish there was more of it. I thought it was too much pasta for the amount of sauce they gave. 

I ate my take home pasta the next day. I heated it up and it was tasty. Some people don't like eating leftovers when the sauce is already on the pasta. However I didnt think the sauce made the pasta mushy or soft.
