-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw For my 200th review I am choosing Brio Tuscan Grille.
First let me say that it is a beautiful building , looks just like a Villa in Italy to me. The colors are just what they should be.
Inside is beautifully decorated, and wonderful music is always playing. 
The restrooms are very clean and nice.
We were seated at a corner tablefor 4,it was perfect. The nice thing is the have a waist high wall built around it ,so even though you are on the corner you are not bothered.
It is really a relaxing setting. I enjoyed lunch very much.
I have had their food before,because they have catered a few events I have been lucky enough to go to. Always good!

Our waiter was Demetrius, he was very good,until he got busy,then he was a little frazzled. He gave us the wrong check twice, but things happen and it was the day after Christmas. So it was very busy.
The food was wonderful as always. T got the Crab cakes and Italian Wedding soup, delish! I got Chicken with pasta and lobster Bisque. Outstanding!!!
We will be back,I wish we could go again this week.
Lots of parking in the great FREE parking garage.

The more I come over here ,the more I like it!
Oh and do not forget to get your reward card.Every time you come in you get points for dining here. Which adds up to free food.
