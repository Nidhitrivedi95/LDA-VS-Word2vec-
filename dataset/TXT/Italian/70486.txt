c-l4nDPZcEwapEiV-Xf08w Returned for Valentine's day, service was way  better than last year.   Husband had lamb,  excellent.  I had my go-to capellini and scallops.  Scallops were perfect,  but the seasoning on the pasta was missing,  wasnt as delicious as usual.  I'll take my chances again though,  and I should have just sent it back but we aren't into doing that.  What stold the show was the amazing octopus appetizer.  Smoky and cooked to perfection!
