I ordered take out - the #2 Caio sandwich - beef, cheese and grilled onions with a small salad not really a salad just a handful of lettuce nothing else so I doctored the lettuce up a bit when I arrived home adding more lettuce, red onions, cucumbers and it was good.  But the sandwich did not taste too good once I arrived home as it was not hot any longer and I needed to doctor it up to so it tasted better - so added some red onions and goat cheese plopped it in the toaster oven for a few minutes and wowla a great tasting sandwich.  I did love the bread and someone said they make their bread from scratch.  I hope this is true. Pretty good place for sandwiches if you eat in, take out not so much.  The pastries are still way over priced even for ritzy Scottsdale.
