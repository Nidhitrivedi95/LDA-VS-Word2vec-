hqWNpbCEzt7EzUeWkDqjBA Wow is all I can say these people can make some awesome pizza! I had a pepperoni slice both times I came but my friend had a calzone and I tasted it so good! My mouths watering talking about it! Best pizza place around here! It's small place to eat but big on flavor! Perfection and I'm pretty picky! :)
