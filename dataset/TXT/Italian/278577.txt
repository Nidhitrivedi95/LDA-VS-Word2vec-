YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg First of all, the service is impeccable. The staff seems to sense your every move and bring you exactly what you need at the exact right time with nothing more.

The atmosphere is contemporary old-school with perfect lighting, and a wonderful view highlighting the strip and reminding you that you are in fact a bit off the beaten path.

And the food? Oh my goodness, the food is glorious. Nothing is over the top but everything is perfect. My colleague is a regular and mentioned that the tomato soup is the best he's ever had. I ordered a bowl and would have to agree.

For my entree, I had a special bone in Veal chop that was without a doubt one of the best Veal moments of my life. Everyone else at the table also enjoyed their entrees. It's just really really good food.

I am looking forward to my next trip to Vegas. I love that Panevineo is Vegas level quality without the monotony of the strip. SO good. Even dessert (Chocolate lava cake) was categorically perfect.
