1Z9rGyR3Ld2mtnOTE4pNcg Recently had an unfortunate experience there with my wife and 3 kids. Dirty tables. Dirty glasses. Dirty bathrooms. And rude owner to top it off. it's really unfortunate because this place has been around for a while. but, clearly it's best days are way behind it.

A few dishes are mediocre at best, and the rest are pretty below average.

Veal and chicken sandwiches: they are not fresh. the cutlets are all dry from waiting in the front. and the sandwich bread was stale. and as other reviewers have mentioned, very bland sauce to top it off. most veal sandwich places will fry on order. Not this place.

pasta: very bland, stale tomato sauce.

Chicken wings: dry, dry, dry.

Price: Overpriced for what you are getting. 2 adults, 3 kids. no desert. $70+tip.

Service: Slow and indifferent. Waitress got our order wrong (we'd asked for sauce on the side). And then she denied it and did nothing to rectify.

Owner: I have a dietary restriction. So I explained it and asked the owner for a simple request. He kept on calling it strange, odd and ultimately refused to accommodate.

At the  prices they are charging, you can do MUCH better in that neighborhood. Marcello's across to street to begin with. Do yourself a favour and try another spot.
