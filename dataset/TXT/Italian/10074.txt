0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg i came here in a large group, and we got the private room in the back.  we had a minimum we had to meet, which i don't think was difficult.  we got a set menu w/ 4 courses.  all the courses were served family style except for the entree.  

for the first course, there was a really tasty tomato salad and a polenta w/ mushrooms.  there was also a beef and farro dish, but i didn't taste that. 

for the second course, there were 2 pastas:  the signature spaghetti, and a  tagliatelle w/ peas and guaciale.  both pastas were delicious, but i preferred the taglatelle.

my entree was the cod, which was fine but nothing to write home about.  there was also a steak option.

there were 3 desserts:  a choc cake w/ salted caramel, apple tart, and a coconut cream thing in a guava/pineapple soup.  the choc cake and apple tart were amazing.  

everyone also raved about the stromboli bread.  drinks here were good too.  i'd come back to dine in the main restaurant next time.
