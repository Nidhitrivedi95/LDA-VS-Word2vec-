vOWLaMmDjvPLwqMh7_noHw If I was rating this restaurant on service alone it would easily be 5 stars. So genuinely friendly and welcoming! I can't remember the last time we were treated so well in a restaurant. 
The food was well prepared and tasted good. Basic breakfast. But the coffee was great and so piping hot! That made me very happy. 
It did feel like a longer than average wait for our food but that may also have been because we were in a rush.
