Ambiance is awesome, feels classy but you definitely can come dressed casual if you're just hanging out in the bar/lounge area. The bartenders are friendly and will make you custom drinks if you ask. I've only had items off of their late night menu, so I can't really comment on the pricing for dinner. For the quality of the steak, the late night menu is very reasonably priced. 

They serve beautifully cooked and seasoned meat, with several different options on the menu. The steak comes cooked with a giant onion ring, which imparts a great flavor and juiciness to the meat. The one thing I dislike is having to order fries or a side dish separately, but the portions are generous so I can't really complain. Cocktails are creative and delicious, but be warned that they are a bit expensive for Madison. 

I recommend coming after a light (read: almost non-existent) dinner so you can splurge and really enjoy your late night meal. Come a little before 10pm so you can get a seat, and be prepared to spend about as much as you would on a moderately priced dinner.
