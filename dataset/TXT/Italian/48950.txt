9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Oh the pizza and calzones gods live here.  My 2nd most favorite pizza in Phoenix.  Now the calzones - the bread is the light as a cloud bread that isn't soggy or heavy.  It must be godly magic but after eating a filled with meats and cheeses calzone from Cibo - you don't feel like you ate a loaf of bread.  Love the ambiance of this little place and we have also ordered take out from here as well. Hubby and I will visit soon and be blessed by the pizza and calzone gods once again.  Thank you Cibo.
