OyiOg9GYKzHI19EbnWqL8A So the meal at Hey Lucy was fantastic. My mother and I are on a girls trip and we ended our long tiring day here. We were draw in from the street with a sign that read "Martini Wednesday". Ummm... yes please! 

We were waited on by Alex who is the sweetest waitress, she hooked us up with some speedy martinis (Sextini and Lemon Drop) we decided to split some menu items including the Fried Calamari (on point), the Kale Salad (extremely fresh with Lemon Herb dressing ) and the Chicken Brie Pizza which was straight up divine!! 

Atmosphere was great, staff amazing and all in all would definitely be back if I lived here. Stop, drink and eat, you won't regret it!!!
