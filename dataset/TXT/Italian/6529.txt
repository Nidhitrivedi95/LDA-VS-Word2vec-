0aw3HbxkZ4G7pkPYt10fhA One of our favorites lunch places - today my husband had his usual soup & salad and I had the Shrimp Scampi - delicious except for the asparagus- very tough and unpleasant! It's a pricey lunch dish so just add the tips forgo the rest to prepare this dish!  

The service was excellent & she assured me she'd let the chef know about the asparagus!
