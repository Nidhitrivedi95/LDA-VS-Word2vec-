G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Everything about this place is beautiful.  The environment, the outfits, the atmosphere, the plating, and the scenery.

Make a reservation for the window seats.

Food was great, a bit pricy for portions (small for lunch) for what amounts to bulk made appetizers that are just plated fancy.  Pizza was great.
