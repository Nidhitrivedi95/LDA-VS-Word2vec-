GfHBBCi6LJAPVFTcCwu9aQ I was looking for a non-pretentious place to casually drink wine in a "non-threatening" environment.  I finally found it. Far from old town Scottsdale and the typical fake folks that peruse places like Olive & Ivy, Centro is a small, dark, and (best of all) quiet place to sit with your friends and actually have a conversation.

The menu... fresh paninis. About 10 or so to choose from. They're made fresh on the spot. There's a good selection of wine and also some interesting beers. 

Centro won't break your pocketbook either. Especially on "Wino Wednesdays".

There are 2.5 parking spots dedicated to Centro, right in front. If these are filled, there's oodles of parking on the calm street just outside. 

Ladies, this is also a great place to hang if you just want to be left alone from men constantly hitting on you and trying to get in your pants! The clientele seems to be educated, respectful, well-rounded, young (20s-40s) people. A nice break from your typical Scottsdalian scene.
