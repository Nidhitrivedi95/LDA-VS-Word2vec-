Ordered drinks, appetizers and entrees for three, but the waiter did not bring bread to the table (I had to ask for it). Then, one of the entrees was not made as ordered and they repeatedly denied making an observably obvious mistake which led to an annoying back and forth argument with the kitchen. Bottom line: The food is definitely great here, but the operation is too small to handle the slightest variation from their menu and their waiters need some training.
