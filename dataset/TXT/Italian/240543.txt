UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ I recently had my sister's babyshower in their banquet room and the event manager took such great care of us from our beginning communications all the way up until the day-of. There was a nice large-screen TV available for our slideshow to run on, very nice table linnens provided, and even extra tables when we needed them. For the price, food quality and time availability, this was defintely the best deal in the area for our get-together! Highly recommended.
