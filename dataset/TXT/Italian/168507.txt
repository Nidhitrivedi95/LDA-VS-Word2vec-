MLqSxca8xQvbhI8WqhqHLA I really wanted to come here as I was told it was good and it is but let me explain my 2 Star the inside looks nice and the staff are great so I orderd a Pizza and thinking I have been to plenty of Italian Resturants and I was thinking here we go another good one but my Pizza was so thin that everything was falling off The Pizza and it looked like a Frozen Pizza that you would get out of a Supermarket and a Chip Shop Pizza not worth the money I dont think.
