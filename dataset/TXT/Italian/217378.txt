ryEwIARbKHvb0lCkAam8dQ Love the mid day Dj, beautiful ambiance and great cappuccinos. It's exactly like the cafes in Milan with the hustle and high bar tops. The foods a bit on the pricier side for what it is (i.e. $10 side salads) but it's worth it for a treat. I'll be back again to bring Friends.
