2-0Z3UeQZ_Mx98m8Dv3oeQ I was surprised to see all the bad reviews on here given a couple of great visits to this place on my end. One was an after work dinner with some colleagues and the other was with my husband for winterlicious. Full disclosure, I would probably not pick an Italian place for a fancy dinner; just a personal preference. This place though has helped change my mind. The food is very good: modern without trying too hard and quite rich. Small portions that really hit the spot. And the fact that they had a strong offering for winterlicious was a nice surprise. Their wine list is very good as well. Nice ambience where the music is not blaring so you can actually have a conversation, imagine that....
