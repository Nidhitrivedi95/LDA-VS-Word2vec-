Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg Greatest deli counter in town. You can feel the magic of Italy here. From my experience which is mainly sandwiches. The chicken parmesan is thee best in town. The reason I haven't given this place 5 stars. Is because I have yet to sit and dine in. I always get my food to go. One great thing I can say. Is that the deli counter had great selection of anti pasta. If you're looking to make a great charcuterie platter. These folks here will help you out. The salumi, prosciutto and cheese are just out of this world.
