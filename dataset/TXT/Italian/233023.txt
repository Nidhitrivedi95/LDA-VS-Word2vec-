TLMysu1mWiLEslCBon5W1g I would hesitate to give 5 stars to anything, but honestly, the prix fixe is $25 and the sirloin is one of the finest quality steaks I've had for that cut. JYB and I have been here several times in the last few months. We have always got the streak frites and caesar to start, and they have been solid every time. I'm not a big dessert pal, but they do the job too.

If you're lucky, you might even get a seat upstairs at the Toronto Temperance Society (booze club). JYB and I really enjoy this place, good cold ones, good cocktails (servers always happy to answer questions) and an amazing steak on a prix fixe. 

You're pretty much the biggest corncob in Toronto or really hate bold flavours if you decided not to go here when given an opportunity.
