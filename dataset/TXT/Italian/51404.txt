9HC5xHX8QE8VmGd-wCKEaA We had reservations here for a large party.  We had booked 1/2 the restaurant for dinner for a bachelorette party.  It was a good place for a large group if you didn't want to be stuck in one spot.  It was easy to move around and chat with everyone.  

Although they didn't split the bills for each person, they were able to provide 2-3 bills per table, and you could split it between a few different cards, so that wasn't too bad.

I didn't have pizza myself, rather I had the meatballs and the tomato and mozzarella salad.  The salad was delicious and tasted very fresh.  The meatballs were also really good.  Get a piece of toast on the side to dip in the sauce.  

My biggest issue was this:  There were about 30 of us there, and everyone was excited for the bride-to-be with a lot of people coming from out of town, and people not having seen each other for awhile.  As with most large groups, we were a bit loud at points.  No one asked us to quite down.  This was our first stop for the party, and we ordered some wine with dinner.  Between 30 of us there were 4-5 bottles of wine.  No one was drunk, rowdy or out of hand.  I had 1.5 glasses myself (and when I say glass, I'm talking 3-4 oz.)  Despite that, they cut everyone off.  I was quite surprised.  There was no warning, they didn't cut specific people off, everyone was.  A bit disappointed with that.

Besides that, however, I thought the food was really good and if I was in the area, I'd probably pop in again.  Just don't expect this to be the place you're going to pre-game before a night out.
