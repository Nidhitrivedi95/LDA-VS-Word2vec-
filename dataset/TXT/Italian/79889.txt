d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew Ohhhh, I've put off writing this review forever. It's time to face my shame. Streets of New York is one of my "I am feeling awful, please make me happy" indulgences. There is a three-step plan to bliss. The plan is as follows

1: Artichoke Dip. (It's not perfect. There could be a few more crusty bread things to go with it, but I usually get delivery, and there are pretzel chips in my cupboard.)
2: Pizza. (Thin crust, pepperoni and other things, depending on mood.)
3: Passion Cookie. (They will bring the cookie hot, with a little tub of ice cream and toppings ice cold to your door. Because they are objectively wonderful people)

Eat until you begin to regret.

I've never been into the restaurant, but I've ordered delivery a lot. For 1, 2, and for a party with about 12 people who couldn't make up their minds. Everything always arrives quick, hot (or cold, if applicable) and delicious. It's a crowd pleasing sort of pizza.
