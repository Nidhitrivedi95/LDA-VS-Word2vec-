j54J0Ky4ruVbN_NTJ3daFg Absolutely fantastic food, setting, and service! Plan your meal ahead because there is limited seating, but the outdoor patio is magical. This place is perfect for a romantic night out or a special occasion. Pair it with pre-dinner drinks next door at Le Madri Gras and you have the recipe for a perfect evening.
Don't skip the appetizers and don't mind the close eating quarters. The low lighting and the low rumble of close conversation adds to the romantic atmosphere.
The food is special, unique and tastes as if it was made specifically for you by an old Italian woman in her kitchen.
Do not hesitate to try this place. It is truly the backbone of a magnificent evening.
