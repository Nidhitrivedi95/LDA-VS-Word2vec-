GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q This is the beauty of Yelp as I would of never known about this incredible little family restaurant.  Joe and his family make  you feel like your in their home for lunch.  Tell me how many places where you find that anymore??!!  The cheese steak with grilled onions is AMAZING.  Joe told me he slices the beef (wafer thin) himself and the bread is so fresh.  The chicken salad is perfect and Mama Tina told me they roast all the chicken breasts at the restaurant.  Try their chocolate chip cookies - addicting!!  My friend took home a slice (huge) of lasagna, which comes with garlic bread, for $10 and said it was crazy good.
