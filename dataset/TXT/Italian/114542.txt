GmgAToSKHnnB3BUtp9eQzw I've been teetering between giving Tratto 4 or 5 stars. 

Our meal started with a delicious complimentary plate that consisted of nuts and cheese. For appetizers, we had the radicchio salad. I am not a huge fan of radicchio, however I enjoyed it a lot. For my "Secondi", I had the grilled two wash ranch piccolo chicken which the server recommended. It was absolutely delicious and tasty. The juices were flavorful, and I couldn't get enough of it that I finished every bit of it with the complimentary bread. My boyfriend ordered one of the pastas, and I can't remember what it was called to save my life. I do remember it being absolutely phenomenal. It was honestly one of the best pastas I have ever had. I remember the pasta itself being cooked so perfectly, with sweet squash in it. 

The service was superb. The servers were attentive. Tratto had a fine dining kind of vibe which was really nice. This is definitely the perfect place to have a date. The restaurant itself was gorgeous. Every piece looked like it was hand picked from a vintage haven. It reminded me of Tratto's sister restaurants (Pizzeria Bianco), but prettier.

So why the four stars then? Tratto is excellent but way overpriced. The chicken was delicious but definitely NOT worth $36. Our bill was $130 for a salad, pasta, chicken and two glasses of wine and we left feeling hungry still. 

Needless to say, the food and experience was a solid 5 and I would come back in a heartbeat.
