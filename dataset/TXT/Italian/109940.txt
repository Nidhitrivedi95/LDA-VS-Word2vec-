G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Oh my goodness!!!! This place is a must!  If ur a food lover, u HAVE to go. U walk in and it just smells amazing. 

It feels like home!  Staff was amazing. And the Manager walked by twice to make sure we were ok. 

I had the watermelon margarita, meatball appetizer and the pasta of the day. To die 4 I tell u. 

And as if that's not enough....I got to meet Giada. She's  super down to earth & adorable!
