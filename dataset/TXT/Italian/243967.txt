usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA Went here on my birthday months ago but I still think of how good the food was. I had the wild boar pasta. amazing. We also had there version of a caprese salad so good! In fact the food was so good I had to order a pizza to go as I had no left overs to take home. I also enjoy that's it's BYOB. I took a nice bottle of wine and I don't think they charged me a bottle fee. In the end. I can't wait to go back. Only issue would be parking sucks on butler street during peek hours.
