vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw Today I'm getting married in just a few hours and I had to take the time to write a review for this location. Here's why, last night my soon to be husband and I, as well as our daughter went to Oreganos for dinner. We chose to come here because it was at oreganos where we had our first date! And we have been continuing to go ever sense! The staff caught wind that we would be getting married that fallowing day, and to make it special for us they surprised us with a lovely bottle of champagne and an adorable card signed by all the staff! It was such a kind gesture, and really made our night! I wanted to thank all the staff at Oreganos for making our night something really special!
