Four in the shell and countless baby clams complimented by leeks and garlic.

By the time I had finished the pasta, there was still a bed of clams on my plate! I got a to go container for the little buggers and figure I'll add them to some sauce and pasta at home for round 2!

Entrees come with salad and bread.

Salute means cheers and, lucky for us, they have some delicious wines to say it with!
