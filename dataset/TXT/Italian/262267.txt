wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg This is a very important 4 stars. My wife and I had a major incident while we were there, and I have complete justification to write a bad review. However, the management staff recognized the major impact of the issue, took care of everything quickly, for the 4 star recovery. On to the food...
I always respect an Italian restaurant that gives aranchinis a try. These were very good for an American restaurant. Still on the look out for an authentic style one...
The entire menu seems like a scientific slight american modification of traditional Italian dishes. They were well prepared, but left me wanting the real thing. We will return, for the quality of the food was exceptional.
