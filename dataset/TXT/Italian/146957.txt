k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw The Bootlegger Italian Bistro came recommended by a friend and someone who was a resident of Vegas. My fiance and I are both fans of the old school Vegas days. The Bootleggar has been around since the RAT PACK days. It's history was very well represented in the decor. I loved it! Although it was was large restaurant it felt intimate. There was a very beautiful bar in the center of the main room with seating all around it. Off to the side was a piano bar with live entertainment. We sat in the main room but we could still hear the music. It was very romantic and I would suggest this spot for any occasion. The food was exceptional. I had the lasagna and my fiance had the Veal parmesan which came with a side of spaghetti. We had drinks before our dinner and they served us bread bites with marinara sauce. So yummy. For dessert we had the creme brule. It was probable the best we have tasted in a long time. I'm already craving this experience again.
