AKQbrvRBZvU5kB9Ut4gVkg I'm giving multiple level of stars to this place. I would like to give it 3.5, but I can't. 

Service...5. Our waiter (beyond being handsome) was excellent. Explained the menu in great detail and was very informed of all the ingredients, transport of items and depths of the wines and cocktails. Bravo!

Atmosphere....4-5. Cozy, quaint. A little loud, but with the walls and flooring and amount of people tucked in here, that can happen.

Food 3-4....antipasti platter. Great selection, not enough. 4 olives? Really? And, 2 pieces of bread for 6 people. Shouldn't have to ask for more. 
Pizza. I had the sausage and rapini. It was good. Crust is different...almost like an Indian bread. I liked. Rapini was fresh. Sausage was under flavor. Needed salt or parm within the pizza. I know the big deal from them now is that they are not cutting the pizza to maintain the integrity of the crust. Three words: CUT THE PIZZA. I don't want to shake the table cutting it and it didn't keep the crust crisp by not cutting it. Bottom was a bit soggy. 
Friends had pasta, ravioli, prosciutto pizza and veal. All were good. Have to say meatballs were great. Not the best, but great. We did have an appetizer of fried mozzarella balls that was heavenly. 
Tiramisu was okay. 
Price....1-2. I'm just not in to paying 15+ for a glass of wine and 18-22 for a pizza for 1-2 (maybe 2 if you get apps). I've had a 150 dollar bottle of wine and I'm telling you it's not all that different from a $25 bottle. I understand that all this food is flown in by Italian pilots humming Vivaldi, but I've had some pretty great Italian cuisine that beats this place on price by far.  

All in all...will I go back? Debatable.
