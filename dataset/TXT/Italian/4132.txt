_j-JBXnTuXclA1lEzzezmQ Imagine a crazy Valentine's evening.  A packed restaurant, a hectic kitchen, a special menu ... but it was a flawless evening.  The atmosphere was perfect.  Not dark, but a vibrant 'near Italian' feel.  The food was off the hook.  Beef carpaccio was beyond amazing, the best my girlfriend and I ever tasted. My seafood risotto was perfect.  The depth of flavor more than surprised me.  My girlfriend ordered pappardelle pescatore ... omg amazing too.  This place is a gem. Definitely coming back here.
