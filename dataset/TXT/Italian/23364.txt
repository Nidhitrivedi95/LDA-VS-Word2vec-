3qTSOuJ-ZyU1L7o62KHSIg I had the pleasure of dining here last night. The food was fabulous. I had the white sea bass and greens. To die for. The staff was courteous, our server Gary was tops and explained my meal to perfection. It was perfection, I ate every mouthful. I'm from the west end and a friend of mine suggested this place because it was suggested to him. Word of mouth is the best advertising and it proved so in this instance. Tiramisu was also delicious. Thank you and I will certainly recommend this restaurant. It certainly does have a "Nose" for quality!. Dee
