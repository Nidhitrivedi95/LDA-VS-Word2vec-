pOhX1XjbBdPoO2Fyy8RGJg After seeing this restaurant on "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives", we visited just at 11AM. The place fills up quickly for lunch!  Just very basic decor, but very clean! I ordered rigatoni with mushrooms, and it was very good. Meatballs (made with veal), big and tasty. My son, however, ordered a pepperoni pizza. I'm glad he ordered a large, because I tried a slice. Absolutely delicious! Among the top 3 pizzas I have ever tried! Some of it was saved to take home, and we fought over the final slices on the drive back! Magnificient pizza!
