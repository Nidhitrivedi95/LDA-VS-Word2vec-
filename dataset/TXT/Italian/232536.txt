tKi4OvAlckcVzeP92InsOQ I've been here a few times for the awesome reclining, cushy seats.  There is a ton of room in each seat and ample leg room even when fully reclined.  All of the seats are assigned which allows you to get there late if you want.  Besides the great seats, every Tuesday night all movies are only $5.  In addition, you can refill your soda for free if you are willing to exit your comfortable seat.  The only food delivery I've seen is pizza from the local pizza place next door.  I have yet to try this option but who doesn't want pizza during your movie!!  Definitely check this place out.  The only time I ever had an issue was the theater adjacent to the mini golf and bowling since it is not sound-proofed enough.
