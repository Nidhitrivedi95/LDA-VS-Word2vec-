7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA This wasn't my first visit, but it might be my last. Our server was new, which was the beginning of all of our problems. First off we ordered our appetizers and entrees all at once to make things easier on the new server. Our appetizers came out completely over cooked. Then the entrees came out. One of which was missing and didn't make it to the table for at least 10 minutes. I had to track down oir waitress to get an update on the food and to ask for more water. Finally we received all of our food and asked for the check only to be given another tables check. When I walked to the front desk to get the check it had no discount and there was no apology for the terrible service. It was almost like they hoped that we would just accept crappy service since the server was new. I mentioned the awful service and all that they offered to do was take half off of the entree that took forever to make it to the table. The food and service are normally good, but tonights fiasco has turned me off of this restaurant for a long time if not forever.
