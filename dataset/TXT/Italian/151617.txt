KpgPSQmQDgx3tJ6RlKVCBA Have gotten pizza here before and it was very good however picked one up tonight for dinner. What in the world? It was disgusting. The grease was dripping from it and it was totally soggy. So hard to find good pizza in this area. Will NOT be going back here. Couldn't stomach it had to throw it out. Sad. Save yourselves some grief and pass on this Streets of New York.
