tIiiq23utFKTs1At2bVD6w By far the best Italian food around! The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and guided us to an incredible meal. I would say this is more a date night restaurant although there were children there. The atmosphere was nice and inviting my husband had the ciopinno and I had the lobster ravioli both were delicious. The service was super fast as well especially for a Friday night! If you want some absolutely amazing food this is definitely the place to go!
