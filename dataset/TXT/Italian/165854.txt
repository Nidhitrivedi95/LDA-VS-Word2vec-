mAhu38hHUQyOatamyQsOww I went today for dinner with my friends around 530pm. We were the only ones in the restaurant. The waiter was trying to be nice, but not really, he explained the food when we asked but that was it, very bla service.

We got some starters they were nice, mushroom arancini and calamary.

We got pizzas and one order of pasta, very dispointing flavors for an italian place, plus they were so heavy, so much oil eshh. Not worth the money. Very pretty place but food, sorry guys not good.

I am definately not coming back.

Oh something that I really love was the washroom, super nice and very clean.
