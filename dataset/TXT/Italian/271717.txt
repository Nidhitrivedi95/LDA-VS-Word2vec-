Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ Love this place...been comig here for years.

The chicken wings here are great..great size and juicy as hell. Never do ya get those overfried dog toys!

The Antipasta salad is bomb...simple..and packed with meat and cheese. Not to leave out what may be my favorite dressing for an antipasto  salad..ever.

What of the pizza you ask? Its kick ass as well...nothing super spectacular but it is better than most places. Served square/rectangle several styles but fave is the mini so I can be a true tank and get wings and salad too!!

Small bar inside but still family safe and they have a bazillion TV's to watch whatever you want.

All in all...this is one of my staples in my food routines.
