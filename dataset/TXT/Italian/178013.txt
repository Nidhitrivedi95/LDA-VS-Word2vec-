NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA Solid pizza and good wings!   The pizza had a tasty and chewy crust although the pepperoni was scarce.  The Margherita pizza was equally tasty.  We also had the wings which were messy and delicious.  The Amalfi Salad was fresh and tasted great.  The staff was very nice too.  When my husband had low blood sugar the host  ran to get him a roll and a Pepsi. It was very kind of him to do that!
