ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw We are staying at a hospital nearby and just ordered veal parm, chicken parm, and cannolis for carry-out. Freaking amazing!  Every bite was wonderful. The spaghetti option that I ordered with the chicken was so good. I imagine they were made there?  Idk for sure but I loved it!
