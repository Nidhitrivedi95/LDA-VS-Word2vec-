D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA A great happy hour spot in Scottsdale. Really good specials that go until 7:00 pm. They have $3 beers, $4 well drinks, $5 wines and $6 cocktails. 

My go-to menu items have become the fried risotto balls (so good!) and the pizza. I've tried the Funghi Pizza - it's pretty good even though I hate mushrooms. They also have a regular pepperoni pizza on their happy hour menu. Their bruschetta changes daily and is hit or miss - the first time I ordered it, it was great. The second time... not so much. The handmade pasta is good too. 

Overall a great value - I'll definitely be back.
