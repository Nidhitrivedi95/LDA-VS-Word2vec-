pOEL97ld-FJMKO8Ki8JmYg The first time I went here it was a little slow and I was worried about the quality, but that worry was for naught as this place is pretty satisfying. One of the many O&B restaurants (obviously Lol) in Toronto, this particular one seems to focus on more on safe family style comfort food rather than anything more adventurous or high end. The prices, however, ARE a little on the high end for this type of food though.  
Luckily it mostly seems to be worth it. Everything I've tried here has been fairly excellent. The Mac and Cheese is creamy, delicious and recommended, and the pizza is satisfying too. However, it is a little on the high end price wise for this type of food to make it an easy go-to recommendation.
