We had dinner there tonight with another couple and we all enjoyed our meals.  The service was very attentive and food came hot and plentiful.  My husband and I shared a chicken souvlaki and ordered Greek salads on the side and an order of pita which was yummy.  Our friends ordered the lamb souvlaki and were mistakenly brought the chicken.  The waiter told us to go ahead and share the chicken and they would make up the lamb which was done quickly.  I thought this was good customer service.  We will definitely return and will get takeout from time to time.  People can be very picky and mean when leaving reviews.  I felt that I ate at a different restaurant than the one reviewed poorly by so many here.  We need these businesses to succeed in our neighborhoods and we should be offering as much support as we can when we have an enjoyable dinner.  I recommend this restaurant.
