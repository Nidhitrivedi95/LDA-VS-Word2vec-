nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Came here for late drinks with a huge party so this is really about the bar service and menu.

They didn't have a huge cocktail menu but whatever they served was pretty darn good.  It's good to see that even the Cake Boss knows you gotta spice up your drinks to make people get sloshed (like we did for a big reunion party).  I had a berry mohjito that was absolutely kick ass.  The bartender was also very friendly and did a good job of making sure the drinks kept flowing.

The ambiance of this place is really nice and there's a good amount of space that can accommodate a large number of guests, making it a great meeting spot if you're part of a big party or celebration.
