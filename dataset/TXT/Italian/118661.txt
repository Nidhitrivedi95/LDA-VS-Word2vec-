GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ Let's start by saying I nor the other person in my party eat pork. We spent 5 minutes talking with the waitress how pork does not belong in a lobster roll and ordered a lobster roll with NO bacon. The lobster roll came out with bacon. We told the waitress and she took away the roll and the manager came over. They did not bring us a new roll but instead gave us a free milkshake (which we didn't even want) the bill came and we mentioned something about taking the roll off since it was made incorrectly and we were never brought a new one. They wouldn't take it off the bill because they gave us a milkshake that we didn't even want. I can't believe Mario and Bastianich put their name on this place. Obviously it's just so they can make money. They definitely wouldn't eat the slop served here. The cod sandwich was flavor less and soggy. I wish we would have ate at Mcdonalds (no joke)
