G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I finally got to eat at my favorite food network stars' restaurant and it did not disappoint! The ambiance and the decor at the restaurant was classy and upscale yet managing to stay warm and inviting.

We did the tasting menu and everything was delicious. And then when that dessert cart came around, we were like kids wanting everything in sight.

But what took our experience to the next level is the service that we got at our table with Cliff...he was instantly warm and inviting with his great big smile. He went above and beyond in accommodating me with vegetarian options in the tasting menu, making sure I was not left out and had plenty to eat. He also recommended these yummy St. Germaine spritzers for an anniversary toast.

These are just a few things that made our experience at Giada's memorable and when in Vegas again, we certainly will be back to dine at this restaurant.
