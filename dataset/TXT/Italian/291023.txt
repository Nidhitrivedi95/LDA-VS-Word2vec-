zY6f_cFY8HTI3hLlJj3SOg Went in for lunch-one slice of cheese pizza, salad and driink for $6.  The salad was just a standard iceberg salad used to convince ourselves that we ate something healthy before the calorie bomb.  The pizza slice was the size of my head.  They threw it in the oven for a few minutes, so the edges had crunchy, toasted cheese while the middle was ooey gooey cheese.  Quite tasty. I will be back.
