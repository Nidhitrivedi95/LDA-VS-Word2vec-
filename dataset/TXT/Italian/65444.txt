bKh66jlEqEKZZFkjWipt8w I went to Stoney's back in March with a couple of my friends for dinner. 

It's a cute place but you have to go up to the counter, place your order and then they bring it to your table. I ordered the Giuseppe's pizza (see pic) and it was delicious. Thin crust, cooked to perfection, fresh ingredients and perfectly seasoned dough. One of my friends had a Caesar salad and tuna sandwich which was on some freshly baked bread and she said it was outstanding. My other friend had a pizza that had artichoke and some other stuff that didn't look too appetizing. She complained that it was very soggy.

The young guys that were working there were very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely return and order the Giuseppe's pizza.
