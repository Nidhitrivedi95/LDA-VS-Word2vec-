iqntlaqSCB4hkzTzlPlEmQ The food and service as excellent.  This was our first visit to Bravo We went on Sunday and they served 
brunch until 3pm.  

My kids and wife had breakfast entries.  The portion sizes were good, presentation was excellent, and the  taste spot on.

I had the Sicilian Pizza.  It had lots of toppings, and was a thin crispy crust.

We tried the white peach sangria.  Found it to be overly tart compared to any other white peach sangria I have ever had.  It would have been better had it been a little sweeter. 

Other than that, the overall experience was good. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  Can't wait to come back to try their dinners.
