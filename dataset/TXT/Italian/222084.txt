SgSVJWgMwFteYyz4OlHu9Q The new owners are on to something good with this place.  The wings are tasty with the perfect amount of hotness to the sauce, (we had the medium).  Their regular pizza is great and is the correct size for a large pie, unlike a lot of places out here in Vegas where the large pie is an inch to an inch and a half smaller than it should be diameter-wise. Had a chance to try their "grandma" pizza, which was phenomenal.  It really brought me back to some of the great pizza I enjoy back in Long Island.  
The place is family owned and operated and I love supporting local places like this and I would highly recommend you, (the reader of this review), to do the same.
