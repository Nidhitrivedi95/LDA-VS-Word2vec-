cAyi1WEvty4vckQJ3YU1RA You really have to wonder about people...

This place is a dive. Food is mediocre at best, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it's also a bar, and so you can order beer with your eggs at 6:30am (if you're into that). TV blaring 24-hour news (murder, murder, murder, rape, murder) with three families including several small kids, doughy french toast, bacon that was manufactured instead of off of the hog, sausage gravy that is 99% white flour, 1% sausage. Also note that the location is NOT where it says it is in Google Maps via Yelp! App. for iPhone.
