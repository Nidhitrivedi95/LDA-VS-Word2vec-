a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w Pasta Brioni...what can I say? This place has some of the best eggplant parm that has ever passed through my lips! Mmm mmm mmm!

My boyfriend and I came here on a whim after another one of our fave Italin spots in Scottsdale (NY's Best Italian) closed and we were NOT disappointed!

It may not be the fanciest or most romantic place from a décor & lighting perspective, but the food is amazing and reasonably priced.

I did wish they had a bit more selection on the wine list but that's really a minor complaint.

I loved my eggplant and my man loved his shrimp scampi pasta. And we BOTH loved the yummy fresh bread. You have definitely NOT seen the last of us Brioni!
