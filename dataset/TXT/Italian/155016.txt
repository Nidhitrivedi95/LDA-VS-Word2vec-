l0dOj4jI82qk-x6WVwNQLQ I used to live in Toronto, and would frequent Sorento quite a bit (during lunch mostly, as I worked nearby).  I moved to the States a few years ago and recently returned to Toronto for a visit.  I just HAD to come back to Sorento!  I came with some of my friends on a Sunday afternoon/evening and we sat on the beautiful patio.  The ambiance was great.  Our server was very attentive, always checking on us.  We started out with a few appetizers: calamari was golden and crispy.  The tzatziki that came with it made for a great pairing.  We also ordered the hummus-you CANNOT find hummus like this ANYWHERE ELSE!  I've tried hummus at several different restaurants, bought hummus from the grocery store and I have not been able to find anything that matches this.  The bread they serve with the hummus is SO delicious as well, great combination.  For my main dish I ordered the combination kabob (ground beef and chicken).  Both were SO tender and cooked to perfection.  The rice is so fluffy and delicious, I've never had rice like this before.  I love the saffron on top, the presentation is just beautiful.  My friend ordered a pizza that she created herself and the crust was just right-crispy and delicious.  Another friend ordered the lamb shank and I tried a few bites.  I'm not normally a fan of lamb but this was just something else.  The sauce was just right.  For dessert we ordered some tiramisu.  They make the tiramisu at the restaurant and it is TO DIE FOR!  We paired it with cappuccinos and it really hit the spot.  I wish my stay was longer, so I could have gone back and ordered that lamb shank!  I guess that will have to wait until the next time I visit Toronto!
