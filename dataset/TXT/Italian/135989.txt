IXUoO2QcFergBHdR4wPf9g I like that we have a new spot within a short bike ride for us. I assumed it was another sports bar with a name like Pitch. But they have a full service menu and wine list.
It's cozy hipster dark inside. Modern rustic....the garage doors at the bar are always nice so you feel like you're outside even when you're not. Speaking of....they have a great looking patio. Dog friendly.
We ordered a Shroom pizza. It was plenty large enough for two people. It came super loaded with flavorful, earthy mushrooms. The crust was thin and crispy. It was super tasty. 
There are numerous menu items....from apps and pizza to burgers and seafood entrees. A handful of vegetarian options are scattered throughout. But our server said some meat heavy options could be modified.
Our server was really attentive and informative, considering this to be our first visit.
I'm not a great writer so I'll close by saying we really enjoyed this place!
