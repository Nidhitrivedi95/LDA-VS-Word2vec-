3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg Whenever there is some sort of holiday or reason to take someone out to a nice steak and seafood dinner this is the place.  I wish I could eat there once a week but it's a little pricey for that. In am a huge fan of mastros as well but  Dominick's has a really cool ambiance that appeals to me more and it's basically the same menu.

Their fresh bread basket has some really tastes breads and I would highly recommend the seafood tower which is my favorite to start or I could just fill up on the seafood tower and a salad alone.

I also recommend the shrimp Dominick which has this amazing sauce that you can also dip your bread in.

I have never has a bad cut of meat there and the sides are so delicious and they are pretty large so I am always taking home tons of leftovers.  And there is nothing better than steakhouse leftovers (except maybe cold pizza but anyway) the next day.

The butter cake is by far my favorite dessert if you still have room after everything else which is usually not the case for me.

If you are looking to impress, this is definitely the spot.  Plus the quarter is a cool place to walk around after dinner and iPic is right there to catch a movie at too.
