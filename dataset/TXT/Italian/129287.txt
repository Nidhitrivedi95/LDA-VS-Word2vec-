i53HvxUdQEMllZ1XmpjjyA First let's start with the flyer we got it says if you order online and you will 20% off. That's not the case it came up on the check out as 5%. I called them the woman I talked to was rude and disrespectful and told me I was wrong and it was an old flyer. I had just gotten the flyer in the mail the day befor so I knew it wasn't old.

So 40 mins latter and only 5% off instead of 20% the food get here looks ok but I take a bight into my  calzone  and I get a mouthful of onions .  I made sure to put on my order no onions .  So I called the store and they tell me they will remake a new one if I would like they say it will be 30-45 minutes for it to get there. 1.2 hours latter still no  calzone  I call them back and ask them what the deal is they say that it will be here in a few minutes another 15 minutes later deliveryman finally gets here with my food cold !!!!!!!!

This will be the last time I ever order from this place she wasn't willing to give me my money back she told me that  that I can get 20% off of my next order like I'm going to order from them ever again.
