G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Had a really wonderful breakfast here this morning.

We made reservations, as recommended, and were seated immediately upon arrival. Our seats were right on the strip. I would warn that if you're not prepared for the noise, you may prefer inside. But it's Vegas, everything is loud.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous and very inviting. Our server was wonderful. She was attentive and helpful. I let her know when we sat down that we were using the groupon. I didn't have to say more (I'm sure they're used to people using the Groupon), she brought our complimentary champagne.

We ordered the pastry selection (4 pieces) and each was great- the scone being our absolute favorite.

I opted for the caprese frittata (sans pancetta) and it was light yet filling. My husband had the "American" breakfast with the meatballs which were an interesting and great compliment to the eggs and potatoes.

Overall, we had no complaints so this meal gets 5 stars!
