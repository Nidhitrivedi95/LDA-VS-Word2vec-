9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw What can I say about Cibo besides... yum!

This quaint little house styled restaurant is a great hidden gem in the Downtown Phoenix area. With it's warm and romantic patio ambiance, who would not want to relax here at any point in time as long as it is not summertime... ha. When you walk in, you get that great sense of home.

However, the best part of Cibo is definitely not the decor or ambiance. it is that food. Their appetizers are a so very delicious way to begin your culinary experience here. Then when it is time to pick your main course, just start with the top and move down the list. I can guarantee that once you've eaten here you'll keep coming back for more. I know I do.

Their wines are not too pricey either which is great... especially if you can take advantage of their happy hour. it is a valued place for sure. thank you for making every experience a good one... that's why I keep on coming home to you!
