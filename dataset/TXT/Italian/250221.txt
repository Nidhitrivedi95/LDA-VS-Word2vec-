vmT1fe7ylbmDVjZimyFcTQ I've went there on a date with my boyfriend and would definitely go again.

The restaurant looks neat and fashionable, the music is not too loud, the lights are appropriate to give a smooth atmosphere.

Would absolutely recommend and will be back for sure.

I had a vegetables pasta meal (can't remember the name) which was absolutely delicious and they focused on quality rather than quantity, which many restaurants fail to do.

My SO had a burger, he asked for no mayo, but they put mayo anyway. He asked for another one and it was in front of him merely 5 minutes later. Very fast service !

Slightly expensive, but that is to be expected seeing the quality of the food and atmosphere.
