WW_oh8NfnHH32L_H5Kn1Ig The family went out for dinner last week and we all decided to have a Caesar salad which was pretty good. My husband had a pizza that he loved and my daughters had a pasta dish . One had a white sauce and the other had a red sauce, they were both a little disappointed with the flavour of their pasta. I myself had a burger, although the French fries we're like McCain frozen fries the burger itself was absolutely delicious it was juicy and the flavour was perfect.
