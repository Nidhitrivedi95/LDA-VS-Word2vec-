yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w This place is really cute. The atmosphere was really cozy and had records and old framed photos everywhere. It's really dark inside though. 

I went there for dinner with my friend, his mom, and sister. We're seated almost immediately and greeted by what I think was the busboy?

One thing I thought was strange was that the waiter touched our table a total of maybe two or three times? The busboy or back up waiter consistently came over to check our table to see how we were doing. 

When we sat down white and red wine was dropped off.. Bottomless wine? Why not? But it's obviously not the best stuff. I barely touched it. The menus are posted on the wall, and at first glance I thought the prices were a bit high.. Then when the good came the portions were MASSIVE. The food was just okay, nothing outstanding. 

For the price you're getting a soup or salad an entree and a dessert drink and bottomless wine while you dine. I guess it's not so bad.
