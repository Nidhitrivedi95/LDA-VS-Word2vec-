s7Pj1mNYqRTGNOXLOiBafw Really gorgeous atmosphere, great space on the patio, but the interior decor is worth sitting inside! Perfect for date night, group brunching, cocktails, or other events. The food was really good quality (We ordered a variety of pizzas to share) as well as wine to drink! 
I definitely recommend going to Figo!! It also gets really busy so I suggest making a reservation as well.
