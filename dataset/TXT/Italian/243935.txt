usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA First time here and we thought it was EXCELLENT!  You can't add or substitute...pasta comes as is and same with salad but we thought it was very tasty!!

Staff was very friendly and service was good also!  Menu changes often so if you like something the next time it may not be on the menu is disappointing but...that just means you have to try another delicious pasta dish!
