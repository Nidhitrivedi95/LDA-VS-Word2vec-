6PQve0oFCLPSh4wnIzvJtg I've gotten food to go from this neighborhood Italian restaurant 3 times in the past, all without incident and all very good.  Today, however, was quite different.  I called in an order to go at 3:55 pm and was told it would be ready in 45 minutes.  I arrived on time and no one there could find a record of the order until the waitress that had taken it over the phone said yes she remembered it, but that they had gotten busy and that's why it wasn't ready.  She said it would "just be 6 minutes to make it" (a well done pizza and spaghetti & meatballs).  While I don't know much about cooking, even I knew that wasn't a realistic time.  And, if it truly would only take "6 minutes" to make, why did she tell me "45 minutes" in the first place?  But, worse than that was her attitude, which I would describe as indifferent or apathetic: she had no problem with accepting the order and giving her word that it would be ready and waiting for me, and then just blowing it off when I arrived.  

Maybe I caught the staff there on an "off day".  Be that as it may, I'd suggest that if you order food to go from Buon Gusto, you get a firm commitment on their intentions to follow thru on it.
