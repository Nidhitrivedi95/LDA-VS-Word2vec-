fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w We were walking back to our hotel from a pool party when we realize we were really hungry. We just happened to pass by this place and stopped in. We had a really friendly bartender who made it a great experience. They were busy but still got our food out fast. I had the bacon burger and it was delicious, and huge!!! I only ate a third. I would definitely come back to this place and recommend to anyone who wants some good food for a decent price in Vegas.
