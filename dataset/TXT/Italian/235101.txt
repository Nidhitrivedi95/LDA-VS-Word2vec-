tvhcshPITUGa_ffUlU-BHA This is one of my favorite restaurants. Get the zucchini or the calamari for an appetizer you can't go wrong. The bread with oil and spices they bring out is wonderful. Their salads are very good and always fresh. I will get the Pollo Rosa Maria or the Chicken Trio which comes with one Rosa, one Marsala and one chicken Bryan. You can substitute one out if you don't care for one. I usually get two Rosa's and a Marsala. I really love their fettuccini alfredo as my side. I don't like that they charge you I think 1.75 extra if you want this as your side. Total crap when you're already paying 20 plus dollars for one dish. I also don't like paying $3 for soft drinks.Total rip off and pure profit for these restaurants. All in all you won't be disappointed coming here but it is costly. Go to restaurant.com and sign up. Every third visit you get $20 off on your next visit which helps.
