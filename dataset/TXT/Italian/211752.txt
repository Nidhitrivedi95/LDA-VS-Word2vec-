r03BNov4Uyul5bJzlgWdJQ After reading so much about this place, the little lady decided without any uncertainties that we are going Italian.

That's Italian is located north of Major Mac on Yonge (actually north of Crosby for those who are familiar).  You will probably see the Dairy Queen sign before you see their sign.  Plenty of parking - actually when we went, prime time dinner hour, there were parking everywhere as we were the only ones at this restaurant.  Kind of made me nervous - what is wrong with the place?

We still went in and sat down.  The place is family run and have homemade food.  According to our server (I guess he's familia), they do a lot of catering and take out.  I hope so as we were the only peeps during our whole dinner time.

We had the Americano and Quattro Stagione Pizzas, Arancini, Chicken Parm with Penne.  The portions were quite large.  I would say their pizzas are equivalent to in size to a medium pizza nova.  The Parm was huge and delicious.  The Arancini - hmmm...OK.

Overall, the meal was enjoyed by the fam.  We even had to take some food home.  The meal wasn't too expensive but not sure if we wanted to make the trip back up when I have Abruzzo's across the street.

Hope business picks up for them as they do serve good homemade food.

Cheers!
