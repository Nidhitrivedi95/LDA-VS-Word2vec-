sw3HdidP3E9YiuuLVyfeNw I have been a number of times over the years and keep coming back for the food and for the setting.  If possible, I highly recommend getting a table near the front window.  The food has always been delicious, but what I love most of all is the attitude of the servers to leave you in peace and let you stay as long as you like!  My only teeny wish is for a bigger list of wines by the glass.  This is a neighborhood gem!
