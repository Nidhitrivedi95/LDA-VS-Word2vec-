Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA My fiance and I didn't plan on eating here before our Cirque du Soleil show at MGM but the location where I had made reservations didn't sound very good once we got there to read the menu. I am so glad that we changed our minds! 
I had been to an Il Fornaio in Walnut Creek, CA a couple weeks before so I recogized the name. The drinks were yummy and the food was fantastic. My pizza was perfectly cooked and my fiance's salmon was seasoned well and not over or under cooked at all. I was excited to find out that there is a location closer to where I live in Carmel, CA so I think I will be going there next time I am in the need for a fancy dinner.
