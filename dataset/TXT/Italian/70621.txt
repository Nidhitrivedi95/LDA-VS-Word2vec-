c-l4nDPZcEwapEiV-Xf08w What a delightful experience we had today with every dish we chose and enjoyed. Bread and butter to start a pleasure, Salmon was exquisite, octopus delicious like always, pork ribs so tender and savorous, Moussaka's taste a temptation, sea food soup a delicacy, every thing incited senses and left a placid sensation to your spirit. And David knew how to made our day, excellent service and attention. Great evening and feast!
