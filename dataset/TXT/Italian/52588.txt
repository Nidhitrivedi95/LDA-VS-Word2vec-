9X935zq92IQDnl1n23PivA I love the Lamb Stew that is no longer on the menu (I'm very sad to find that out recently). Last time I was there (last weekend, I was craving Lamb Stew), I was so hungry that I didn't leave when I received the news about no Lamb Stew on the menu. I tried the Spring Roll Basket before I left disappointed because my fav dish is gone forever. The appetizer was really great and it had a kick to it, (spicy) for those who like it and can handle it. I usually can't handle it but it didn't do any harm to me. I will go back to try the new menu though. No pictures yet because I forgot about Yelp and now I have an iphone so I will use this site more often, if I remember LOL!
