qRTbYc7ennnwfr992kfjdA I had a groupon deal on this place, and I have to say that I was more than satisfy with my meal. I order the calamari and mussel for appetizer. Both were amazing. Then I order the chicken breast and my gf order the salmon. Both were superb too. The service was excellent, and the owner was very nice. Without the groupon, the price were still reasonable.
