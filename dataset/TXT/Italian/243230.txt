UQiUVCtG-rJxoriuEv1RRQ I took my partner here for her birthday on Friday September 25th. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. Food however was horrible. We started out with sangria and a glass of wine both of which were great but it was downhill from there. Appetizer of potstickers that were from a freezer bag that you can get at Costco, 10 bucks for 4 and they were disgusting. My main course was pecan crusted chicken and the chicken was very dry the vegetables that came with it were mushy and there was not nearly enough sauce. My partner got the sweet potato enchilada and it was not good at all. On their website they advertise little mini apple pies that are supposed to be to die for, mine tasted like it was baked about a week ago it was very dry and bland, to be honest with you I would have rather eaten a hostess apple pie and we all know how gross those are. We also got a bread pudding which I would give a 7 out of 10 so it was pretty decent but that was compared to everything else that we had tried. I really can't say how disappointed we where and we will never be going back. This seems to be the trend and when your meal is over $100 for two people, it should be at least satisfy. You shouldn't be leaving the place you had dinner pissed off and feeling resentful that you spent so much money on a very disappointing meal. Makes it hard to support non chain establishments when you consistently get food like this.
