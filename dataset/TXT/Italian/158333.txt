LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Have always gotten pasta when at Maggiano's and it has always been the best ever so this time we decided to get peppercorn sirloin. OMG it was the best!!  Since it comes with peppercorn sauce, not knowing if we would like it, we asked for it on the side which was a good idea since we did not like the sauce.  I love this place.
