RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ Mineo's serves a unique style of Pizza. It's not the type of pizza you will find in most of the of the other joints in the 'bugh. It's very good, just different. Let me describe it for you: The crust is neither too thick or to thin and is quite flaky and soft. The sauce also is pretty standard, but the difference comes with the cheese and toppings. At Mineos the pepperoni is actually placed under the cheese. And there is not just a couple pieces sporadically tossed over the pie, but instead the entire thing is covered with thick sliced pepperoni. To top it off the cheese is layered on like an inch thick. I've never seen so much cheese on a pizza before. And it is greasy, I'm talking grease ponds pooling on the slices. For my tastes it is great, but i can see why other people don't like it. Have a gallon of water handy after you finish eating. Every time I eat here I am thirsty or hours afterwards. Like most pizza places you either love it or hate it.

A large one topping isn't cheap, something like 20 dollars. But in my opinion well worth the extra 5 dollars to support a local restaurant instead of some chain.
