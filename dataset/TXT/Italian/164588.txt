Lzj-_QdzL2bLeHd_bC88Fg meh. Went for my graduation dinner here. 

The owner is very friendly. She tries too hard.

Beautiful decoration. Great location. 

Is this a trending problem with many new restaurants in Toronto?. Because they re gorgeous but that is it. Is like eating cheap catering food in a museum.

The food hit and miss.

Gazpacho soup: Was that really a gazpacho? To me it was badly chopped onion and pepper floating in toms clamato. Disgusting. Real gazpacho is not even comparable to this. I lived in Spain several years and can speak freely about this.

Truffle app: Very well executed, excellent flavour!

Burrata salad: Nice, nothing I could have not prepared at home.

Fish stuffed with fennel: Good, althought the filling was not that good, needs some more garlic and seasoning in the supposed marinade. The only good part of this dish was the potatoes and the carrots.

Pasta: fantastic, fresh, sauce fresh.

I would recommend the owner to be more attentive with the menu, the cooks and prep boys are not really hitting the note.

Very expensive for the quality offered.
