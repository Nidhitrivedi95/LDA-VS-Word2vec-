u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog Service - A little stuck up.
Reservations - We went late on Friday night but none was needed.
Food - Hit or miss.  Overpriced.
1. Short Rib Bucatini Special - Salty
2. Penne Alla Vodka - Just not memorable.
3. Ricotta Gnocchi - Very dense.  The "gravy" was delicious.
4. Sauteed Greens - The spinach was perfectly cooked.
