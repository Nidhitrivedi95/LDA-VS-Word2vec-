qisbqK1wxuwp6GumMrwB2Q There are a lot of options in N Glendale if you want to enjoy a slice of pizza or a whole pie, but Bottega is my local #1 if I want brick-oven, Neopolitan style pizza. I've dined here a few times since the transition from Pomo to Bottega and the food is top notch and made with very high quality ingredients. The owner- Nick- is normally on site and checking on customers and the kitchen which is what a place like this needs because it's Bottega by name but once you've met Nick you'll feel like it's Nick's place and you're welcome to stop by anytime and make yourself comfortable at a table or at the bar.

Last Sunday night, we had the Botttega pizza, which is red sauce, mozzarella, basil, roasted red peppers, spicy salami and sausage and a bottle of house wine for $20. Tiara was our server, and she was great. She brought us the polenta and mushroom app and the sauce was begging to be sopped up with something so she got us some fresh baked bread from the brick oven.   

One thing I have to point out is that on Mother's Day they offered a set price 3-course meal but also kept the regular menu and the happy hour specials. Plenty of restaurants wouldn't do that and I appreciated that they did keep all options open.

Big patio out front with misters and shades plus a huge private room for events. I haven't tried many of the pasta dishes yet but that'll happen. You should put Bottega into your rotation for pizza, happy hour, or Italian food.
