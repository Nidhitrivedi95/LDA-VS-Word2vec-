Food: 

I've had their Chicken Parm to-go and the turkey sub lunch offering. The chicken parm was pretty solid, could have used a bit more S&P but a good meal nonetheless. The sub was fantastic, fresh sliced turkey bathed in an herbal-y green sauce. Oh, and the chocolate chip cookie I had there was one of the best of my life!

Ambiance/Service:

Friendly and typical counter-service, the place has the vibe of an upscale cafe or the like - clean, white, and modern. Lots of natural light from the large windows. Friendly and straight-shooting service!
