SeQXxtKhqgr5SHw4VIjaLw My experience is mixed. Things started off poorly. We ordered drinks and someone got a cup of hot water. Waitress said it cost 1.50 but she's not going to charge us. Why even day that. While ordering food she was quite abrupt. We had brushetta appetizer. It was bad (taste, toppings and bread). 

The meal turned around when the pizza came. I chose the make your own and it was decent. Nothing special. My friend said he's tasted like it was under the heat lamp while the other meals were being finished. 

Will I go back? No.
