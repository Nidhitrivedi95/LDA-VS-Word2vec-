EY4xsGDe0euyusOfAb3Cwg In the grange food court is where you will find this wonderful food counter that serves up (one would argue) Toronto's best Italian sandwiches. 

When I first came here a few months ago, I was blown away by the price of their specials. For four dollars you get a loaded veggie sandwich, a drink, and their chips. You can hardly get a veggie sandwich alone at that price normally. Despite being inexpensive, they use a generous amount of toppings that are made fresh daily (mushrooms, beans, eggplant, etc). They also use fresh bread from a local bakery. Their "chips" are also very unique, slathered in tomato and pesto sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about this. 

Despite the food being of excellent quality and value, my favourite part about coming to this place is getting the chance to talk to the owner. He is a super friendly guy, who always greets you with a warm smile. And when you leave he will say, "ciao Bella!" 

This place should get way more attention! It is truly a hidden little gem.
