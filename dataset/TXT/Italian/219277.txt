sa1ZAswk7kEQfg9Mb6iQwQ We've been here numerous times and it's always been fabulous. We always get the server to pick some delicious stuff for us and eat based on their reccomendations (believe me it's the best way to do it!!!!). The food is always excellent, top notch ingredients and quality. If you go you must try...
- the pork chop: to die for with sautéed leeks and cauliflower
- the braised cauliflower: kind of like buffalo cauliflower you see most places but not fried!! 
- the asparagus and prosciutto pizza: I think this may be seasonal :( 
- sweet pea Aranccini balls 
- any of their delicious stuffed pastas 
Really anything you have will be exceptional. The service is always above and beyond and they make a killer cocktail too!!
