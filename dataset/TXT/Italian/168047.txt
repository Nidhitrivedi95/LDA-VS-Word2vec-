mJ_ucQ2_3hfTsmCcKb-hgw So many good reviews... 

My boyfriend and I wandered in on a Saturday during lunch to try a new restaurant. The atmosphere is very nice, the service was okay, but the food was disappointing. The food wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good either. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with chips. The chips were good (maybe a little over seasoned), but the grilled chicken was bad. The chicken tasted like the grill (not in a good way). It had an odd taste and smell to it. 

My boyfriend had the crab cake sandwich with pasta salad. I had a bite of his pasta salad and it was good. He said his crab cake was full of filler and not a whole lot of crab. 

Meh- I would give it another shot since fellow yelpers have rated this an average of four stars...
