The main entrees were the same you could find at any Italian restaurant for a little extra. The service was also okay. Food came at the same time, waiter came around from time to time, but nothing stood out. Didn't seem to care to be there.

The restaurant itself looks very nice and would be a much better environment if it was full. For how much floor space the place had, there were not a lot of people (and it was Father's Day).

UPDATE: Went two more times for family gatherings. Earlier in November I went with a party of 6 and food/service was fantastic. However, returned for Easter and had a large party. Waitress did not seem enthused about working, dishes came out lukewarm. The Owner was more than happy to assist us when we needed it, I just wish the waitress would have showed the same attention. Therefore, it stays at 3 stars.
