wUqqq1nUFA8Fn-3vYYFyWQ MMmm....love this place.  My mouth waters thinking about the Pollo d'aglio....marinara sauce with goat cheese.....mmm!  Love the huge booths, I went there on a double date last time which was a lot of fun.  Don't forget to check out the downstairs wine cellar.  Tied with the King Street Tutto for best downtown Italian....wait, I changed my mind, Porta Bella definitely wins.  5 stars.
