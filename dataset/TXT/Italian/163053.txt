lvv9Vv_5i4IwvDdofO_rKg Full disclosure...We only did the charcuterie and drank (and did this all while sitting at the bar).

First, we entered from the mall entrance... behind an escalator, a bit of a weird entrance...

The décor is great and the atmosphere seemed to be nice. We had the large charcuterie plate which was yummy.

The original bartender we had was not super engaging and didn't help us much when we would ask questions... or just try to be playful, but the second one we had was great and helpful with suggestions.

The staff were interacted with were mostly pleasant.

The atmosphere was nice, food looked good, and the items we had were good.
