IXUwuNjy707wJNW2U4sRVg Have always enjoyed our visits here.  It is a fresh and different dining experience in the area, unpretentious but still refined with excellent wine and food.  No wine snobbishness here and yet perhaps the best selection of Italian wines in the region.  Owner is partial to wines from Piedmonte.. a kindred spirit who is fanatical about Borolo.  One of the best authentic ragu Bologneise anywhere.
