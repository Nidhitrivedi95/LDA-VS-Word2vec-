A little surprised that the stromboli came with so much on it - I ordered meatball thinking it would just be meatball and cheese.  But it comes with ham, pepperoni, salami, cheese, and meatball.  It does say this on the menu, I guess I thought those were options.  Never had a stromboli come with all that on it before and I eat a lot of them!  But it still tastes great so fine with me.  Will definitely call again soon!
