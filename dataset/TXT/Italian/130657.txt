iBZcbvdM1vp_xiuxJVqkNw I normally like Streets of New York however the staff at this location seemed to be in a hurry to get home. Even before closing time. All I wanted was a salad 15 minutes before closing. But that seemed to be too much of a task. Don't be fooled by there so called closing time. They stop serving people at a quarter till. Not even a salad.
