JFNv5sKeKAf1ZVPnfbzpXw Horrible! I called to place an order over the phone for pick up and the girl was terrible. She put me on hold and then picked up six or seven times to talk to me, but then kept placing me on hold.  I was told my pizza would take 20-25 mins. I got to East West Pizza 25 minutes after placing my order and was told that it would take another 30 minutes from the time I paid for it. From the time I placed my order to the time I walked out of the restaurant it was over an hour. I thought this pizza better be great considering how long I waited for it and how much I paid for it (it was $18 for a large with two toppings). I took it home and ate it and threw more then half of it away. It was not good at all! Their toppings are very bland. There is nothing special about this pizza at all. It is obviously from all frozen products. They brag about their cheese on the top of the box and it is tasteless and disgusting! I would never go back!! If I could give them negative stars I would. Do not go to East West Pizza. Go to Grimaldis or something. It is not worth the $18 I paid or the hour I waited!!!
