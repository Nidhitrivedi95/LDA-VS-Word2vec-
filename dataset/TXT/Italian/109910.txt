G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I had the salmon cakes benedict  breakfast which was delicious!  The orange juice in the mimosa was a bit too tart for me, obviously made with fresh squeezed oranges but still too tart.  The orzo meatballs were very good.  Loved the vanilla latte with cookies (the lemon was my favorite).  Overall a nice experience.
