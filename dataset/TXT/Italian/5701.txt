_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw Wife and I went in last weekend. We have been patiently waiting for them to open and were excited to finally go. I will cut to the chase. We were very disappointed. We started with drinks and an appetizer. The app was their version of calamari and shrimp. It was pricey and very bland. I had to cover it in salt just to make it palatable. Drinks were over priced and unimpressive. After the uneventful pre-meal, we decided to play it safe and order their signature pizza, the POMO. Can't go wrong there, right?.... Well, it was absolutely bland and tasteless. Terrible pizza. Not sure what all the hype is about this place. I live in Gilbert and frequent the Heritage district quite often. Believe me, there are far better choices all within walking distance to this place. Needless to say, I will not be going back to Pomo any time soon.
