RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ This review is for the ice cream served adjacent to the pizza counter. What makes this place nice is the fact that they often have interesting flavors not seen elsewhere, such as apple pie with actual pie chunks or grasshopper (mint, chocolate, and fudge). The flavors also change regularly. I find them to be a much less expensive alternative to Cold Stone, which is way too indulgent and sweet.
