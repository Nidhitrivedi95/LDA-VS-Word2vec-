fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg Went here for lunch today with three other people from work. It was packed but we were able to get a table in the back. They have some great lunch specials and I ordered the Shrimp tempura Udon soup with a California roll. The soup was good however it could have had a little more flavor. I ended up having to put in some soy sauce to liven it up a little bit. The California roll was right on and I enjoyed it. I also ordered a side if Gyoza (potstickers) and they were very tasty as well. I really like how the wrapping was thinner than most places. The bread that they give you when you sit down is very good.  They are hot and fresh yeasty rolls and it was hard to have just one. They also have a great selection of desserts as well as baked goods. I did bring home a slice of chocolate cake for hubby so I don't know how it is yet but it sure looks good! Service was very good and our waitress was very friendly and attentive. I would recommend this place and will definitely come back again.
