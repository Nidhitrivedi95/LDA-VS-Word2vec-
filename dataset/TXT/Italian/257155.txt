w2b0ve7xpuCQkwYICFIUOg Love this small very cozy restaurant. The food is amazing. Everything is made to order. The baked eggplant parm is the best I ever had. I have eaten several items and have not been let down. The garlic bread rocks. The owners are very warm and inviting with their guests. The art work that decorates the restaurant is amazing and it is all for sale.
