DZfFFSVFVJVxs3vfFVVf0w The store near Bell and 7th St. was filthy.
The employee making the pizza obviously had a cold or sniffles or something.  Repeatedly touched his face and handled the food.

My slice of pizza was very good.
But the utensils were all soiled, the tables were dirty, windows dirty, etc.

Been to this and other Ray's pizza locations many times.
