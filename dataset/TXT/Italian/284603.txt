ZBSha-zoPLias7wCQ0ZyVw Gamberoni is a hidden gem.  I have dined at the restaurant countless times and I have left satisfied and looking forward to coming back again.  My favourite meal is the veal cannelloni--it is absolutely brilliant--they also make excellent tiramisu. Based on my interaction with some of the waiters, they make the pasta dough themselves! Majority of the Italian restaurants I have checked out the food has tasted as though it was already pre-made frozen and they simply reheated it.

It may take some time for the meal to be  ready, however, it is definitely worth it.  I recommend you make a reservation because otherwise you will left to wait in line (especially on Fridays & Saturdays). A few minor negative observations (1) given how busy it gets sometimes the waiters are too preoccupied to attend to you [which is again explainable by the fact the place is completely packed] (2) I was not a major fan of the bread basket--it tasted a bit stale. I do not believe they have gluten free options but you should double check if that is important to you. The general crowd is older 40+ and I believe many of them have been dining there for many years (based on a few friendly conversations I have had).  Its wonderful place with lots of character and I think that if you are thinking of a place to have a date its a great contender.
