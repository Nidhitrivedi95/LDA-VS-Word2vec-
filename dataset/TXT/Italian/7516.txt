0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw We really only come here on special occasions due to the slightly high prices and long wait in line.  Even though I always say I am going to try something new on the menu, I end up getting a burger, fries and milkshake.  They are all really good.  When the weather is nice, we really enjoy sitting outside on the benches.
