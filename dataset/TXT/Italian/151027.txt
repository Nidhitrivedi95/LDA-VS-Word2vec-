klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw Everything was fine, but nothing special. The bread was good, the salads were OK. My prime rib had a good flavor but it wasn't an especially great cut of meat. My wife's salmon left a little to be desired in the fact it was so incredibly bland, so she wasn't very impressed. 

We did have very good service so that was a plus and the Showstopper cocktail was really really good. However, the merely average food for the price makes me feel we wouldn't return, especially with so many other fantastic places to eat at Wynn/Encore.
