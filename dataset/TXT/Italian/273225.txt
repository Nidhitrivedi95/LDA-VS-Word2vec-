xZeMt4Vg-P9PTyLgCe5phg We were here Sunday evening. The last few times we were here everything has gotten progressively worse. My order was wrong; had to wait for the correct lavosh to be made. The flavor was very bland. My son's bbq chicken pizza was laden; too much cheese and greasy.
This is the third time orders have been wrong...either by the server or kitchen. I hope things improve...I really did like this place.
