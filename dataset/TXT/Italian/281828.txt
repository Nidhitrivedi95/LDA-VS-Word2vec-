yXiDD18UV49-7UhA6dWjAw Came here for a slightly early dinner on Saturday night while in the area for a convention. Hubby and I were in the mood for non-chain food. This place did not disappoint! Hubby got the special, which was manicotti, lasagna, and chicken Parmesan all on one large plate. He ate most of it and then sat there grinning and complaining that he was too full, but it was worth it.

I had the chicken Parmesan with spaghetti. The chef was kind enough to put the sauce in a separate bowl for me since tomatoes are a migraine trigger for me. The chicken was nice and thin, well flavored, not dry, and not salty. It was good!

We also had a chocolate cake for dessert. It was okay. The fudge frosting and chocolate moose layers were good, but the cake parts were a bit dry. (We still ate most of it)

Our server was friendly and attentive. Service was fast. One odd note: the check was handwritten. That's fine if it works, but a bit odd, even for a small business in this day and age.

I would go back here when we are in town next and recommend this place to anyone who asks!
