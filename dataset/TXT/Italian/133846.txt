iPxDmZVbssspPtUEBnUyQw Ordered using iPhone app. Store has excellent and quick delivery, even on typically busy nights. Took advantage of 3 md pizzas for $5.55 ea, add on toppings are not a great value, and while delivery is less than Pizza Hut, it still sucks that they charge all orders an extra $1.99 on top of tax. Pizzas were delivered super hot in about 25 minutes. Everything was made correctly and tasted good. Will definitely get pizza from there again!
