wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw Love Postinos. The only thing I diidnt like were the small size (very limited seating at peak hours) of the restaurant. Otherwise, the appetizers are excellent, the wine is probably good (I don't drink wine) and the beer is cold and tasty with a good selection.

The seating is very casual and they also have outside seating. the bar is much too small honestly and they would be wise to expand the bar seating area and size because there are many of us who want a place to sit down that are not with our significant other or are single.
