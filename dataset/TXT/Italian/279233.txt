yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Dinner for two on a Saturday night with a wait time of only 20mins. Not bad was able to grab a beer at the bar while we waited for our food. Girlfriend treated me to dinner as she has been there before. This was my first time and it was absolutely amazing. Every dish from the house salad and bread sticks which we got a couple of refills for! Steak was amazing and the free house wines were excellent! Such a great atmosphere and eatery! This is a must stop when in vegas! Being a local we will be back again in no time!
