vzoAKt7ND2YPLYfnVRi_Cg After waiting 2 hours for a Dominos pizza that was never delivered and being hung up on by the Dominos manager, my wife and I still really wanted pizza. It was 9:55 pm and Barros closed at 10 pm but I gave them a call anyways not expecting to be able to order. I was pleasantly surprised that they took my order and told me it would be ready in 10 minutes so I headed over to pick it up. When I got there I was greeted by Nick who was in the back and came right up, apologizing that he was in the back helping train some new employees. He reviewed my order and realized it was slightly incorrect and immediately headed back and fixed my pizza that had just been put in the oven. After only 2-3 mins he came back up, apologized and then proceeded to give me a discount for having to wait on him...I was so happy that I was even able to order 5 minutes before closing I would have taken any pizza no problem, but Nick made the whole experience exceptional. After having such a poor experience with another pizza chain it was such a relief to come in here and be treated with such respect and service that was above and beyond. I would highly recommend this place! Excellent job Nick and keep up the amazing work!
