KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg The pizza was good, for appetizers we ordered the flank steak skewers the steak was so greatly cooked BEST STEAK IVE EVER HAD!!!. The salami pizza had great flavor the pizza's slices were so big i can fold it and eat it like a taco. The marinara pizza was okay, as long as you ate it with the cheese that came along with it. If it is eaten without the cheese it is difficult to find a good flavor to help you enjoy it as you eat it. 

The service was not the best, the hostess was a bit rude and it was a long wait. The waitress on the other hand, was much better. Other than the service the food was delicious. I recommend Pizzeria Libretto, if you love pizza and are patient with people.
