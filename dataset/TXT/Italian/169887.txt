MtvN8vMiKcLkkz_tCvBx3g Went today with a party of eight for a business lunch and I have to say Aria far exceeded my expectations.

Service was quick and competent, although they never took a drink order so we all ended up drinking water. I'm sure if someone was really jonesing for a soda or tea they would have made it obvious, but instead we all just enjoyed the water and the frequent refills.

My steak salad was phenomenal. The steak was served over arugula with fresh mozzarella and a balsamic vinaigrette with some roasted peppers. It was fantastic and I would order it again in a heartbeat.

Everyone else really enjoyed their dishes too, from chicken parmesan to risotto. The first comments from the group as we started to eat were that the food was so much better than you usually get at lunch.

I'm sure Aria has its ups and downs, but we clearly hit it at an "up" time. I will bring other people back for lunch again.
