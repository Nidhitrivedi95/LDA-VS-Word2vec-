It's kinda of fun because it's rock'n'roll themed, but they don't incorporate the Beatles any further than the name and some wall paintings. (Where is the 'Yellow Submarine Sandwich'? What about the 'Lovely Rita Wrap'?) I'd go here with a few people to drink and maybe get a snack, but not with a big group and not for a meal.
