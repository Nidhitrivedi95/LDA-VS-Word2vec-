NVC1MFGTobWxYcuo_z7BGQ We ordered three meals - scallopina al funghi (veal), gnocchi all normanna, and black spaghetti alla scampi. The veal and mushroom in a light cream sauce is very good; the spaghetti w/ shrimp and cherry tomatoes was excellent, just very flavorful. As one other reviewer mentioned, the gnocchi was nothing special. Did not have that "pillowy" texture, more like a pasta. Their tomato sauce is very good, but there was hardly any eggplant in the dish. The eggplant that was there was in thin slivers, not the chunks I'm used to getting. Really couldn't taste the eggplant in the dish. Overall, this is a good restaurant and I'll be making my way through their menu. Oh yeah, menu prices are not what's posted on their website. They have an older menu posted.
