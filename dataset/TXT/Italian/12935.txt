0xzmIBsJQc5eUNLucFrZ0Q Went back again since late night dining options are few and far between at the Encore, and sat at the bar since there was a wait for a table.  Great service from the bartender.  I tried the specialty cocktail which was some fruity (a ton of real strawberries and raspberries) Red Bull and vodka concoction which I later found out is made with 100 proof vodka.  Whoa!  It's a $14 cocktail, but definitely worth it.  I had to take that bad boy with me after dinner since I couldn't finish it at the bar. 

Skip the calamari.  It was overdone and tasteless.  

Gave the doughnuts another chance, and this time, they were stuffed with Nutella and delicious. That doesn't garner an extra star, however, because it just reaffirms the fact that some cook got lazy and screwed us the first time.
