Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg One of my favorite Italian Restaurant. I feel like having dinner at my italian aunt (too bad i am french asian lol )
restaurant is roomy. 
staff is very nice and caring.
the food is amazing. Not some random supposedly Italian dish. it really taste like the Real Italian Home Made Dish.
to start they always offer some fresh bread and butter. i usually order a plate of different olives
the whole menu is amazing. 

i love their Gnocchi bolognese, gnocchi alfredo,  caprese salad, chicken milanese... 

portions are for 1 and half person 
my dad ordered the ribeye. the meat was tender and juicy! flavored with a branch of rosemary! amazingly yummy
their desserts are homemade as well. 
i love their pana cotta with red berries or their tiramisu with REAL Mascarpone.
price is good for the quality served.
you won't eat Italian elsewhere once you try Roma Deli.

i prefer the spring mountain location than the sahara location. Tried Sahara location and i am voting Spring Mountain as my favorite location

sorry no pics...  every time i am like "S..." i finish my plate forgot to take a pics
