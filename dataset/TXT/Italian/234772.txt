tuikCn2ljRGN5QHZBnjoqA Nooooo!!!  I was so sad this morning when I went for my daily "Jam and Ham - No Jam", to find that Noodles & Co.  is closed!  The food was great, the people were fantastic, and a visit there was the favourite part of my morning routine.  I wish all the best to the great staff, and many thanks for all the great breakfasts and lunches!  You will be missed!
