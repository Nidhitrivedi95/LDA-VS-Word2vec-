YOD9dXrnpu8HTRILpF0onw I was craving some pizza and I wanted to try somewhere new.  I had been to the other Times Square (Deer Valley) a few times and decided to check out this location.  I called in and placed my order for their carryout special of a 16' One Topping Pizza for $12.00 ($13.00 after tax).  I went with a plain cheese pie with garlic as my topping.  I drove down, walked up to the bar, paid for my pizza and was on my way. Here is how it was.............

Large Garlic Pie-  This thing looked great.  Looked like the same crust and cheese as the other Times Square.  I took a bite in and noticed that it was just a tad "off".  They buried the garlic underneath the cheese and right away it tasted different.  Not sure if the garlic cloves they used today were bad, or what?  I know minced garlic tastes a bit strong sometimes, but this was more powerful and bitter than usual.  Besides that, even the cheese didn't taste the same as the Deer Valley spot.  It wasn't as stringy and flavorful.  Maybe I should have went with a meat topping like before?  Who knows?  The crust was pretty good but even that wasn't as great as I had remembered, either!  I ate 5 slices of it and couldn't do anymore.  I gave my remaining 3 slices to a homeless dude on the corner of Bell and the 17 freeway right before I went back to work.  He was stoked!  

Overall, the pizza was just meh today.  The service on the other hand was outstanding!  The bartender/waitress lady was very nice and smiley.  She asked how my day was, we talked about the weather etc all while she was getting my pizza and paper plates.  She was incredibly friendly and was the highlight of my visit to the restaurant. She is the reason this is 3 stars and not 2. The pizza though...I'll stick to the one up the road on Deer Valley...much better!
