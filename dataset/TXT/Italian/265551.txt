I've been here a couple times with friends, and most recently with my sister for brunch. Top notch every time. The menu offers sandwiches, brunch, and the bruschetta for which they are famous (and rightfully so). Sit inside or outside, and enjoy a fantastic glass or bottle of wine from their excellent list. 

When the weather is nice, the huge front glass will be opened and the inside and outside seating areas seem to become one. Outside seating offers a large fireplace in the winter, and misters in the summer. The back even has a seating area on fake grass for the kiddos to play around. The atmosphere cannot be beat. One of my very favorite foodie spots in Gilbert. 

This Postino location has great parking options--look for spots back by the Gilbert water tower where you park for the Gilbert Farmers Market.
