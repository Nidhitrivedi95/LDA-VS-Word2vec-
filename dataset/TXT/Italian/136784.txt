The place is a bit small so make a reservation if you come for dinner. 
The place has a cool Hawaiian vibe.
For appetizers we got the marguerite pizza which had yummy goat cheese on it. Also got the guacamole and hummus. 
For the main, I got the shrimp poke. The rice is a little dry and there is too much of it. I think I saw the option on the menu that you can substitute the rice for kale. I might try that next time. But either way it was still a good meal!
The hubby got the salmon poke. He said it was good but next time he won't put so much hot sauce cuz there are already jalapeño peppers in there. Now his mouth is on fire. 
For dessert we got the lemon basil pie and the apple crumble. The lemon basil pie was better. 
They gave us shots on the house for my hubby's birthday! 
I'll come back here. And now I'm even more excited to go to Hawaii.
