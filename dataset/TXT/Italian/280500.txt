YOD9dXrnpu8HTRILpF0onw I have heard several times from different people how great this place is...i didnt really get it.  I was hoping for a local italian restaurant with amazing food for great prices and that is not what i got.  The pizza was doughy and bland.  The crust had a strange flavor to it also. The service was fine, my only complaint is the food.  i had the fried cheese as well and same thing....it was barely melted and just didnt have hardly any taste.
