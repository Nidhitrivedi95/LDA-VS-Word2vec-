zINKP9rtvo2IUKTZoYJUvQ I was very interested in checking out Cento before my show at the Overture Center.  The place is stunningly beautiful.  But the exposed walls lead the noise volume to be really high.  It was hard to relax at our table.

My guests and I took part in the theatre menu.  The Beet Salad was lovely, not much to it but beautifully created.  My friends had the tomato bisque, which they really enjoyed.  Me and one friend had the Char and it was very good.  The roast veggies were seasoned well.  It was a little greasy.  The other friends had the seafood pasta.  I should have gone that  route.  The sauce was delicious.

Dessert was a waste for me.  I had the lemon sorbet.  One scoop is really enough and I got three.  It was very tasty but I was puckering so bad after the first one I had to stop.  The other desserts were enjoyed by the others but I would not have liked them.  Please think about adding a cake.

The noise in the place was so loud, I had to lean in to hear my friends.  For the price, I want to enjoy my time in the place.  I may go back on a quieter night.
