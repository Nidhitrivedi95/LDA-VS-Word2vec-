D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg Would have been three stars only because of the view but then service was very lacking so I kept it at 2 stars. Food is decent but not worth the price. The basics were lacking: e.g., water and bread service. The entrees came out while we were still eating our apps. Wait staff didn't know the particulars of the menu, etc. The view is great but doesn't make up for the rest of the problems.
