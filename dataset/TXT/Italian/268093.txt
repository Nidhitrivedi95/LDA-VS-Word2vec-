XF4w6wG1JOvfKZlQcxiWgQ I've reviewed Fired Pie, MOD Pizza and Pizza Studio. I think I still like Pizza Studio best, but 1000° Pizza is pretty darned good. 

Good sauce, which is so very important, is good. Really good.  Strong flavor, when I asked for extra sauce the attendant didn't hesitate. Toppings as much as I want, which in this case was excessive mushrooms, but again no problem!

The 1000° oven itself is interesting, perhaps VERY interesting. See photo. 

I asked the attendant why is the high heat, the 1000° is beneficial and oddly, he did not know.  I'm not sure who's in charge of training at 1000° Pizza but I think if you name a restaurant 1000° Pizza, you might want to have a reason at-the-ready for cooking the pizza at 1000°. Not today. 

Try this place. It's good.
