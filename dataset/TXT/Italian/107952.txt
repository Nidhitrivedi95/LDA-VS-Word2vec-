FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A We visited the new location tonight for a late dinner. After ordering and paying, one of the line cooks made derogatory remarks in Spanish about my boyfriend and myself. We were the only patrons in the restaurant so it was clear the comments were about us. Whether he thought we didn't speak Spanish or thought we couldn't hear him, it was completely unacceptable in 2014 to be such a hateful, homophobic ass! We immediately asked for a refund and left without eating.
