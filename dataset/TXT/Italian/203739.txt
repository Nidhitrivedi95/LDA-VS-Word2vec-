Q7Wwjcwq5ux8EbLb8-X6iQ We stopped by this place for lunch before a spring training baseball game. It was clean and the service was fast. The bench seating was nice for our group. I ordered the 2 cheese slice special, $6 and came with a large tea. The crust was thin, folded nicely. I enjoyed the cheese ratio, gooey! I'd definitely stop by this place if I was out at Camelback Ranch again.
