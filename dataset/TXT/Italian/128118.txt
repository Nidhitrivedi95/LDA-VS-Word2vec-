HYhbeLznSWEl6JIYTllVUA Everyone enjoyed their food and the prices were very reasonable.

I am a big fan of veal so I was quite happy to see that Stone and Vine serves Veal Parmagiana, Marsala, and Piccata.  And they were charging only $18 for these dishes, which is quite a value compared to other italian restaurants in the area.

I ordered the Veal Piccata and it was a quality piece of veal and was prepared as it should be.  We also had the Rigatoni with the Bolognese and it was great.  Such a simple dish but not everyone gets it right..

Stone and Vine offers a varied menu including flatbreads and pizza, which are a few dollars less during happy hour.

We will be back.
