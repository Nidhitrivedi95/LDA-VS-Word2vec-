y769FA7VJOW4QQYdYlR62A I was told to visit this place from a friend living on dovercourt. He explained it simply as a proper Italian establishment with great flavours. One day after a miserable drive home from work I decided that I would bury myself in carbs and fall into a food coma. I ordered the Carbonara and Rigatoni pasta. Boy was I not disappointed. Both of the dishes were plentiful and full of flavour! My gf and I split each dish down the middle and were easily able to finish all the food. That being said we were completely full and comfortable in our "comfy clothes". We will definitely go back and try their pizza this time.
