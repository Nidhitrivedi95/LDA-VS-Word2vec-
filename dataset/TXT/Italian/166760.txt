mFmmOKdcwFrDqXKaew0ahw I have dined at Streets of New York for years with a whole spectrum of experiences. Today was exceptional in the area of delivery & food quality! I ordered a "Cold' # 7 - The Best of Everything (and it is) and some fries. It came as fresh as it gets and the fries were still crispy upon arrival! The delivery driver was pleasant, well dressed and professional! A great representative for the company! Keep up the good work over there on Carefree Highway!
