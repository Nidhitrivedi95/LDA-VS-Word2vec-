bgCHcGeOBNQxDT95XvzNFQ It was my first time going with my family for mother's day. My husband made reservations. We got seated like 10 minutes later which that's not a problem because we weren't in no rush. 

We order our food. My kids had macaroni and cheese which needed some flavor. I order Pollo Parmigiano which it was good, but I think the spaghetti need a little more flavor. Dessert was ok. 

They need to work on how to put more flavor into their food. If they do their food would taste a lot better. Even though it was busy the service was on point.

My drink was a Pomegranate martini which I do recommend trying.
