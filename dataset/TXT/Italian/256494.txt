w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q Three magic words:  Business Lunch Special.

A few more words:  FIlet mignon, potatoes, salad, bread, coffee or tea -- all for $19.50.  (Up from $14.50 a few years back, but still, what a decadent lunch for 20 bucks.)  They have other entree choices for the special, but....  I wish they had this deal in Los Angeles.  Sigh.

Not a lot of variety to the menu, and dinner prices are astronomically higher, but terrific quality items, and very professional wait staff.   Definitely a Vegas vacation lunch tradition.  I've even taken a cab straight from the airport.
