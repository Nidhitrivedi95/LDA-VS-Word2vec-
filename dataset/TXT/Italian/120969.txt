I recall that the co-owner, Lucian, would walk around singing Louie Prima's "Just a Gigolo" along with the jukebox, greeting every family, and laying candy bars beside each kid's plate. The other co-owner, Jerry, would be cooking with the kitchen door open and whistling loud enough that you could hear it throughout the restaurant. As I grew up, so did my tastes, and my goto dish was the rib steak with a side of spaghetti and mushrooms. All this time, the house dressing has always reminded me of something an Italian grandma would mix up in her kitchen. As a man, most of my visits are now lunch time stops for the perfect prime rib sandwich or gravy covered roast beef sandwich and fries. And there, in the center of the room, the Budweiser Clydesdale wagon keeps spinning, as the Tribe game plays over the door, and suddenly I am eight years old again and the food is just as great as it was back then.
