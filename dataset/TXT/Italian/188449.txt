OwYpVa-JnVjfEz4iVZk3ZQ I've been coming to this locations for years, maybe even decades. Long before it burnt down and was rebuilt, to give you an idea. Of course the food is exactly what you'd expect but our last meal's bill was noticeable higher than I remember it ever being. Not sure if the prices have slowly risen without me noticing but it seemed higher. The food tastes great and with salad and breadsticks coming in continuous fashion we certainly got our fill and left more than satisfied. The decor and atmosphere is vibrant and welcoming, it's usually busy which means you'll enjoy a nice level of Hustle and bustle. This also means though you'll almost always have to wait some amount of time before your seated no matter when you visit for dinner. Of course we'll be back the next time we get that OG craving and if you've never order a side of Alfredo sauce to dunk your breadsticks in you're totally missing out.
