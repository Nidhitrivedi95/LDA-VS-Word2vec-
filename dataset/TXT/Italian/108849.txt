G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I tried this restaurant with 4 other people two nights ago and we ordered a bunch of appetizers and everyone ordered the salmon. The appetizers were good. The salmon was not bad but def not great - everyone thought it was dry and not a huge fan of the thin mustard succotash sauce under it :((
The views were great from our table and the service good. Just ok for me.
