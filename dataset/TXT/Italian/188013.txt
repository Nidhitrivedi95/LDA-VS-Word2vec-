oUvqwPJkorOnYZFKRt0oEg I really wanted to give more stars but for the amount of money we spent for 2 adults and a child combined with the time it took to get our food and be waited on I just can't do it. The food was very good and that gets 3 stars. 
We waited over an hour to be seated after being told it would be 30 minutes. Once being seated everything took longer than it should. We arrived at 5:45 and our dinner wasn't over until 9:30pm. Ridiculous. 
I'm not sure if we will give it another try. We did like the decor but if the service and wait is always like that it's not worth it.
