NnOAwa0A2tNPnZl9IHVLPQ Lovely little slice of Italy in Hudson - busy on a Tuesday night with lots of families enjoying the quaint atmosphere and food. Nice staff who work hard and deliver good service. Large menu made it hard to choose - I was tempted by the Italian nachos! Pizza looked good on other tables but I got the special pasta. Really good food and taste. Beer was bottled.
