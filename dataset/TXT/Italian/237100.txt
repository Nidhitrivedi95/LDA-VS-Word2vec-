tYbK94fl50os3h_RjpY4gw My husband and I were having a lazy Friday night so we decided to order delivery and found Rocco's menu in our stack to try. It was over an hour before our food was delivered and even though we were both starving, I could not force myself to finish the food. 
My husband got the calzone- there was a severe lack of seasoning. The crust was like eating cardboard. It was chewy and had absolutely no flavor. Usually pizza crust is my favorite, but if their pizza crust is anything like this calzone then I would highly not recommend. Even dredging the calzone in marinara sauce did not rescue this sad little dish.  
I ordered the Chicken marsala. The menu said it came on a bed of pasta. So I assumed that the pasta would be dressed with sauce, maybe some cheese? Salt? Seasoning? Anything? Nope, I was wrong. The "bed of pasta" was literally pasta drained from the boiling water straight into the take out container.... now why would I want to eat plain pasta?? Disgraceful. I even tried to find some marsala sauce to toss over the pasta, but it was non-existent. The Chicken marsala completely lacked flavor and seasoning. Completely under-salted - and I normally hate salty food. They might as well rename this dish- plain chicken breast over a bed of plain pasta. 
Garlic knots- When i heard my entree came with garlic knots I was very excited! I love anything carbs and bread. Boy was I disappointed. These knots were hard and extremely stale. What a let down. 
I have to admit that we did not try the pizza and I know this place is a pizzeria, but based on the dishes that we did try, I will not waste anymore money and time order from this place. Sorry for the harsh review, but if you can't make the dish right, then take it off the menu.
