FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA I don't think much more can be said that hasn't already been said about this place. Hands down my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I was sad to move from the desert solely because I couldn't come here every week. 

The bruschetta is amazing. Tomato jam is hands down my favorite...sounds weird, but extremely good. You really can't go wrong with any of them. If you go on Monday or Tuesday night after 8pm, a bottle of wine and board of this gloriousness is only $20 bucks. Get on that. If you're not in the mood for bruschetta, the Tuna Melt is out of this world...order it with a side of Sierra Nevada mustard and you won't go wrong. 

The brunch here on the weekends is incredible, too. Central is the only one that offers it so don't try going to the other ones and ordering the BELT sandwich, because you won't get it....but come here and you'll experience the fantastic brunch

Free valet, too.
