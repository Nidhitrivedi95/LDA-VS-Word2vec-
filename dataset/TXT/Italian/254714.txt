VX6DcQETQbuPbTC4hUoREg I was recently looking for a quiet place to hold my fathers 90 birthday party and knew my dad liked to eat at Spennato's. Knowing we would have about 20 attending My sister called about a month in advance. Mary stated they had a back room that would accommodate our group. With a $100 deposit, she provided us with menu options. We decided on a buffet with salad, pasta, chicken, meatballs and choice of drink. Cash bar was an option for those who wished to do so. 

That day everything went as planned. Food was excellent and ready about 15 minutes after we arrived. The waitress serving us was very polite and took care of all our needs and even assisted with the birthday cake we brought in. When all was completed she brought out take out containers for all to take home any remaining food. Everyone took a little. 

I highly recommend Spennato's for such an event. When all was said and done we were charged $20 a plate with all taxes, gratuities, and room use. Excellent day all around.
