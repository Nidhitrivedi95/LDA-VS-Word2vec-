Lzj-_QdzL2bLeHd_bC88Fg I have eaten at this restaurant at least 5 times and each time it has been delicious.  The most recent time was last night when I went there with four friends.   My friends had the grilled calamari appetizer that they loved and it looked really wonderful.   I had the soup of the day, a sweet potato soup and although it was okay it was nothing special.   Two of us ordered the brick pressed cornish hens that were absolutely delicious including the sides that came with.  It was a huge portion so we were unable to finish it.  Our friends ordered the grilled branzino which I tasted and it was excellent as well.  In the past I have also had their kale pasta which was so good. Great fresh food made using quality ingredients.   I plan to go back again soon.
