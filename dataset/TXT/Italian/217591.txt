RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q Finally had the time to try Spinatos for our 41st anniversary. Victoria was our waitress and she was great. Started off with a capese appetizers and it was very refreshing. Moved onto six meat pizza/meaty pizza and Chicago steak calzone. Every dish was delicious and portions were substantial. Party of three ate for less than 60.00 dollars with drinks (sodas and beer). Enjoyed dinner so much that we are planning a revisit.
