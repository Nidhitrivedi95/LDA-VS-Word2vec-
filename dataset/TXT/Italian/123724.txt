HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q So many gelato flavors and so little time!

To cool off from the outside scorching dry heat, we decided on sweet gelatos in the Palazzo. Yes, Expressamente Lily offer more selection such as coffee drinks, crepes, breakfast sammies but we went straight for the kill on the gelatos.

I can't remember what my friend got in turns of favor but I know she like it a lot. I got my favorite flavor of Pistachios and love tonguing it like a lizzard or french kissing. IT was that GOOD!  The prices was fair for a couple of scoops.

We brave back outside and didn't mind the sun melting our gelato into our hands because we were too busy in our conversation and making out with our gelatos. 

Recommended for a sweet & cool treat.  This place will make you a fan, too!
