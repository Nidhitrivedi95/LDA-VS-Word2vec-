KKUfGvyBDVqdZXXqS3uDrw I enjoyed my lunch here and would recommend it if:
- you are looking for Italian-Canadian food, not strictly authentic Italian food
- you are in the mood for pasta, not pizza (can't speak for the brunch or desserts as I didn't try them, sigh!)
- you want reasonably priced Italian-Canadian food (bonus points here!)
- you want a casual environment, not particularly remarkable for its interior design but clean and cozy

I recommend the pasta dishes because there is a decent selection, with a variety of sauces and toppings. I enjoyed my agnolotti stuffed with goat cheese and leeks, and was happy that I was able to change the sauce: I asked for tomato sauce instead of grilled portobello mushroom pesto cream sauce, which sounds interesting but strays too far from my notion of pesto sauce (I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to these things).  
My friend had a pizza and while it had a nice crust (quite thin but moist), it had too much cheese and not enough sauce for my liking.

Overall rating: 3/5 for the pastas, reasonable prices, good service and cozy environment.
