IkLAUX7lZIWqE9_YC66SRw Saturday night and they were a bit slow considering the rest of the plaza was packed. Service was off, but the food was on point. Everyone was pleasant, just could have been more attentive. I will still come here and I do recommend the food. The misfire in service keeps me from giving them 5 stars, which I would really like to do.
