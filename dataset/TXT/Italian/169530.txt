I always enjoy the rustic feel and ambience of scaddabush. I have a few favourites: the spinach and artichoke dip is the best ever, the seafood pasta as well as the pizza taste delicious. Their bread and cheese are so fresh and flavourful as well. I would love for them to diversify their vegetarian options more! In desserts, their cheesecake is my favourite- very creamy, rich and with the perfect hazelnut base. It usually average to 25-30$ per person.
