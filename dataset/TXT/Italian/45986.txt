8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA Love this place. Only con I can think of is that they don't serve alcohol and I have to have some vino with my pizza! We ordered a thin crust and a deep dish, both sausage and mushroom. The deep dish was the best! The fresh tomatoes on top were amazing and the cheese with the buttery crust were great. Not exactly Lou Malnattis but the best Chicago pizza I've had in Vegas so far. The waitress was very accommodating and delightful.
