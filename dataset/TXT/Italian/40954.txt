7JWWeXqil03Ua_wV9KN8ZQ Wow a lot of people out there seem to really like this place. On the other hand, I though my meal there was horrible.

Me and a group of friends were staying at a hotel across the lake for a friends' wedding and wanted to get some food the night before the wedding. 

I got the spaghetti pescatora and my friends got the paghetti and meatballs, risotto al funghi, and salamone allacento balsamico. All of the above were plain bad (I've been to Italy 3 times and I know what good Italian food tastes like).

Although I doubt I'll ever have a reason to return to the hotel resort, if I do I certaily stay away from Luna Rossa!
