-lJtyCOTVInWusU9YF120A My wife and I had dinner at Joey's last night.  We were greeted and sat by the owner, Michael, and enjoyed attentive and friendly service throughout the evening.  Nice ambiance - Joey's is well decorated and the lighting and music creates a pleasant relaxing atmosphere. The complimentary pull-apart bread was arrived warm and delicious.  My wife ordered the toasted cheese ravioli and I had a Delmonico steak with angel hair pasta.  We were both very impressed with our meals.  The house made creme brulee was excellent!  We will be back again for sure.
