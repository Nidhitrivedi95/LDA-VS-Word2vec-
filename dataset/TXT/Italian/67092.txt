The ingredients were fresh but the thin crust we ordered was a little bit of a let down.  It was too thin and lacked taste, luckily the toppings compensated for the crust.  I would still go back but I would order a thicker crust.  They definitely have the right idea and vegas is in need of a gourmet pizzeria that serves great pizza - I think it's a work in process  as far as the thin crust pizza goes but overall the ingredients were fresh and it's a nice location.
