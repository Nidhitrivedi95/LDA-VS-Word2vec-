VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w I LOVED it!!!!!!  Went with my Girls on New years day.
The line was basically non existent. We stood in line for like 3 minutes- NO COVER. and when we got in, they put these yellow wrist bans on us and told us open bar till 11:30 :-)

The DJ was GREAT!!!!
Most Vegas clubs are Techo and Dance or House music... but this one played Hip Hop, Rap, Oldies, Salsa, Reggae and Reggaeton-- All without speeding up the beat and making it sound like House music. 
So if you need a break from the average Vegas DJ- this is a great spot where you can do the stanky leg, dougie, walk it out, do the beyonce bounce, get your suavemente salsa on, groove to some Prince and drop it like its hot to some snoop dog. and much much more! lol

The crowd was mixed.. mostly 21-30. And the night I went ( January 1,2011) everyone was being really friendly and was attractive looking. I remember randomly making friends with these random girls. lol. And the guys were very sexy, respectful, nicely dressed and could dance! 
The DJ had us falling in love. lol

The atmosphere has an upscale appearance. what you would expect from the Palazzo. Had a cool entrance with these "sinks"lol and a classy restaurant downstairs.They had go-go dancers and these two girls sitting on top of the bar in "roman" costumes "looking sexy" lol. they just sat there and tickled  each other with feathers (BEST JOB ON EARTH-- can i get an application?) lol

There were places to sit for those who chose not to splurge on the bottle service. 
So if you get tired of dancing just grab a seat by the bar, or on the stage, or on a random go-go dancer platform. lol

I met this SEXY Puerto Rican guy and he was my dance partner for the night, so i may be bias. lol. but overall this club was GREAT!

If you are in Vegas to dance the night away and have a blast LAVO is the place for you!
If you dont like hip hop or you cant dance, then go to Ghostbar or PURE . lol
(also good clubs)
