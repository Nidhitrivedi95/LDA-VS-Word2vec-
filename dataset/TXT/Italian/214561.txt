rIcEm0o8Xk413HWD4-f2QA We have loved this place for years! My favorite is the grilled chicken salad...my husband loves the pizza...and you can't miss the cookies and cream dessert it's amazing :) You can be in and out extremely quick to make a movie etc or take your time and enjoy your meal. It's one of Scottsdale's hidden gems!
