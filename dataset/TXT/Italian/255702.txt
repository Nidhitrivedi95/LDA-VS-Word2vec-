vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA Had dinner here one night & drinks & appetizers the next.  The service was perfect, the food delicious, the drinks fantastic & the overall ambiance perfect.  Unlike another reviewer my wife & I thought the table / booths a great change from the usual restaurant setting.  We'll be returning again during our next trip to Vegas.  Loved it!
