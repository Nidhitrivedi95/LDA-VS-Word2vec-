w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q So I have a new favorite steak place. Too bad they are 1200 miles from home. The service was great with nice ambiance. Extensive wine list and a good selection of beers on tap. We were in a group of 8 and could stoll converse with everyone at the table wihout screaming.

Now... about the food.... 

The filet mignon was so velvety and tender. I don't know how else to describe it but perfection. My husband had the sea bass. I hate fish, but this was delicious. We had creamed spinach and goat cheese mashed potatoes.  A little pricey, but well worth it! My husband who hates creamed anything wouldn't stop hogging all the spinach. That speaks wonders...

I will definately be returning here wheb back in Sin City.  Now, could you please just build one in Austin?
