qisbqK1wxuwp6GumMrwB2Q I love good neopolitan pizza. This was just ok. Ordered the regina margarita. Good chewy crust with great wood fired oven char. But the whole pizza ended up being very funny and wet. I get that the texture of neopolitan pizza is different than normal pizza. As I said, I love neopolitan. But this was just difficult to eat. Sauce and cheese became very watery on the surface itself, on my plate, and on my hands. 

I'll probably come try again because it's close to my office. Hopefully today was just a less-than-perfect day in the oven.
