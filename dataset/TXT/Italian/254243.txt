vVpq26iHxy0sWWCVR_un4Q My wife and I went here last night for dinner and were pleasantly surprised.  It was quite good and reasonably priced.  I had the lasagna, which was excellent.  Lots of cheese, great sauce, and lots of cheese.  My wife had the pesto chicken tortellini, which was also excellent.  Good portion sizes.  Wonderful salad with the meal, too.  Cozy and not noisy.  I look forward to trying more of their entrees and pizza.  Service was a tad bit slow, but that was actually good since it created a more relaxed atmosphere (didn't feel rushed to finish).

I would recommend Picasso's to anyone and we will definitely go back.
