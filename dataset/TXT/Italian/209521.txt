qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA My husband and I purchased the package from a hotel. It was a pretty good deal. I believe they also deserve more than 3.5 stars!

First, the decor is a five! The place looks amazing and the front of the house really paid close attention to the table setting. I love the ambiance and how it is overlooking the river, very romantic! Secondly, their service is amazing. Food wise, I got the minestrone soup for starter and the  chicken marsala for lunch, no complaints on those! The chicken is cooked too perfection. You can taste the love in the food! On the other hand; my husband got the lasagna. The lasagna was okay I thought. The sauce could've used more boldness and the cheese is overpowering the entire dish.  

Another bonus is that they serve Illy coffee! Will definitely going to come back here when I visit Vegas again!
