dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA I went here recently and forgot to Yelp! I'm a Newbie! 
The pizza was fantastic! You're able to see EVERYTHING that you choose to personalize your pizza from an array of fresh ingredients at the toppings bar. You even have a choice of dough, that includes gluten-free! I chose the Neopolitan dough, spicy sauce, mozzarella, basil and pepperoni.
Since the big and beautiful oven is 900°(hence the name Novecento!), my personal pizza was ready in 90 seconds! 
I chose the lunch special that included a side and a fountain soda. Pepsi products!!!! Yeah! My side was a small chopped salad with romaine, Gorgonzola cheese, Genoa salami (my fave!), red onions and roasted red peppers A triumph! The vinaigrette was a little sweet for my taste, so I'll just get oil and vinegar instead on my next visit. 
They also serve large pizzas, calzones, stromboli,desserts, coffee, beer, wine and sparkling water.
Do yourself a favor and visit this place if you love the old world, rustic pizza "groove."
The staff were wonderful and checked on me several times.

KUDOS!!!!
