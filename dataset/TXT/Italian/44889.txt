8dSIAoz_UphMGpZr_uMing The food is good, and delivery super fast (got our food in 30mins after ordering)! 

I got three large Chicago style pizza, the garlic knots, and garlic cheese bread for the office. The pizza and knots were AMAZING. However, I was a bit disappointed in the bread, not only did they forget the cheese it was only two pieces... For $5 I expected more than two. 

Overall, this place is really good, kind service and fast delivery guys.
