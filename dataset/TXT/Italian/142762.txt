jrwRDE-QhvDGHLXaTMSJyA If you read my previous review my fiance and I went to Tria during restaurant week and we were not able to try their tappas menu. Unfortunately, we have been dying to go and try the tappas but we were so disapointed. I am not a fan of writing negative reviews to mom and pop businesses so I will try to be very brief and as nice as I can be.... To start, the service was horrible and very disrespectful. The waiter was clairly upset to start off because we did not order any wine at first. We then decided that we wanted to try as many things as possible so we ordered about 7 different items off of the tappas menu. I am certainly not a tappas professional but the few other tappas restaurants I went to brought out the food as soon as it was done so that it comes out fresh. Tria brought out all of the items at once and it was not only a very long wait but it was also a bit overwhelming. Specially with the very small table that we were seated at. As for the food it was subpar. All the seafood dishes seamed to of came from a frozen bag of mixed seafood. Most of the dishes were extremely bland. In particular the ceviche did not have any flavor at all. I honestly think that the chourico was store bought bratwurst that they tried to saute in cayenne. You can not pull something like that off with a Portuguese guy who was raised on chourico. Sadly, I very much doubt we will think about going back to Tria Terra.
