KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ We had dinner here Thursday 9.15.16 around 7:00.  We checked in and were seated within 5 minutes.  We enjoyed our dinner... typical Vegas; price wise, portion wise, and ambience.

In summary, we ordered the meatballs-awesome, star of the show!
I had the lasagna-it was very good.  No complaints.
My gf had the lemon chicken-she said it was one of the best tasting chicken dishes she has ever ate.
LIke everyone else said:  the breads and butters are really delicious.
Service was up to par; attentive without being annoying.  The prices are a little more than what I would normally pay for, but again this is Vegas and it is what it is.  I would definitely have dinner here again and we plan on it next year.
