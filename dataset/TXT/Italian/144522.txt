A friend brought me here to celebrate  my birthday, and it was wonderful!  We had the Yukon gold potato pizza, and it was incredible.  The spinach salad we also shared was the best I've ever had.  It was a beautiful day, so we enjoyed sitting on the patio.  What a great place tucked away where I wouldn't have found it myself!
