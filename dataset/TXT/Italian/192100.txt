PhIkXAFZ8UMvrt_bPwjzIw Lobster bisque to start was not bad.. not as thick as I would've liked, but flavour was there.  The breads were delicious, and had the seafood special of the day with three kinds of fish.  I remember enjoying one of the fish a lot.. the mackerel I think?  The linguine my coworker had looked great, portions are really big here for the pastas.  This is supposedly our client's fave Italian resto in the area but I was a bit let down.
