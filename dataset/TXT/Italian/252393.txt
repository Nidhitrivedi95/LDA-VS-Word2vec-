VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w This club was small and extremely packed. Came here after PURE and was much more impressed. The club is above the restaurant and was pretty nice. The bar was super small and the drinks were gross. I ordered a Sex on the Beach and it tasted NOTHING like a Sex on the Beach. 

I must reiterate this again. The club was extremely crowded that drinks got spilled on me multiple times, I got elbowed in the head, and pushed around by couples all night. It got pretty annoying to see couples on the dance floor making out. GET A ROOM! 

By the end of the night, my feet were dead from dancing so much but like they say, beauty is pain!
