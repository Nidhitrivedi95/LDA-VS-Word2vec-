OIdOJaNS8M624F58XGV3PQ I took my boyfriend here this past weekend for his birthday dinner. I had heard great things from friends and it's rated the #1 pizza place on Blog TO.

I made our reservation about a month in advance and we had to wait about 5 minutes when we got there because the people at the table they had for us decided to order another bottle of wine. They ended up giving us a table downstairs.

I had told the restaurant over the phone that it was my boyfriends birthday and they said they would do some kind of dessert for it.

We decided to order some apps before the meal. We got the gnocchi and Roccos salad. Both very delicious!

For the main I got the duck confit pizza which had no sauce and pear on it. It was absolutely unreal. Probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had. My boyfriend got some spicy pepperoni pizza, it wasn't listed on the menu because it was the special of the day.

During the meal I got up to remind our waiter it was my boyfriends birthday and he said he would bring something over. 

After we finished the waiter came over with the dessert menu. I was hoping my boyfriend wouldn't order anything because we were gonna get something for free. He ended up ordering an espresso and a gelato, and I ordered a chocolate affogato.

The waiter ended up bringing a wooden plate that said happy birthday in nutella and had both our desserts on it. I figured since he picked a dessert off the menu it would not be included on the bill. Turns out it was and that's the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I don't mind paying but if they said they would include something they should. Oh well!

Overall it was great. Good service, amazing food and a cool environment! Would definitely go back.
