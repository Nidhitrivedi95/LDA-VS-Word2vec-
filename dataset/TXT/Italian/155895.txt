L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw My sister and I took my my sister and my brother in law to Jaime's for their  birthdays. We were very excited given the name attached to the restaurant. It was one of the worst dining experiences. When I walked in they had seated my 3 relatives at a table by the door where the cold air came in. My sister was not well.I asked to  move immediately since there were many empty tables inside. This has happened to me many times which leads me to think that this is systemic racism in the restaurant industry. As visible minorities we get the worst seating available. The food was so awful we skipped dessert and went to Nadege café in the mall to have dessert. My brother in law had to look for food in the fridge when he got home. Jamie should be ashamed of himself to attach his name to this place. Save your $ and eat at home.
