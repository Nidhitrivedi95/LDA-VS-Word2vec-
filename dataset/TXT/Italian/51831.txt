9Jn6MJZMz2R6rcszqmXDqg My husband and I dined here tonight for our anniversary. The ambience was romantic and the service was exquisite! Our servers were very attentive and offered wonderful service.

Now for the food... We had a Groupon for a 4 course meal for 2. I had the Cesar salad and my hubby had the wild mushroom soup.  Both appetizers were great! I would've liked my salad to have a bit more garlic though. The maple bacon on the salad was to die for! My hubby enjoyed his soup. The calamari were fresh and cooked to perfection. Entrees: I had the T-bone steak (very very yummy) and my hubby had linguine with seafood. We both enjoyed our entrees thoroughly. Dessert: I had Nutella bread pudding and hubby had creme brûlée. He loved his dessert, mine was alright... The bread pudding didn't have a "Nutella" feel... It was more of an espresso bread pudding with cocoa sprinkled on top, but nonetheless it was still good. 

All in all we had an amazing time and we'd definitely go again. Ps. The bread basket was great. They served it with a chickpea and roasted vegetable puree.  Yum!
