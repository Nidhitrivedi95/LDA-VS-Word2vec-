x-ZnHkRIhpGwZ_7VwiKlRg There is nothing more gauche than a television in a dining room. What do they think they're running here? A TGI Friday's? 

They have a Stefano Ferrara oven which many consider to be the "Ferrari of Pizza Ovens". The only problem? They use it like it's an '83 Reliant K. The pizzas spend a lot longer than 90 seconds in that beautiful oven. A pity really. (To be fair, Valenti's has the same oven and their temps are even lower and cook times longer.)

The food tastes fine, but the experience could be soooo much better if they just got rid of the tv and decided to get serious about their dough.

No reservations, no bar to wait at.
