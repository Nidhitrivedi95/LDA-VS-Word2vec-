Ordered: lobster pasta and arugula salad
Cost: incl. tax and tip $35-40

On tripadvisor.ca, this was the No. 1 restaurant in Kleinburg and No. 2 in Vaughan. Unfortunately, they spell it wrong. It has 37 reviews, yet in Yelp it only has 4 including mine. I wonder why.

We tried eating here a week before without a reservation but it was too busy. There weren't that many other restaurants in Kleinburg which is a contrast to Unionville which has so many. 

Food: The food was delicious and slightly better than other 4 star restaurants I've been too. The pasta was al dente which my girlfriend and I were not used to. However, the salad was deliciious.

Environment:  The service was excellent and stood out. My girlfriend recommends that you don't ask the server for recommendation, otherwise, he'll go through each item on the menu. We also thought the waiting staff was very attentive. Being attentive and pampering is very important to her. ;)

Bottom line: I would definitely come back. This is 4.5 stars. I'm rounding down to 4 because it is only slightly better than my other 4 star meals.
