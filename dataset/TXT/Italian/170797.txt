MWYJl-bIxhtQ-4Kg3ENUxA I've had Rosati's in Chicago and always thought they were a decent pizza, certainly not top 10, but good for a change of pace from the typical places.

I stopped by this location since it was near my hotel and I learned they also served Italian Beef sammies, which are hard to find outside the Chicago area -- so they were getting my business after a 12 hour, no lunch work day.

Since I had to get an Italian Beef, I also got a thin crust personal pizza (it was my first meal all day, don't judge me!) , in hopes that their thin crust was better than my memories of their deep dish back in Chicago.

Unfortunately, while the Italian Beef was much better than expected, the Pizza was not. It wasn't bad, it was just bland and reminded me much like a kit pizza you would get at a bowling alley.
