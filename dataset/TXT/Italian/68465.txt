BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag My wife and I ate their last night for dinner.    This is one restaurant you can always count on for great service and great food.  Our server was Kelly and she was phenomenal, made great recommendations and was as pleasant as could be.   Nice touch when the Manager stopped by to ensure we were having a great time.   I mentioned that this was our last dinner in Phoenix due to a relo, and they brought us a free desert to say good luck..... Nice touch!

Great restaurant!!
