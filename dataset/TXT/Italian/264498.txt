wxzG81ZyWpBje_mU4aFLaw We came to Humble Pie after seeing it featured in Phoenix magazine (so sad that I can never find a place on my own...) and we were blown away.  It was a weeknight and all I wanted was some pizza to go and veg out on a couch watching a movie.  Well, after waiting on our to-go order we both wished we just stayed there! The restaurant is so incredibly inviting with its modern yet warm decor and a brick oven smack in the middle of the restaurant.  It was warm and smelled nice which was a bonus after walking from a car in 30 degree weather (crazy winter this year, isn't it?).  The staff were incredibly nice and we snacked on the "butter" mints that were placed by the exit while waiting.  I know they are for after the meal, but we were hungry!

Anyways, the pizza was fantastic.  One word: "sourdough"!  Well, it's either sourdough dough or something that tastes like it, but I thought that the pizza was fantastic!  It is not too thin and definitely not thick. Just perfect, on my taste buds.  We had parmesan chicken pizza (I think) and a margherita pizza.  Both were phenomenal.  We also ordered some french fries that were likewise super yummy.  As an aside, I was raised in NYC, which is famous for its pizza.  I have to say that Humble Pie's pizza is at least as good as New York pizza.  

I will definitely come back, and I cannot wait to try a date night (Thursday after 6 pm: an appetizer, pizza, and two salads for $20).  Also, apparently there are like 10 different food places in that general area on 7th Street -- time to check them out!
