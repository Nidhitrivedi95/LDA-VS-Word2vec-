AAc1Ob8MPxNUycjZ0kEd1Q Not bad, but not great either.

The good:
Location and overall ambience. 
Was satisfied with the food on the whole.

What needs work:
Service - our waiter (young guy with glasses) was friendly but not really on the ball.  Would disappear for long stretches of time to the point where I'd have to ask another waiter where he was.  Really didn't have much to say when I asked him what he recommended on the menu.   Maybe he was new, but you expect a higher level of service and professionalism at this price point. 

Music inside far too loud - our table of 4 could barely hear ourselves speak at times. 

Final point and somewhat out of their control - we had flies buzzing around us all night.   

Overall I had a decent time but that was more due to the company rather than the restaurant.  I'd hesitate to go there again for a meal (but maybe drinks; outside patio looked amazing).
