aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ If You are a big eater this is your place.  I went with #foodcrew to Graziano's to take part in the monster pizza challenge and YESSS that thing is a monster!!  There were around 30 of us at the restaurant 8 competed while the others ordered from the normal menu. The food was delicious and everyone's order was out fast even tho they had to make 4 of those huge pizzas.

Short list of delicious:
1. Garlic knot (so tasty)
2. deli calzone (yesssss!!)
3. Broasted chicken (delectable) 
4. BBQ Pizza (flavor)
5. Graziano special pizza (flava flav)

I definitely recommend that you make a stop at Graziano's
