3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg Classic steakhouse atmosphere, dark rich colors. Live music in the bar serves as entertainment for the restaurant (downstairs). Singer is very talented.

First server was strange, but when our actual server came ver he was better (first was very staccato, no welcome, just down to business...."hello. Tap or sparkling water?"). 

The pretzel bread is to die for. All the bread is amazing!

Oysters were great (expensive, though). Friends got crab law appetizer & liked it. Caesar salads were pretty good. 

We ordered lobster potatoes; they brought lobster Mac instead. The mgr brought a small side of potatoes, which were better than the pasta, in our opinion. My friend ordered petite filet, thy brought bone in filet instead. 

So sort of a rocky start....but got better.

My hubs and split a bone-in filet + scallops (plenty of food!). It was delicious, after my first bite which was gristle (I had to spit it out). I had the bone, and the meat flavor was great, cooked as I'd ordered. My hubs had the non-bone side, and by the time his sizzling hot plate came cooled down, his was overdone.

Plus: cocktails are great. Sides (snap peas, mushrooms) were fantastic. Warm butter dessert s recommended. Big portions. Quality of meat is high.

Negative: $40-$50 for a steak, it should come in cut and cooked as ordered, no gristle. Wine is 3x markup. 

I might try it again and see if I can upgrade to a 4-5 star. It's just that, for the price, I expected things to be better.
