qisbqK1wxuwp6GumMrwB2Q Let me start with VIP and great customer service from everyone one. Very welcoming this is our second visit here. This place is amazing we always go to Scottsdale to enjoy your dinner. But now we found our little Italy place in west valley. The owner Christine Diello is very accommodating came and checked on us couple of times. You can tell he has a passion for restaurant business and he is amazing at it. Our server Mihai is very knowledgeable about the menu will listen what you like and recommended exactly what you need. I would recommend mussels, truffle burratta, steamed clams and for entrees sea food pasta and everything on the menu is amazing. They are very accommodating and consistent. Very kids friendly as well. I would definitely recommend this place. Thank you for amazing service.
