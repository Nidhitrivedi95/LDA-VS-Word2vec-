H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g Very good, beautiful view, attentive service, outstanding wine list. Caperberry pizza was yummy, the spaghetti carbonara was so good I wanted to roll around in it, and the only problem with the olive oil gelato us that there wasn't enough  of it!  Desserts are pricy, pass on the arancine.
