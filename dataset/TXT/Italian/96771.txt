esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA Lunch time as we were walking by Harrah's, stopped in thanks to my Yelper friends!!
It was pretty darned good for an oyster bar in the middle of a casino, in the middle if the desert.

We had Oysters on the half shell, New England Clam Chowder, and Maryland Crabcakes. Everything was quite good. The clam chowder was ordered by my lunch companion and he really enjoyed it! The crabcakes weren't as crabby as I like, but had great flavor (I grew up in the east coast, living in VA, MD, and FL so my expectations for seafood is probably a little high).

The waiter was super friendly. Beer was cold.... What more can you ask for?!!
