XqSN1PtZkJ6QorOUa9AAdA I love alto. I came here on my first date with my boyfriend, look how well it worked out for him! :)  Alto is a cross between a truly chef driven type resturant, and a more trendy place like Postinos.  It has some dishes that are more accessible and some that are more haute cuisine, all perfectly executed.  Being a vegetarian, I stick to the basics, Mushroom Soup, which is incredibly creamy and savory, and the Insalata Caprese.  Alto takes both dishes to a new level. The Caprese salad is fresh burrata mozarella with the heirloom tomatoes that are so ripe that they literally melt in your mouth. they serve it with b asil of course, but add a touch of preserved lemon rind which balances the sweetness of the tomato, and basil and the creaminess of the mozarella with a touch of salty and sour.  great wine list.  great ambiance.  Oh and they serve their cheese platter with bread and two jams, fig and apricot sage jam. delicious.  i heart alto.  on weekends you can wander around twards the main lobby of the hotel where they have flamenco band and dancers performing.  A great restraurant and a great date place.
