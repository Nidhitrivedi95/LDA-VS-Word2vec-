We grabbed a drink across the street and they called us when our table was ready which First of all, I would prefer rather than waiting around and secondly, there is no where to wait. 

All of the staff we spoke to were really friendly and helpful. I debated between two dishes and was glad I let out server help me choose, it was delicious! She highly recommended the Tortelli and we got a meat and cheese plate to start. Everything was filling and so good. 

It was BYOB so make sure to take a nice bottle of wine with you. 

I will say they cram as many tables in as possible. It is a small place and you don't get much room.

But other than that, this is a new favorite of mine.
