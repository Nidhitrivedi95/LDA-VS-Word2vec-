GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA Me and my husband decided to come here to celebrate my 40th birthday. I had come here a few years back with work and thought it was great. Unfortunately this time it was just okay. The service was wonderful but the food was a hit and miss. We decided to go with the set menu so that we could try a few things. For the antipasti, I ordered the grilled octopus limoncello vinegrette and my husband ordered the pork belly. We ended up switching dishes because I preferred the pork belly. For the primi, I ordered the bolognese which I thought was pretty good and my husband ordered the orechiette which was not that great. For the secondi, I recommend the short rib which is fall off the bone but it's also very rich. And for dessert, my husband ordered the cannoli which was just ok but I ordered salted caramel and pistachio gelato which was really good. At the end of the meal, we left feeling like we could have had a better meal somewhere else for the amount we paid.
