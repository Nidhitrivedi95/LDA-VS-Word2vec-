YJS7cXGLAvWw9DUDXpw84Q Love most of the food but the service is horrible! We went for a very early dinner to use a friends and family coupon and it was apparently shift change because everyone was sitting around. We asked someone for a booster chair, she said let me get your server! The server came back and said oh we don't do boosters. That's a small indication of service, no plates, napkins, silverware until prompted. 

I do love the buffalo Caesar salad but don't bother getting the large because they  just add more lettuce. Kids love their pasta  but it doesn't even come with a drink (or she didn't offer) so $6 is steep IMO. 

We also tried the Firecrackers but be warned, you don't get Happy Hour pricing with any other offer. The steak firecrackers were very greasy, weird to be paired with marinara. 

Service is better at lunch but not by much, sticking with Nellos!
