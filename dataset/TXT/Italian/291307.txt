zYb4kj2R54R2YPeNm829BA I have ordered several times and the food has always been great. Most recently, I ordered a medium two topping pizza garlic knots and wings. Everything was delicious--especially the wings. 

Sometimes the delivery can take a bit; but, eat 24 and Sauce are pretty good at providing updates (and it's always been worth the wait).

Tip--the pepperoni stuffed fried cheese is fantastic.
