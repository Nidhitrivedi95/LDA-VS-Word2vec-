2i0dDzxLuQQAwzxDZVR-1g Oretta just opened earlier this week.
I was here Friday night for dinner and liked the food, service and atmosphere. The restaurant was fully booked for the evening and the only reservations available were for 5 and 6pm, however they will accept walk-ins on a first-come-first-served basis and there are no reservations at the bar. I was there at for my 6pm reservation and there were only a couple other people there and the dining room didn't start to fill up until almost 8pm.
The bistro-styled vaulted 2-storey space has a really nice feel with plenty of art deco touches and an impressive bar are dominating the center of the dining room. It feels comfortable, modern and not at all stuffy. I especially like that it is not a loud restaurant and you could comfortably have a conversation with others at your table without yelling, unlike many restaurants out there.

I started with the Bison tartare which was nicely prepared and seasoned. The breaded soft boiled quail egg made for a nice creamy sauce for the tartare. For my main I had the Gnocchi with squash and healthy shavings of truffles which was really comforting and satisfying dish. I ended my meal with very nice zeppoli (a Italian doughnut), which was more crunchy and flaky than a typical zeppoli and filled with a light and a mildly-sweet chestnut cream filling. It's a nice dessert if you are not into sweets.

My meal was very reasonably priced, especially for King West (and considering Buca is across the street), and everything about it was great which is very impressive for a newly opened restaurant. I will definitely be back again!
