I've only ever had the mussels (on promo too) so it was decently priced for what it was, but I wouldn't get them otherwise. They're drenched in sauce, which can be quite salty. The service I had both times were rather slow, especially given how empty the restaurant was. From what my friends ordered, the pasta doesn't look too bad, but portions are small. To be honest I wouldn't come here unless there was a special/large event. 

Edit: Not sure how to reply to comments, but sorry Lawrence about that! I've edited my review so it doesn't contain any unjustified claims.
