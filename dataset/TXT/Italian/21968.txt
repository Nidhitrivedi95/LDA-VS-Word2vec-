The atmosphere is warm and inviting with a long cozy "service" bar that was full of people perched on bar stools gabbing away, eating and drinking.

We had spicy salami with crusty bread brought to our table. We ordered the cold Octopus - which was delish, a collection of soft and hard cheeses along with some other cured meats - amazing, and an arrancini cone - perfectly moist with a crunchy shell.

I had the wild boar pasta - it was fantastic. My husband had the short ribs - they were just as scrumptious.

I am looking forward to returning to this place! A little gem in the heart of Ronceys!
