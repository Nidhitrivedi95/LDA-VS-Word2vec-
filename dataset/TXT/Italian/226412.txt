srIy6x9Z_6hEHuGPE6L0dw I have dined at Rudy's a few times and have always had a wonderful experience. Very good service and great Italian dishes. The prices are reasonable and they have a good wine selection.
Very casual and comfortable atmosphere. I have tried a variety of entrees and found all of them to be excellent.

Supported by a large local crowd.
