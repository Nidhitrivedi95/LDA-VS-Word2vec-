uPLbXDvBJF5R7FmBy8Na_g OK so California Sandwiches is truly an iconic place to get a veal sandwich.  I've been here probably about a million times and never really review it.  Well to start I order a sandwich from work over Uber Eats.  No better way for my first experience to be from California Sandwiches.  My order made it to my desk in half hour which I was really impressed.  I order a veal sandwich with medium hot pepper, cheese and mushrooms.  The sandwich was not just any normal sandwich it was a MANWICH.  It was huggeeeee.  Had to release the saw in order to be able to bite the sandwich.  The veal was tender and the toppings were generous. My only complaint was that the sauce was a bit to sweet for me but that's all personal preference.  I also found a chunk of onion in the sandwich as well which im sure was an accident.  None the less these are not overly huge reasons to complain nor are they reasons to cut off the restaurant.  I have been coming here for years and I will intend to continue doing so.  If you are craving a veal look up California Sandwiches and im sure there will be a location near you.
