ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Found a sweet new place-check it out! They have inside and outside brunch and dinner plus a coffee bar, bier garten  and a lot of cool outside space with bistro lights and a fireplace for those cool evenings to sit and chill with your friends or loved one..best part of all..they are fur baby friendly!! The service was a little slow especially with coffee refills but the food was presented well and tasted excellent! The price was more than your standard diner but appropriate for more high end brunch, service and ambience.
