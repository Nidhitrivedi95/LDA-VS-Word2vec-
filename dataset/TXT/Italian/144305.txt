It works just like Panera, you order upfront and wait for your food. However, they bring your food to your table which is nice. 
I got the "pick two" combo including tomato bisque soup and a turkey avocado wrap. Together it came to about $9. 
I'll start with the soup- if you are a tomato bisque fan- it's a must try! They sprinkle croutons and a small, thin slice of cheese on top and its amazing! It has that kick of spice, so good! 
As for the wrap, it was okay. It was satisfying but lacked some flavor. I could really only taste the small pieces of corn they included in the wrap. The piece of avocado was way at the bottom of the wrap and from what I could taste, that was about it. However, it's a small fix and definitely didn't push me away from coming back for lunch! 
Recommend!
