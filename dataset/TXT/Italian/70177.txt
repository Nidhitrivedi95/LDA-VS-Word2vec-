By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g I knew I was eating here last night and had to do my pre-work.  First of all, what the heck does DOCG mean?  During dinner we asked and got the answer in English, which means "controlled designation of origin guaranteed". You should see DOCG on all fine Italian food labels, especially on wine.  I never knew this until last night.  By the way, within 5 minutes we forgot what DOCG meant, hah. I had to go back after dinner and ask again.  Lol

Regarding their food, where the heck do I start?  We tasted a lot during our dinner last night.  Present during dinner was Chad S, Roy E w/his gf, and of course, Terri R.  

We shared the following dishes.

Small Plates:
-Their Bread
-Roasted Bone Marrow (red beets & oxtail)
-Grilled Octopus (chickpeas, tomatoes & basil)
-Pancetta Wrapped Prawns (w/rosemary lentils)
-Beef Carpaccio (caper aioli, parmesan & arugula)
I wasn't a fan of the Roasted Bone Marrow and wished it had more taste to it. The Beef Carpaccio, however, was fantastic. 

Pizza's:
-The "D.O.C.G" Pizza (fonduta, egg & truffles)
-Margherita (mozzarella & tomato)
The DOCG Pizza was a very tasty one over the Margherita.  This may not make sense at all, but the egg topped on it gave it a sweetness which combined very well with the pizza. 

Pastas:
-Pici (braised duck sauce & black truffles)
-Scialatielli ("arrabbiata" with lobster & shrimp)
-Fettuccine (roasted garlic, escarole & mushrooms)
My favorite of the three had to be the Pici.  The duck actually tasted like braised ribs, but had a small after taste to it.  Very lean and simply melts in your mouth. 

Sides:
-Roasted Asparagus (w/lemon & egg vinaigrette)
-Grilled Broccolini (w/garlic & chili)
-Potato Puree (w/mascarpone & parmigiano)
Their version of a mashed potato, just a lot creamier and full of butter.  Out of the three sides, this was my favorite with the asparagus as a close 2nd.  

Dinners:
-Diver's Scallops (My Entree - w/brussel sprouts & pancetta)
-Braised Short Ribs (Terri R's Entree) - w/sweet potatoes & cippolini):  I had to add this on my review since I ate half of her entree. 
I thought that the scallops were just okay. I'm a little different than most. I prefer smaller pieces of scallops over these huge ones that are served here.  In my opinion, the large pieces are a little too fishy to me (I know, this isn't fish. Just saying).  I did enjoy Terri's Braised Short Ribs.  Even though there wasn't a bone, this was some "fall off the bone" meat. I wish I had her meal. It was phenominal. 

Desserts:
-Salted Caramel Budino (pretzel toffee)
-Tiramisu (kahlua soak & coffee gelato)
-Marscarpone Cheesecake (w/fresh strawberries and strawberry sauce)
-Tartufo (nutella malt gelato, chianti cherrycompote & hazelnuts)

My favorite of the four desserts was the Salt Caramel Budino.  Served in layers, you have to dig your spoon deep in order to enjoy the magic of this dessert.  The Tartufo was magic as well with a combination of Nutella and dark chocolate.  The Tiramisu tasted like your normal Tiramisu.  As for the their cheesecake, I wasn't able to partake in the fun since I'm allergic to fruit. According to our group, this was a favorite too.  

Sorry for the longer than average review, but we were here a long time and ate a lot. Can you say food coma?  Food baby? After dinner, we were given a special "behind the scenes" tour of both DOCG's and Scarpetta's kitchen.  I had a great time and with a great meal.  I originally came here expecting less and got more, a lot more.  Good job, DOCG!  Your service was fantastic and definitely appreciated.
