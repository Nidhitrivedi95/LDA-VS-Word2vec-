5ykOWYZ44sUvu9qxD8rPeg We're staying nearby at the Hyatt Regency for a weekend getaway and wanted a change of scene with a small local restaurant that would appeal to me, my husband, and 5-year-old son--and weren't disappointed with this choice.  We sat outside on a pleasant evening and enjoyed a couple of pizzas, Caesar salad, wine, and gelato. Pizza was nicely crusty and slightly charred at the edges. Staff was kind, vibe was good, a winner all around.
