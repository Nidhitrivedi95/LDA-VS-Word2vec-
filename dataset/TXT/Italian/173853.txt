nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g Had dinner there last night for the first time, here on business from Chicago. We had reservations at 6 and were able to be seated right away, but by 7 the place was packed and people were waiting to be seated. Lots of large groups, and I'm guessing that's why it took an hour to get our food. So if you don't mind a long wait, I'd recommend it. The menu had a lot of interesting choices and our pizzas and pasta were good. Fun atmosphere.
