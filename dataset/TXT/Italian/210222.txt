qvQ-i1HgSloSJLkGnXsfhw Being a native, I can't believe I have never ben here before! The place was packed which is always a good sign. We only waited like 5 minutes on a Saturday night before we were seated. We ordered the boneless wings which weren't anything spectacular, but the pizza was great! We had the Red Devil Combo pizza, but they all looked and sounded great. I will definitely return.
