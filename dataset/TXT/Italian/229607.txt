Authentic Italian pizza must have a thin, crispy crust... this one was super soggy from the oily cheese and from being WAY undercooked. The dough was quite chewy (again, undercooked) and a little too thick in some areas. Not good.

The potential for a great pizza is there when the staff learns how to master the wood ovens, because as I said previously, the flavour combos are excellent. Until that happens though, I think there is much better pizza to be had in this city.
