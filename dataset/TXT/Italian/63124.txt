The atmosphere of this place is really interesting. Definitely check out the upper floor, it's what makes this place. 

The food is amazing! The mushroom pasta is honestly the best pasta I've ever heard. The grilled octopus is a dish that you have to try - not chewy at all. You can see all the delicate sauces and micro herbs they put on the dish to compliment it. Yum. 

The wine is also very good. 

I liked how they put you on a waiting list and text you when your table's ready. Very professional and time efficient. I don't have to sit in the restaurant and wait. 

Overall, it was a positive experience.
