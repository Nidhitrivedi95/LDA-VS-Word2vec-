cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q My coworker and I arrived around noon and we were immediately seated in a booth near the bar area. The waiter took our drink order and gave us a minute to review the menu.
Our drinks arrived and we had decided what we wanted to order, so the waiter took our order. The two lunch items (advertised as "Pronto Lunch") we ordered came with a choice of house salad or soup and breadsticks.
We got the house salad and breadsticks brought to our table 20 minutes later and then another 15 minutes for our lunch order. When we got our food, the waiter did not take any of the bowls or plates we used for the salad and the breadsticks. The table was now crowded and we had to maneuver the plates to make room on the table to eat.
The waiter did not take the liberty to apologize for the long wait and never followed up with us after we received our order to see if everything was ok. We had to ask for refills since he never came back to check on us. Refills were handled by another waiter and one other waitress.
We asked for our check and will not be returning to this location based on the customer service we received.
