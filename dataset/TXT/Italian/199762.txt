PSRZaGGxXmOmabL2si8pKw Just had the worst service ever. I love this place. However I felt very rushed by our server said one word she would run away. Forgot half of the stuff I asked for. My kids entrees came with 5 min and I waited at least 20 min for min. Grilled chicken and asparagus. My kids were done by the time mine came to table. As soon as she brought it I just asked her for a to go box. She said I'll box it for you. Not oh I'm sorry it came it out late sorry you didn't get to enjoy your meal with your kids. Nope took the plate boxed brought back and dropped my checked. And I paid $17.00 dollars for 6 ounces of chicken and 10 spears of asparagus I didn't get eat st the table with my kids. No I'm sorry no I'll get my manager nothing. Disappointed.  I'll post a picture of my boxed $17.00 to go Order.
