-wXyBph4d0IQlQrS8H1rDw WOW!!! Want to get screwed? Go to Senti in Lawrenceville. Yup, food was ok, but do you really want to pay $28.00 for a 5 oz. glass of wine? Really, a mixed drink for $12, and without any warning, the bill comes to the table. $28.00 for a 5 oz. glass of wine. A bottle that we can buy at the PA state store.
Guys, there are tons of great Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. You don't have to go to Senti.
