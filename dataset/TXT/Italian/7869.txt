0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw Had the bbq pizza. Not bad. The crust was wonderful. The sauce was good but the randomly place bleu cheese chunks detracted from the flavor. The ahi tuna sandwich was good. The slaw was large. The bun got a little soggy. The vanilla shake made with real vanilla bean stole the show. Very good
