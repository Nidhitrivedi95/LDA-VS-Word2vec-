HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A Love this place! Been here before with my best friend and had the osso buco and it was just as good as I remembered it! Best osso buco in town I think! My family and I sat in Kurt's section and he is just the sweetest! He made excellent recommendations, joked with us, and just an all around great person and waiter. Oh also had the cream puffs for dessert, don't miss out on those, they are just to die for!
