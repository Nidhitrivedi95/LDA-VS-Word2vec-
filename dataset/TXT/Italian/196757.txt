pOhX1XjbBdPoO2Fyy8RGJg My fourth Geraci's experience, now, and I felt the need to update my previous 5-star review with another one.

On a recent visit, as my wife and I were walking in, we were greeted by Fran Geraci, who was sitting outside having a beer.  Just as sweet as last time.  We ordered two small pizzas... the tri cheese and a double pepperoni.  Both were fantastic.

The pepperoni was just starting to burn at its highest points, which adds another dimension to the flavor and texture - neither of which were necessary, but both were welcome.  Service was very good as it has been each time.  Price, nice.

I just haven't been able to find much to complain about that matters, and I'm usually the type to really look hard when a place has been featured on TV or in Cleveland Magazine or something... I'm not a big fan of review inflation because a restaurant is SUPPOSED to be famous and wonderful.

Geraci's just nails it for me.  Like I said in my prior review... "beer and pizza" - there is no "best" . . . only your favorite.  This is my favorite pizza.
