AZlnpvILz5cEWJifjr2CSQ When we first found this place, we thought it was a blessing. You see, we moved here in Nov. 08' from Connecticut. My wife is an Italian girl from back east. She really hated Vegas, she said the food here sucked. So to find authentic (at the time) Italian was a godsend. They started out doing really well by us. But we have noticed a gradual down hill shift, in both food and service.

It started earlier in the year. My wife's favorite was the Sicilian lasagna, the eggplant was burnt.When the employees were told about the incident, the response was,"Oh really...I'm so sorry". No offer to replace the meal. Hmmm. So needless to say we haven't been back for six months.

Earlier today I had to run a bunch of errands. My wife called me and asked me if I wanted to give them another shot. Knowing that at one point this was my wife's favorite restaurant, I said OK, give em' another shot. We ordered two lasagnas and two orders of meatballs. 

Beside the fact that the order was shoved in the bag sideways, when I got it home the entire inside of the bag and everything was covered with grease. Both dishes were leaking . OK the food. The lasagna has gone from a work of art and SOME of the best I've ever had, to a greasy mess. The flavoring was poor, (needed salt). I give it a 2 out of 5, and trust me when I say I'm being generous. The meatballs have gone from a work of art to 2 small meatballs with NO flavor, just a ball of meat. Again maybe a 2 out of 5. And overpriced for what you get.

So this place is a great example of how to go from great to so-so. I do believe we won't be going back to this place. It breaks my wife's heart, because she really liked this place.

Don't waste your money on this overpriced yuppie swill!
