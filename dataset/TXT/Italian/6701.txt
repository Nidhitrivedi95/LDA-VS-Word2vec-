0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw I would have to agree first & foremost with the FLY INFESTATION theory! they really really REALLY need to control it, being indoors doesnt stop them at all!!
last time 2 of us went there it somehow came up to $50 which was insane! they are good but.... 
coleslaw is very very plain/flavorless, i still eat it.
the ribs are very good, shakes = good, atmosphere good.
I do have to agree it does get very loud sometimes, generally quiet and not busy in the early afternoon.
OH
DO NOT
I REPEAT, DO NOT SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING FOR THE FRIES
i substituted onion rings
they added on $2 more and gave me like 5 onion rings!!!
I do like the fact they seperate the trash/plastic/recycling etc..
im sure ill be back
WITH MY OWN FLYSWATTER!!!!!!!
