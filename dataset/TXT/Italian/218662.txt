s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q Horrible food and service!  Sadly disappointed in this place. ..the server was clueless about the special of the day for starters. The bread was soft sourdough which is NOT at all Italian. The food was tasteless and the meat was dry...very overpriced for an Italian meal that is worse than Olive Garden
