Toux3q1WwY2vNV5AhbR6wQ Great service and atmosphere.  BYOB was a nice option, but the unlisted $7.00 corking fee was a surprise (in Regent Square).  Food was excellent (menu changes daily), but I feel like they're trying to over do it with the attempt to "upscale". We'll be back but will probably only bring one bottle or just go out after.
