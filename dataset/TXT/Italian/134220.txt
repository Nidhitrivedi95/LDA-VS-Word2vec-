iqntlaqSCB4hkzTzlPlEmQ I used to like Bravo Cucina, I would eat with my family, bring my friends, etc., till  Saturday lunch October 28 with my husband and my sister in law, I wanted the chicken Parmesan but they wouldn't serve it without the pasta and I didn't want the pasta. The server suggested the chicken Marsala so I ordered that. The sauce was okay but the chicken was as thin as a pancake and only one half breast. For 14.99 I don't think it was worth it. It came with a high blob of mashed potatoes so I guess I was supposed to fill up on those and not the chicken.  Next time I'll go elsewhere.
