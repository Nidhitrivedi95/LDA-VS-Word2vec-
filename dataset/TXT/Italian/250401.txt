vNQkym5qZ-E-4AJ4IQ5JEg Been to Alla Famigla many many times.  It never disappoints.  We were celebrating my sons birthday.  I always order a seafood dish.  I went out on a limb and ordered the Gorgonzola filet.  OMG.   That is all I can say.  It was the best filet I have ever had!!   I am dreaming about it.  Can't wait to to back and have it again.  My opinion.  The best restaurant in Pittsburgh!
