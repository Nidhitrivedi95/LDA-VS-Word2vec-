w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q My husband and I read Yelp reviews from multiple restaurants and was intrigued by the food photos and reviews from the Palms Restaurant.  Well let me be the one to confirm that they did not disappoint and if you think the pictures look good wait until you taste the food!  I had the crabcake entree which was awesome! All lump no bread in crabcakes.  The Atlantic salmon was not as flavorful for my taste but quantity was sizeable.  And the best part-the three cheese au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach.....um um um...forget about it!!!!!! Delicious!  Best i have had thus far!!!!
