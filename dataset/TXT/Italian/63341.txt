B7G_2Hx8Rx8l6oQ6K3n5Uw I just wanted to say how extremely disappointed I am with my order. I placed an order for delivery and first off I ordered the supreme pizza and only got a pizza with mushrooms and onions. Second I ordered the broccoli cheese and chicken pasta with extra sauce, well there's no extra sauce and the pasta is undercooked. Every time I pass by this restaurant it looks so intriguing and thought I would get something at least decent but this uncooked pasta???

Very disappointed customer
