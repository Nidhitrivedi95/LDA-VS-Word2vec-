Awful and overcrowded with some of the worst wait queue organization skills from any restaurant we have ever been to. After waiting for over 90 minutes (from being told a 30-45 minute wait time) and then being told we're 10-15 minutes away from being seated which actually lasted for another 35 minutes, and having 2 parties jump ahead of us, we were finally seated. They had this loud and obnoxious party happening which prevented anyone from getting a table because of them clogging up the walk areas and bar area only to find out that NONE of the actual party guests were even sitting in their 20+ seats and tables! A server finally made his way to us but it turned out that he wasn't even our actual server and was helping the server assigned to our area who we never saw because he was dealing with that party. There was also some unkempt wine gopher that kept dealing with what looked like people he knew or were financially better off than most. After placing our order we sat there and my wife made me realize the amount of food we ordered and how much it would cost for our drinks, 2 appetizers, and dinner entrees which was over $110. For us, it doesn't matter how much the food costs at a restaurant as long as it tastes good and the experience is welcoming and rewarding. But did we want to spend that much after such a terrible experience? HELL NO! So we flagged down our surrogate server, cancelled our orders, and got up and left.  I really hope they get their act together and provide a better dining experience for future guests.
