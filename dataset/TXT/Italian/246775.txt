v3AS5LGeV2Si4nOHZ7lgxQ Yummy yummy pizza.  Crust is mid range between thin and a thick crust.  Tastes homemade.  My favorites are their deluxe (what can I say, I like classics!) and the Ranch (bacon, chicken, red onions, tomato, ranch sauce).  The latter is simply to die for.  Their regular tomato sauce, which I think is what can make or break a pizza (in addition to the crust) is fantastic.  I will say though, that people seem to LOVE the fetalicious but I think it's gross. Obviously a personal preference.

And this review is for pizza from all Glass Nickel Pizza locations (including Atwood Ave, University Ave, Fitchburg, and Green Bay).  They are all very consistent.
