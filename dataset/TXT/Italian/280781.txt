yPgUkQxj8CYPKF89HV65kg I'm so glad that this place didn't sell out to the development next door.  Lombardino's  has changed (and improved!) over the years, but retains so much of its classic-Madison character.  I hope that Lombardino's with it's throw-back mural and Trevi fountain replica, stay a neighborhood fixture for  generations to come.  We stopped in Saturday night with friends and were reminded of how much we love this place.  From the starters garnished their fresh pea shoots, to the pasta courses, to perfectly cooked steaks and scallops, we left very satisfied.  Friendly and attentive staff don't hurt either.
