E2e0ddxVL_G0EzsJaFVQKA Been to this ristorante a couple of times and my fiance and I love it. The service was great and they made us feel comfortable. The head chef came to our table to talk to us personally and that was a beautiful classy touch.  

The food was absolutely tasty and filling.
I would recommend this great place to my friends. 

My fiance and I liked it so much that I proposed to her there, on Sept 5, 2013. 
Its our special place now.
