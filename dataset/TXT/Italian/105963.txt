fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I have been coming to this restaurant for about 7 years and it has never ever every been anything but AMAZING!! I am a huge fan of their service and their food. It is consistently delicious! I live in Mesa and whenever I'm over in phoenix I try to stop in for lunch or dinner. It does get pretty crowed during rush hours and weekends. I have never had bad service or been disappointed with my meal! Not once in 7 years!
