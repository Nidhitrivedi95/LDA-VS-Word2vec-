Drinks: They have a full, but limited bar.  My husband wanted a Jack and Coke, but they don't carry Jack.  He ended up getting a Bulliet and Coke, which came in a very tiny glass.  Even though it was tiny, it was a pretty strong pour, I gotta give them that.  I had a very nice glass of wine for around $11, so not bad.

Food: Beef carpaccio for an app.  It is rolled like a sushi roll and the meat is sliced thicker than other carpaccio I've had, so you could really taste the meat.  I very much enjoyed it.  After, we ordered the Due Forni pizza.  It was $16 and I was a little dismayed at the small size of it when we got it.  More dismayed when I started eating it and there was hardly any toppings; it was a lot of dough.  That's some expensive, bare pizza.

Service: Overbearing!  The moment we walked in, we had two people greeting us with plastered on smiles from both sides of the restaurant.  When seated, a guy who I think was the manager came over and talked forever about every menu item and the ingredients in each one.  Let me look at the menu and if I have questions, I'll ask thankyouverymuch.  But the kicker was when my husband's drink was finished...3 different people asked if he wanted a refill literally within 30 seconds.  Too many hands in the cookie jar if you ask me.  The waitress was also very pushy when we declined dessert and kept insisting we try something.

I think I'd come here to sit at the bar and have some drinks, but I wouldn't spend that much money on the pizza again.
