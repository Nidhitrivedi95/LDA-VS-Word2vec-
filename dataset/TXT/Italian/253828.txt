vu_jrjVKFPLW-iFHq6sRCA Have used this barros location in the past (roughly 1 year ago with positive results.  Went back tonight and picked up an order to go for a large pizza and hot wings.  The pizza was pretty good but the wings had almost no sauce. The place looked pretty busy but I won't go back for wings anytime soon
