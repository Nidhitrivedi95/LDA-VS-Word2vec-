sj9osyqLyOy7b_kDZb1txA The spaghetti with meat sauce I had was reminiscent of something you got from a supermarket deli.The sauce tasted blander than bland! And there was not nearly enough of it on the pasta. It was on the dry side. I tried one of their pizzas but was not too thrilled with it. Then again I'm a big fan of New York style versus Chicago.
