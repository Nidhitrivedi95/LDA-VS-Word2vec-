U7fZfH9C4hj5BFRYaPOo2w Just want to say hats off to the chef for an impeccable meal! The entire course was absolutely amazing.

They start you off with this very warm sour dough bread with this herby garlic spread. So good.

I then ordered the best salad with this Spanish bleu cheese. Light and pleasant.

I then ordered the scallops and my god they were probably the best scallops I've ever had. It came with this lobster infused (and chunks of lobster) Israeli couscous that just went with it so well. It was savory and balanced. 


The next night we went again and I had the fried risotto balls with chorizo in them. Done deal. Their chorizo had this very smoky but not overwhelming taste. I could've eaten 10.

Their special was this fish flown in from Hawaii the day before. Seared and had a truffle risotto with it. And the truffle was just the right amount. Not overwhelming at all.

I plan to tell anyone I know visiting Scottsdale to come check this place out.

Bravo

P.S the service is perfection.
