98V9R-7YT20KmcmJyMiJmg I'd actually give here a 3.5  I had been to the Danforth location of Il Fornello years ago and liked it, so expected here to be about the same, and it was, when I came for dinner around 6pm on a mild Tuesday evening in December.  The place was less than half full, with the majority of the customers seated toward the front of the restaurant.  There must be at least 30 or 40 tables with a capacity for 100 I'd say.  Simple, casual/fine dining atmosphere with low lighting.  Friendly service.  Free white bread with oil and vinegar to start always is the perfect beginning to an Italian meal for me.  Then my friend and I split an order of garlic cheese bread, which was delicious with lots of cheese melted to perfection.  We each also tried the Gnocchi Gorgonzola (house made gnocchi in a gorgonzola cream sauce with toasted walnuts 18.65) which was delicious and very filling.  I'm not even a walnut lover, but these were the perfect touch.  Somehow yet, my friend was able to order and eat most of a side plate of fingerling fries.  She obviously had a carb addiction that night.  lol  We split some bottle of pinot grigio which I don't recall the details of, other than we did it enjoy it as well.  My only complaint of the evening may sound huge to some people, but there was a smell of sewage throughout.  This is common in many restaurants downtown, something I guess to do with the old piping in the city.  It wasn't dominant enough to really bother me, but it was there.  So if you are sensitive to that, you may want to test it out before sitting down to order.  The place itself seemed clean, so I doubt it was any fault of the restaurant.  I'd definitely go back here anytime.
