bgCHcGeOBNQxDT95XvzNFQ I went there with a group of 8 friends for my 40th birthday. Everyone from the hostess to the waiter to the bus staff made me feel like a VIP and my guests all enjoyed delicious food, good wine and impeccable service. We met in the bar for drinks first and listened to live piano music, then were promptly escorted to our table, and then stayed for some music and dancing in the bar. Our food took a little longer than usual I think because there was a large party of prom goers, but it still mostly  was a good, relaxed pace.I have been to both locations a few times before and I know its normally a relaxed fine dining pace, but usually not such a long wait for dinners. I could not have asked for a more relaxing, fun birthday and Villa Antonio is the only place in Charlotte that I know that does it this well. If you're looking for a great dinner, fantastic martinis or wine list and a place for dancing and music for the over 30 crowd, this is THE place to go.  Also, their patio is amazing and we had originally planned to do drinks prior to dinner there but it was raining.
