RuU1P-CW3DJtiLoNTahUHA The best Italian meal I've had in a long time. The food was fresh and authentic. I took the waiter's recommendation on the seafood pasta special. The pasta was home-made, the seafood was fresh and the sauce was delicious. He also recommended the perfect wine pairing and dessert with cappuccino. We finished it off with a cold limoncello. Highly recommend it!
