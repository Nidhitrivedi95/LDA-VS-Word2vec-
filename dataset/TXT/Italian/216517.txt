RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ The pizza was pretty good. Decently crispy crust, plenty of sauce and a load of toppings. I ordered a pepperoni, sausage, and bacon pizza and we really were impressed by the amount of cheese and meat that were on it. 

That being said, the taste just wasn't phenomenal or anything. Took a long time to get the pizza. Neat neighborhood and decent pizza though. I thought it was a classic dive style pizza place.
