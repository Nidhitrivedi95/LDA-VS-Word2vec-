hTsZSiftorNUFb1VaHCHHg Love this place! I came here about a month ago to do a wine tasting for a bachelorette party. Not sure if they do this regularly but it was a great accommodation. The owner (also a sommelier) put together some small plates of charcuterie, fruits, and nuts and paired them with all different kinds of wine. 

The service was great and the he did a phenomenal job explaining the most commonly used wino terms. He also taught us how to pick out some great wines and made awesome wine recommendations for the budget friendly wine drinker:)
