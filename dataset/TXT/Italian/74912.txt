Cr5CLpmVrmzFyz_RfQ6rmA This Scaddabush location is a lot closer to me than the one located downtown, so to celebrate my birthday this year, this was the location we unanimously chose. 

The food here is passable. Wasn't really anything to write home about. There is obviously way better Italian elsewhere. The food to me felt like what you'd expect from a chain restaurant. East side Mario food on fancy plates really. 

The service was also a pass for me, but barely. Our server was great, very attentive and kept coming back to check on us (20 person party). She suggested the best drinks, meals and comped some drinks + dessert for the table which was great and appreciated. We didn't ask, so it was nice that she went out of her way to do that. 

Where the service fell flat though was when we arrived. I called days ahead to book several tables as walking in with 20 people would take forever to get seated. Upon arrival I was shown to the back near the windows. 4 tables with approx 10 chairs. I told the hostess, was a guy, that I booked for 20. His response was "ya, once this area clears we'll pull up some chairs". Ughhhh, okay.. I guess half my party will stand for an hour? Why take a party of 20 and seat us if you don't even have the space? How stupid is that .. Let's just say we never saw him again for the rest of the night. We had to ask patrons to borrow chairs and steal empty tables before they were cleaned. 

We won't be returning.
