nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A I've always been a huge fan of Buddy so my friend and I decided to try it out. Service was exceptional, and we were suprised at how fast we got our food. The chicken marsala was good, but nothing more special than the others I have tried. The real reason we came was for the lobster tail and cannoli. It was amazing and even better then we imagined.  A definite must try when visiting this restaurant.
