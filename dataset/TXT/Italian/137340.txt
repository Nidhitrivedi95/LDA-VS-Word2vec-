J4tO07oCDhwP3rdcgjjdxg Can't wait to actually have their food next time!! Stopped In with my boyfriend for a quick drink and the owner (I believe) took the time to show us their featured menu items (their grandma makes their lasagna homemade everyday!) and even let us try their wings which were the real deal and amazing! Can't wait to go back for the pasta!!
