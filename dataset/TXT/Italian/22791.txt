3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg TOURIST TRAP!!! Sorry to those that I know that work there but this is a place you go once and do not come back. Over priced, overly loud, and the product does not match the scene. We ordered wine by the glass and the waiter had to check the wine list to see what I had ordered. We ordered crab cakes and they came out in under a minute(sure sign of someones mistake sitting in the window waiting to be re-sold), and our steak was over cooked, however we couldn't even send it back due to lack of attention by our server. He checked back once during the meal and then again to see if we wanted dessert. The inside was poshly decorated and the dining room with the pool was very cool, but not enough to overcome the feeling of being lost in the shuffle. I hope Steak 44 has more to offer.
