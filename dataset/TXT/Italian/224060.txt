smBsHggLvIuABgntBvlYLw One of my favorite places.  I have had many, many of the items and have never been disappointed.  My favorite thing is the salads.  So many wonderful ingredients.  Such as goat cheese, beets, asparagus, roasted brussel sprouts, kale , red quinoa.  Oh my.  seriously this is only a few.  a small $8.50 is usually enough for me to have lunch the next day.  One of the few places that even when it is busy and full it is not too loud to enjoy.  Thank you Mr. Pollack for creating a wonderful restaurant.
