366FaRQ1MWEHBhaEKTcriQ I used yelp to find this restaurant and I'm grateful for the reference. Started with the meatball appetizer and it was delicious. Nice flavor in the meatballs,good texture, lots of cheese and the marinara sauce was delicious. I could eat just the sauce with a spoon. The thin crust pizza was also great. We built our own with sausage, mushrooms, banana peppers and ricotta and my only complaint was I was too full to finish. I'm from out of town so next time I return I will be sure to save room for more pizza from Spinato's.
