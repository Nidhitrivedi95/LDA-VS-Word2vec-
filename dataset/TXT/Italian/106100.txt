fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg Round up from 3.5 stars to be a solid low key dinner spot when you and hubs can't decide what to eat, don't want to go too far or spend too much money. We rolled in around 9pm, which is apparently the perfect time to go on a Saturday night according to our nice server. They ran out of bread, which was fine since this was already going to be a carb-fest. On our server's recommendation, we got the seafood udon and napolitan pasta. I had pretty low expectations based on prior reviews, but both dishes were solid winners, especially the udon. The napolitan pasta was the restaurant's vibe on a plate - a mash-up of Italian and Asian flavors which was confusing at first, but admittedly delicious. 

This wouldn't be my first choice for date night, but something tells me we'll be coming here a lot. For two entrees our total was $26. Parking can be awful in this tiny lot but it was only half full at 9pm.
