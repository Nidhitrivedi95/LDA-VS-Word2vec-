oJSa5HCiZXKLXxggQmecEQ I came on a Friday night in a party of 4. I almost gave up on this place... Almost a week in advance, I phoned to make a reservation. No one answered, so I left a message. 2 days pass, no call. So I decide to try calling them again. I call at strategic times to try and catch them before they get too busy. No dice. At one point, the call answer thing tells me their voice mailbox if full. Bad sign... Finally though, they did get back to me. FYI - I think on Friday/weekends they only do 2 sittings, 6pm and 8:30pm. 

Showed up and the people at our table were still not done... It wasn't that bad, but we did have to wait 10 mins. which is sort of annoying when we already had a reservation. 

But I still give Campagnolo 4 stars because the food was SO good. I had high expectations and I was worried it might not live up to them, but thankfully I wasn't disappointed! 

I had:
- Cocktail that was basically a gin & tonic with fresh mint and cucumbers. Simple perfection. Nice and refreshing. 

- Brussel sprouts with pancetta and pine nuts -- love at first bite! The creamy sauce was divine. Luckily we got the house made baguette, so I could dip the bread in it. Good portion size. 
- Had a bite of the burrata and grapes. So fresh and tasty. I am definitely going to order this next time. 
- One person got the prosciutto which was nice but it didn't come with any bread or anything. The prosciutto looked a bit lonesome on that long plate... Another ordered the fish chowder. Looked hearty and he said it was really, really good (so good he wouldn't share!). 

- Spaghetti all' Amatriciana - I was so excited to try this because it is a quintessential Roman dish that I discovered recently while traveling in Rome. Campangolo's version was just as good as the ones I tried in Italy. Perfect al dente noodles and the sauce was spicy but not exaggerated. 
- We didn't really share entrees, but the person who ordered the boar was raving about it. And another friend got over his psychological barriers to eating rabbit (bunny!) -- and enjoyed the pappardelle dish. 

- Peppercorn panna cotta - interesting idea and mix of flavours, although after a few bites I found it way too pepper-y. 
- Salted caramel budino - I'll echo what everyone else has said, one of the highlights of the meal. 

Despite my frustrations in booking a table here (why have a phone if you don't pick it up?!?), Campagnolo has won me over. Really authentic Italian food done right -- simple dishes that let fresh ingredients speak for themselves and a small but always changing menu (luckily favourites like the burrata and the caramel budino are almost always on offer though). Knowledgeable and friendly staff plus a warm, inviting space are the cherry on top.
