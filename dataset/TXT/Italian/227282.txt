SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Good food, but a little too pricey. Location is a trade-off. 

First, let's deal with the location. The fountain can be great to look at and of course the people watching probably doesn't get much better. However... the fountain is loud, generates lots of humidity, and that section of the Forum seems to be a hot spot (temp wise). If you're near the fountain, you're likely to be in lots of photos (which can be annoying getting flashed in the eyes all meal long) or having people stand at the railing observing your meal or kids crawling on the fountain wall around you. To me, its a take it or leave it equation. I would aim for the patio just outside the restaurant where the negative aspects may be  minimized. 

I've been here a couple times. Recently, they had a mozzarella, strawberry, basalmic salad that was great! I once had a great risotto, last visit was a combo of over/under cooked (like they had some left over from another table and mixed old w/ new). $40 for risotto with salmon bits, 5 small clams, and a fair portion of calamari is a little steep. Other dishes have been good, can't remember anything I wouldn't try again. Caprese is good. Wine markup is a little much for mostly entry level selections. Service was execellent. 

I would go again and would recommend it to a friend. For that, I rounded them up from 3.5 stars to 4.
