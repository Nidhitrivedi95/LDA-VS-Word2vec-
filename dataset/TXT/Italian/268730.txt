Not sure why today was different but I now regret my delay. It's a really tastefully decorated huger end bar which you would never guess walking up to it. 

The menu is great as well and it's hard to choose from so many great items. So we asked our server for help and she was both very knowledgeable and helpful. 

The food is fresh, never frozen. Its homemade and delicious as evidenced by all 6 of us clearing our plates. In fact we all already have our orders ready for our next visit. I would highly recommend the Italian wedding soup to start. It was worth the calories. 

I'm going to say that this is likely the best dining spot in this general area which true, there is not a ton of choices, but this truly is a gem and deserves a stop.
