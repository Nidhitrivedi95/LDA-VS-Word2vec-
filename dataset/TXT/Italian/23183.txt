3q8MtOEIJ6nC7kVv_8Mfgw We selected this restaurant for a family dinner due to its central location and delicious-sounding menu. It did not disappoint. 
The food was absolutely delicious. I had the escargot to start, seafood pasta as my main and chocolate mousse for dessert...yes, a lot of food. There were 5 of us in our party and everyone loved what they ordered. I had a bit of my husband's app special- avocado shrimp and crab thing...to-die-for!
The prices were appropriate for the quality and quantity of food. However, the selection of desserts wasn't great and the staff did seem to get a bit overwhelmed when all the seats filled up. Our desserts took almost 30 minutes due to a 'large party' being served. 
They also accommodated the fact that we had a 3 year old by adjusting the spaghetti dish to be a bit more bland. 
The atmosphere was great, perhaps a bit dark, and the crowd was comfortable and not stuffy for a white linen restaurant.
I would definitely come back and am glad to have found another great restaurant on this strip when KitKat was my usual go-to.
