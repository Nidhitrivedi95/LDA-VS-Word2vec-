The range of beers is amazing. The wines are also great: they had help with the line list from a guy who is extremely knowledgeable on the subject and it shows. They're reasonably priced, too.

As for the food, starting with the appetizers, they are pretty good as well as unusual. Another poster's comments about the clams was misleading: yes, they're small, but that's because they're littlenecks. Management should probably put that in the description. My complaint about them was that they were not particularly flavorful (blame the purveyor for that), but the sauce was great. We kept ordering more bread to soak it up -- they apparently bake the bread on the premises, BTW.

The 3 cheese tartlets are an interesting idea. My only complaint about them is that they use brie in 2 (gorgonzola in the third), and I don't think the brie can stand up to the cooking. Maybe they should try a camembert.

The fries are good (another reviewer's comment about the rosemary being useless is accurate - but it makes the plate look nice), but I think the sauce is a little bland.

Didn't have any other appetizers, but we will next time.

The only salad we had, which we shared, was the Chopped. It was unusual, but also outstanding!

Also had the Lamb Kefta and 2 pizzas. 

Didn't try the pastas because we ate so much of the other items, but we will on the next trip, because they look like they're a lot more than just pasta. No room for dessert.

I think this is the perfect place to go after work. Have something to drink and some appetizers, and if you feel like staying and eating more, the food is just right for that kind of night.
