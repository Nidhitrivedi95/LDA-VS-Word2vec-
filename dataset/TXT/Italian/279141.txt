yNp0ybYo07JQWlmdz1K4Cw We went during Restaurant week for a date night! I must say I was extremely impressed!!! The food was wonderful, the server was on top of her game and the atmosphere was soft and romantic! 

Their Almond Crusted Brie is one for the books. I've never had a flavor combination quite like that and it was just wonderful!

The server had suggested a bottle of wine which, if purchased, came with a gift card for the restaurant to use on another visit. GREAT suggestive selling and an amazing way to get people to come back for another round of a tastefully delicious experience!

Going back this evening!
