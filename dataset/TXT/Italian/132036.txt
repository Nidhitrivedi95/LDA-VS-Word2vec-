Ijdoi6pDMK3Burw3TtAOZg 2 stars only because the pizza was good. WORST delivery driver EVER. He should be fired. Called me to ask where he was supposed to deliver and i was like what the heck i gave you guys the address and he said he has the address but he's not gonna drive around trying to find the hotel. Are you serious? He had the most unpleasant attitude and demeanor when he finally arrived. Oh and before that, someone calls me from the restaurant asking me for my credit card number. I was like,  uh i am not giving you that since i ordered through grubhub. The guy on the other line figured out he was calling the wrong person and apologized but i mean still...calling a cuatomer for their credit card number is just funny business. I'll pass on this place next time I'm in vegas.
