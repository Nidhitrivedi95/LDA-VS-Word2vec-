N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg How I missed Chicago pizza! I mean real Chicago pizza! There will be of course a wait here but it'll be worth it!

They do not take reservations so make sure not to walk in hangry. We had an hour and 10 minute wait. They took my info and text me (with a chicago number!) when my table was ready. I love that they text you with a link to see the status of where you are in line. I also love that you can preorder your food so when you finally get to your table you don't have to wait another half hour or so for your food (so you won't get hangrier). The wait for us ended up being about an hour and the food was out an ready within about 10 lonutes after sitting down.
As a Chicagoan, I know that a deep dish pizza will take about 45 minutes to make.  Also some advice, if you've never had a deep dish, for two people get a small pizza. You just need a slice maaaybe two and then you are full. Oh and also make sure you get buttercrust. Tastes amazing! 
Wish I could've made it to dessert...maybe next time!
