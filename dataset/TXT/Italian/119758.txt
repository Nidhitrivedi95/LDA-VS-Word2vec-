Came in for a latte and ended up letting the waiter choose some items for us. My photos will show:  truffle honey, candied apricots and Marciano cherries as sides with Buffalo mozz, fontina and smoked Gouda. With Prosciutto and salami. 

Typing fast because I want to go back for more. Tip here: Let your extremely educated waiter choose for your items for you. Guide them a little but be adventurous. Enjoy this great little escape during gambling or shopping. 

Back to the Vegas grind. See you all soon.
