_dvEaK970_4AFzVd2z9VCg Love love love the pizza! The crust is slightly thicker than the normal pizzas around here but I like my crust a little doughy. We ordered for take out and waited there. I didn't see anything wrong with the service, however I didn't dine in. They had an extensive menu and I'm looking forward to eating there and having one of their many pastas which looked really good. This is a small eatery, so I would not bring a large group...seats about 15-20 tops. This is going to be our go to spot for pizza. Salami with champignons was delicious!
