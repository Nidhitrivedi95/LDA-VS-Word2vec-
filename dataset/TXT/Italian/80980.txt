The menu looked good, prices reasonable, and the atmosphere intimate but still inviting.  We changed for dinner and were the most dressed there that evening (I had on a dress, my date slacks & a dress shirt, no tie).  The waitstaff was very nice, the ambience pleasant, and the food was good.  My gin & tonic was a bit too strong (he even went and added tonic after I mentioned it and it was still too strong).  A good meal & experience overall and I'll recommend it to anyone looking for a nice place for dinner
