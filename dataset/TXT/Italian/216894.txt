rV6PwAjgpTx5Knr5lYouoQ This place has definitely gone down hill. Used to enjoy coming here and within the past year the food quality, service and overall environment has declined. 

The sauce has changed in my opinion ( and not for the better), service was awful. It took about 20 minutes just to get our drink orders. I had to ask for a straw twice and never got one. Tables and floors were dirty. Sadly, it wasn't even busy. There was on other couple in the dining room section.

I would advise to stay away!
