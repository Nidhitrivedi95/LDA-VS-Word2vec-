yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg Terrible place...We were sat by a grungy older man who didn't even say hello. On the way to our table, he stopped and reprimanded a waiter in the middle of the patio. We just stood there - uncomfortable! Our waiter was rude- He kept leaving the table in the middle of our order to go to other tables and would not let us finish our sentences. Halfway through the meal the older man (who we figured out is the owner or manager) had an argument with 2 of the employees and then got in his truck and sped out dropping f bombs at the employees. (Sitting on the patio, we had front row seats to the drama) - We felt like there were hidden cameras and we were on a prank tv show or something! WOW! DO NOT SUPPORT THIS RESTAURANT!
