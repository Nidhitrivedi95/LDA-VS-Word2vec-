HNQzWfhR8kIgTsoxLKCcSw We are visiting from out of town and enjoyed a lovely quiet dinner here. The service was friendly and attentive. The waitress changed a drink we did not like. The pasta was delicious -- we had penne with eggplant and tagliatelle with prosciutto . Rocket salad starter was dressed perfectly. Garlic bread was generous and so tasty. We resisted ordering more. Would definitely go back!
