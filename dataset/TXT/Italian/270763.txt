XPDzKfrq5uzz4o82eCZI7w First, I can't believe they've been hiding there for 18 years and we've never found them....until now!  What a treat for our last night in Scottsdale.  We were welcomed at the door and the host had actually read our reservation comment on OpenTable!  What a pleasant surprise.  We had a table in the corner where we could enjoy the entire restaurant as it filled to the brim for dinner.  Our waiter was outstanding; the perfect blend of attentiveness, knowledge, and fun.  I didn't see one of the cocktails on the night's menu that I'd seen on the website, so asked the bartender to surprise me with something "gingery".  He did not disappoint. Not sure what all I was drinking, but it was delightful!  We started by sharing the Chanterelle & Fried Egg salad.....sounded a bit strange, but what a heavenly dish.  Rich with flavor and texture.  I opted for the Jidori Chicken and my spouse, the Braised Berkshire Port "posole style".  Both were well prepared, and extremely interesting...in a very good way!  Based on other reviews, we ordered the Sauteed Shishito Peppers, which truly made every bite a surprise, and we almost licked the platter clean.  The Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Bacon were amazing as well.  And just when we thought we'd had enough....we had to try dessert!   Mom's Honey Pecan Square was a hit....but my favorite was the pink grapefruit mint sorbet!  A perfect ending to a perfect meal!  When we were leaving, the host asked about our experience and engaged in some delightful banter, which just completed the night.  Next year, we just might start our Scottsdale vacation at Rancho Pinot!
