_BnBjRMt5Ba-TAv07r3fyw I went to this resto with my friend looking for a quick lunch. This place is really nice inside and they have so many wine bottles they need ladders to get to the top shelves! Definitely do not want to be in this resto during an earthquake! I ordered grilled octopus because it's not something I eat everyday. Before the meal comes, the waiter brings us a baguette with a plate of pesto! Yummmm every resto should do this!! Our waiter was really nice and even brought us a second baguette after we chowed through our first one.... I'm a sucker for bread, it might be a problem ;) The octopus was really yummy and served over fennel, onions, capers and white beans... The only hitch was that it was quite oily and it was a hell of a job to fit everything on your fork without anything falling off on the way to your mouth! Overall, good service, good meal, good environment, not too pricey and the service was quick! :)
