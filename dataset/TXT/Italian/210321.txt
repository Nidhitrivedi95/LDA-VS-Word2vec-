qVQGfHphxolps16v6g5X-g Belfiore has become one of my favorite local Italian joints to frequent. The food is always amazing and the dishes are large enough to eat family style which makes it that much more affordable.  The reason I rated them a 4 star instead of a 5 is because of the lack of consistency in good service.  Most of the time, it's wonderful, but there have been times when they are understaffed, and the flow of service seems  discombobulated and hectic.  

If you're looking for great, local Italian food, this is definitely the place for you.  If the girls seem overly busy, just breath and be patient--after all, they are running not only the restaurant, but the deli/bakery portion of the building too.
