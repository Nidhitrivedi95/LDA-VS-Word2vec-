c5x6HWB8MTZvlTgabihaSw We have visited this restaurant twice.  We have not been disappointed yet.  The pasta is made in-house and it's perfectly al-dente.  I recently had the lobster ravioli in a cream sauce.  It was so tasty and delicious. I asked for more bread at the end to sop up my leftover sauce.  The service there has always been wonderful.  Friendly, professional and informative.
