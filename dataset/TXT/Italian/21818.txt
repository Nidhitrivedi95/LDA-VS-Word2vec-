3cbsPfoUUrysf-M8FI_0IA YUM. Chef Kate Romane is a genius. Pittsburgh is very lucky to have her. Doing Italian food is relatively easy, but she does it extraordinarily well.

The special of the evening was corn fritters. They were absolutely delicious. They were also super filling so I was very glad we decided to share.

I had the wild mushroom ravioli. It was very good. Definitely had an earthy flavor to it, which our waitress described perfectly. My guest had the ricotta ravioli, which was much sweeter (too sweet for me), but it was excellent as well.

The servings are very generous and it was a struggle to stay for dessert, but we did it for the beignets. There are five in a serving, so good for sharing. They are perfectly done and topped with lots and lots of powdered sugar.

It is pretty hard to get in here, but if you go right as they open on a week night there shouldn't be an issue. If you're a fan of Italian or just good food in general, I highly recommend E2.
