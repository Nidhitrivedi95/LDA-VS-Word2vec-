x4aHNNo1osWNCB75q_PijQ I kind of accidentally went here a few weekend ago when we had originally tried to go to the crepe place in Gainey Ranch. However, they were crowded and I had remembered seeing Pomo on a Yelp search and seeing that they had great reviews. Therefore, we decided to walk across the parking lot for some pizza instead for lunch.

We were seated right away and since it was our first time there, we were told about their background and how they're the only place in the US that's certified for having authentic Napoleon style pizza (or something like that). We ordered the margharita pizza and gnocci. We were warned that the wait would be a little longer due to the gnocci.

The wait was definitely long, but worth it. The pizza was great. Lots of flavor with fresh ingredients. The gnocci was room temperature when we got it which was disappointing. It was really good though, just would have been better if it was hot. It did make for great leftovers though. 

I'm sure I'll be back!
