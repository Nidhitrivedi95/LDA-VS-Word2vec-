qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ I have heard so many positive things about this place and it has always been ok our list of places to try. We tried Casanova Bros. for the first time on Monday and we are back on Saturday. Mike and Tony make you feel valued and take care of you. We went all out our first time and tried appetizers, salads, pizza, sandwiches and desserts, everything was excellent. We are happy to have a great pizza place so close to our home. Thanks Mike and Tony, we love your place!
