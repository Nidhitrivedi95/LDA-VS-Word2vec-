QLRn67HoGCqi4Dqo2YaJvA Of course the one time I didn't check Yelp before my boyfriend suggested we have dinner here on Friday. If I had checked, I would have been prepared for the death stare we got when we told them we didn't make a reservation because we didn't know you had to. Mind you, the restaurant was half full, at best. 

We were seated in a back corner (I always seem to get lucky with the most inconvenient and uncomfortable tables/booths; what's the deal with that?)

We got one salad and two plates so this place is like Olive Garden where you share a larger salad, and they give a balsamic dressing on top (no others).  They also provide a good size loaf of baked bread that they describe on the menu as garlic bread but it just tasted like butter and bread to me, I didn't taste any garlic or other seasonings. I got the pasta with Italian sausage & feta (cannot remember the name and cannot find a menu online to refresh my memory), and my boyfriend got a chicken dish. Both were simply excellent; hot,fresh, cooked to order, nice portions, and great presentation. I definitely think they were worth the 1.5 hour wait. (I think?) no seriously!  they were top notch Italian dishes and a lot of care was put into each one. 

My only large qualm was briefly mentioned above: the dining room was 1/2 full and we waited 45 minutes for our salad & bread. Another 45 minutes for our entrees. When the entrees came, the waitress apologized for the wait, and listen, I want a good meal. I don't care if it takes a bit longer than usual  if it's fresh, cooked to order, and worth it in the end, which this was. 

But honestly I just can't get over how long it took as well as the first impression of being made to feel so uncomfortable for not making a reservation. Just don't come here without calling first and don't come starving and you will be fine (haha you will be cranky!)
