HrXrd_S6cDbSjpsRxIGsog We have had 5 star experiences and 3 star experiences, thus I am giving them 4 stars. We love coming to this great family friendly restaurant. The best part is the kid's play area. My husband and I love sitting back there, enjoying conversation, and letting our toddler play with their play kitchen, legos, and watch Disney Junior. It is just perfect. To top it all of they have delicious pizza, decent wings, and great prices on their pitchers of beer (with some great local options!). Their prices are great and you just cannot beat the play area. If you want to go somewhere where everyone in the family will enjoy it, I highly recommend Barro's. I just hope you go on a day when the staff is on it. The main issue we have (when it is a 3 star visit) is the inability to ever understand how to apply their own coupons and not say anything about it. The only reason you know is because when you look at your receipt later, it is not applied! At least ask a manager how to do it or something. The staff is also not very helpful, they take your order and deliver your food to your table and that is literally it.
