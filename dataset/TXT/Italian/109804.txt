G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q By far the best meal I had on my trip to Vegas. The bread with condiments was delicious. We got three apps- the artichoke balls, a crostini and the orzo meatballs. All were so good! I had veal saltimbucco for my meal and it was excellent!! Everyone in my party enjoyed the food and we all thought it was best place we had been (we went to emerils and carnevino on other nights). Also great atmosphere at Giadas.
