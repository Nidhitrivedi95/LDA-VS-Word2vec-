3yMmo1sERpks50quoaA8PQ I think this restaurant deserves two different ratings- one for their in-restaurant experience and one for take-out. 

Their staff is extremely friendly and nice...but mostly only to the patrons that are dining in. That makes perfect sense, as their service correlates to their tips. But still, I always  feel ignored when I'm there to pick up my food to-go. 

The food is really good, but they recently surged their lunch menu prices so they no longer have great lunch specials. I'm also sick of feeling unwanted when I go pick up my lunch
