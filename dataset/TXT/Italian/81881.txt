ddlnpDxGDDxGGoG_dVXwiw Made a reservation on Open table for 7 p.m. Showed up at 7:05 Was told 15/20 minutes , " go get a drink at the bar". At 7:30 I asked the " major demo" what the status was, btw saw 3 open tables , and was told that the table they had for us was still occupied and the patrons had not ordered their entrees for 2 hours after seating. To which I replied " and that effect me how"? Turns out another 30 to 45 minutes.Really junior , bush league service and we left. Had a fabulous dinner at Mimi's on Fairmont, much happier. Good luck to Feliz - or not so much feliz
