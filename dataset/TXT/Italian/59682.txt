First and foremost the food was great!  Well done with the pasta!  

The service was half and half. What I mean by that is some of the employees are very professional and the other half are subpar.  I believe in being good with your craft and some are not. 

I say at the bar which I usually do and when I walked up it was not cleaned from the last party that was there. It didn't take long for the bartender to clear it from the last bartender that was on shift. 

I also witnessed some of the waiters/servers clowning around in the entry area. Kind of annoying... also had another server pacing behind me waiting to clear her check or something. She was loud and annoying in a place that is generally quiet. 

Besides all this I enjoyed myself and blame it on this one occasion. Most of the time Maggiano's is legit. I feel this was a one off, just ok, experience.
