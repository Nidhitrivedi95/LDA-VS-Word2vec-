jluEI1ZDQDeJlbl-M3YH3Q Actually I would give 5 for food 2 for service.   Lets start with our food I ordered Tagliolini Verdi del toula the white cream sauce was so delicious and the home pasta was to die for and the pancetta made this so yummy.  My hubby ordered Ravioli collata.  The flavors burster when you are the homemade ravioli.  The robiola cheese and smoked ricotta with pancetta made us want more.   Our server was so helpful and made our meal interesting with fun facts about the area. But it stopped after our meal.  We ordered our desserts and at a same time a wedding party of about 20 people came in.  This is where the manager screwed up.  They were expected but there was not enough wait staff to handle them.  There was the greeter, our server and his asst.  But what happened one of our desserts we ordered was not available.  According to the manager after waiting 30 minutes he told me they did not have it and gave me an alternative. He gave it to me free but I think our whole dessert ordered should have been free from our coffee, tea and my husband's tirimsu. So I would avoid ordering ricotta cheese cake. This was all on the manager we watched others in the dining room wait once the wedding party came.  They were not prepared for this big group and the rest of us suffered.  It took us over an hour to receive our desserts. With no coffee or tea refills while we waited.
