ui8KERxCwlx8B5vWvpXxqg My wife and I have been to this Hawthorne's a few times, and though they've always been good, our first visit was noteworthy for being perfectly executed.

Excellent service: the waitstaff has a good knowledge of the menu and is able to answer questions and make recommendations when you're not sure about your selection. Consistently quick with bringing food to the table, clearing dishes, and taking drink orders. Great waitstaff are great for NOT being noteworthy, they just make the meal progress and everything happens at the right time, with very little fuss.

The pies are excellent, try the special-white (ricotta, pesto, sundried tomatoes), and the plate of meatballs as an appetizer. The food has been consistently better than most other pizza places in the area.

The beer selection is good, with a couple options on the list for beer-snobs, and not unreasonably priced.
