ii9kqE9s4456Jn9asz-BPQ First time in Montreal we decided to go here for a pizza,The location, decor were great and service was good. The waiter was friendly but when accidentally we broke a plate he didn't bring us a new one. Also they had an empty table when we arrived there but when we asked for a table at patio first they offered us a tall table set  under the lamp with a lot of flying things around it. 
Both appetizer and pizza were good but not excellent.
