SzTK3GPoFIkb6k322f1Mmw I originally tried this place when visiting Pinetop. We were very pleased with the food and service and I was happy to find out they have them here as well.

I went here on Sunday evening with the family around 5:30. I was put off first by the fact that you have to order right away at a register , as mentioned in the previous post. The other location had waiter service, and this was what I was hoping for. You also have to refill your own drinks. The concept just does not match the theme and decor of the restaurant, this was a big disappointment. We had to go over the menu off to the side, and then I became more upset to see that they do not offer the sliced meatballs as a topping, which is why I came. Oh well...we already here.

We ordered the cheesy garlic bread ($4) 2 medium pizzas, one with pepperoni and grilled chicken, and the other with pepperoni and italian sausage, and 3 drinks. The bill came to a little over $36...not too bad. 

The cheesy bread they have here is good...however this time it was served too soft. They did not leave it in the oven long enough and it was like melted cheese sitting on a cold baguette. The pizza was yummy and we all enjoyed it and actually had a little left over.

I really preferred the other location and was not happy with the way this one is set up. I will not go out of my way to come here...but would return if I was in the area.
