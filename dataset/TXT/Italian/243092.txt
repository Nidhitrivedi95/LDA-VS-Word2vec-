uOJ87zqbU1MtShCSHDkiyw I come from an Italian house who take food very seriously so when I read some of the good review I was expecting good food. To my surprise it seems I should have paid more attention to the negative ones. Again I come from new Haven , CT where some of the best Italian food is and I can assure you I know fresh good Italian food and this was not it. Calamari should be light flour seasoned batter and what I was served was an onion ring type batter which was a bit oil saturated drenched in a type of mayonnaise. I also had  gnocchi alla vodka where there gnocchi was under cooked and sauce was just OK  a bit bitter. But I will say the most disgraceful thing was the seafood bisque it was no more than tomato soup with a single shrimp in the center . Seafood bisque should be creamy rich and vibrant also should have traces of seafood lol. !!!
