GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA From reading a large amount of the reviews on here, I am getting that a lot of people who are going to the Phantom of the Opera or some other show in the Venetian, come to this restaurant. 

Made a reservation on open table because I figure it would be busy on a Friday night at 5:15pm. It was not. Had dinner with the wife and another married couple. We like most people on here had tickets to a 7pm show, so we were kind of on a time constraint. 

The decor was elegant and had nice dark wood throughout. The menu to me read as this "foo foo poo poo w/ a side of fennel something or other". It was kind of tough to figure out what most of the stuff was on the menu. This is not their fault. It is mine for not speaking Italian. One could translate on their smart-phone if need be. I, instead was sketchy and chose something that might taste good. When the food arrived, it was great.

The waitress was knowledgeable about the wines and made us feel at ease for not knowing what a lot of the items were. She answered our questions without the attitude of "omg, how do these ruffians not know what these dishes are?!" That was a great feeling. 

I would come back to this restaurant again. I only took one star off for the amount of money we had to spend for food. Wife and I shared a meal, one salad, two cups of coffee, and one small dessert and it costs us just under $100 with tip.
