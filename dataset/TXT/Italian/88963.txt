e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw This is the place!. Indeed, this is the place to dine when you want to do it in class and style. I enjoyed this restaurant so much on a previous trip that this time, I brought my wife here to celebrate our anniversary. She enjoyed it immensely as well and can't wait to return. 

With a nod to Old Blue Eyes, the sweet songs of Sinatra greet you as soon as you enter the welcoming hostess at the entrance. While there, linger a moment and appreciate Frank's awards and trophies - and some choice photos - adorning the wall.

The dining room is as exquisite as they come. The chairs so comfortable that if you lean back, you just might fall asleep. The soft music of Frank's many hits continues to play in the background as you settle into your seat and, by candlelight, examine a menu fit for kings and queens. 

I opted for Frank's Spaghetti and Clams, which was one of Sinatra's favorites. I can see why. It was outstanding. I added some parmesean asparagus on the side and lemme tell you....if you don't like asparagus, you'll love this. It almost tasted like some kind of pizza! 

We capped it off with an amazing dessert. I wish I could remember exactly what it was called but it really doesn't matter because they all looked good. It was so nice how they fancied the tasty dessert up with a warm "Happy Anniversary" message on the plate (see photo). 

I should mention that everyone we encountered at the restaurant seemed to know we were celebrating and wished us a happy anniversary at every turn. There was even a nice card on the table when we arrived. How nice is that?

We love this place and can't wait to hurry back.
