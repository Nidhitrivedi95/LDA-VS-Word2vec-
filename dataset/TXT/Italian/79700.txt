D1lAVtlav4atQTJnIvtcpw Decor was on point with cute chandeliers and a "farm to table" feel. Great location located downtown near the CN Tower. Staff was attentive and quick. My Linguine di Mare entree was flavorful and the fresh pepper added a nice kick - yum! Unfortunately, the calamari (extremely salty), tiramisu (watery???), and cheesecake (ridiculously tart) were not what I expected.
