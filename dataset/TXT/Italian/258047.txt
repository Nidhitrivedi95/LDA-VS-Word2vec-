Luckily, we went family-style, so we ordered a number of items from the menu - all amazing.  From the get-go, we were super hungry, so we ordered the Fiorentina pizza for an appetizer while we contemplated the rest of the (huge) menu.  I guess I didn't realize just how large 16" is (there's a joke in there somewhere), but I was surprised by how big the pie was when it came out; the 6 of us dug in.  The flavor was a perfect meld of hot, cheesey, pesto-y goodness.  We then also ordered the chicken parmigiana, pasta sorrento, and pasta alla panna.  I know a lot of other Yelpers have said the chicken parm was their favorite, and while it was very good, I think the other dishes were incredible.  The pasta sauces were light but packed immense flavor and left me wanting 2nd servings, even though I was stuffed.  And we got the house white (pinot grigio) and house red (pinot noir), which were both very drinkable for $25.  

The location (strip mall behind the Harris Teeter) leaves something to be desired, but once inside, you feel the love and atmosphere of Italy.  Our waitstaff was very attentive, and our server did an amazing job of splitting checks (no easy feat with bottles of wine, one pregnant lady, and someone else ordering a healthy salad on their own).  I can't wait to go back!
