9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Went for lunch on a Sunday. No line, no wait, fast service. This review is based on my first visit to Cibo. The ambiance is great. Very cozy indoors and garden dining outside. Best part of the visit was the atmosphere. Cheese and basil pizza came out to the table quick. I found lacking in flavor. No pepper, garlic, olive oil, or herbs in the sauce. Yet with the complete absence of seasoning, it was packed with salt. Also had the frittata which was had a nice texture and eggs were cooked perfectly. However, again, lacked seasoning.  I asked for ketchup and tabasco and mixed it together for a spicy ketchup that saved the dish. I was disappointed they didn't have a homemade ketchup or other homemade sauce for the eggs and potatoes. I would go back on a nice day because this is a charming corner garden in which to sit outside with an iced tea and sandwich.
