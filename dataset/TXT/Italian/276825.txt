yGd87bkFijZ6YHrHtW5maA We had two orders the yellow curry. I've had Thai currys all around the US. The taste was wonderful but...

The serving was almost entirely yellow curry sauce. I estimate they was less than a half pound COMBINED of onions, carrots, and pork. It ess decidedly heavy on  sauce and sorry of contents!

I certainly do NOT recommend this location. However, if that put more substance into their curry dishes, I might reconsider but I"m not paying to sample it.
