I still love it.  I had Carpaccio and Veal Tagliatelli, and a Barbersco Piemonte.

Me and my journal, and a little baroque music.  The only issue?  Well, the Cleveland Cavaliers were playing -- and some patrons were louder than I would have liked.  I wish they'd get rid of the TV.  This would rapidly become the place I chill after work...

Actually, I still prefer my flat...  :)
