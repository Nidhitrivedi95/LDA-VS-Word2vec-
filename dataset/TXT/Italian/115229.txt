GQAvKHDfuBws7312iIqX6Q We've been going here for years.  Bought a Groupon last month and went to use it.  Was told  they had new owners and were not taking Groupons purchased prior the new owner buying the restaurant.  Then we found out this was told to us by THE NEW OWNER, who went on to say, "The prior owner, my brother, sitting over there with his family (a table filled with about 8 people) signed up with Groupon.  I don't take the ones he signed up for."  

He did agree to take $5 off our total bill.  We were there so decided to stay, though not thrilled!  

Buono's pizza has ALWAYS been our families favorite.  But on this night, it was just "ok", nothing special.  Much less sauce and cheese on the pie.  To make matters worse, both my husband & I had terribly upset stomachs that night!  

Won't be going back unfortunately.
