pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg Came here with my family and my girlfriends family as we love the Carmine's in NYC and love family style Italian.  Food was good but not comparable to the Carmine's in NYC.  Tempted to give this place two stars for the terrible service, but the manager was very nice and took 10% off our bill.  Server brought out our food and then disappeared for 30-45 minutes and did not return to table until I brought it to the managers attention.  Unacceptable!
