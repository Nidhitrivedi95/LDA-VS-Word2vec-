SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog Hmm.. well, this left me a little confused. Maybe not good enough for four stars but slightly better than three. It is a typical old school New York style Italian restaurant, as it is apparent from the name. The decor is dated but I think that is intentional, which is cool. We were a large party of 12 and our waitress was pretty good with the service. They brought out the bread and salad and they were quite great. They were incredibly fresh and who doesn't like whole black olives in their salad? Seriously. 

We started placing our orders and after about 20 minutes of deliberation, I decided to get the Baked Rigatoni with chicken. I thought the sauce was pretty great with abundant garlic.. just the way I like it. The chicken however, left much to be desired. I found myself trying to eat all of the chicken as quickly as possible to get it out of the way so that I don't accidentally take a bite of the pasta with chicken in it. I don't know how it would've tasted with sausage or shrimp, but I would just stick to the pasta with absolutely no meat in it, if I were to return. One of my friends ordered meatballs and she absolutely hated it. She thought the sauce was too sweet and ended up barely eating any of what she ordered. The rest of the party, however,  seemed to enjoy their food. 

I thought it was alright overall.. not terribly disappointing, neither was it a memorable meal. Undecided at this point if I would return.
