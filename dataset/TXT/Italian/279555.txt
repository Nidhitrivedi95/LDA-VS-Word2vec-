Well, maybe not so hidden since we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table even with a reservation, but this place really does look like a "hole in the wall".  I've been to Vegas several times and had never heard of this place even though it was steps from the strip.

The decor is kind of cheesy, but the service was impeccable and the food was absolutely delicious.  And seriously, all you can drink wine, garlic bread, soup/salad and side of pasta with every entree for under $30??   That's one of the best deals anywhere, let alone Vegas.

I got the sauteed salmon... the fish was really fresh and the sauce on it was delicious.  Tried bites of a lot of my friends pasta dishes.  Absolutely everything I tried was outstanding.  I really wasn't expecting much of the food... I kind of thought this was going to be more of a cool experience than anything else.  I was very pleasantly surprised.

The accordion player was absolutely adorable also.
