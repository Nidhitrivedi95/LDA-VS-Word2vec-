53BSdnhzcCBfBH_6TgX63Q It was very disappointing to order from this restaurant. I was a visitor in the city and my hotel had their flyer in the lobby as one of the restaurants that delivers. The food quality wasn't very good. I ordered Mango Habanero sauce for my chicken wings order, and it tasted no where near a spicy mango flavor. The taste was sweet and spicy BBQ sauce. I don't care for the BBQ flavor, so it was disappointing to smell and taste the sauce.
I also ordered what it said as pistachios cannolis. Surprisingly it was no where near pistachios. It was frozen solid, with green coloring on both ends of the cannoli. No pistachios or nuts of any kind in the cannoli, except for the green food coloring and some chocolate chips . I opened the frozen cannoli and the filling tasted chalky. I am not sure of the ingredients. In the end, the only good thing that was edible was the side salad that I ordered. Despite my order was simple that consisted of 6 wings, 2 cannoli and a side salad, it came up to $19 and change!!!!!??? I wouldn't recommend it to any visitors to the area. The prices didn't match the quality.
