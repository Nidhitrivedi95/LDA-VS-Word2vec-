pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA I can't believe I never left a review. It was a little expensive and there was some waiting, the place is a bit small but it's a small business so what do I expect. The pizzas were great, exotic (not weird) and definitely not the generic pizza you get at your local pizza franchise. I ate till I could eat no more so I can definitely say I enjoyed it and I got to meet the owner and chief who was very nice. I went there a while ago...I gotta remember to go again.
