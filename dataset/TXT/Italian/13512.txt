18NP-qL3VIJEBJGpns7aTw So excited to have a good sit-down option in Laveen where I can take my kids and have a nice, family dinner.  We've been two times since it opened, including opening night.  I've been pleased with the quality of service and the food each time.  I've always liked Barro's Pizza, and I'm glad there's a local option now instead of just national chains.  I was also beyond pleased at their prices.  We'll definitely enjoy having this Barro's so close!
