HKsDnEbwZ6DYKqEWtVdWJQ Loved this wonderful place.  The food was truly Italian from Italy, the bolgonese was really good rich and had that wonderful slow cooked flavor. The stuffed spinach gnocchi appetizer was I think the best gnocchi I've ever had, don't miss it!!!  The ciopinno was good but different then I've had in the past, it had a whole lobster tail in it but not brothy at all.  The wine was good and great service from our waitress Tanya.  The owner stopped by and chatted with us about the homemade pasta from scratch, delicious!!! Will definitely be back again
