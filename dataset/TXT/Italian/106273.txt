fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg This place was very good.
I try to avoid carbs at night and they have low carb pasta.
Normally that rules out noodles, pasta for dinner, but
I had the bolognese with sausage and it was great - Tofu pasta tastes pretty similar to al-dante pasta
But it does get very crowded so reservations a must
One of our friends tried to go with no reservations and they waited over 1 hour
