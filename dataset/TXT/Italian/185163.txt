Ojw5eTqzbv6k27_Df3q0-A Wow this place is awful. I came here after hearing good things about it from a few people. BF and I were both sorely disappointed. The service was good and the ambiance was nice, but the food was bad and overpriced.

1) Our bread was NOT cooked! Seemed pillow-y at first look, but was literally dough once you bit into it.

2) I ordered a chicken pasta dish, and the chicken was breaded and fried. This was not mentioned on the menu (had it been, I wouldn't have ordered it), and I have never had Italian food that had FRIED food in the pasta. Needless to say, it was pretty terrible.

3) BF's dish was mediocre at best. We paid ~$40 for 2 pasta dishes and one soda. 

Maybe we ordered the wrong things or went on a bad day, but I'm not willing to go again to find out. For Italian food that's barely mediocre, this place is way overpriced. Save your money and your stomach and go elsewhere.
