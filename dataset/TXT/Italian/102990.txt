fl34c5BlCWmSL_BQk-cnaQ This is usually my favorite sandwich place. Went in today and they changed the bags that you order on. Removed the skinny option and no hot or cold option. I asked about the skinny option and they said just write it on the bag. Didn't ask about the hot or cold and got my sandwich back toasted, which I hate. Then I heard them tell someone else they are all toasted now and you have to ask for cold. Again, why not leave the option on the bag along with the skinny option if you have to ask for things still? Doesn't make sense.
