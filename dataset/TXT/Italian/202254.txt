q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Visited Capo's on Sahara for dinner last Friday. We were seated toward the front where the bar area is, which was disappointing as I wanted the more formal, romantic atmosphere of the dining room. So I know in the future to request a dining room table.

We ordered the antipasto appetizer, but it arrived without cheese. HUH?! How does one NOT put cheese on an antipasto? Isn't that like Italian Cooking 101? The meats, lettuce and balsamic dressing were wonderful, but it needed the cheese for balance. After what seemed to be a communication issue with our server, to where he actually told me that the dish does not come with cheese ... I then showed him the description on the menu which clearly stated "meats AND cheeses".  Only then did he seem to get it, apologize, and offer to get us another. We both had the Pasta Fagioli soup and enjoyed it very much along with the yummy bread basket.

I enjoyed Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata Rigatoni with spicey garlic sauce. I also ordered a meatball (really good), which was initially forgotten and no doubt was off cavorting somewhere with my lost antipasto cheeses.  But our waiter fetched me a meatball and I was happy. My date enjoyed his cheesey mushroom ravioli dish, although it seemed a little overcooked and pasty to my taste.

The Tiramisu was delicious with an after-dinner espresso to kick my energy level back up to pre-pasta levels.

All in all, Capo's is a different kind of dining experience and their food is good, but I was not wow'd.  Would probably return, but not in any hurry to do so, and must remember to request the dining room next time.
