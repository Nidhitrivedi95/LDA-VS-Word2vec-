Time has stood still in this place. The walls are decorated in pictures of Frank Sinatra,  Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop, Marilyn Monroe and many more. Lovely Italian music fills the room. It's funny how these song are so recognizable when you hear them. There was also a tiki bar out back that we all ventured out to see when we spotted the giant gorilla. We finally all got settled into our booth ready for our midnight feast. The menu is everything Italian you can imagine. We got garlic cheese bread, lasagna, giant raviolis, fettuccine and one pound pasta bowls!  We ate until we could eat no more. The food was fresh and tasty. The staff were so friendly and fun. I saw a small stage where the band plays nightly. Oh how fun that would be to see. I felt like I was in the Moonstruck movie eating dinner with the Castorini's.
