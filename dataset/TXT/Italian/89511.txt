E0YuuRpK_4RpaUF7JK3mhg Good food.  The problem was the service.  The guys working the room were well-meaning and personable, but there was one guy working the bar and one guy working the whole floor!  

The room was full and there the one guy had to greet and seat people and answer phones at the host stand, bus tables, run food, and take orders.  He just couldn't do it.  The bartender jumped out to help but for me if you have to constantly be looking around for a waiter, wait for food or drink or checkbacks, the spell of the meal is broken no matter how good the vittels.

Another big problem is the room itself.  It faces west so as the sun sets in the evening, it blasts through the windows.  I was hot and blind throughout the meal.

That said, it's a little local joint with good grub (and the worst wine list ever!  my wine was around 90 degrees.  had to throw a few ice cubes in there to make it drinkable.) so I'll round up from 2.5 to 3 stars.
