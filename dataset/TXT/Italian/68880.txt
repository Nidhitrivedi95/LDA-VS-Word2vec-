bUGtQAzsJ8Z-Y8vBtY6aPQ Normally I don't write negative reviews, however, it bugs me that everyone is raving about this place on Yelp and Facebook.  Apparently there are not many people in Fountain Hills that have had good pizza.  I tried this place right after they opened and took one bite of the pizza and threw it away.  There was no sauce, the sausage was super greasy and tasted awful!  I thought maybe my experience was just while they were working out the kinks.  So.... I tried them again last week and it was just as gross!  Still, no sauce, weird sausage, cheap pepperoni.  And, above all that, it was so greasy, it melted a hole in the bottom of the pizza box....who wants to put that in their stomach???? I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because the restaurant was very clean and I love the remodel.  But they will not be getting a third chance from me!
