lvv9Vv_5i4IwvDdofO_rKg we were on our way to the ACC for the raptors game and decided to stop in here for a bite to eat.

my first time here, and i was pleasantly happy with the service, the food and the price of our meal.

the server was very patient with us as we changed our mind many times on what we wanted, and didn't make a single mistake.

we had pasta, with the mozzarella balls and the tiramisu.
the pasta was really fresh, i was very happy with the portion, it wasn't 'american size' and i didn't leave there feeling stuffed and actually had room for the tiramisu!
the mozzarella balls were good, but too oily and i couldn't finish the portion because it actually started to hurt my stomach after a while.
the tiramisu was flavourful and rich, but not the best that i've had in Toronto!
