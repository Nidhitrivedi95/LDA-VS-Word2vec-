mJ_ucQ2_3hfTsmCcKb-hgw Visiting in town and ended up in Market Square for dinner. Decided on trying Sienna.  Good food, but I had to ask for a server to take our drink order. By that time, we had also placed our order. Once again, the food took way to long to be served. Service staff was cordial,but distracted. Had to ask for our check as well. Probably would not recommend.
