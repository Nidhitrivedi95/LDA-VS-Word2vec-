OXrFWgoz533T8tMRemkiww What a great time! They have a fantastic outdoor patio in the back that is beautiful. Homemade pastas and great wine selection!!  We haven't been here in a while - normally we'd get a wood fired delicious pizza but we went for the homemade pastas instead.  Gnocchis were fluffy delightful clouds - delicious!!!  Standout was the homemade cavitellis with the sweet fennel sausage meatballs - WOW!!  So good.  Our waitress was attentive and absolutely adorable!  Too full for dessert but we'll be back!!
