I have to agree with Nicole on the pepperoni, feta, mozzarella ...it's a perfect combo. Thin crispy crust is their standard and I can see why.
Also tried the Combo and loved it on the thin crust, but  my favorite item on the menu is the trio of meatballs-YUM!  They have the meatball making down pat.  I could go in there and just have the meatballs and bread....if I absolutely had to. The meatballs come in  marinara with hot bubbly cheese melted and just browned.
