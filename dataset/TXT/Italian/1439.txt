-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q After seeing La Piazza al Forno consistently listed in the Valley's top pizza joints by numerous outlets, I decided to try it out before an event on the West side.

My friend and I arrived around 6:30 on a Wednesday evening expecting a dinner crowd, but to my surprise there was only one other table of guests!  I have to say, you cannot beat the wine prices - $5-9/glass.  We shared a spinach salad, which was so-so.  Next, the Margherita D.O.C. pizza with carmelized onions.  Unfortunately, the onions weren't carmelized, just slightly cooked.  I'm not sure if there was a mix-up in the kitchen or somebody back there doesn't know what carmelized onions are...  I felt like the bottom of the pizza was a bit soggy in contrast with the charred crust edges.  The flavors were there, but the execution could've been improved.  We couldn't resist the zeppolis (pillows of fried dough covered with powdered sugar - see pic) for dessert.  So good!  

Overall, we were content with the food and the fast service.  I think La Piazza al Forno is a solid choice for pizza in the Glendale area, but did not make my Top 5 Valley Pizza Joints.
