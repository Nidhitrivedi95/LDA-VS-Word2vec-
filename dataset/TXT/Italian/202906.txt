q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ About 6 months back at a concierge event for work, I won a $50 gift card to Capo's. I had dined here once previously so I was pretty stoked to have a chance to go again. Also I enjoy when local places are willing to donate meals to other local establishments or events. 
The first time I came here, the secret door threw me way off. I won't say too much and ruin in. I will say enjoy it, and play along. This time, I had my 16 year old step son and he was confused and thought we took him to a closed gangster establishment. His reaction was worth it alone. 
The lighting is dim, and your menus come with small lights for those who may not be able to see the menu in the dark. (ie: me) There is live entertainment, and a cheesy mob boss who is kind of hanging out and running things. Although he is very involved and I don't believe he sees himself as cheesy one bit. The godfather is playing in the background. (Last time it was Casino) There is even a man selling roses. They go all out with the old school speakeasy type of vibe. 
The service was mediocre, don't get me wrong our waitress was pleasant. But slow, and un-attentive. Our drinks went empty and the bread basket was out, often. 
The food however made up for it. Meatballs and peppers appetizer is a must. The meatballs are a good quality meat that melt in your mouth the way they should. Just the right amount of spice lingers on your tongue leaving you hungrier than when you arrived. The pasta in all the dishes seemed like they were made in house. The bread and cheeses were fresh and authentic, and the salad came with a great house dressing. I didn't like the cheesecake, but unless its straight from NY or Cheesecake Factory, I usually don't. 
Overall, its high priced, but the atmosphere helps out and easily makes this a great place for a date night or special occasion.
