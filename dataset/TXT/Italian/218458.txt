S1zlGFu9fi5-QmVpGqsKsA If there were 0 stars if be ok with that. Cold eggplant appetizer with mozzarella that had clearly been nuked several minutes earlier. The spinach salad was fine. My black squid ink pasta with seafood was an amazing display of bleached old seafood and rubbery scallops. So gross. My husband's drink with the hot pink lipstick on the glass was really outstanding. This is right up there with the worst C rated restaurants in NY. Stay away if you value your taste buds and internal organs.
