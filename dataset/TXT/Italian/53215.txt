a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w First timer with this place. My friend said he's been eating here since he was a little one. We pigged out and got a pepperoni and olive pizza, pasta salad, chicken martini and a cannoli, to try bites of everything. Well, EVERYTHING was delicious! Most places are hit or miss with their pizza etc.. Not disappointed whatsoever!! We had it delivered for convenience and I would love to know what it's like going in and sitting down!! Fat & happy currently (:
