POJL-N7Smw1UZMP_xldFwg My hubby and I were craving for good pizza after vaughan mills. Didn't want to go to Marcello again so found this gem based on other yelp reviews! Glad we did but yelpers weren't kidding about the space being small! Only 4-5 tables and some bar seats. They might have changed their menus ... I didn't see any desserts or kale salad as posted in pictures :(:( 

Service:
- Welcoming at the cashier 
- Not sure if i caught them on a bad night but given the amount of tables. I still had to sit in front of dirty dishes from prior party for a good 5 to 10 mins. 
- I saw my pizza on the counter waiting to be served for a good 5 10 mins so when served it was just warm
- it's somewhat of a do it yourself/ get it yourself vibe which is fine 

Food:
- amazinnnnng 
- we had funghi pizza, rigatoni, panzanella salad
- the funghi pizza was delish even though it could be hotter. It was as described, lots of diff mushrooms and the dough was so soft and yummy! PLUS it even had truffle oil drizzled! I am a sucker for truffle oil! 
- the rigatoni was also very good. The braised beef was so good!! Hubby thought the pasta was a bit under cooked but I thought it was just right.
- the salad wasn't special but it was still good. All ingredients tasted fresh 

Overall:
- generous portions across the dishes 
- reminds me of a smaller scale via cibo but I actually better prefer this place's pizza and pasta (via cibo has better salads) 
- will come back again if in the area
- go early or expect to wait for seats
