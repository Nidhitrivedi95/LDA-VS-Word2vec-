dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw As many of my followers know, I am notorious for leaving tips on Yelp, but tonight I felt Fiamma deserved a real review! At least the bar (where I have spent the evening).  Hands down, some of the most hard working, fun, energetic and funny dudes in Vegas! John, Dragon and the infamous Kerry. WOW! You three are amazing! Non stop action and you guys move and work effortlessly, all while maintaining a smile. Making a the guests feel important and involved in conversation: we know that's what motivates guests to stay longer / want to come back ASAP. Kerry is beyond thoughtful, engaging and pays attention to EVERY detail. He certainly deserves recognition.  Overall - I'd recommend this bar to any/all of my Yelp friends out there!!!!
