r7IvPMyza853adkAvi1RNQ This is a sports bar & grill. I missed the happy hour which had some really great deals on drinks. I came in the late evening and ordered a linguine dish and it was good. I'm giving it 4/5 stars because the service is AMAZING! It is family run and they are very nice and attentive. 

They custom made my father's dish just to his specifications. They give plenty of complementary bread and you don't even have to ask them to bring it out, they just do it. I found this strange, but in a good way, they're open 24/7. Wow.
