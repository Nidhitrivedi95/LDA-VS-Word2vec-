In a bustling part of town, it wasn't difficult to find a nearby bar to kill a bit of time. The lovely hostess assured us that she would text us once our table was ready. 

The service was great, especially for a busy Friday night. We had a pasta dish and a burger and split the two entrees between us. Overall, more than enough food with just enough flavour.

I'd return to try a pizza...or the pumpkin and sage ravioli!
