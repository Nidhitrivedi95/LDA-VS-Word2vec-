zZAAiNGU2ySMvAlYbvvchg This place attracts some interesting characters!  Once we were seated close to the front window (the rest of the place is quite dark), a woman reading nearby asked us if more people would be arriving at our table, and informed us that she wanted "to avoid noise" and promptly relocated to a "quiet" area. Another woman promoting herself as a public health nurse confronted my friend in the washroom, accusing her of not washing her hands properly (apparently my friend's paper-towel-ready prep was completely unacceptable).

Nutters aside, this place is quite laid back and the service is friendly. The seafood was all good, which is a main priority for me, and my friend kindly indulged me. We ordered a variety of apps instead of entrees to get a better sense of what this place has to offer.  We used a Groupon discount voucher but I didn't feel that compromised the service or quality in any way. If I came here again I'd try the pasta, but it seems like this place has a lot to offer all around.
