7S5iOI5Xb9cTUQLmBwCeXw Went for dinner Thursday night, excellent food and service!  Easy going, quiet atmosphere.  Used my Groupon coupon, but will definetly be back again.  Reasonably priced for a good meal!  City North is a tough area for businesses to survive and The Skinny Italian Kitchen is doing well despite the location, glad you're in business and going strong!  Will let all my friends and co-workers know :)
