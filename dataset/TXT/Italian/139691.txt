JG26f5Ppxvmz1EP6nh2WkQ It's a cozy spot with one of the best chef tables in the city. It's intimate and cozy with some superb design elements. But what makes Cafe Bar Pasta special is the host, Tom and Chef Jay who seem to have this rhythm and connection. 

The feeling they convey is " Let me take care of you ". The food has a slight Asian edge to it but the core is Italian with classics like Puttanesca, Saltimbocca, gnocchi and table side carbonara. 

They have a great private dining space down below that can accompany a larger group of people. 

The wine list needs some editing but it has wines by the keg and some of the best local choices. 

So go to Dundas West and let Tom take care of you.
