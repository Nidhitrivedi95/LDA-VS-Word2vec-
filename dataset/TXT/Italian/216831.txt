rUy2MtHyFv8pI7FOW1DE8w I can't say enough wonderful things about this restaurant!' The pasta is home made  and cooked to perfection!  Al dente!   I had the bolognese which was amazing!!! The anti pasta course is a must!  The cheese is delightful and the meats are sliced thinly and to perfection allowing g the flavor to come thru.  The burrata is also a must.  Silky & creamy served with peppery arugula.  But most importantly, the chef & wait staff are some of the loveliest people in the world!  Jen was our server who was very attentive and sweet'. Chef thoughtfully chose all of our meals & deserts! In fact creating a customized desert of mouse & house made ice cream along with tiramisu so that we could try it all on our first visit!  BRAVO PINO!!' We will be back!!
