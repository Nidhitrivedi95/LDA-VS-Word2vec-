zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g Food is exceptional. Ambiance is slightly less than you'd expect given the quality of food.  Then you hang out for 5 min and realize the service and fare are sensational and create a causal understated ambiance that makes you wish everywhere was like this. 
Whether pizza or entree you can't go wrong. Presentation taste and quality are top notch. Half off happy hour is 3-6.  Great bar and wine list. 
Give them a try. You won't be disappointed.
