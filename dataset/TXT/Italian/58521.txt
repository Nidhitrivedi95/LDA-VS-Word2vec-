aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA Got the Oregano's favorite salad "to go" - extremely disappointed with the amount of toppings on it, A very very small amount compared to the amount of lettuce that was underneath. 


Frankly, I could've gone to Chop Shop to get the skimpy toppings but I chose Oregano's because I had a really good experience with their yummy pizza the other day. 

And to the girl that answered the phone, do you really have to speak so fast that I cannot understand a word you say? It's 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the place wasn't packed when I got there. 

Disappointing!
