v5YvCuj_b26JKAqDcnReFQ We're just out traveling around and have been on the road for three weeks. We decided to try Evan's based on the previous reviews here and, boy, are we happy! Wait service, atmosphere, food quality, and value for$ are all great. Serving size was large, I couldn't finish and that's VERY unusual for me. We split Mississippi Mud Pie for desert and it was good too. Just go there!
