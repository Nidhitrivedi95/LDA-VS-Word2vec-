2Zeh89IUg7T4dUFjRfqtdg I live in Scottsdale most of the year (except summer) and this place is a favorite for the locals. They're pizza is good, fresh and made from scratch. Family-owned and operated, good service and a deli/market is also there. I buy cheeses and meats there to use at home when I cook Italian (my heritage as well). Very cozy, long-time established place. Love the cheesecake too. They also have hilarious tees you can purchase...good place to dine casually.
