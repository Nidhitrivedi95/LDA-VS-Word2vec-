OMf69ePEdHXvaqAlCCI01A Stumbled upon this place after we checked in to the Boulders Resort not far from here and, boy, am I glad we did.  The cheese ravioli is delicious, especially if you're a garlic lover!  The homemade breadsticks are fabulous and you MUST try the homemade balsamic vinaigrette dressing.      Only reason I didn't give it a perfect rating is because my meal was just warm when it arrived to me (my husband's meal was steaming) and became cold very quickly.  I wish we could bring this restaurant home because it would totally be in the dinner rotation!
