yLrCSSrSnpxB-0ZEPt19jA I ordered an eggplant parm sandwich and fries for delivery. They came a half hour faster than Grub Hub estimated, which was great, and the delivery guy was friendly. My sandwich was HUGE--I'm talking twice the size of any other eggplant parm I'd ever had before, must have been 12 inches--but it was little soggy and wasn't very flavorful. The fries were a huge portion as well, though they were soggy too, but this could be because they were delivery. 

For the price and convenience, this place is pretty okay! I'll still be searching for that perfect eggplant parm hero though...
