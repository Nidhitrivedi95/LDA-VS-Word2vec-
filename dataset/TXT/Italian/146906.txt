k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw We were in Las Vegas last week for NFR and I read on the back of a magazine that this was a place to try.  We were driving back to our hotel and saw it so decided to stop in for a late lunch.  The place is very old school and the food was outstanding.  I am Italian so I am pretty picky about what Italian food I eat.  I would recommend the lasagna and the meatball sandwich for lunch.  Great flavor and good size portions.  If we would have had time, we would have gone back for dinner to try the antipasta.  Will be back next year for NFR and will come back!  We sat at the bar and had no problems with the service.  The waitress was very friendly.
