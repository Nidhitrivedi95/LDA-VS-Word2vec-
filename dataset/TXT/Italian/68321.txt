BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Local Bistro is one of my favorite places. Whether I go with my family or just with my husband we always have a great time. The atmosphere is casually upscale, yet laid back enough that you can bring children (although ours are older and usually well behaved). Some of our favorite dishes are the clams, bolognese, chicken parmigiano, and the Spanish risotto. Sadly, I dream about some of these dishes, they are that good. Brian is our waiter of choice. He's absolutely great. And lastly the wine list is very good and the prices are extremely reasonable. We love Local Bistro!
