G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I really enjoyed Giada's. She's one of my favorite food network chefs so being able to dine at her restaurant was definitely exciting. We sat and ate at the bar and still received attentive service. I really wish I remembered the bartenders name who was serving us he was seriously incredible. He made us amazing drinks and the cucumber martini he made me was SOOOO GOOD. He told us about how it's his own special recipe that he won a contest for. The food was really top notch. I had the lobster hash and was definitely not disappointed. Big chunks of fresh lobster, an amazing sunny side up egg, and fresh wholesome veggies. Absolutely loved it. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles that I also had a bite of and it was really freaking good. You can go wrong and the servers are always around to answer any questions you have. Everything is super clean, and the ambiance is so relaxing even though you're in Vegas. I'll definitely be back!
