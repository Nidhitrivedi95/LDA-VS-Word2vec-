yEgnxd3aUUgUoG7qJiuDlQ So apparently there is a statute of limitations on reviews here?! Yes, I would say our visit was about a year ago, maybe a bit more. As I just joined Yelp, I wasnt actually able to write a review on a site I WASNT YET A MEMBER OF. Are you going to delete all the good reviews that are more than six months old as well? And are u so blind that u didn't see how much I complimented the food. This is a very good demonstration of how bad your restaurant seems to be with people, even if it is good with food. Why on earth would I write a fake review that said 'one of the best composed dishes I've ever had'. I will happily give you my cell number if u want so you can respond like a man.
