RQ_sx6lNGVjSTtasK3wlQg After writing the review for this restaurant I felt like going for some of that veal parmesan. However my most recent visit has caused me to rate the restaurant with 3 stars, one less than my original rating. One of the minor reasons why I removed a star is because the free garlic bread wasn't as good as it used to be. However, that's not enough for me to remove a star. What the MAIN reason for my slight disappointment is the apple pie I ordered. This is the first time that I've ordered dessert at Uncle Joe's, because I've always been too full to have any. I really wish I hadn't. For an apple pie w/ ice cream that I'm paying $4.45 (somewhere around there) for, I really didnt expect to catch the waitress MICROWAVING my pie!! Instead of a crispy and flaky crust, the microwave made it soggy and unappealing. What was worse is how nonchalant she was about microwaving it. If you're going to do it, at least make sure that I don't catch you in the act. Very disappointed.

I will still return to have the dinner entrees, but never again will I be ordering dessert there. Never again.
