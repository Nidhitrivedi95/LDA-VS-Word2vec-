uOJ87zqbU1MtShCSHDkiyw I guess this part of town is becoming little Italy as this is just one of 6 or so Italian options in the area.

This is a locally owned non chain. As of late their bar at happy hour seems to be the place to be.

I have gone here for both lunch and dates. For lunch the place is strangely empty and it can be a bit awkward, but decent.

For dates it is great, the dining room has a classy quiet atmosphere. The bread with the sun dried tomato butter is great. 

If you hear about a special that sounds good ask the price as I was surprised by my $32 mahi mahi special on one trip. It was good however.

I typically opt for the ganocci al la vodka sans chicken. The al la vodka sauce is bright and has a luxurious mouth feel. The Gnocci have a great texture, with a nice chewy firmness that one expects in them.

The parking lot can get a bit crowed, so you may need to park closer to  Kohles.
