7qo6rqDjlHds8ObxzxBD4A I arrived at this establishment on a Friday around 7:30pm. Overall I was pretty impressed with the food, in which me and a group had ordered a large white pizza and garlic knots. The pizza was excellent and is comparable to somewhere such as Gilbert Pizza. However, the down side to this restaurant is the service. Every time I have made a visit here I have waited quite a bit of time to receive r any service. Expect to wait and plan your time accordingly, inside is a little cramped but this place makes you feel at home.
