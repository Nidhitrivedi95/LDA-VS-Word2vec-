First thing I ate was spaghetti and meetballs.
The serving is nice, presentation of the food exquisite. Ambient and atmosphere just amazing.
I got the food super fast and everything was fresh.
Warm fresh bread as an appetizer won me over.
Great place to take a date out or go with family.
Will be coming here alot. Definitely recommend :)
