-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw Love this restaurant!  From the crusty fresh hot bread to the yummy desserts, Brio is the best.  Our waiter, Danny, was phenomenal - great attitude, super customer service, very attentive and professional.  It was the perfect evening to sit outside, sip a cocktail, people watch and enjoy a good meal. Highly recommend!
