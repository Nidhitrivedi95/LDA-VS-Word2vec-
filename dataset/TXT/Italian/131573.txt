Dante was an inferno of judiciously prepared, exquisitely flavored and divinely delectable treats.  Four of us went, three had the special tasting menu (DO IT. PERIOD.) I of course betrayed myself and those around me, deciding to go it alone, be an obstinate troll and order off of the menu.  Fortunately, my choice was not regretted.  The tasting menus may or may not have changed our lives.  My assortment of comestibles was well crafted and overwhelming.

For being upscale, I believe the prices are actual quite reasonable.  $65 for the tasting (5 courses) or I believe $95 if you add in wine pairings throughout.  My 5 courses I picked out for myself came to about $65 as well, plus my drinks, so we all spent maybe $105, and rejoiced in and around our mouths, eyes, ears and intestines.

Our server was Andrew.  He was a blessing.  You should request him.

My SINGULAR complaint.. was... the polenta was served in a horse trough and could have fed a starving family of 5.  I believe that any guest would gladly pay the same price for 1/5 of the portion.  

But, the polenta was great.

TRY DANTE!  Invite happiness into your lives.  (My Moscow Mule was unreasonably delicious).
