nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ Yelp found us a wonderful place for Father's Day dinner as we began a two week road trip. Service was EXCEPTIONAL! Hilda was sweet and attentive as were the bussers. She even brought a small cannoli to my husband for dessert.

Food was great! You start with a little appetizer dish of peppers, olives and parm cheese chunks along with the best garlic knots ever. Could have stopped there. So good! And Hilda brought MORE!! Swordfish Siciliana was delicious - tender, juicy approx 8oz piece was plenty to share with capers, olives and tomatoes. We shared it along with the eggplant pizza which had a crispy thin crust and sliced eggplant and riccota. Lovely. Kid had what looked to be house made tortellini. Can't tell you much more than they disappeared quickly. 

Wonderful experience in Vegas, away from the drama of the strip.
