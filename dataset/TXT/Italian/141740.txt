The menu is extensive, but really unnecessary because there are so many great specials.  If it were my place, I would probably get rid of the regular menu and only offer the specials each night.  

The service is top notch - they take great pride in their work and know the food well.  We came with a group of 12 to celebrate a birthday and end of year team dinner and they did a great job in timing the meal so that we all ate together.  

Highlights were the special burrata and the pastas made in-house.
