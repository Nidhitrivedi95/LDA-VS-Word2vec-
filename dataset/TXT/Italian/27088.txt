4qQVf2lt-47VcQ4v54PEXQ I don't understand how this place doesn't have some kind of national recognition for their sandwiches. The Stromboli bread so so light and thin with a tender crunch. The Fiorentino combination of spinach, garlic and thinly cut chicken was perfection. You'd expect the chicken breast to be overcooked and dry. Not so here. If it couldn't get any better the homemade bread its served on ties it all together.
