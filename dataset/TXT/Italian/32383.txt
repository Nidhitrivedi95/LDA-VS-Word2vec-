5TXQxcwEfqzBDbMq2zmBPQ One of the BEST buffets of all time. The food is always fresh. I like the omelet/egg bar. You can get scrambled with whatever he has. I get mine with onions & cheese.. They usually have bacon & sausage as well as french toast. 

They also have a nice fresh fruit tray, cheese & crackers as well as some different breads. On the hot side they have a prime roast most of the time, with some other hot items as well. 

The desert bar is nice as well. The lemon cake is moist, flavorful and a nice way to cap off a great meal.. Most of the time they have chocolate covered strawberries.  

The staff are always nice and alert and friendly. 

The best $20 you'll spend in a long time. 

Dinner is also a excellent choice. I suggest the lamb chops!
