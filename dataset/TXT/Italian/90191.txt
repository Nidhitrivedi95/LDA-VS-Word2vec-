E9b73ETPw0VYUJ2_YSJJdQ I don't know what to say except that it was just OK.  I was a little disappointed because I had read/ heard so many good things about this place.  

I went there for lunch with three of my colleagues; we split two Rustica Salads and two Frutti Di Mare pizzas.  The salad was mostly mixed greens with just a few little olives in it and not much dressing and the pizza didn't have huge flavours like I would have expected.  They were kind of lean on the fish (and cheese) but the fish was fresh.  Again, just OK.

To be honest, the pasta dishes looked a lot more appealing.  The couple at the next table had ordered the Seafood Linguine and the Meatball Spaghetti and both looked delicious; they finished every last bite.

Service was great though; waitress was super friendly.  I will definitely go back and try something other than the pizza.
