VsHhy9ixEze-AxNYt6UxLA I found the food and especially the service disappointing.  Arrived at Crust at 5:45 on a Tuesday, seated ourselves, and waited 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us or brought menus.  Another 10 minutes passed before the server returned to take our beverage order.  After placing our order, my salad arrived in timely fashion, but the glass of wine still had not arrived.  The server scurried to bring it, and it arrived in a glass that appeared dirty--spotted, sticky, with drops of food crusted on the outside.  The server was very courteous but constantly seemed overwhelmed by the large number of tables he was attending.

The spinach salad with fresh strawberries and mushrooms proved pretty tasty and generous in (enough for two people, though it was the small size).  The NY style pizza (which actually is a half pizza with 4 large slices, though the menu describes it as a 20 inch round) was okay, though the sauce was lacking in flavor, and the crust was soggy.  

I would not come here again--too many superior similar options, including Mellow Mushroom, Humble Pie, Amaro Pizza and Vino, and Upper Crust Pizza and Wine Bar.
