wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw For many Gilbert residents, Postinos is the local equivalent to Boston's "Cheers"...a friendly pace where everybody knows your name, and the drinks are poured with a smile. The staff has genuine charisma, and the brunch is to die for (you haven't LIVED until you've indulged in mimosas and French toast--if today was my last day, I would eat that French toast three TIMES.) The ambience is sexy enough for an intimate, romantic date night, but it's also cheerful, fun, and open enough for a business lunch or a girls night out. Try Postinos for yourself today, you won't be disappointed.
