wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g We had a very tasty lunch at Canaletto. The $25 prix fixe menu was a great value. I ordered the salad, pizza, and black cherry gelato. The pizzas are large enough for two people and appear to be prepared in a brick oven. For the other entrees, they appeared to be fairly small; however, my parents indicated that the gnocchi were some of the best they've had. We intend to return there again during our stay at the Venetian. The ambiance is excellent, it is located very close to the gondolas and live entertainment started even at lunch time. The waiter was very pleasant and attentive. I would highly recommend for a relatively inexpensive three course meal with beverage included.
