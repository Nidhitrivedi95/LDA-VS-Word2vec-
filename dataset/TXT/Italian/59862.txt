AuIiqDeL65kczmiFSkAWrA I've been to several other locations so I was very excited to try this one. 

The layout is typical but I loved the high ceilings and the upstairs portion of the restaurant. It was a bit sad yet entertaining to see the continuous look of dread every time a server had to trek their way up those stairs with a handful of food. 

Our server was very nice and personable.  He suggested the ravioli dish that was on special that came with the truffle cream sauce.  I ordered this as well as the pepperoni risotto bites. The fried risotto bites were impeccable; best I've ever had anywhere.  The creamy red sauce was a nice touch as well. The ravioli special had a nice flavor but was missing some saltiness in the sauce. The ham was a nice touch but still lacked it that burst of flavor that salt would've helped provide. The cheesecake was very rich and creamy not to mention huge.  

Towards the end of the meal I found myself waiting a long with for refills, my to-go order, and the check. I was eager to leave at that point and get back to my travels but I guess the server enjoyed my company. 

I would still recommend this place to folks looking for a good Italian option.
