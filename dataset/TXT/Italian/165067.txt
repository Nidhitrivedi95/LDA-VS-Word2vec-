m1Mk8bYVgKOX_KPGccU6Sw Nick's is a great little neighborhood spot! I do take out probably about 3-4 times a month from here! When I feel like dining in I usually go to the Pinnacle Peak location as I like to sit at the high-tops in the bar (I love sports and they usually always have a game playing on the tv).
