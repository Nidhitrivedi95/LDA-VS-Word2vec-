V6MWAv-xv4dgSUrDU1qxaA Just discovered this place and I was pretty happy with it. I had Pad Thai with chicken. The food was incredibly hot and really fresh with lots of little bits and bobs. I was surprised, however, by how expensive the meal was. Last night at a designated Thai restaurant my wife had a serving of Pad Thai with shrimp that was twice as large and definitely a bit better. Still, not a bad place to swing through if you want something above fast food. Everything seemed to be of very good quality (although there sweet tea was definitely not very sweet at all).
