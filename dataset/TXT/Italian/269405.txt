xjjxHavx4RIiW6zS6rasGA I have to admit that based on the Yelp reviews, I was expecting quite a bit more. It's not that our food was bad or anything, but it was just okay. That's it. We had some delicious meals while in Scottsdale, but this one was pretty average. The one standout dish was the Cioppino special which my hubby ordered, which was quite tasty, but skip the short ribs. The portions were generous but the quality, flavor, and tenderness were just not there.
