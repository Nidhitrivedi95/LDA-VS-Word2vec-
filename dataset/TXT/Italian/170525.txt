mvsnt4q3A5TzcbPFolpsZQ We were in Scottsdale for a meeting and wanted to get away from the hotel food. What a great little find! I had the mushroom artichoke ravioli and my husband had the lasagna. Homemade pasta that melts in your mouth! Reminiscent of our trips to Italy. My husband sopped up the sauce with the homemade bread. Impressive wine list for such a little place, too. I only wish we had enough room to try the homemade Limoncello.
