Jpyh7MfaNysY3geXjhzqJQ Love this place!!  Nothing better than pizza with crunchy crust and Char definitely does it right! We've been in here 4 times since it opened and have never been disappointed. Such a cool make it your way concept, really quick, great topping options, and the staff is always really friendly and attentive too. The decor and overall vibe of the place is really cool too - laid back, great for families or a date night with my hubby.  Great outdoor  patio, great music, and cool little bar in the back to watch some football!   Will definitely be our go to pizza spot!
