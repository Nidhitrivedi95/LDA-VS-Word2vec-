Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw I love Cugino's. I lived in Las Vegas for 2 years and I have to say that Cugino's was the best part about the whole city. I want to thank the Cugino's family for blessing me with their existence. If it weren't for them, I would have lived a fruitless life in Las Vegas. I found the courage to get out of bed every morning only because I knew that at some point in the day, I would be graced with the privilege of eating one of Cugino's sandwiches. The people that work at Cugino's are true humanitarians. If you go, get the Italian #2. Or if you are feeling frisky, ask Donny for his special sub, you wont regret it, and neither will he. Thats all I have to say.
