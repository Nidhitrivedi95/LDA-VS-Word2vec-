9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg Heard about this place from a radio station contest. 

My hubby is from vegas so he had heard of them to but never ventured out to try it. Near flamingo and decatur with time to spare before my doctors apt we decided to take a chance and try it. Mind you i was 6 months pregnant! Going here i was so hungry and once i walked in i could smell the aroma of homemade pizza and pasta. I was in heaven! Looking at the menu we had a hard time making a decision. We decided to go with an app [buffalo wings] and a pizzza pie [it had sausage, mushrooms, and pepperoni inside] and a side of french fries. the service was great. waitress was friendly and explained the biggest hits on her menu. 

The bus boy was great at refilling our drinks and they were never empty. i loved that. food came quicker than i thought since they did have a good amount of people there for a [monday] lunch hour. 

The wings were delish and i could not get enough of them. The fries were a little to salty for my liking... but then again i grew up with a mom who never allowed us to use salt plus i was pregnant and my taste buds didnt like salt too much. Lastly the pizza pie was huge! def enough for atleast 4 people. we had sooo many left overs. i swear when i went to the doctor i had gained atleast 10 pounds. 

we shall be back because the food was very good. very much reminded me of my hometown in cali where the pizza has lots of toppings and tastes homemade.

Great thing about this place is their are all about specials. Lunch specials. Specials on their calenders for every day (i.e on may 2nd if your names jacob you get a free pizza lmao. they also give half priced pizzas to those who dine in monday thru thurs from 3-5pm
