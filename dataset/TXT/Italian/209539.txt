qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA This has just become my favorite Italian restaurant! The service is amazing here. They're really fast and all very courteous. If you get a table next to the inside of the canal shops I recommend that. You can see the gondola from below and hear them singing somewhat. The view is cute from there.
What I love most is how pretty the restaurant is. From the time you walk in, where the bar area is, you get total rustic Italy. It's super cute! Then they take you upstairs, which I loved the stairs too, to the gorgeous dining area. Love this place. Can't wait to go back and try something new.
