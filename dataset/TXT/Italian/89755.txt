Atmosphere:  Santa Lucia has been occupying it's little corner near Stanley and St. Catherine for quite some time - and it certainly shows.  The place is certainly the "old school" dinner other more recent restaurant incarnations try to imitate but fail.  In a word "charming".  The place however could use a little bit (ok a lot!) of touch up.  From the raggedy wine coloured rug, to the creaky tables and frayed curtains - it is very obvious that St. Lucia is in the business of frequent clientele turnover (good luck finding a table during lunchtime - thanks to the crush of business people at that time)

Service:  The service at Santa Lucia varies depending on the time of arrival.  Evenings (3pm and up) tend to find the restaurant almost desolate - and thus the staff (one / two people) being very attentive.  Being popular with the business crowed due to its menu and close proximity to many of the businesses in the downtown core - it is very difficult to get a seat (or grab anything to go) during lunch time, so the staff is understandably rushed and brief during those times.

Food:  You will find many a Montrealer who swears by Santa Lucia's pizzas, pasta dishes and Italian sausages, however for the prices charged the food's quality is not something to write home about (but worth a Yelp review!).  Pizzas and calzones are cooked in a stone hearth / oven which gives them an added dash of flavour (watch out, sometimes these are made "more-oily-than-necesarry") and some pastas are even made from scratch.  Dishes are served hot, and Santa Lucia makes a great carrot cream soup.

Santa Lucia is best for pickup and for when no other places remains open - its quaint charm is slowly fading (along with the paint) however due to lack of up keep.

Note: It is located directly adjacent to the Che Pare strip club and La Boom nightclub.  Just though you should know!

Worth a try when time allows :O)
