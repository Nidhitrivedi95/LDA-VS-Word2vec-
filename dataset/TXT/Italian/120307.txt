h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ My family and I went here for the first time last night. The atmosphere was very nice and we were seated at a booth that was tucked away. The service was great and the food was fabulous. We had the spaghetti and meatballs and the chicken parmesan. The portions were very large and we each took leftovers home. 

We will definitely go back.
