A2aOwMcP0DxGPr2El7eifA Took a chance with a new restaurant and celebrated a dear friend's birthday. I have a hard time finding a good Italian restaurant in Markham. Either restaurants in the area are over priced or so tucked away between buildings we end up giving up looking for it. Well, I think I found a new to-go place for my Italian food fixing. Plenty of parking and easy to find right on highway 7. The restaurant use to be Fire and Ice which was a local favourite. 

Starter
We ordered the grill calamari and we got three big head of squid nicely sliced but still presentably attached together. The garnish of mix salad greens, caramelized onions, olives and large capers were the best part. I highly recommend this dish! 

Main Course
We all ended up with a veal dish; Parmigiano (really big), Vitello Gorgonzola (Amazing white wine butter sauce) and the Vitello Marsala (a full body mushroom sauce). We were served 3 slices of veal but each dish's meat size were really different. If you're hungry go with the Parmigiano but I just loved my deliciously creamy Piccata Di Vitello which small but I didn't care. Like any great Italian dish, you should be asking for more bread to soak up the sauce. A sign of a great chef is working in the back.  

Dessert/Staff
Sorry, I didn't like the tiramisu. It was big but didn't taste right. It was as if the cake was left in the fridge for too long and not enough mascarpone. Like I was eating a dry cake. Our server was ok. Maybe it was the cold weather but I honestly don't care. Desserts and service can be easily improved. If I wanted dessert, I would hit a bakery. After all, I'm here for the main course. Hey, maybe they were having a bad dessert day.

This restaurant is a great addition to Markham. There's plenty of room and a great place to hold large gatherings. They have a vast menu so we will be back soon to eat more!
