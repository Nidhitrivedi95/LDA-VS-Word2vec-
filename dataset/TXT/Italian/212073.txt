R2GxA0LslohJIOEndoFXYw Third time at Marshalls for happy and dinner. All three time I have loved the staff and enjoyed sitting at the bar with all the wonderful company. The bartender Robert is prompt with drinks and very friendly. The happy hour menu is vast and cocktails start off at $ 4.00. The prime rib, ribeye, chicken and pasta dishes are to die for.. The bread and salads are very good the best are the desserts.  So happy we have a new place in Moon Valley.   Thank you Marshalls for wonderful evenings
