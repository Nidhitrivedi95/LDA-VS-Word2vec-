Ye2WDL6sA66605igAbKGFg I will give a decent rated because I'm a regular here because I live nearby...

The food is good, I've had many things on the menu and I can say that there is a lot of tasty things to try and eat !!!

The work staff changes all the time, and this is due to the lack of quality service that everyone is complaining about .

So this leads me to think, owner, manager why don't you read the reviews and act on this. Are you coming and doing your part to make sure your restaurant and staff is property trained or are you on vacation counting the money while people are talking crap about your service!!!!

Think about it
