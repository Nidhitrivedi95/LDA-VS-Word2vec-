E0YuuRpK_4RpaUF7JK3mhg We had a delicious dinner. Started out with a  nice bottle of wine. Mussels & clams for an appetizer. Homemade ravioli stuffed with spinach and ricotta. Generous portions. Tiramisu with Bailey's and coffee for desert was the best! Had a wonderful experience. I will definitely be back.
