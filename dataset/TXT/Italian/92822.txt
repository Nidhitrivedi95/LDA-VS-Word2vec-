EhuKnhTKJTm_EZ_QGe7PvQ Last night is the last night I will be dining at Carrabas. I like the food but the service is terrible. every time we've gone lately ( and I mean EVERY time), we don't get our wine until a very lengthy time after we order, after we are done with our salads and our main meal is coming. Last night we saw our wine just sitting at the bar forever, and eventually when I got my wine it was wrong . A few visits ago, we had to show the server how to open a wine bottle. Are you kidding me?!? Last night the hostess was taking in front of a lobby full of customers how overwhelmed she was and how a server wasn't cooperating with her. We Almost left right then and there, and I wish we would have. We go out to relax and enjoy a beverage, which is very hard to do when the staff is complaining, visibly stressed, and it is near impossible to get said beverage.
