pXQV_vlMtQt---3W_do9Zg My husband and I ate here on a whim and it was amazing. He had the Gorgonzola Linguini which was fresh and home made. I had the Pollo Florentine where the vegetables were cooked to perfection . The vegetable soup also had freshly cut veggies in it and was seasoned perfectly. They have fresh bread and the desserts are amazing. I had the flan which is served with dulce du leche and my husband had the tiramisu. I liked it so much that I drove across town the next night to try it again. I even got a piece of tiramisu for the husband since he couldn't be there. He playfully called me a devil woman for going without him again...lol. The waitress Jane is wonderful, so nice and accommodating and the food comes out super fast.
