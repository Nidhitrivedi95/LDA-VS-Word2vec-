G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I easily made a reservation for Giada on OpenTable so that was convenient. It's easy to find as it's upstairs at the Cromwell Hotel.

You're greeted by friendly host and servers. The servers here are notably great and personable. Our server Nancy was great, very personable and she answered all of our questions thoroughly and made some recommendations for us.

We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and the mushroom arancini to start with. Both were great. I love how the bacon was thick and crispy contrasted with the sweet and chewy dates. 

For our main dish we had the branzino, bucatini with orzo meatballs and the crab and scallop risotto. All of which were very good. I was disappointed at the size of the main dishes as it seems like they are more of a tasting portion. So it would be best if you ordered a variety of dishes and shared family style. It works since you get to taste more than a few things. This of course will increase the price since you are partly paying for Giada's name. 

All in all, I thought the food was good but with a celebrity name behind the food I don't know how it separates itself from any other fine dining Italian restaurant without a celebrity chef's name attached to it. I mean everything in the restaurant including the napkins, pepper grinder, serving carts all have the signature "g" on them lol.
