HYhbeLznSWEl6JIYTllVUA What a great place for dinner and drinks on the patio. We made it in time before the heat hit. But still, the inside looks great, too. The service by Kevin was on point. The food was good and the leftovers were eaten for breakfast. The ONLY thing I would suggest changing is the music. Iron Maiden does not at all compliment gnocci and sauvignon blanc on the patio. 
Not a total deal breaker, though. We'll be back.
