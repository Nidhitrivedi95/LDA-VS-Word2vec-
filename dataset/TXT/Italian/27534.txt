4tJiL2mHKO-erM6xoZji9Q Well... the food is good but definitely not worth the shitty service. We sat at the bar last night to watch the game and get some food and drinks. There were 3 bartenders. None of them pour drinks consistently. They never ask you for a refill or if you'd like another drink. They actually barely ever speak to customers just each other. The girl bartender was actually sitting on the floor behind the bar on her phone at one point for about 5-10 minutes. I realize they're young but come on..... There was also a period of about 15 minutes where there was NO ONE behind the bar at all. Then, one of them had the audacity to whine about being stiffed by the people next to us. WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED??? The best part of that is the other guy telling him to just add money to their check to make up for it. Right in front of other customers. Trust me if the game wasn't on I would have left after the first five minutes of being there. 

Pizza - great
Wings - can't really cook a wing wrong 
Drinks - sometimes too strong sometimes just juice

If I ever came back here it would be for takeout pizza only. The managers/owners need to get a handle on this place for real.
