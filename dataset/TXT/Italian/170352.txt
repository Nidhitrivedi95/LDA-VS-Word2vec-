mUUTJY9_BqmAYxypHiqWrw Amazing little bakery/hot table shop. Their sweets have always been amazing and their food is delicious and sweet. 

On this visit, we rendered an eclair, which my better half (a baker), said was one of the best, if not the best she's ever had. 

We also ordered a box of cookies which our family loved. 

Haven't tried their hot table yet but will do in the near future.
