wxzG81ZyWpBje_mU4aFLaw One of my new favorite neighborhood joints. Service was attentive, and listened almost too well. But that was okay, we got two delicious pizzas out of it, and the accommodated to us with the bill, too. I fell in love with their balsamic vinaigrette on the strawberry and gorgonzola salad. Only complaint is that if you choose to get chicken on your half salad, they give you a whole breast - it feels off balance!

The mixed drinks were delicious, and flavorful instead of cloyingly sweet like many places make them. The pomegranate martini was incredible, and the limoncello margarita will continue to give me wet dreams. Swearz.

The fact that I can get egg on pizza, and that they locally source ingredients creates many points in my book! I loved the place! The environment was perfect to facilitate conversation as well!

OH! And Cameron, the guitarist? I am a fan! I can't find him online!
