They are generous with their portions and seasoning. Between the both of us, we would come back for all our appetizers, mains and desserts. I had the marinated seafood salad with chickpeas, and that would be belly happy for a small eater.

The lamb chop was done well. Very flavorful, with delicious long beans for sides. This dish is also on the regular menu.
