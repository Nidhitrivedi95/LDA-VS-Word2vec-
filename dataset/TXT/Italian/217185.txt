rxWQz4Tlk7nTy049qGCxcg We have been eating at Barros on Lake Pleasant Parkway for 3-1/2 years. Since about September of 2014 it has been hit or miss. Bad customer service, errors with orders, pizza quality has gone down and the employees are loud and obnoxious in the dining area. We have given them chance after chance, but the last time we ate there, it took almost 20 minutes for a manager to correct an order problem, and then it never really got solved. Location is so great for us, but unfortunately these loyal patrons are going to have to move on.
