Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg We fell in love with Metro since there is no local pizza.  We actual would like to find a good take out place, but this is more of a restaurant.  We loved the double stuffed pizza and ate here many times and even ordered take out at parties.  They are too pricey, but we would go at the happy hour price or in large parties with our friends.  

Then suddenly the last time we got take out and the last time we went with a large group.  The pizza was horrible.  The crust was hard and bland and the topping ratio was off.  The purpose of paying high dollar is that the quality was supposed to be higher.  I am afraid if we go again and it is bad, we may think they are no longer the same company.  I hope that someone is reading this because it seems other agree.  

I really enjoyed the higher quality of cheese that they had and the crust, but it has not been the same the last two times.
