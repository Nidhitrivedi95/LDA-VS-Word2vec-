2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg Another Sunday has come and gone, leaving us with yet another coffee shop review!

I know I say every week that I have a new favorite coffee shop, but this time I really mean it. This place is everything!

It is located in one of my favorite places, (Trivoli Village) if you've never been to this area its a must. It almost feels like you've stepped out of Las Vegas and traveled to a far off little city in Itay. Lights strung up guiding you up the cobblestone paved streets lined with quaint shops and eateries. You would lose track of time if it wasn't for the beautiful bell that rings for the hours.

In this little City within a city lies Leone Cafe. Perfect place to grab a cup of coffee and a quick breakfast to start the day.

Leone Latte Especiale- 5/5 A beautiful combination of rich coffee and delicate sweet honey. Definitely recommend.

Quiche- 5/5 Flakey golden crust, surrounding a fluffy flavorful quiche.

Sit outside on a Sunday morning. You will not regret it
