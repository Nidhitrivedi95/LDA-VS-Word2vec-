MtvN8vMiKcLkkz_tCvBx3g One of my favorite spots for Happy Hour! They have bar bites available on weekdays, and usually serve some type of drink special. 

The carmelized gnocchi is outstanding, the sliders range from very good to delicious, (flavors rotate often,) and the wild mushroom goat cheese pizza has tons of flavor! 

The calamari are not as good as some which I've had, and the rings are very small. 

Not a fan of the desserts, but I like supersweet desserts, and none of theirs are.

A great place to come with friends, family, or for a romantic dinner.

Even though the setting is upscale the environment is casual. Staff ranges from helpful to helpfully friendly, and valet eliminates the uptown parking headache.
