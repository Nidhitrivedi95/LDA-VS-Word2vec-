CrIWqmuO2uQWwl3z11K_BA The pizza was good, but that is all that they really have going for them. I was there some time ago, but sadly I think it will be my last. 

The service is extremly slow and terrible. We saw there was a meat and cheese dish on the starters. We asked our server what meats and cheeses were included. We were told "well....meats...and cheeses are on the plate". What? I wanted to leave at that wonderful description, but my parents were interested in trying the pizza. The pizza was actually good, but the service really soured me. 

Maybe doing takeout would be better!
