RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ It was service was prompt and friendly service, nothing to jump and down about- dishes are all ala carte and pricey. Mushroom Risotto  was pretty bland and my veal Marsala was good but not worth $24, just meat, no sides they are extra...Happy  hr menu very limited, not really a happy hour place per sec the bartender...I probably  would not go back, unless I have a couple  hundred  to spend on dinner for 2..
