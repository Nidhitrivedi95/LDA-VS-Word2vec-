WpZkK951tqHONywmKLmhQw We visited this location with high hopes.  They have many locations so they must be doing something right.  Seeing reviews of long wait times to be seated and poor service mean nothing to me.  It's a new joint, give it time.  The food was OK.   We got there just after 3 pm on a weekday and there was no wait.   I ordered the Stuffed Riga Tony; my partner ordered the Roasted Chicken Garlic Lasagna.  I did not see one morsel of meat in my spicy "meat" sauce.  I picked through it with the fork and it was just chunks of tomatoes.  They must have used the wrong sauce.  The stuffed pasta was good, but not enough sauce.  The lasagna was a surprise because we saw a picture of it before we went and it was the traditional lasagne with 3 or 4 layers.   It is only one, maybe two layers.   It was covered with sauce but it was not your typical lasagne.  It was tasty, but there wasn't much more than noodles and sauce.  I am a garlic lover and could not taste the garlic.    I'll stick with Olive Garden for a while until this place survives all the reviews they will get from us old people in the area.  It's a little more expensive, but the descriptions on the menus are accurate.  

As we were leaving, a man came in, saw the line that had formed and asked for a to-go menu.  The girl said they ran out.  I can understand that, but there is a way to pull it up on line if you go to the regular menu, click on something like "pasta" and go to the bottom.  It gives you the option to download the to-go menu.  If I were running the place I would have told him that rather than lose a customer.   Or, send someone to another store and grab a few.  The guy just walked out mad.
