BsvCTCVG7lrzXZ68VyyIcg I am from out of town & was looking to go somewhere in Cleveland for my fiancé's birthday dinner. After asking around on where to dine, I decided to take him to Lago. Next to the service & atmosphere, the food was outstanding. HIGHLY recommend the Chicken Francese! What I also loved about my experience was that my fiancé received a free dessert for his birthday so it made his night extra special.
