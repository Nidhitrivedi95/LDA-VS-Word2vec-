Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA I agree with Bruno P.: their minestrone is excellent. If you don't go to a chain or a well-known restaurant, you kind of expect to get crappy, tourist-oriented food, but this was a very nice exception. I got a nice turkey panini, which they heated up on a panini grill; minestrone and a fruit tart, all of which were delicious. (I have to take off one star, though, because my husband's tuna sandwich was dry and not very good.)

The atmosphere is pretty calm. It was a nice place to eat breakfast.
