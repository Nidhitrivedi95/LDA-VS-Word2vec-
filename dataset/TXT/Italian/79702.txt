D1lAVtlav4atQTJnIvtcpw We decided to check this place out because we saw the pretty decor from the outside.

DRINKS: 
Beer - Peroni

Appetizer:
SALUMI (3/5)
(local and imported artisanal meats)
The jamon was delish! 
The pretzels that came with it were a great mix with this charcuterie board.

Mains:
CHITARRINE E VONGOLE (3/5)
(fresh squid ink pasta, savoury clams, guanciale, bone marrow pangratatto)
The clams & squid ink pasta were good. I liked this pasta compared to the tortiglioni that I've ordered. This pasta gears towards the lighter end of taste buds.

TORTIGLIONI (2/5)
(butchers ragu, lamb neck, wild boar, provimi veal)
There wasn't enough sauce and they added too much salt onto the pasta. But! The meats within the pasta were pretty good.
