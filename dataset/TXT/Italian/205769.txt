Huge mistake, the buffet would've been a much better dining experience with much tastier food and more variety, for about the same price. Yelp definitely steered me wrong in this case. No idea why they would rate this 4 stars on average?!
Mediocre at best and I can make much better pasta at home. The complimentary garlic knots were not soft and pliable like a doughy rollout rather hard and dry. I only ate half of one. I ordered the seafood pasta and the hub got the meatballs. Both were just ok. Waitress was ok as well. Nothing spectacular about this dining experience, and wouldn't come again. Definitely not worth $80 for 2 entrees and a glass of red plus tip.
