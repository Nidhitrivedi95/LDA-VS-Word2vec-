7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw I plan on coming back and trying every item this place has to offer. My Bronzino was absolutely perfect and piping hot. The bolognese was the most satisfying portrayal of homemade comfort food. Finally, the amazing, light tiramisu made me so happy and sad at the same time because the meal was over. I'm going to go dream about this restaurant, goodnight.
