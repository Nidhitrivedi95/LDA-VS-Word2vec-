hRkZHnKHVuIZWmF258sbCw Mediocre visit at best. First time here. Looked nice from the outside and had high hopes for this restaurant. 

First impression: Walked in and was greeted with a nice décor and dim lighting...unfortunately, this ambiance was accompanied by a strong stench that smelled like the old trough urinals at Maple Leaf Gardens. This filled the entire restaurant for our entire meal.

Ordered the calamari and arancini for appetizers. Taste was okay but calamari was lukewarm at best and the arancini was cold inside.

Entrée consisted of spaghetti carbonara and pasta with ala vodka sauce. Entrees came out piping hot, which was nice, but the carbonara was on the bland side and the sauce lacked that smoothy, creamy texture which a carbonara should be. Instead, it was actually clumpy, like a bad mac and cheese. The ala vodka sauce, on the other hand, was overly salty and almost overpowering.

Dessert was the only pleasant surprise. Mango sorbet was served in a frozen mango skin, and the made-in-house crème brulee was actually very good. But who knows, maybe only the dessert experience was good because the urine stench had faded a bit.

Don't think I'll be returning any time soon.
