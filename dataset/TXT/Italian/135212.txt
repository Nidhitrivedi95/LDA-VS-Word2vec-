ITUhsKjJYcVupAccQ1ADXQ My wife and I ate there on a recent Friday night.  The place was almost empty when we got there at 6, and stayed quite empty.  Despite not being busy, our food took nearly an hour to arrive.  I ordered what was ravioi by another (French) name and got only 9 one inch squares of ravioli.  When I questioned the waiter he said 8 or 9 was standard.  My wife had the porketta which I helped her eat.  It didn't take us long to eat and when we departed at 7:30, there still were not many there.   Went there on recommendation of Fodor's--wish we had gone elsewhere.
