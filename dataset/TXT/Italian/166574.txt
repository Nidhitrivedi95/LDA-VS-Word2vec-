me17NOULVwu40AdKGYHIaQ I got the lobster ravioli and WOW was it SALTY. The pizza was okay to me, it doesn't beat pizza rock though. If you want killer NY style pizza, go to pizza rock, it's just down the street. Omg and BEWARE on their slices!!! I originally wanted a slice but quickly changed my mind after I seen there was a fly landing on the slices! SICK!!!! They really need to cover there slices up. At least for the safety of their customers.
