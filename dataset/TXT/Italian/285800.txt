zFnPRtP7LGvr3sfxvy_dfg My buddy came in town and we decided to roll on in here on Thursday night. They started a new game night and we ordered individual pizzas and drank beer and played Bingo. 

We one three free beers and $5 off our tab. We spent about 4 hours her socializing with other bar patrons (the entire Roller Derby Girlz team was here tonight - they were awesome) Going to see one of their bouts this year! 

Anyway - I ordered a personal pepperoni and mushroom pizza - very tasty and loved the crust. My friend got the 'burger" pizza - it was ok - I would not order it again - I will stick to the classic pizza flavors. 

The beer selection was great and we killed the keg of Four Friends Uptown Brown! 

I will go back this Thursday!!
