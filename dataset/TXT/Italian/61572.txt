AYLxEeVq8NKG2UhcBiggrA 850 degrees is a pizza resto that is situated on the lakeshore. Have been here many times but never had the chance to review! They specialize in wood-oven pizza and have many choices to choose from! Everytime we come, we tend to try a veggie pizza and a meat one. This time, we came for our fiance's birthday and had a group of 12 so the variety was definitely a lot more than what we are usually use to as just the two of us. 

For starters, we had their ceaser salad and caprese. The large caprese salad had about 9 slices of tomato and mozzerella. It was tasty, but wished they put more mozzerella ontop! A slight drizzle of honey ontop would also be tasty! Ceaser salad was standard and was an ok size for Large. Large could feed 3 people comfortably. 

In terms of pizza, our favourites were the mushroom and the hot sopressta one. The crust were cooked to perfection, very crispy and did not make the centre of the pizza soggy. They are also quite generous with their toppings. One pizza is definitely filling for one individual! The Hot sopressta one is extremly delicious when it is just out of the oven - pipping hot! 

Pricing wise is a little bit pricier - ranges from 13 - 15$ a pizza.. It is also thin crust base. Overall, great experience with good servers! They also have monthly specials so that's also cool to try if you get a chance. Not a super huge restaurant though so make sure to make a reservation if you're going with a large group!
