YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw This was a disaster.  It started at the hostess stand, where the hostess asked my first and last name and then proceeded to type into her computer for eleven minutes, then asking someone else to show us to our table.  (in an empty place) I was served an ice tea and water with an ice cube in each one; needless to say they were warm very quickly.  I ordered the pappardelle bolognese.  The server brought me a dish of cavatelli with meat sauce.  When I told him this wasn't what I ordered, he had to track down my waitress.  She said, "Oh, you don't want this?"  I told her I wanted what I ordered, then she told me that yes, they were out of pappardelle.  I told her I didn't want this, to take it off the bill.  I asked for a bread plate, as one was not offered.  Restaurants like this annoy me.  You are in a locals casino, not the strip.  Charging $24 for chicken parm, with nary a strand of spaghetti or a salad does not make you a "high-end" place, it just makes you overpriced.  And please train your wait staff BEFORE you open.
