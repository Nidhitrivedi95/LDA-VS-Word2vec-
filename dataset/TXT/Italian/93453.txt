Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag Came here for a business dinner while in Vegas. I would have given them 4 stars, but the service was inattentive. 

I ordered the Fettucini Carbonara, which was fettucini with zucchini and pancetta in a cream sauce. The pancetta was very flavorful and brought a smoky flavor to the dish. The prices are a bit high for Italian food, but what do you expect for Vegas and a Wolfgang Puck restaurant.
