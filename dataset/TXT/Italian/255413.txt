VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g I would really give this place 3.5 stars.

Likes: 
- the bread was awesome and the butter was of the chain.  I think it has some basil in it.  It was simple italian with nothing extravagant.
- The waiter was very tentative and filled my boyfriend's glass of water probably 10 times.  He drinks a lot of water.
- the Lasagna was cheesy and meaty just how I like it.  It was well balanced and well-seasoned

Dislikes: 
-  Looking at the website turned it off for me.  They need to take it down a notch as it wasn't the most impeccable italian food I've ever eaten.

That being said, I would go back for lunch but don't think I'd be willing to pay the dinner prices for what I ate....
