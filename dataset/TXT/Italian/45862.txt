8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA I've had really good Chicago style pizza and this place was average.
I guess Las Vegas is just far away from Chicago. The crust was ok and the sauce did not move me. I expected more from a place this highly reviewed. And as my wife told me, if I didn't have a really good Chicago style pizza to compare it to, I may have loved it. The problem is that I DO have something to compare it to.
Not saying this place is bad, it just wasn't worth the 4-5 star reviews I saw.
I will give it 3 stars because that's what I believe and average "not bad" place deserves.
