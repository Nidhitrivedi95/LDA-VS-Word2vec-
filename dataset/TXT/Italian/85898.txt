dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA This used to be a good place to chill and have pizza.  After a majority of the original crew that opened here left around Spring time last year, it's been going downhill.

My Roma pizza, inconsistent, salads not crisp, overall place is always trashed and tables were half assed cleaned up. (ie food debris still on seats)  Embarrassed that I took friends here, so we stopped going.

Tried again recently and the pizza ingredients just looked sad, not fresh. So we skipped pizza and got salad. The cold case, most of the gelato didn't look good either. The crew, unfamiliar with, now seems clueless. Had issues with the cashier. 

The owner who used to be there couple times a week, ran a tight ship, he was cool to every one that came through the door, has been MIA..SOS Chef Marc!
