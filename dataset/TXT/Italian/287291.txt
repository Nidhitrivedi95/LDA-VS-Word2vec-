zKwzMHiufpQ3bRAA7R7f8w The pizza is good, but be prepared to wait a long time! I've been here twice, and the first time, our party of 6 waited over 2 hours for pizza. On our most recent visit, there were just two of us, and it took around an hour to get our pizza. If you're not in a rush or hungry (as the pizza's are also pretty small for the price), this is a place to try.
