wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q We showed up here at 11am and the doors were closed. Waited a bit came back around 11:06 am and it was still close. No one was inside and no employees in sight. Never coming back to this place again. I had never been there before and was really looking forward to having it today for my first time. We decide to go to Hash house ago go instead since they were open. I'll be sure to let everyone know about my experience at Macaroni Grill.
