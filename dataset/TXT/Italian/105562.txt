fSYdQCfFF5zsOapeUcY25A I've been to Piada quite a few times.  I enjoy this "chipotle-esque" fast-food-but-not style eating establishment.  
My favorite item is the choose your own salad with chicken (add roasted veggies, pancetta, all other veggies and skinny vin dressing) and that has quickly become my menu of choice.  I also order a children's portion choose your own pasta (chicken, spinach, veggies, pomodoro sauce) and a piada (sausage, roasted peppers and onions, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, artichokes and pomodoro sauce) for the hubs.  
At first I didn't know they had children's portions and prices because it is not posted, but it is in the paper menu and this is good to know.
They don't do a lot of cooking at this place and the soup is pre-made, comes in a bag and probably most of the topping offerings come from a can...but I don't get the soup anyway and I love olives, so I didn't let this hinder my review.
The service can be slow at times but I'm hoping that this is because it is a newer place and the staff is still getting used to the pace.  We shall see.  Overall it is a fun place with tasty food.
