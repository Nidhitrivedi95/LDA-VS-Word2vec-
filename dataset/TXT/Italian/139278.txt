JFNv5sKeKAf1ZVPnfbzpXw Great pizza, and I live right around the corner, those go hand in hand in my book.  They do a NY style pizza, huge flat slices.  They also have a bunch of typical Italian restaurant appetizers and desserts to choose from.  No complaints about the pizza, every time I get it, it is great.

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars, is this.  They sell pizza by the slice, which I am a huge fan of.  Why stop at a nasty fast-food place when I can get a slice or two of great pizza, right?  The problem is that 4/5 times I go, there are never slices available.  And it isn't that they are that busy, there are none ready.  Wait 10-15 minutes for some to be ready?.. no thanks, it kinda defeats the purpose.

Other than that, great food.  I can always take advantage of the $9.99 large cheese pizza!
