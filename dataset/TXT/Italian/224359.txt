First time for three of us, the other two had been here before. We were pleasantly surprised to be seated at Emporio immediately upon entering. The wait staff quickly served us water, asked us for our drinks and we had all five on the table within 5-7 minutes of being seated. Outstanding.
The group ordered a variety of foods, including tomato risotto, salads, mac and cheese, the anniversary saucy balls in marina over penne and spaghetti and a meatball sandwich. Drinks ranged from drafts to wine to rum and coke. All were refilled quickly and without being pushed on us. We shared the donuts in chocolate dipping sauce for dessert. 
The feel is casual, the tables, while being close together don't make you feel like you are sitting with the people next to you. It is not overly noisy but has enough ambient sounds so that your conversation isn't the center of attention for three nearby tables. TV sets were on ESPN or RootSports to view the Penguins. Another thumbs up for the sports fans in our group.
Wonderful experience, great good/solid food for a nice price. And we were easily done with our meals and drinks and dessert in time for the 8:00 show. That in itself was worth the good review. Many times we try to grab a bite to eat before a show and end up having to cut the meal or drinks short in order to make the show. Not so at Emporio. Well done.
