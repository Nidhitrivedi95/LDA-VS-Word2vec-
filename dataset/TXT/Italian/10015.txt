0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg I dined at Scarpetta for the first time this evening with high hopes.  I am from New York and have heard good things about the reputation the NYC Scarpetta has from friends.  Being that Vegas is expected to bring the best of the best and be over priced I was nervous taking my parents there when my dad was meeting my boyfriend for the first time.  I am Italian and we take eating meals together very seriously.  I must say that I was not disappointed one bit.  Their decor and ambience alone was impressive.  It was elegant and slightly rustic but not tacky like you see often in Vegas.  From the very well dressed GM Kelli who seated us to the extremely polite food runners the entire experience was definitely a plus.  Having worked in the food and beverage industry on the east coast and west coast I can be a tough critic but I would recommend this establishment to anyone who isn't afraid to spend some money on a good meal.  The appetizers were fairly small portioned but paired with the entree and dessert this place is perfect to have a 3 course meal and be more than satisfied.  I hardly give 5 stars and did not take a look at the wine menu so I can not speak on that.  I will have to return in order to add another star.  Thanks Scarpetta!
