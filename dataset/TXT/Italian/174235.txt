nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g I've been here 2-3 times since it's super close to my office. I've ordered the truffle pasta (Tonnarelli alla Norcina) and it didn't disappoint me. The portion didn't look like big but it was very filling (I couldn't finish the whole dish and had to split it with friends). 

One down side is that you can't change anything listed on the menu. For example, if you don't like basil on your pizza, you cannot take it out... 

The sitting area is pretty cool and spacious. It's always a good place to catch up with friends/coworker since it's convenient location.
