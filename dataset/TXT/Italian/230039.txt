TByvxX_5DZlLmf9Zs_j3xg Honestly wish I could give this 3 1/2 stars. I thought the meal was very good, just that there are other pizza places that outdo it in the area. 

I had the Salumist. Crust and sauce was awesome. However my pizza was warm not hot by the time it made it to my table. The meat was good not great. I was disappointed in the Soppreseta after having Proper Brickoven's. 

My father in law had a create your own with peperoni , mushrooms and fresh red peppers. Again his pizza was warm not hot, but he commented on the freshness of the mushrooms and peppers but felt the pepperoni was nothing memorable.

This was on on a busy Friday night around 630 in about the second week of business , so I will give the temperature of the pizza pass. 

I liked the selection of beer, I would say they could eliminate some stuff we always see on tap (Blue Moon) and add some local microbrews. Can't comment on the the mixed drinks.

Overrall would recommend, I'd like to try again at not so prime time. For comparison I would still recommend Proper Brickoven, Wingharts, and il pizzaiolo over this place.
