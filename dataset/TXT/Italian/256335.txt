w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q Palm is one of our go to places in Vegas. Depending on when you go, and what you eat, it can be the bargain of the century, or a pretty pricy, but excellent steakhouse. There always seems to be some sort of special going on. The previous month was a fantastic deal of their awesome 12oz prime beef burger, with toppings, for about $8! The month we went it was $80 for a 4lb lobster, split for two, with two sides and two starters, and a happy hour with sliders for a crazy low price. this time we went just for steaks and dropped almost $400 total on a steak dinner for two with a nice bottle of wine, starters, sides, desserts; huge portions, everything cooked perfectly.

Whenever you go you can expect great service, an incredible atmosphere (inside clubby steakhouse, outside people watching sidewalk cafe), and great food. No pomp here, this isn't a jacket and tie place (unless you want it to be). We've done Ramsay Steak, Delmonico's, and a few other fancy joints, but this is the one where I feel comfortable, and where I feel I am getting a fair deal and nobody is trying to rip me off (for example they just bring you nice cold tap water, no trying to upsell you bottled unless you ask for it).
