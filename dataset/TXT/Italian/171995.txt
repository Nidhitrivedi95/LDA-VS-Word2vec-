N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ Service is excellent & very friendly. Establishment was clean.

Value is good... $5.99 for 2 large slices and a drink.

Pizza is average. We ordered the pineapple & ham slices, which were ok. I ordered the "Art of Chicken" which consisted of diced white meat chicken, artichokes, peppers, garlic and black olives. The picture shown in the restaurant was nothing close to what I got. The toppings were piled on after, on a sauceless cheese slice. I guess this is how they customize each plain slice. What bothered me the most was the smell of dirty dish rag that kept wafting from the pizza or was it the parmesan cheese shaker? It was hard to say. I didn't enjoy it at all, but luckily I did get a backup slice of cheese as my 2nd pick. The cheese slice was good, but swimming in a pool of grease. Be careful not to splash it on your clothing like I happened to do.
I wish I enjoyed it more as the people in there were very nice and kept asking, "was it delicious?". I didn't have the heart to say "no...", so I just nodded.
There is a certain smell of garlicky sauce, a hot pizza oven, etc. when you first walk into a really good pizza place that unfortunately Biaggio's lacked.
