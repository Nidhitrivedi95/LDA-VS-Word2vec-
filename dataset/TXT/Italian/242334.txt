umxki_So2--o08q9bkXK6Q So it's hard enough to go out and have a gluten free meal disregarding the fact if it is good or not, but OMG my gluten free dinner was delicious! Going into the restaurant I had heard that picazzos was gluten free but I was so impressed with the  waitress' knowledge and understanding of my intolerance. Every single one of the salads was gluten free and many of the pastas and pizzas were as well. I love when restaurants use fresh delicious ingredients and boy, picazzos does not skimp on the good stuff!  We ordered a blue cheese salad (yummy!) and I ordered myself a margarita pizza with gluten free crust- my parents ordered another pepperoni, sausage and ricotta pizza expecting that mine would be less than average. The pizza was delish, not ehh it's gluten free delicious, it was by golly if this pizza was served- without being told it was gluten free- I would be immensely impressed. My parents even enjoyed it! I did not check if they have gluten free deserts because I was so stuffed from the great pizza and salad! 

They also sell gluten free pizza dough for five dollars (and for a gluten free eater it's a steal!) when they are not crowded. Although it's a tad gooey and hard to work with, it makes the most delicious home baked pizza ever, I repeat EVER. I force my mother to buy some whenever she is nearby.

Also on a side note, I am such a iced tea snob and their iced tea was auhhhmazzinggg!! 

Overall a fantastic dinner! I will be back very soon!
