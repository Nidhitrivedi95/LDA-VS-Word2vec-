UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ My Hubby and family and friends take me out to Vegas for my birthday and I have to say this one was the best place I have ever been. I loved the atmosphere and the food was so good the service was top notch. You start off with salad bar lobster bisque and they have sushi too. The waiters come round with all sorts of meats and sliced right at ur table and all the varieties of the meats I can't count em all... However my favorite was bacon wrapped filet mignon . I even had a birthday cheese cake and everyone sang to me. I highly recommend you try this place when out in Vegas . I will be coming again and I'm bringing my kids. What an experience .
