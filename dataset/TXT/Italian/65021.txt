Our dining experience reminded us of being back there.  Every food course was impeccably prepared.  So delicious.  The lamb chops and risotto were to die for.  The cheese plates and deserts divine.  Chef Grigo made sure everything was presented properly.  Perfect for special occasions, even better to impress a first date or business associate.
