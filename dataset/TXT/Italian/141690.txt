JogUSDKa1xyG3lLEmD4Xjg My husband and I met some friends here for dinner last night for the first time.  We were not disappointed.  I really liked the bread and pesto they brought out.  I had pasta with mushrooms and truffle oil...it was great!  Our server was very nice and very knowledgeable, but maybe a little slow to greet us or follow up.  It was not terrible at all...she could've just been swamped.  We will definitely pay this place a visit again!
