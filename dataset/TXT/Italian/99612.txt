F4zvnOsgjEV9aVbKqBYRng Went on a Wednesday (10/12) about 6:00 pm. Sat on the patio. Initial service was okay, but it went down hill fast. Only ever saw 2 dudes at the bar, no other customers than my daughter and I on the patio.  Had to wait at least 20 minutes for a beer refill, she said she forgot, um no one else is here! The wings were good, the garlic knots were not.  Some street freak who was obviously on something came and sat and the end of our table. The server never asked the guy anything, or asked him to leave, he just sat there staring at us, when we left he started following us so we went in the candy store next door. They get 2 stars because we had a Groupon and the cost was reasonable, however, will never go back.
