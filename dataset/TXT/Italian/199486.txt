Plain and boring interior, Snooty waiters at the bar and pizzeria, staff is short and slightly rude. Pizza is good but not the best, definitely not worth waiting hours for. Overall lack luster. Will I be back? Probably not. Will I recommend to friends and out of town guests? Probably not. I can go to La Piazza Al Forno in Glendale for brick oven pizza that is much better, less wait time,  more options on their menu and genuine friendly service.
