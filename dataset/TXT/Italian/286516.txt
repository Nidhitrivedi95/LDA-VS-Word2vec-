zi_qqjCzkerE2dT-ViE2JA I hate to be a downer, but as a person in the market for an Italian rehearsal dinner locale, I had high hopes on Bellini. The idea of it being set in an old church sounded cool, and it does have some ambiance in the main dining area, with the stained glass and whatnot. Too bad the private room is in the basement by the restrooms in a very non-Church-like setting. More importantly, the food was definitely sub-par for this bride-to-be. First, the portions were rather small. My fiance's pasta dish only had about 5 forkfuls of noodles. I ordered the salmon, which came with "mashed potatoes"...now if these were "mashed potatoes," they would make your mother's lumpy attempts or boxed instants look like rockstars. These were gray, heavy, and lumpy to boot. Also, the whole dish came swimming in a bowl of sauce. Needless to say, never again for me!
