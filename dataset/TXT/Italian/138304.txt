JBrBsKpw0bbXK5nlrXVOYQ Really good food and service. Medium priced menu with lots of choices. I enjoyed my entrée and side dish. Very flavorfuI and reasonable portions. Didn't have to wait long to be served. Nice atmosphere. Restaurant has big screen TVs with the game on. Was a great find located next to my hotel.
