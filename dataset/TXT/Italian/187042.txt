I've had the pleasure of eating my fave mizithra with brown butter since I was a teen. Not sure why I chose that as a teen after my years hooked on the spaghetti with clam sauce but there you have it. They've since added another way to consume my fave by adding bacon & mushrooms to an already yummy dish. The bread still included & served hot with the garlic butter to shmear all over the place. Bleu cheese dressing still good too. Some things you just don't monkey with. In addition to how good everything tastes (not just my fave btw) the food is priced right. Where else is your drink albeit iced tea or milk included with your entrée & desert too?  No where. So your next trip check out the Old Spaghetti Factory.
