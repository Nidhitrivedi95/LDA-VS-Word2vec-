BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA Just ate here again last Sunday, another fine dinning experience! The calamari and mussels make a great appetizer. If you like Cioppino try the Nero Linguine. A variety of seafood over a bed of black pasta with a spicy sauce made of San Marzano tomatoes, thinly sliced garlic etc... that you cant get enough of. My wife and daughter had the scampi dish and it was fantastic. The deserts were excellent also! 
Thanks again Derik and Ferdinando for making the experience truly special.
