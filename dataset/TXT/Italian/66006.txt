bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw I had a great time. I went for my first time yesterday for brunch. For 30 dollars, you get an appetizer, an entree, and bottomless mimosas or blood Mary's. it was great. I got the Brussels sprouts (made with bacon and potatoes) and the crispy chicken sandwich. Great. The chicken DID need a little more seasoning but overall, it was really good. Will definitely be back.
