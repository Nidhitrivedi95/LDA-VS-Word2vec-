0s1DqJlSSgR1Ftg9Q_HEOg Needed a pizza fix while overnighting in Henderson.  Yelp didn't let me down.  Enzo's makes a great New York Style thin crust pizza.  The pepperoni and sausage are just like you get in New York.

They have a small dining area (about 8-10 tables) or you can order take out as I did (was ready in 15 minutes).  Delivery is also available in a limited area.

I would definitely recommend these guys.
