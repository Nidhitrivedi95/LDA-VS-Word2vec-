bo4loBeLwkQqZ7HGrgxXRQ I can honestly say that the people who wrote the first review must have gone on a bad day because this fantastic little restaurant is absolutely the best place to go in LIttle Italy. The atmosphere was great with the checkered tablecloths and brick interior, it reminded me of cooking in the kitchen with my grandma. The pizza was just fantastic and the waiter was great to talk to. Our whole family was eyeing the calamari at the table across from us which looked amazing as well. Once you enter the restaurant you are surrounded by the smells of homemade pizza and italian pastas. If you're in the mood for pizza this is the place to go. I haven't tried the pasta, but from the looks and smells of the dishes around us, I will be soon.
