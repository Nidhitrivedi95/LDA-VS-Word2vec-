7LIxuMlLsQp_znezKPBRaA We use Groupons to discover new restaurants. This was one of them.  I paid $40 for a $80 meal (supposed dinner for 4)  including drinks and two orders of bruschetta.  Firstly, we did not receive any bruschetta, nor drinks, and our server did not credit us for $80 worth of food from the final check.  We ended up paying $120 extra for 3 people as the server simply deducted $40, not $80 as it should have been.  Folks, this is false advertising and dishonest.  The Groupon was not honored. Secondly, the food was mediocre as was the service.  The average dish price was $28.00.  This would have been satisfactory had the quality of food matched the relatively high price.  This establishment was quite a disappointment on multiple levels.  We will not be returning.
