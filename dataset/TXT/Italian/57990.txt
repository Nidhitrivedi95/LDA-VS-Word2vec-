ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg My family's first time to Crust (we stumbled on it - wife spotted it). Trundled the kids in, and lo and behold - Free WiFi signs about! YES! I said, running back to car for laptop. I fired up YouTube for the kids while wife and I had a chance to meet and greet one another again. "Hi dear, who are you?" and "You look terrific? Where have I met you before?"

Service started a bit slow, but waters and drinks came around and then our family medium crust pie later - I loved it, wife said Yeah! and the kids were quiet, glued to video clips and my son ate a bunch of Crust pizza. 

The Rustica thin crust pizza  seemed to be the Crust calling card, so we;ll have to try those next time too. Well done! And we didn't even try any wine! But next time we're in the hood, we will.
