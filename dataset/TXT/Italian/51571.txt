9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg The restaurant was empty when we came in. It's probably because we went for a late lunch about 3 pm. No one greeted us as we entered. I had to eye a cook and told him table for 2. He motioned to sit where ever. Ok, so we sat. 
The waiter came by shortly after and he was nice. We ordered the Abbondanza, half Modesto and half Sunspot.  The pizzas were decent. We got happy hour prices so we can't really complain. It was a great deal. I am not sure if I would pay full price since nothing really stand out and menu price was a bit on the pricey side.
