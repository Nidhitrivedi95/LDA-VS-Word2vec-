Tried this place for dinner and I was ready to not like it. I wasn't crazy about the pizza joint that was previously here and I typically don't like super thin crust type pizza. my wife told me they have a special on Mondays where you can get a large cheese pizza for around $10 so we ordered one. Inside was busy with customers and there were plenty of staff on hand to get everybody taken care of. The only downside is that they only have about 5 tables inside and since they were filled with customers eating side it left us customers waiting for take out orders huddled together which was awkward. The inside is narrow so there isn't much space when it's busy. 

I ended up liking the pizza. It was thin, not too greasy, and had the right amount of cheese and sauce. I can't say I'd pay the regular $12.99 cost for it however with a coupon or a promotion like we got this time it's a good deal. I came back a couple days later for lunch and picked up a couple slices of cheese and a drink for around $6 including tax. The pizza was hot and just as good as a couple days before. The only thing I don't get is why it doesn't come in a take out box? The 2 slices were on a thin paper plate inside a brown paper bag. I wasn't just getting lunch for myself but my wife too and trying to carry it all out plus 2 sodas was effing ridiculous. I like the specials they have and look forward to trying some of the other menu items however if it doesn't come in a proper take out box it might make me not want to come back as often since I wont want to risk dropping all the food trying to carry it to the car.
