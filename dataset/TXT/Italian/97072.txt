esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA After our EDC trip, my boyfriend and I did not feel like eating anything. We wanted something small but nothing too heavy and filling. Not sure if it is a good idea to eat raw food after a day of not eating and a night of drinking, but we wanted oysters. As we walked up to the counter, we can smell the fishiness of the oysters.
It was around 1pm and we were expecting a lot of people, but there were only about 4-5 families around us. We sat at the bar; right in front of where the chef would pry open the shells. At first, we stood in front of the bar, waiting for a waiter or someone to help us. We ended up getting fed up, so we just sat down. Nobody came to neither take our order nor offer us anything to drink. After 10 minutes, I started too waved down one of the chefs and he finally took our order. We ordered the half dozen Salsa half shelled oysters for $18. All I can say is, not worth it! I rather go to boiling crab, even though it is not as fresh the one here. But honestly, it tasted the same. Yes, the oysters were fresh and the salsa made it extra flavorful and it did take away the fish stench. But for $18, I was expecting a POW in my mouth. Nothing happened. Lame... We downed everything within 5 minutes...took another 10 to wave down someone to get us our checks. Bam $21 total...and we booked. 
Next time, if I do come back, I would probably just order some clam chowder or calamari.... (the family next to us ordered them and they looked and smelled good)
