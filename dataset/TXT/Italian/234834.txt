tUjyGFSN8wQqLgKp5Q0CUA Oh my goodness, how much I love Trentina and the atmosphere it exudes! When I walk into Trentina I feel like I am transported to a countryside cottage in the south of France and I love that feeling. I have only been here for brunch, but as far as I'm concerned that is the best time to go there. The prices are a little high, which is why I am giving them four stars instead of five. I enjoy everything about the place, but for a brunch the prices are a little steep. The eggs benedict here are the best I have had in a long time, and the fried potatoes are just a little sliver of heave-like the best hash brown I have ever had (I don't remember exactly what it is called). Mimosa pitchers run around 15-18 dollars, it has been a while but I think it was around there, but they are pretty big and could definitely be shared between four people. However, be prepared to spend around 50-60 dollars per couple. Expensive, but worth it and definitely a unique Cleveland staple!
