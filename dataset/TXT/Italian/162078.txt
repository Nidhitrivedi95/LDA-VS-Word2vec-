LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g Had a lovely dinner the other night.  Thanks to Travelzoo for an amazing bargain.  Ambiance is great and service was top notice. Our mains were 9 ounce lobster tail and a veal chop.  Both cooked perfectly.  We started with lobster bisque and mozerella tomato salad, both very nice.  Enjoyed a carafe of the house chianti.  It was all more food than we could eat!  Very expansive menu with lots of grilled meats to choose from -- hard to choose with so many options!  Very relaxing and romantic dinner.  We couldn't eat dessert so took it to go -- canneloni.  All around excellent and wouldn't hesitate to return.
