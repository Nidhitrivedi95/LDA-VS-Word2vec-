e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw i died here.  the food was AMAZING.  LIKE SO SO SO AMAZING.  vegan or otherwise they pull out all the stops here.  best service, best atmosphere, best food, and it's pricey but *WORTH IT*

i ordered cashew cream pasta pockets, salad, vegan chicken marsala, dessert, & coffee. (i ordered a LOT i know, but i split it all with a friend)  everything was extremely high quality and extremely delicious. 

don't miss this serious gem!  vegan OR otherwise!
