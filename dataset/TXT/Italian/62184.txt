b24sTA2JkHB4joNlNkBkfQ Late night err umm more like early morning eating. Around 3 am. not much dining choices, ate here before but first time eating breakfast. Ordered pancakes then added whipped cream and strawberries then a side of bacon and of course something to drink......... $16 later.....beware it adds up fast!

Gotta admit though these were damn good pancakes even without the whipped cream and strawberries. Bacon was tasty too.
