00J65e-ewht6GZ9fXZdP1w Only speaking of the Saturday dinner buffet they have at this location because we normally don't eat Pizza Hut anymore. The salad buffet was pretty messy, all the foods mixed in together. The pizza on the buffet sat there for at least an hour. 2 of the pizza where there when we got here and the same 2 are still sitting there so they may have been out longer. It took forever to get drinks and when we did we had to flag down different people to get them. Our plates stacked up on the table until we left. They must be really understaffed or have pour management with their employees.
