9Boahjn3QxlZnP2Aw_V1Rg The food was pretty amazing but I have to say for the price I would have expected stronger service. Too long for drinks and too long to clear table between courses. It's all in the little things. Clams, veal and mushroom pasta all amazing. Pasta was slightly undercooked but still delicious!
