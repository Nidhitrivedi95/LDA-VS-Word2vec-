qpBfYbkPmXIFWVQ7pLkQ_w First of all, let me say that I love our local Olive Garden in Rochester, MN.  I love Olive Garden's menu, so we dine out at the chain somewhat regularly.  We went to this particular restaurant yesterday for a dinner with an elderly relative.  I suppose when we walked in, they profiled us and didn't feel we merited any kind of special or polite treatment.  We were led to the most cramped, dingy and dark booth I had ever seen in an Olive Garden restaurant, where the lighting was so bad, we couldn't even see our menus.  Our server was Sergio, and he was just going through the motions--quite badly.  He didn't smile once, or come back and ask us how we were doing.  He brought the salad, and then we didn't see him for a half hour or more.  Then he came and picked up our salad plates before he served our entrees and actually left the dirty salad plates on the tray beside our cramped dungeon-like table for a long time.  To top everything off, the family behind us were the rudest, most uncouth trash I have heard or seen in some time--they need their own reality show on some trashy network.  Their 2 or 3 year old brat was allowed to screech inhumanly for their whole meal, which unfortunately overlapped ours.  When we finally got our food, it was hot (unbelievably) and tasty, but everything else about the visit was a complete and total fail.  I would be surprised to imagine that the Olive Garden franchise can condone this kind of service and atmosphere.  Luckily I was just traveling through and don't have to ever eat at this hellhole again.
