L6ZPG8lO1tMGmHimSjuEMg I like ramen, but when I think of it I go back to my childhood days of 10 for 10$ top ramen. I loved that shizz! I have no other ramen or ramen restaurants to compare this place too, but it's a bowl of ramen that has been churched up with some goodies! I had the torigara and enjoyed it! The smell of it got me psyched to dive in and tear it up! The poached egg in it was a good addition for me. I would come back again and probably order the same thing. Give it a try for sure!!
