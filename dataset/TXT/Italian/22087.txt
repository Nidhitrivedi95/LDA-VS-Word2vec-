3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A Just a week before Christmas my partner and I decided to splurge on a huge, delicious, relaxing Italian dinner together before a week of family outings and events occupied our vacation, and Enoteca Sociale was the best decision we could have made.

Our reservation was for 6pm but we showed up a bit earlier and were given our choice of seating right away. The service from start to finish was attentive, warm, knowledgeable and hospitable, from wine selections to a choice of entree and dessert.

We started with the cheese platter which featured a selection of soft cheese, a goats cheese, blue and a hard cheese, with wine and beer. As we nibbled our octopus arrived and it was really was one of the shiny hits of the evening, with a savoury tomato base, meaty, chewy and nommy. I've never had octopus this delicious in Toronto or anywhere else so far, the bar is raised!

For my entree I had a rutabaga agnolotti with the most delicious chanterelles, in a maple butter sauce which blew my top off. Portions were smaller but the food was so rich I was completely full.

But of course, I HAD to go for the panna cotta which was a nice, light, crisp finale to the evening, with a sweet Noans wine, a blend of Riesling, Gewurz and Sauvignon Blanc, a perfect topper to the evening. 

All together, a cheese platter, appetizer, 2 entrees, dessert and 4 alcoholic beverages with tax and tip came to about $150, but shave off the cheese platter and wine or dessert and it's more affordable, but we wanted it all :)

I would absolutely go again, I'd love to try some of the other entrees, especially the Pappardelle with Lamb, it's been in my dreams since, I swear.
