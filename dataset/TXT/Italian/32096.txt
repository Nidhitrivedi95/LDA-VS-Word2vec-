The hostess called it "castle door".  As the door is tall, so is their ceiling.  In fact every thing was including table was large. Nice large table and comfortable booth seat were very nice.

It wasn't too crowded when I went there for lunch this week.  With the high ceiling, I didn't even hear much of other customers' conversation.  Service was nice and our server took time to explain the lunch menu.

Per his recommendation we shared the grilled calamari appetizer.  Calamari was tender, not chewy at all, and great flavor.  They were not deep fried as seen at many places, healthy way to cook. They cooked with whole cloves of garlic but garlic wasn't overwhelming with garlicky taste.

For entrée, I had salmon.  Salmon itself was cooked to the perfection, but I didn't enjoy the leek came with the meal. It just didn't go well, it was too overwhelming. I would have preferred it was cooked longer.

Desert was interesting.  When I saw the word "tiramisu", I didn't even read the menu. I just ordered one. When it came, it didn't look like tiramisu.  The server explained it was explained on the menu.... I didn't read.. He explained that they use the same ingredients but it was constructed differently.  It was tasty nonetheless.

When I got to my office, I had to fight with food coma.  It was very difficult to stay awake until I had time to digest.  The server said if we are a member of the theater, second lunch is free.  I have to look into the membership as I enjoyed the unique food here.
