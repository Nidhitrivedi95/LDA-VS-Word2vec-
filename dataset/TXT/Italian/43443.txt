7ZBh-3wWVQ5zkd6KZytW0g My final word: No one wants a limp pizza. 

My lunch experience: went on a weekday, it was surprisingly busy but they were able to seat my group relatively quickly. Ordered their lunch special which consisted of a salad and pizza. 

The good: the service wasn't bad, and their spinach salad was very nice. 

The bad: I unfortunately have to make a list (it wouldn't be right to give a one star unless I had the chops to back it up) 

The bathroom was disgusting and smelt horrible. 

I caught the server wiping lipstick off a glass with get finger and serving it to another customer. Honestly disgusting. 

There were multiple fruit flies buzzing around our table the whole time. 

My pizza was limp, undercooked and super oily. Bonus plus though, it tasted much better upon a second reheat. 

My lunch cost $40 with wine and tip. The state of this place, the food quality, and the questionable health and safety standards do not justify that price. 

Honestly, I would never ever go back.
