Y-tgvb9Bh-Od-sPa1PRILA I'm literally going to hold this until I get my delivery, however....I've always had a great experience. I input my credit card number wrong. The driver called me and I asked for him to please hang on while I verified. He hung up on me, told his boss that he called me 4 times and I never responded. That's a lie. The manager was rude, when I immediately called back to rectify the situation. I made a mistake online. No need for the sass.
