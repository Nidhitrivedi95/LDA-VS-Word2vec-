q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA Really enjoyed this place the two times that we went.  I'm a sucker for breakfast sandwiches, and the veggie is so creative and delicious... I want one now.

The mochas are tasty, and the space is small and quiet... almost too quiet... but nice.  

I will be back to get more breakfast sammiches!
