vxadNrpTY7OHNmWsrEpNnA Love this place! The staff is excellent. Friendly and efficient. My goto meal is the pork chops breakfast with eggs and grits (see pic). The pork chops are AMAZING. Seasoned to perfection and so tender mmm. The meal is only $9.50 and its impossible for me to even finish half in one sitting. My boyfriend always gets the challah French toast. It's like the king of French toasts. Also amazing. I have no complaints about this place. Every time we go we leave happy... and we go a lot lol!
