oEYyuU67YkYEsBzwP4PGag I saw these reviews and decided to try this place. The Pellini is an Italian burrito. You get to pick you meat (chicken, steak, italian sausage, shrimp), sauces (tomato and white), and topping (cheese, veggies). There are lots of choices so you can really have fun and personalize it. 
I had the chicken and Italian sausage and I thought that it was ok. Not great. I didn't think it had a lot a taste but maybe it how I put the Pellini together. 
My wife had the chicken and shrimp and the shrimp really brought out the taste. Her Pellini tasted really good.
The decor was up to date and clean. It thought the the service was pretty good. They were very helpful and friendly. 
Not to sure if I will return but my wife enjoyed it, so we'll see.
