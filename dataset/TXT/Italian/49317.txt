9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw I had such great hopes for this place. I love the fact that this restaurant is a restored craftsman home in downtown Phoenix with a great patio area.  We went there on a Saturday night and the waited  for an hour for a table while being able to meet the friendly owners. We ended up with a small table on the patio. Our waiter was half attentive to us throughout the night. The thin pizza crust was not as crispy as we would have like it. My husband's pizza was on the salty side. My pizza with spicy salami was good, not the best pizza ever.  After all the great things I've heard about this place, I was a little disappointed with the food. I wish the great atmosphere was matched with great food. I'd say it's a really nice place to hang out with friends for some wine and pizza while supporting a local business.
