IQVka-wzJmN3jw2W70aCzw I cannot even begin to tell you how angry I am about my experience here.  My family is Italian from NY and I drove almost an hour to try out this place because of its reviews.

We pulled into a dark divey parking lot, next to an appliance part store. We walked in and my first thought was that they were busy, so that's good right? The decor is sterile and outdated, no music and in need of some warmer inviting ambiance. We were told it will be would a few minutes since we didn't have a reservation, although there were still tables open, so we waited 10-15, no big deal. 

We finally get sat, and a lady brought over water and bread. We looked over the menu and planned what we were going to order. The waiter finally came over 10 minutes later and got our drinks and told us the specials....then walked away.  We waited another 15 minutes for him to return which never happened. By this point,  I have been here over 30 minutes and felt like we were absolutely being ignored and judged on purpose. Btw, the server was an older gentleman, gray hair. I own a business,  if one of my employees treated a guest like this I would be embarrassed. 

I would not recommend this place...ridiculous customer service.
