DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw We sort of stumbled upon this place which is off the strip and so glad we did!  We started with the Tritata Salad, I loved the flavor dimensions of the salad and you can never go wrong with crispy pancetta!  
We also had 2 Pasta dishes, both better than the other.  Porcini Pappardelle con Ragu di Cinghiale (pasta with boar meat sauce).  This was so wonderful.  A truly hearty and filling dish with so much flavor.  Our 2nd, Bucatini Carbonara e Tartufio Nero.  All I can say is this was the best Carbonara I have ever had!  This is a place I would love to go to again and again.  
Service was very good.  Server, Paulo was very knowledge and efficient.
