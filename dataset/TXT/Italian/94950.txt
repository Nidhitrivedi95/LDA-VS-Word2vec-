eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg Was craving Italian and got great service, delicious Italian, and fabulous setting! This was located in "Old Vegas"  and right inside the Golden Nugget, short walk from the hotel lobby. 

There are two sections of seating and one is "inside" the restaurant while there is an outer area that hugs the huge glass walls, where you can look into the pool and aquarium / slide! It was really nice to zone out and have a nice view.

We ordered a salad (big enough to share between 2 or even 3), bruschetta, mushroom caps, and almost couldn't eat it all as we scarfed down the warm bread that came to our table shortly before. 

Everything we ordered was to our liking and even with one member of our dining party being extremely rude and cranky (sorry!!) the wait staff was ever so gracious and patient.

Located super close to the Fremont experience, will definitely add this place as a must stop for a meal while in Vegas. 

Valet parking is free and tip based so make sure to tip them.
