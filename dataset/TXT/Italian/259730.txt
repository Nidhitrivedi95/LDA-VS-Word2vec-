wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg My friend promised a "Cheap and Cheerful" meal and that's exactly what Grazie is. 
This restaurant is Always busy, with people spilling out of the restaurant, even in Winter. 
Fortunately, we ventured in early on Saturday and managed to grab a table right by the window. 

The restaurant is huge with seating stretching to the back. 
It's energetic and busy but i wouldn't say it is loud. It looks exactly like a big, friendly Italian eatery. 

Food:
Bruschetta: I don't know what they brush the bruschetta with prior to grilling but it was delish; not your usual olive oil. The tomato was tasty too. 

I had the Capri- Linguine with shrimps and clams tossed in olive oil. The flavor had depth and was tasty; nothing i've tasted at an Italian restaurant. The shrimps and clams were pretty tiny, but i overlooked that because the entire dish was just tasty. 

My friend had the Bosco and i had  taste of it; rich, creamy and topped with mushroom- yum

The only thing that kinda annoyed us was our server. She initially asked if we wanted anything to drink but we'd just sat down :30 ago so we said just water and lemon. When she came back to take our orders, she hurriedly sped through the process, grabbed our menus w/o asking us again if we wanted something else to drink, before speeding off. We would have ordered wine but didn't bother asking her since she was in such a hurry. Additionally, when she came to check in with us, she didn't bother to wait for our reply, didn't look at us...pretty much just sped through us. She could have slowed down a little and made more money...we didn't bother ordering drinks or dessert. 

Other than that, highly recommend for an efficient, tasty meal in Y&E
