aylmrtz1AaFQTeM62cul0Q We had great experience and delicious dinner at Carrie Cerinos. I came to celebrate my friend's birthday. Darlene, our server, was very polite and attentive, we didn't wait long for our drinks, or appetizers, or main dish. Everything was just right. My friend said that his steak was amazing! I ate so much, I needed to do extra walk that evening. So, be prepared to have a lot of food, when you order appetizers, salad or soup, and then your main dinner. In addition to that, we got a birthday cake! It was a very nice gesture from the owners of Carrie Cerinos. The owners also checked on our table twice to see if we enjoyed the meal. Great attention to make sure the guests are happy. Thank you for a good hospitality and delicious food.
