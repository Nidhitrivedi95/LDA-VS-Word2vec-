pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Extremely overrated. Been trying to go here for a long time but refused to wait hours to get in. Expected the best pizza ever from all the hoopla. Pizza was good, not great. Overpriced for sure ($21 & $16) with limited toppings available. Also very sparse on the toppings too. Small salad was $9. Much better pizzas and variety at Humble Pie, Rare Earth Wine Bar or Oregano's. We came, we tried, and we won't be back.
