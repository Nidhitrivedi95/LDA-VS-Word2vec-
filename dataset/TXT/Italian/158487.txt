LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Second time eating here and I love it. It is my boyfriend and my 4 year anniversary. Our server was training a young lady but even with that added stress to him, the service was still awesome. We sat outside to enjoy the night and watch the sun go down. 
We had another server assisting us throughout the night and she was amazing! Wish I would have gotten her name. I even asked her for an amazing dessert choice and without me asking, she sent out a sampler free of charge. Will be back again. 

PS: the bread and oil is amazing.
