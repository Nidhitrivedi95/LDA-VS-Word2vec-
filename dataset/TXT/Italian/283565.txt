z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ We were staying at the D on Fremont. on our way to the casino, i saw the ad on the elevator door, so we decided to eat here. Amazing experience from start to finish. We ordered Caesar salad, it is prepared on your table, so yummy. We had the bone in ribeye, delicious and tender meat. Our server, Paul was so attentive, charm and professional. He made us feel at home. The entire team were very professional, waters always filled up, table clean in a proper way, food dropped from left. Very, very nice and good experience. We'll definitely be back when ever we are in vegas again. Thank you for a great experience.
