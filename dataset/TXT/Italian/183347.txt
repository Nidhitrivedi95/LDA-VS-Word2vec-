ODlST50VSMzUMd0kmDpQgw This restaurant is very good it come in large proportions and it is the best. I personally recommend the ravioli and chicken. But it is a little pricey (15-20) about per dish but each fish may serve a few people what we did was we ordered A few dishes and we all shared them. It was great service it was refills right when you where empty. It is a little chilly in the restaurant so make sure you are prepared.
