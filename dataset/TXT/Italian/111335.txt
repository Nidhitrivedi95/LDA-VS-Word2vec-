G099MT9cwtwgdsR71JLp6w Went twice, once for lunch with colleagues and once for dinner with BF.

I have to say that I had a better experience with lunch, than with dinner. At lunch the food was homey, simple and delicious. At dinner I found it a bit over dressed.

For the time being, I will give it 3 star because the dinner dishes fell into the trap of many Italian restaurant: too much sauce, too many flavors, trying too hard to be something special. To me, the best Italian food sports few flavors. One main standout ingredients. A subtle balance of all the supporting components working to enhance the main ingredient without overpowering it. I understand that this is not what most people thin of as Italian, so I realize chef and restaurateur have to go after the main crowd and this might make for a tough balancing act. But that dinner was threading to close to the worse side of Italian food.

Other than the food, at dinner I had some pretty bad wine. The first glass I even sent back. I might have just chosen the wrong wine, but that also did not help with the whole dinner experience.

Anyway, I will be back hoping to find a better balance next time. Or I might just stick to lunch.
