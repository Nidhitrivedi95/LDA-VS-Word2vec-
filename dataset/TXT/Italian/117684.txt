Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw This small restaurant caught the eye of my wife and I for breakfast.  The decor, ambience, and service were great.  The food wasn't.  We both ordered the breakfast combos (one with frencht toast, one with pancakes) with eggs, bacon, and toast.  The breakfast was comparable to a Jimmy Dean or Swanson frozen breakfast.  Sadly, this breakfast totaled around $30. Ouch.
