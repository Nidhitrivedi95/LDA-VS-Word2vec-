8E6Cu9E0gCg6FgffWXl8mA I came back after many many years and am delighted by this gem.   The waiter was super attentive and very helpful.  We ordered a bottle of the lovely house Chianti.  We split the tomato and mozerlla salad and they split it for us.  We shared the lamb shank, which was out of this world and the spinach gnocchi.  It was delicious and I needed to be carried out. No room to try their dessert ...
