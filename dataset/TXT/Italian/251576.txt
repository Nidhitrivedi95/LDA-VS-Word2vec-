VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w We saw all the good reviews and had to try!!!! SO GLAD WE DID! We had: Caesar salad - yum, capprese appetizer - delicious!!!! If you're not starving, two ppl could spilt a small pizza (at least 12" diameter) our party tried the meat lovers, the meatball, and the margharetta. All were absolutely delicious!!!! Unfortunately there was no room for dessert...
Tiny little place, easy atmosphere, friendly, hard working staff. You need to try it!!!!
