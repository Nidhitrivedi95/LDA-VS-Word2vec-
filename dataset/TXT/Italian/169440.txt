MrmwDgMlL2GtthlAZsJwNQ Came here with a group of friends for dinner. We often goto this restaurant but I have not reviewed it. We were a group of 5 that arrived around 5:30pm. Service was excellent but the wait time for food was unacceptable. The food came at about 6:30pm which was a lot longer than expected. Food quality was good, portions are fair and prices are fair. We are likely to come back but I don't have amazing recommendations for it.
