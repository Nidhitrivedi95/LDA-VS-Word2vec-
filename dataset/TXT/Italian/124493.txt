Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ I had bookmarked this place for months after hearing how amazing it was. Just a sidenote, I'm a huge fan of thin-crust pizza, crispy on the bottom and edges, and a sucker for a good crust. My fave crust is at pizzeria mozza--tastes like French baguette crust. 

I personally wan't too fond of the garlic knots-- they were sourdough based, and though I love sourdough, I wasn't quite expecting it in a garlic knot or an Italian place, or at a pizza joint. But it had good flavor, and the sauce was to die-for. 

The pizza had fresh toppings, but again, because the crust was sourdough, it didn't live up to my expectations. The crust had a nice crisp, but, I have other places that I prefer more than here. 

A quaint place, and the pizza takes quite a while to get made. The prices aren't low either if you order the supreme or set specials. Would I go back? I'd give it one more shot. I also want to try other items next time, like the stuffed chicken wings.
