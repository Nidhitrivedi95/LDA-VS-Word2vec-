B9pMUND3peh4fFtGmqA4LA We had a really nice time at this little restaurant, it was packed and crowded but still a nice buzzing atmosphere. We sat right beside the bar and watched the bartender make very cool drinks. I had one of the drink specials and it was delicious!
We all enjoyed our meal and the service was excellent too.
