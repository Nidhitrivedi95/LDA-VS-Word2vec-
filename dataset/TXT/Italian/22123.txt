3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A I've been impressed by the service and the food every time I come here for dinner. I've had two meals in the private room downstairs, which were excellent (and a fantastic way to have a small celebration). And the meals I've had (two or three now) in the main restaurant were excellent too.

Yesterday I called in to order the tuna conserva for pickup. I mentioned in passing, because I felt a bit strange about just ordering an app for pickup, that it was my husband's birthday and that while he wanted to have dinner at home I knew he'd be super happy to have the tuna (and I certainly wasn't going to sous vide tuna to make a version of their amazing conserva at home - I was drawing the line at homemade sweet potato gnocchi). I opened up the package later to find a serving of chocolate terrine with 'Happy Birthday' written on the container. And a portion of their delicious bread with oil for dipping. I meant to call last night because it was such a nice surprise but forgot - so I've rallied to write a (long overdue) review. Thank you Enoteca!
