iwzVhM5CirzkNS5wTxwZeA The Strand Urban Italian Food Review: 4 stars!  Walked right in on a Saturday night and was seated right away (not a game night).  Nice modern ambiance in the restaurant, good selection of pastas, pizzas, wine, martinis and other drinks in the menu.  Very friendly service as well!  I don't know how Italian this dish is...but the Lobster mac & cheese is a must try!  Very tasty, cheesy and filling!  Chicken Alla Vodka was good too and they gave us a good portion of chicken.  Complementary bread was ok, but their pesto/vinegar dip was so good!  It's also perfectly fine to share a glass of wine...they serve it like Postinos.
