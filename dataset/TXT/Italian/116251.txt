GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA Bravo! We had a party of 6 with varying degrees of food pickiness, and everyone found something to enjoy. The service was top notch, and we even got impromptu dinner theatre while overhearing some middle aged guy yell at someone who was either his wife or his mistress ("If you fucking mention Facebook again, I swear I'm going to get up and leave this fucking table!") AWESOME.

Most of us ordered an antipasti dish, then we spit several primi amongst the table. Each of us ordered a main dish. We were stuffed to the gills, but happy. I wish we'd saved room for desssert! Standouts included the goat cheese tortelloni, the gnocchi with braised oxtail, the grilled branzino, and the steelhead trout. 

Fan-freaking-tabulous. I'll definitely visit again the next time I'm in Vegas.
