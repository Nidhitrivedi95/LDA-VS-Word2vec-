8cQc0BRbkSDSkLn6oFw3mw This is a decent place to eat.
We use to eat at the original's Nick's until we started to have a few issues. Later we found out that Nick's and Nick's ll are not related? Nick's ll are the original owners of Nick's, but then sold the original Nick's. Then they opened up Nick's ll, there does that explain everything? I now confused! 
Anyway, I have had breakfast here a couple of times. It's pretty much the same as the original Nick's. But this place seems to be more customer service priority. You are treated a lot better here, and don't forget about you. Food is really good, I personally love their pancakes. Their bagel breakfast sandwich is very good also. There are a lot of options for breakfast in Surprise, and this is one of the better ones.
