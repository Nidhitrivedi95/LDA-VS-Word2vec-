wTBfpTjdWG_zoE62B_bLtA You know when your friend has told you about a place  for years and then you try it and you're like, 'don't get it'?  That's this joint.

We had an order of bread sticks, with a little cup of gas station nacho cheese for dipping.  The sticks were OK.  The bread, in fact, tasted like when you were a kid and your folks made white toast with margarine and put garlic salt on it and called it garlic bread.  I'm sure they have their devotees and it has some old school appeal, but meh.

We also had two thin crust medium pizzas.  The size of a medium is small 12" and I thought next time I would get a large minimum.  One of the pies was half pepperoni and half sausage, the other a "Delight".  They put the pepperoni under the cheese which is not my personal preference because it always makes me think, where's the pepa!  The Delight is a specialty order and comes with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions and green pepper.  The flavor was good, but the green pepper was a bit overwhelming to me and drowned out the other more subtle flavors of the mushroom.  The sauce is slightly sweet and you can taste the freshness of the mozzarella and to their credit both pies were well cooked.  They deliver too, which is a bonus.  

Overall, it's A-OK, if you are looking for decent pizza, this is that place.
