Located at The Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian, this is one popular fine dining Italian restaurant. And for good reasons too.

The minute you step foot into this restaurant, you are completely taken back to old-fashioned, traditional Italy architecture and decor. First level is like a lounge with a full sized bar. Then you can either take the stairs/elevators to the second level for the restaurant portion.

Service was great. Our waiters were very attentive throughout the entire evening. Our drinks were constantly kept full.

Started off with a couple different dishes of antipasti.
***Calamari e Gamberetti alla Diavola----Calamari and Baby Shrimp sauteed with Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Garlic, and Diced Fresh Tomato, in a Spicy Tomato Sauce.

****Carpaccio di Manzo, Parmigiano e Germogli di Rucola----Thin sliced beef tenderloin, capers, shaved parmesan, and rucola sprouts with lemon dressing.


For our entrees, we got:

***Risotto Gamberi e Granchio----Carnaroli rice with crabmeat, shrimp, garlic, a touch of tomato and white wine.

***Filetto di Branzino alla Catalana----Pan seared Mediterranean Sea bass fillet with white wine, half of a 1  1/2 lb. lobster served in a pink sauce and spinach.


Definitely really enjoyed my dinner that night. Plus the atmosphere of the  restaurant made everything so much more elegant. I would definitely love to come back here again and maybe try their pasta dishes. Even though it's only spaghetti....the person in my party had that as his side dish and it looked freaking delicious!!!!
