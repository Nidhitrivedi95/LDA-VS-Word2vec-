NdXgEnEpHrP74L1oZtdsBQ Ordered at 6p for delivery to my hotel. Estimated 50 minutes to deliver and the driver was there in just about that time, problem is he had the wrong pizza. 

He was very apologetic and took it back and said he would be back as quick as he could. It took him roughly an hour and ten minutes to return. Not exactly how I would handle a mistake that is 100% their fault. 

Mind you 1/2 my food was left behind so dinner was split. 

Now on to the pizza, it was ok, I guess.  The thin crust was  good, sauce was heavy and inconsistent, cheese was good. I did not like the spices on top after cooking. Just my personal preference. 

Price was high. $29 (including tip) for 14" cheese pizza, French fries (they were ok for delivery), and a 2L Coke. 

Driver was nice enough to offer a 20% discount on my next order that I will likely by take advantage of.
