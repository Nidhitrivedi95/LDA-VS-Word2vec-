DjvpsmdtEvnyMk2vXxpc-w This place has a lovely, intimate feel. People are relaxed and the view of the water is pleasant. Food is middle of the road, but tasty. We had a big umbrella blocking our view of the water that they said they would take down, but didn't. They probably would have if they could have. Just not enough staff. There was literally one gal serving ten tables. She did a bang-up job, but I get the feeling from the other reviews here that they are perpetually understaffed. 

Still, for a nice quiet night on the water, give Pier 54 a try.
