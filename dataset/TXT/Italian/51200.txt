9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg I've been to this location a couple of times. The food itself is good, but the service made me come back. Good hosts and waiters make for loyal customers.

We had the spaghetti with giant meatballs. The meatballs were not overdone and very filling. The fried garlic was a little too much for me near the end of the meal, but I know others love it. I also tried their burrata as my main the other time. Great decision, it was amazing. Also, their tiramisu is good, but could be more flavourful.
