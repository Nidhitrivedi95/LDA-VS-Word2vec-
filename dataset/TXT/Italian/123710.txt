HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q You can't get better than this place if you want real Italian cafe food and coffee. This shop is run by a wonderful Italian family who lives, breathes, and eats coffee. The reason why prices here and elsewhere on the strip are high is because rents are extremely high. I mean insanely high. It isn't because the shop owners are greedy. Bottom line, if you want a delicious coffee and dessert, go here.
