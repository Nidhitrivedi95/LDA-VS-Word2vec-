oNptGQ-jHp4NG1HzO8I4_A Went to Rosie's on the recommendation of a friend.  It's a small restaurant (cafe) in a strip mall.  We got there at 5pm hearing that it fills up quickly.  We didn't have reservations as we didn't think they took them, but they do for parties of three or more. The staff was very helpful and because we were there early we were able to get a table.  
 I typically do not go out for Italian food as I figure it's easy enough to make at home.  Therefore I ordered something I wouldn't normally have.  Stuffed Shells Florentine.  They were excellent.  The portions are large and the prices were great.  It's an old style restaurant  with down home service and food.  The food came quickly and nice and hot.  Went with another couple who the week before took us on an hour drive to what they claimed was the best Italian restaurant they have ever been to.  Well, they have been converted and are now fan's of Rosie's.  My husband had the stuffed shells as well.  My sister-in-law had traditional spaghetti and meatballs and her husband had lasagna.  He quickly determined after one bite that it was the best lasagna he has ever had.  
I do have to say the garlic buns were different.  Not great or bad, just different.  The Italian sausage was also excellent. 
Treat yourself and go to Rosie's.  When we left at about 6pm there was a line outside.  We leave this area in a week and are planning to go back one more time before then.
