yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg If I could give this place -0 stars, I would! My wife and I came to Scottsdale to meet friends in Old Town for dinner. While waiting for my friends to arrive, we walked the neighborhood. My wife went in to this cute place to check the menu and use the restroom. She came out and suggested that I do the same. Just after entering the men's room, the owner banged loudly on the door and demanded for me to leave - immediately! I own businesses and travelled the world and have never been treated so rudely. I was, and still am in shock! I sincerely recommend you avoid this place.
