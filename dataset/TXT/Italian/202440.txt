q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Worst manager I have ever encountered in my life! Manager was so rude! It would have been a great dining experience until the manager showed up and kicked us out for having a service dog. And it was not a big deal but she did it in a very rudely way. She screamed at us while she was on the phone and came back when she got done with her call and screamed some more. She violated my neighbor's rights for having a service dog. All the waiters and waitresses are very nice but I don't know what happened and how the heck this unprofessional, very rude person become a manager! I hope the owner sees this and make the actual great workers there the manager. She just showed how she doesn't deserve to be in that position. Then we spoke to the owner at a later time and pretty much didn't care. Would never recommend this place, definitely would not support a company like that. It's not like their food tasted fantastic. So sad for this place, we like going to tiny local restaurants but it's sad to see a company who doesn't care about their customers.
