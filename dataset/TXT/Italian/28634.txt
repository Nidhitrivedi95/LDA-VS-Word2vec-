54rjpC8YuM3QN_QbFGmLAg I went in here about 4 months ago for the first time. When i first walked in all i could think about was how hot it seemed in there. My love for pizza didn't care about that so i sat down and ordered a large peperoni with extra sauce " Yes i know i went way out there on my pizza choice"  Fast forward a few minutes later and boom here comes heaven on a plate. I ate the entire pizza in one sitting. I eat pizza a few times a month and i have to say its one of the best tasting pizzas i have ever had. The toppings were placed well and the cheese was cooked well but the thing i loved the most was the sauce. It tasted so much better then i had expected it to. I couldn't recommend this place enough to people. Sadly because of work i haven't been able  to go back but my family has been a few times since then and they tell me how Great the food is.
