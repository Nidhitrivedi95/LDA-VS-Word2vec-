h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ Had a date night with my beautiful wife. Food was delicious. We were sat immediately and service was phenomenal. Lasagna came out extremely hot and wife's pasta was simply amazing. Waiter recommended a very delicious wine to start our evening and the Moscato was perfect. I have nothing bad to say about this place, food was delicious, service was impeccable and the atmosphere is very romantic. I will frequent this place with my love for future evenings together without hesitation.
