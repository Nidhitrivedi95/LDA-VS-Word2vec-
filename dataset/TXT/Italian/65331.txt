BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA This place isn't bad - been here twice and the food is pretty good, not great.  First visit, I started with the Polpette (meatballs served with polenta) and then pappardelle bolognese.  The meatballs are ok - nothing too special.  I can make better at home using recipe I found on google.  The pappardelle bolognese was pretty good - I enjoyed it.  

The second visit, I started with the salmon burrata and again went for the pappardelle.  The burrata was very good, definitely a step in the right direction.  My portion of pappardelle was small this time however.  Not just compared to my first visit, but smaller than other portions of the same dish served to my guests (a couple of us ordered it).  

My issue with this place is consistency - they need to be aware of this and try to improve.  It is a restaurant that I would like to frequent but issues like this don't help.

Verdict:  Pretty good - worth a visit if you're in the mood for Italian food.  I will most likely come back.
