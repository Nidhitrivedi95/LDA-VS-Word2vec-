ZVtjS8Hvq2a6SxHxlehPGg We loved this place! We got a coupon off of restaurant.com and it wAs well worth the wait. I had the tortellini with the Alfredo sauce which is the best Alfredo sauce I have had to date! It's my favorite sauce. My hubby had the gnocci with the marinara sauce which was to die for! We will definitely go back. We had to wait 30min past our reservation but it was well worth it. Two dinner plates and a glass of wine hit the $50 coupon just perfectly.
