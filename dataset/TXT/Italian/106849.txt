fUhgw2iXXS3TETqU4eZU6Q hi im from tinley park  ill. there has been a aurelio's pizza in tinley since i was a little girl. the thin crust sausage, mushroom and onion is the best. im now retired and go to aurelio''s on craig for their lunch buffet. george is a great guy. its a little more expensive but worth every penny.  the beef sandwich is killer also.
