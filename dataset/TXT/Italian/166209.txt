mDiFWhywAziq9SKnj6am_Q I was pleasantly surprised. 

The server was incredible.  It was a GREAT value.  We enjoyed our meals. Loved the environment sitting on the patio.

I had the Lasagna and Ash had the Seafood Manicotti.  The Lasagna was great.  I really enjoyed it.  It had a great texture, perfect amount of cheese, and was well seasoned.  The Seafood Manicotti was incredible.  I HIGHLY recommend this dish.

Along with dinner we each enjoyed a wine flight.  They offered a nice selection and we both really enjoyed the tasting.

I would highly recommend this spot.  Give it a try.  We will be back.  For the $$...you cannot go wrong.
