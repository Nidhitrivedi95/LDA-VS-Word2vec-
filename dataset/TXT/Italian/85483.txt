dPxZI9lrKTl5dvFfnb1_Ig This place is authentic... to a point where some staff only speak Italian.  Everything is made in house, it's a family business.  So everyone takes part, even the father of the owner makes the pastries, and let me just say... best cannoli!  And those cookies? Absolutely fabulous.  It's a bit pricy but personally you're paying for quality Italian food, with a sweet bistro ambiance.  I loved it, and honestly haven't experience authentic Italian in a long time.  I'm so happy to know this place exists in the world!
