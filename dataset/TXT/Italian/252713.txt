VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Went here for dinner on Friday night... We had 8 dudes, but even though we had a reservation and it was late (9:45)... we had to wait a bit and they sat us outside...in the 100 degree heat.  The heat wasn't a big deal, but we kind of missed out on the whole decor and atmosphere of the inside.  The kobe meatball was very good.  I just got an 8 ounce filet.  It was good... but it doesn't even come w/ a potato or anything... but the side of asparagus i got was heaping and tasty.  The filet was good though... cooked to my specifications and seasoned nicely... most other people got pasta dishes... do'nt know what they thought, but most looked pretty normal.  Service was good.  They got everything right.  Not super pricey, but pricey.  But overall I was underwhelmed... I just had the feeling that I would rather pay more to eat better or pay less to eat junky.  No real complaints... but I wasn't wowed by anything.
