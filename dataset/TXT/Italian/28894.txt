I went this past Tuesday for a date, and arrived at 9pm. The restaurant was fairly busy with tables eating but I had made reservations on OpenTable and we walked right in no problem. 

Had the same server (no idea on the name) the entire time - from walking in to leaving, and he was absolutely perfect. I drink a lot of water and both the girl I was with & I were impressed that we'd take 2 sips, look away, and it would be full again. The food was out extremely fast, and the bread was OK (probably the only thing that could have been better on the night)

The food was very good as well, I had the 4 cheese gnocchi which is probably hard to screw up, but tasted delicious. There were more than a few items on the menu that I'd try on return visits. Our waiter recommended a good wine and made sure we had better value by getting a half litre instead of two glasses. 

Atmosphere was very cozy and romantic, but the service really brought it over the edge. We were there for upwards of 2 hours without a hint of being rushed out, even as the last regular table in the place (in fact our waiter even brought us a shot of something (don't remember) on the house after we finished). 

Wish I could remember his name so I could throw him some props, but I'll be back again soon and will get it then.
