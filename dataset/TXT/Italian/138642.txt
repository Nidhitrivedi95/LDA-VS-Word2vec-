This place rocks, it's my top 3 place to
eat in Charlotte why all the 4 grades, it's a total and solid 5.
The food is consistently great, they do
A wonderful job presenting the food, the staff is upbeat, know the menu, fast service.  The chicken  parmesan is amazing, they have all types of spaghetti options. O my gosh! have you tried the Mamatini? That's a martini made out of aged pineapple. Ok, if you don't order the  tiramisu for desert you have missed the best home made treat in the house.
Do I get a free meal for this review
for goodness sakes I'm Italian for
Christ sakes, well not really, but
If I was this would still be a 5.

Try this place you will not be sorry.
