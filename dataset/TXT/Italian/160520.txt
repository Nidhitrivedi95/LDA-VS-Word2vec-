lHLNQnEHwCJ_CROCfCxEzw Scotty's is our favorite restaurant. We've been going there since it opened however many years ago. They never fail to provide good friendly, efficient service and really delicious food. They have a patio out back for the good weather and a clean well run dining room. You can see the kitchen and even better smell all the wonderful smells. Worth the drive from wherever you live. Well lit safe parking and easy access from anywhere. A hidden gem on 185th st.
