KuxDPl6UYNLxFChPm0_MNw My girlfriend and I went there during the Pride parade and World Cup so it was fairly busy. Our waitress was serving us inside the restaurant along with a full outdoor patio - while several indoor servers were standing around. Needless to say, placing orders and receiving drinks was slow. 

We both had the eggs benedict off the brunch menu. It took a while for the food to come out and mine didn't have enough hollandaise sauce. For the price, I would not get it again.

Atmosphere wise, it was very lively. The Pride Parade along with the World Cup made the restaurant fun and enjoyable. 

All in all, I would like to appropriate the mishaps in service and food quality to the parade and world cup, but something tells me it was more then that. Would I go again or recommend it? No. Would I blame someone for trying it out? No.
