KAVRjihA1m-D1n9mfnJiXw Horrible breakfast and not great service. Food came out cold and the hollindaise sauce was made from powder and bland. Their home fries were dry and burnt with no seasoning not even oil or bacon fat they seemed to be baked dry plain potatoes. We had a 3 year old with us and other children were given coloring but for some reason we werent. The ketchup on our table was empty and when we asked for some they were all out and we got ketchup packages. I would never go back their are so many other breakfast places close to this one.
