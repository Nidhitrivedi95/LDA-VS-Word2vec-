vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw I was in oregano's on bell road for lunch a couple of weeks ago and left my jacket on the back of my chair.  I realized this about an hour after I left and called to see if they had found it.  They had found it and said they would hold it until I could pick it up.  I went there 2 days later and after they searched everywhere, they couldn't find it.  They told me they would continue to look and check with other employees, and call me when they located it.  It is now over 2 weeks later and I haven't heard from anyone at oregano's.  I think that at the very least they should have followed up with a phone call to me.  In any case, I also think that someone that works at the restaurant is now wearing my jacket and I'm not.  I won't be going back there anymore.
