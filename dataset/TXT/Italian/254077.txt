VUOn9pztnaEX49Xfb_9L7A This used to be one of our favorite restaurants in Cleveland but last time we went we were insulted and treated rudely by the owner, Al.  We have dined here before and purchased a bottle of wine with dinner, but this was a special birthday and we had a special bottle from a Napa trip so we called ahead and asked if it was okay to bring and what was the corkage fee.  We were told by Mike, "No problem, don't worry about the corkage".  When we walked in, Al made a comment that he was insulted that we would bring California into his restaurant.  We didn't dwell on it and went on to enjoy our meal.  When the bill came with a $25 corkage fee, we were shocked.  I do not mind paying a fee at all but that was higher than I've ever seen, plus we were told "don't worry about it".  So I nicely inquired and the waiter brought Al over who said, "Well what do you expect when you bring wine into my restaurant?  I have to make money!  Why don't you just bring your own steak and ask me to cook it?"  We were horrified!  We will never return, nor will any of our friends that we have shared this experience with.
