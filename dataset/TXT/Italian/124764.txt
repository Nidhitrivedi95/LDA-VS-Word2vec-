Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ As soon as I stepped into Old School Pizzeria, I knew I was going to like this place. Located on Craig across the Cannery and nestled alongside a barber shop, Old School Pizzeria is a nice surprise. The menu is written along the walls on chalkboard, the lighting fixtures that dangle above the tables adds an interesting touch, and the seating is bench-style. We were warmly greeted by the cashier who took the time to answer any questions we had about some menu items. He came off a genuine person who was passionate about food - you don't get that often.

CALZONE ($8.99): This calzone was made with love! The calzone comes stock with 3 types of cheese. Toppings are an addition $0.75. I got mine with black olives, bell peppers, and mushrooms. The smoked and ricotta cheese were amazing, and the veggies were of the high-quality artisanal variety. Served with a side of marinara sauce. I was only able to eat half. 

PIZZA COMBO ($7.99): When they say Monster slices, they aren't kidding. This slice of pepperoni pizza was humongous! Thin crisp crust and perfectly cheesy. There's a few different combo options you can choose from, the mister got his with a half-order of garlic- rosemary knots. 5/5

GARLIC ROSEMARY KNOTS ($3.45): Probably the best garlic knots I've ever tasted. A half-order comes with 6 knots, each one brushed with olive oil and topped with rosemary and soft garlic cloves. You could literally spread a clove like butter on the knots. The side sauce served with knots was to die for. It wasn't ranch, but some kind of fancy sauce (the name escapes me). 

I regret not coming to Old School Pizzeria sooner. This place is officially my new favorite pizza spot!
