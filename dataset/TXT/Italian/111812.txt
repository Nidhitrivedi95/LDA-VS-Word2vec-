G9h56Qy5DudCqKBmbPWyzQ The service at this location was horrible. They are supposed to start serving lunch at 11am. We get in line at about 11:15am and I ordered  some pasta and sauce for my niece. I was told they don't serve that until 11am and I reminded the lady it was 11:15am and she said it will be out in 3 minutes. No big deal we can wait a few minutes. So in about 3 minutes I saw the cook bring the food out so I'm thinking great we are going to get our food now. No, instead I watched them serve many other people. So finally after 5 minutes go by I asked asked for the food and they finally gave it to us. Just a bit more customer service and the situation could've been rectified.
