jluEI1ZDQDeJlbl-M3YH3Q We dined here using a Groupon for a four-course dinner for our family.  $299 for eight people, regular price apparently clocking in at $784.  For less than $40 pp (not including taxes and gratuities yet), what an AMAZING deal!  I was thoroughly impressed with the top-notch quality, presentation and taste of every single course.  My insalata di mare was a light starter with very fresh grilled calamari and shrimp.  Next was the antipasto board with a variety of sliced meats and cheese, a nice change of pace to our meal.  My entree was the grilled seafood cacciucco, a tomato-based broth with tons of tiger shrimps, scallops, calamari, mussels, clams and saltwater fish.  This was truly an impressive entree - a very hearty portion that was as delicious as it looked!  I was honestly floored with this dish.  Dessert was the Toula tiramisu, an amazingly sweet way to top off the meal.  

What a fantastic meal!  It's been a while since I've had such a gloriously impressive meal.  Definitely was impressed with everything...and of course, the panoramic view and romantic candlelit ambiance was a huge draw as well!  Only negative angle to point out is the very costly drinks, which is pretty much expected for this type of establishment.  $7.5/bottle of distilled water...and main annoyance is that our server kept automatically topping off our water glasses, obviously to max out the number of water bottles we'd order.  $15 glasses of wine are also quite pricey.  Tip would be to keep your drinks in check!  Anyway, I'll still look out for another special opportunity to revisit this restaurant.
