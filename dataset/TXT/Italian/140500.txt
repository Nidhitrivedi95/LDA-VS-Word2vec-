JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw I was really excited for my meal at Chinato, but it turned out to be a-ok. 3.5 stars for this restaurant. I would be interested in coming back to try other dishes if a friend really wanted to go.

We came here to treat a friend who was visiting in town. He is a lover of Italian food, and after one look at the menu, he knew it was legit. I hear Zack Bruell really tries hard to make his meals authentically Italian.

Service: 5 -- Bruell's restaurants are always run very well. Our glasses were never half full, we were offered bread whenever our plates ran out, and they were very interested in making sure we had a good experience. My one issue is that our server wasn't as knowledgeable about the menu as with Bruell's other restaurants. She had to go and ask others for more information.

Ambiance: 4 -- really great ambiance and fitting for E 4th St. Lots of modern lines and decor, and lots of fairly well-dressed people coming in for dinner after work.

Food: 3.5 -- I ordered the spaghetti with seafood - a simpler dish, but I was really looking forward to it. Very simple flavors with the seafood and tomato. I would say that the salt water broth was the best -- really great combination and good flavor, but it wasn't very deep. The pasta wasn't particularly moving or fresh. 

My friend got the gnocchi - very popular at the restaurant, and he was very satisfied. It was restaurant week, so my beau got the prefixe which included the tuna tartare (I think), the vegetarian cannelloni, and a dessert. It was very average. I would say go with the gnocchi.
