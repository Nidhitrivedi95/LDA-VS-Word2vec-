hdZ_4Vd9opGm5UajNUuhwA How can anyone give this disgusting place more than 2 stars?!?!?
To start with the place is a mess and the employees look like they can't stand their job and treat everyone the same...badly!
The pizza is sitting all over the counter tops.  As you order it, they take the cold, old pizza and put it in the over to reheat it.  So, we ordered a calzone and bread knot instead.  BIG mistake! The calzone was probably even worse, a strip of mozzarella, a couple pieces of pepperoni, rolled up and sitting on the counter (hiding) waiting for some sucker to Order it.  Then they burn it to a crisp.
The tables and chairs are disgusting!  We asked for a rag and some cleaning spray and they said they didn't have any????  Ummmmm  how do you clean the back area?  Oh they don't!
