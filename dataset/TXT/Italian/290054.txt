zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA We visited yesterday for Happy Hour and we were very impressed. There were a ton of appetizer options on the HH menu--we ordered the fried mozzarella, meatballs with crostini, mozzarella piccolo, fried ravioli, and a Caesar salad (which wasn't on HH but was reasonably priced). All of our food was fresh and tasty, especially the salad. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and it had a nice, romantic vibe. Also, our waitress did a great job--she checked on our table the right amount. We can't wait to come back!
