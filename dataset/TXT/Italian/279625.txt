yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Some people recommended this place and I get why because the food is decent and comparatively in Vegas this place is pretty cheap.  It also has included unlimited garlic bread, soup or salad, and unlimited wine.  My wife and I are not big eaters so it made sense for us to split as we often do.  It's not a matter of being cheap its quantity.  This is why I am so-so on this place because the food was ok in my opinion.  My wife thought it was good.  We got the eggplant parmigiana.  It was done nicely but it is baked not fried.  This isn't a problem for us because we are health conscious anyways.  If you are eating and drinking on a budget I recommend this place or if you are looking for a lot of decent food for a "reasonable" price.  Otherwise there are better places to go.  

One last note.  There is a $13 charge for the additional person that doesn't order a meal in addition to the cost of the plate but you get a salad/soup and all the wine and garlic bread.  I should add this also come with a side of some basic pasta too.  This is totally reasonable.  so again if you are looking to fill up on the cheap then this is it.

P.S.  I forgot they finish the dinner off with a cappuccino which was very nice!
