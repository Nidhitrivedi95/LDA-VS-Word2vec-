I'll never pay for Pizza Hut ever again.  I'll eat it only if it's free, but I won't be very happy about it.

I tried their "Pizza Mia" in March, and it was horrible.  I got it because it was $5.  Big mistake.
I've never had such a bad pizza in my life.  The cheese was bad, the sauce was bad, the crust was bad, and the pepperoni was bad.  How does that all come out so horrible?

I'm not one to complain, but it was so bad that I went on their website to let them know.  I didn't know if maybe some of the equipment was dirty?  I don't know.  

ok, so I forgot all about it, and kind of just let it go.  Then just last weekend I ordered a different pizza because they were on sale.
Big mistake!
I was having problems with their website cause it's the worst, and the kid on the phone saw my info and had seen that i had complained MONTHS ago, and they NEVER even got back to me!  WTS?

So he at least apologized and said someone would call me.
A lady did, and she was horrible with the customer service.
She never once apologized that it took 10 months to get back to me!
She didn't even sound shocked that I didn't like their pizza, she said that the Mia pizzas are their "value line pizzas, using lesser quality ingredients"
No joke, her exact words.

Even the new pizza I ordered wasn't good, but I didn't even bother to bring it up to her.  She said thanks for my imput and that was the end of the call.  Lame.

I thought that I always liked Pizza Hut in the past, nothing sticks out as having bad experiences, but these last few times have ruined it for me.  There are too many other pizza places out there.  I'm not falling for Pizza Hut's cheap prices anymore.
I guess you get what you pay for.

This Yelp thing won't let me give zero stars, so I HAD to give one.
