JBrBsKpw0bbXK5nlrXVOYQ Anzios was recommended by the front desk at the Holiday  Inn, since it was in walking distance I gave it a try. I was not disappointed. I ordered the combination platter. Not only was the food hot and fresh but the customer service was top notch. If I am in town again, I am definitely coming back.
