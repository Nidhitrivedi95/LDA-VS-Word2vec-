pOhX1XjbBdPoO2Fyy8RGJg We went here because we had a groupon, would have been much unhappier if we didn't.  The service was mediocre, when we went to pay employees were just sitting around at the front talking, kinda weird.  We ordered fried mozarella which was decent but not that great.  The pizza was ok but I've definitely had better.  I can't really pintpoint it but in summary we won't be back.  It's a cramped space, pricey, and not high quality.
