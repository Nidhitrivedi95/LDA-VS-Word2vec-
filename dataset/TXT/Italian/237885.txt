u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Yum! I've only ever had the bruschetta so my review is based solely on those menu items. Everyone has a different "favorite," so you have to try them all to find yours. I really do think you can be full and satisfied by ordering just the bruschetta. Another tip is that you can order half boards. So you can say, "half salami & pesto, and half brie and apples" if you want to sample as much as you can in one visit.

Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil - yummy, a classic.
Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone - definitely my second favorite!!!!!
Salami with Pesto - delicious!!!!
Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes - delicious.
Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios - MY #1 ABSOLUTE FAVORITE
White Bean with Chopped Tomato - yum!
Warm Artichoke Spread - unimpressed. didn't live up to my expectations. I ordered this once and didn't bother to order it again on subsequent visits.
Brie & Apples with Fig Spread - I'm allergic to apples (weird, I know) so I cannot comment on this one. But my friends loved this. 
Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese - never tried this.
Smoked Salmon with Pesto - never tried this.
Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese - never tried this.
