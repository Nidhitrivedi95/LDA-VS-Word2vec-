iLLzOJLU4tPAN9UUHlyZiQ Oh, well. While quick to respond to my review and comment that Nico's  charged my credit card with a  $12 tip AND took my $15 cash tip with a promise to reverse the charge to my Visa - here it is, a week later and Nico's has NOT reversed the $12 they added to my UNSIGNED credit card bill. A $27 tip on a $60 bill was definitely not worth the food but it's worth the life lesson. I won't be going back! Walk down the street to Postino's instead! Save yourself the trouble
