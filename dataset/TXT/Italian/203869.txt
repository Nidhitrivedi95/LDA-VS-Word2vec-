Q8qsbFqIE7lwA-zkv07fxA Marios consistently serves excellent food with fast and friendly service.  To start, the garlic knots with marinara are totally addictive as another reviewer has pointed out! 

 If you are in the mood for something light, go with a salad and a slice.  My fav salad is the Mescalun (with candied walnuts, dried cranberry, and goat cheese with Italian dressing).  For the slice, I usually get chicken with mushrooms and black olives - but you can choose whatever you like.  The crust is just right - not too thick, not too thin. The sauce is good and the pizza is never greasy.  

But, if you are in the mood for something a little "heavier", they have excellent pasta and other traditional Italian entrees.  A couple of my favs here are the Eggplant parmesan, Chicken Marsala, and Seafood Fra Diavlo.  Also excellent is the Spinach Stuffed Shells!  The entrees come with a salad and garlic knots and are large enough to have leftovers to take home, which is a nice bonus!  This is one of my fav go-to places for a great meal at a great value.
