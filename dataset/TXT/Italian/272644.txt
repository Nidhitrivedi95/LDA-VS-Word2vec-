XvYtp_rwIWdd382zbQ6XjA Ate here on Saturday after soccer. I can see how people enjoy this restaurant as it was busy with baseball & softball teams. Kids were chewing down as parents ate and enjoyed adult bevies. However, the food was mediocre and left me with a stomach ache and my son got sick. The staff was super friendly, but the food was not good.
