GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA I was here for a corporate event during a recent trip to Las Vegas.  

We had a private room off to the side of the bar and a couple of staff members dedicated to our group.  Consequently we got pretty good service during the course of the evening.

the space was a little tight for mixing around during the cocktail hour.  However once we sat down, that's when the magic started.

After making some selections, the following food showed up on my plate.
course 1 - lightly breaded calamari - a little salty, but I still scarfed it down and it tasted great
course 2 - 3 pieces of ravioli.  I know this is a meal Battali used to grow his reputation, but I wasn't too excited by it.
course 3 - roasted beef rib.  This was slow roasted for 5 hours and was cooked to perfection.  Any time meat melts in your mouth it is pure heaven.  
course 4 - raspberry sorbet it was yummy and helped end off the meal on a positive note.

I found it odd how the staff constantly referred to Mario Battali during the meal, I wonder how the other "B" felt being constantly ignored during the service.

I cannot comment on pricing as this was an event the company paid for.
