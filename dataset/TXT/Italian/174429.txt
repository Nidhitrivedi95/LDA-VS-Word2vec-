nDfN1RkA40anfzjFGRO8qQ My husband made reservations here for mother's day brunch.  We have been wanting to try Bella Luna for several months and were looking forward to a delicious meal after church today.  We really wanted to love this restaurant - it is close, quaint, and not a chain restaurant.  Unfortunately, the meal and the service were both not at all what we expected.  The  brunch menu was extremely limited.   My crepes came out cold - literally, cool to the touch as if they had been sitting out for a long time after they were cooked.  My husband loved his chicken and mushroom crepe, and his meal was nice and warm covered in a sauce that he raved about.  Our son ordered a lentil soup and a pasta dish - when they brought our meals, they had nothing prepared for our son.  We, of course, waited until his meal was prepared before we ate, which took another 10 - 15 minutes.  For mother's day, they offered all of the mom's a single strawberry that had been dipped in chocolate.  Unfortunately, they placed this single strawberry on a hot plate, so the chocolate was melting off of the chilled strawberry.

As much as we wanted to adore this little restaurant, it just was not anything special at all today.
