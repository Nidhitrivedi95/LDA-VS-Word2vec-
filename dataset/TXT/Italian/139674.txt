JG26f5Ppxvmz1EP6nh2WkQ Came here for a birthday earlier this week. The food was delicious. We tried several dishes and my favourites were the lobster lollipops, the Creste Rigate (loved the crispy duck skin) and the Citrus Pot De Crème for dessert. 

The decor of the place is lovely. We had a large group so we were seated in the back room, next to the open kitchen and were able to talk to Chef Jay who is very accommodating and explained each dish to us as it came out. Over all it was a great experience and I will definitely be back!
