Our first pizza left us with  the feeling that this owner wanted to make his profits by seeing just how small an amount of toppings could be put on a pizza. This might work sometimes if the taste is amazing, which wasn't the case.  We decided to give them one last try, and ordered my wife's favorite "Marguerita pizza".
What we got was the most tasteless piece of pizza I've ever had.  It was a sparse amount of fresh mozzarella with sliced Roma tomatoes on a thin flavorless "water cracker like crust.  It had No BASIL, NO OLIVE OIL, NO SALT, NO OREGANO and NO FLAVOR.  Never again.
