znH36RmIAI4wcHy9WiEO5Q Really excellent and attentive service from wait staff but frankly, the food was disappointing. After reading the reviews here I expected something at the level of Bianco or Cibo. But my pie (called Forget About It) had the taste and texture just marginally better than Domino's pizza. Seriously.
This pizza had a bunch of stuff piled on and I think that's what might've killed it. It was just too much overcooked meat on top of overcooked cheese, on top of mediocre dough. 
The tiramisu was amazing, however. Very large, not soggy at all, just the right texture. Not too heavy not too light. 
Their house cocktails are good and strong. Try the Ciao Bella if you're in the mood for something sweet and citrus-y with a major kick. 

The restaurant itself is nestled in the Esplanade complex. Since most of it is empty, you might think the whole place is abandoned. Not so. Find the AMC Theatres sign, and you're in the right area. 
Dieci has mostly just tables and chairs, no booths. Everything feels pretty small and cramped compared to many similar restaurants in the Valley. 
Overall neither me nor my guest were impressed by Dieci.
