VeBNqe1pI5QBxVbquv0uoQ Hey, if you feel like waiting an hour and a half to be seated after being told it would be a 40 minute wait, and want to wait another hour for your food to be given to you, I've got the place for you... We got there around 7 and didn't get the opportunity to leave until about 11. Absolutely terrible customer service. Silverware is dirty, and they never bothered to bring an appetizer that was ordered. Don't bother.

Oh, but the food is decent.
