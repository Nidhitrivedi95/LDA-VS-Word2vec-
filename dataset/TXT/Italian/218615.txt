s2hzc_rFWYY9_-4TfrFGng Highly recommend eating here if you're visiting town for Progressive training or even if you're a local.  The prices are great and the pizza is extremely tasty.  He also offers other great Italian dishes.  

I'm from an Italian family and I'm pretty critical but I've gotta say I enjoyed the food and the chance to support my people and small business.  The owner runs the place personally and is a very friendly older gentleman.  Ingredients were fresh and the taste was authentic.  The crust was not too thick neither was it like one of those wood-fire cracker pizzas, it was just right.  I didn't call ahead, I was a walk in and he quoted me 15-20 minutes for the wait and my pizza was ready in about 10 minutes.  I'm just visiting town but I'll be back before I leave.  He also has his own wine!
