6I27BTuHI5PMvOBG4WS8NQ Love this restaurant! The food is absolutely delicious, full of flavour and definitely the best ravioli I've tried to date. Our group shared the appetizer with cheese and cured meats. I ordered ravioli, so delicious!! I couldn't stop talking about it for days. The portions are on the smaller side, compared to other Italian restaurants, yet even still, I was left with a feeling of satisfaction and a desire to order other dishes ( appetizer, and dessert). 

Service was excellent , even during a busy  Friday night. 

Definitely will come here again and bring my friends to try it!
