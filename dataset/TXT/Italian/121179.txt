HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A One of my favorite off the strip hotspots. I've been coming here for years and always leave very pleased, the decor is nice so definitely dress upscale. Some of my favorites include the Chicken Parmagiana, Chicken Vesuvio, and NY Steak Pizziola. All different but absolutely mouthwatering. My friend also raves about their Lobster Ravioli (they only make occasionally as the chefs special). She literally calls ahead to see if they have it that night. 

Mastrionis is Family run which is evident from the attention to detail throughout your entire dining experience. 

A must try!
