4tJiL2mHKO-erM6xoZji9Q The Cafe Milano needs to do a much better job of matching its menu to things it can do well.  On a visit earlier this week, they were out of coffee, out of guacamole, served cocktail sauce, not ketchup, with deep fried onion rings, and smothered their wings with overpowering barbecue sauce.  The only saving grace was a Tuscan chicken hoagie, which was very good.  That hoagie convinced me that if you want to have a good experience at Cafe Milano you better stick to things like pizza, hoagies or other standard Italian fare, apparently their strong points based on our visit.
