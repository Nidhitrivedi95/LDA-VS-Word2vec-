GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA I totally don't understand the low scoring on this place. The food here is phenomenal and the service is superb. My steak was amazing and the rest of our meals were delicious. 

It's been a while since I've been here but what I can remember of it made a long lasting one and I would recommend anyone who would like to indulge to give it a go. There is a reason why this is a celebrity chef Resturant the food speaks for it self. The Resturant itself can be a little bit bigger but the staff and the way they present your meal is HUGE. This Resturant this Resturant along with such as NoVe Italiano make it's high marks with me!!!  

Expensive but worth the money spent. Lucky for me I have a rich father in law to pay for it. LOL!
