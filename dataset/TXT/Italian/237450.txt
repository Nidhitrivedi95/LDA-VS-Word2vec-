u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg What a nice place. Visited for lunch on a Saturday to be greeted by friendly parking valets. Had a very tasty panini and entree salad with a few glasses of wine. Everything was wonderful and service was friendly, fast, and efficient. The building is also quaint and in a trendy location that provides a solid vibe.

Only complaints, minor ones: First, management has still not redone the wine list to reflect the absence of a selection which we know they haven't had for some time, as we visited the Gilbert location weeks ago; secondly, the on-tap beer selections are a tad embarrassingly underwhelming for a nice place like this. Yet, on the whole, a definite keeper.
