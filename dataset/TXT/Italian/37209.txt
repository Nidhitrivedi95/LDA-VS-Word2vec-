We had the caprese salad and crab cake appetizer. Mozzarella cheese was homemade and very creamy. Crab cake had really nice flavor. Two people in our party got the veal osso buco and loved it. It fell off the bone and had excellent flavor.  I had the chicken Parmesan rollatini and it was delicious. For dessert, the chocolate amaretto cake was incredible.  It was our favorite meal so far in Vegas. Everything was perfect. Servers were nice and very attentive.
