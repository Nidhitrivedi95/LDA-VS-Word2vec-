17Q4bVyFLxAJiht0lHdj-Q Went to Alice Fazooli's with my bestfriend after getting our nails did. Since it was a lovely night, we headed to the patio lounge area. It was live with great music with beautiful baskets of flowers surrounding us. We had a very kind server who never rushed us the whole time and I found her gorgeous because she had this brilliant smile across her face all night. To start we had the grilled calamari putannesca it was light and delicious. My friend decided to have a glass of Lamberti red wine and she loved it! Even though I personally love Italian wines, I decided to get there Pesca Bellini instead and it was totally worth it. For my main I had the butternut squash ravioli and it was slightly too a la dante for me but for future I may ask them to cook my pasta a bit more. Personally I love my local Italian cuisines in Woodbridge area but this place wasn't too bad at all ;)
