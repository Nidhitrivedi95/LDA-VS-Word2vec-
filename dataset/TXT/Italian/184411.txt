oHvWn9Xmg7mfzzj9ROS-8A Like eating at grandma's (excuse me, Nonna's) house.  Our last night in Phoenix brought us to this gem.  The only people who work there are the mother (server/hostess), father (cook) and daughter (server/hostess).  The food is very good, traditional Italian cuisine (melon with prosciutto for starters..ummmm!).  I went with a Pollo Scarapiello (sp?) which is chicken with white wine, peas and pancetta.  It was great.  Other dishes ordered were fettuccine, veal and penne.  You really do have the feeling like you're eating at someone's house instead of at at restaurant.  It is super casual, and very homey.   I will definitely return.
