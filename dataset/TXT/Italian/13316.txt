15YuEFO59yXd7BTO5NZgYw Vito, you have it figured out.   A nice repertoire of Italian faves, an explosion of seating options, fab espresso & extensive wine list, charming waitstaff, & Moretti Rosso.    I adore your sunrise sauce atop your homemade ravioli's and minus the chilled tomatoes in my insalata d'caprese, it was also delicious.    Totally acciented upon this gem while  lost in the desert and on my way back from Superstition Mountain, I landed here.   Mike, was the most well-oiled waiter machine I've ever met.   We came, we ate, we conquered - oh no, actually I guess Vito's conquered us.   Delicious.
