OPctv7y27uf5cRvChC2sKw I'm afraid the Cucina is barely adequate. I say this despite all the positives: very friendly service, a relaxed atmosphere, an excellent beer list, and good prices. The problem is the core product: the food. The ingredients did not strike me as being fresh. The grilled veggies accompanying my lasagna were not even edible. They tasted like they were either old, or had been dipped in kerosene, so I'll go with the old theory. The lasagna itself was edible, but basically mediocre. The penne pasta my companion ordered was also mediocre.
