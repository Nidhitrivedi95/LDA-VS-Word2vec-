r4HkiC71nB9k8Fe8zIORFQ First time ordering a pizza that after you place your order,they call you back 12 minutes later to tell you what the price will be. Was a bit strange but I wanted to try their pizza. I was looking for a big pizza to feed a family of 6. I was told that the large pizza has 10 slices, so I ordered one of those and a medium-size pizza. They were wrong, the large pizza came with eight slices. At least I have a medium size pizza left. The medium size and the large pizza are very similar in size TBH. The pizza was good, a little dry though. The pepperoni with olives was kind of rubbery, but I enjoyed the crust. 

What was really disappointing were the wings. I ordered hot and they are very mild and bland. This is AZ people! We like our food spicy. 

The salad was nothing to chirp about. Shredded lettuce and your typical sandwich toppings made into a salad. 

All in all I paid $50 for delivery and food and feel like I didn't get my money's worth. Also something I feel I need to add, is that the man who delivered the pizza must be a smoker because I could still smell the smoke on the plastic bags that contained our food. Yuck
