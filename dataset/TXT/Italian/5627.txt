_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw POMO = Apple?! Yes! Super short story: Back in the days the tomato was introduced to the Italians from the New World and was then used throughout their cooking. And since tomatoes have seeds in it, it is considered a fruit. The tomato is a fruit variation of an apple, hence pomo!  Hopefully I have captured and given the word Pomo its origin. If not, you are more than welcome to correct the story! :)

Anyway, the wait was 45 minutes. Started at the bar area to order some drinks. The Peach Bellini is a good sweet bubbly! Misters and the fan were on to help cool off in the summer heat. Within less than the suggested 45 minute wait we were seated to our table. 

All the pizza prices were roughly around $16 or so for thin crust pizzas cooked in a wood fire oven. We went for the calamari appetizer with a few surprises of fried shrimp, a couple lemon wedges to squirt some acidity over the breaded seafood. 

Pizzas:
Pomo - Italian sausage, roasted red bell peppers, sautéed onions and mushrooms over the pomodoro sauce and cheese. The crust was a bit on the chewy dry side. $15.95

Donna Rosa - (no tomato sauce pizza). Thin crust, with pesto sauce, cherry tomatoes and shrimp. A bit on the very salty side but overall was my favorite pizza. Pizza crust was more edible here. 

Calabessas - (I think that's what it was called). Thin crust as well, with tomato sauce, fried eggplant and shaved parmegiano cheese (which I loved). What I didn't like was the literal 4 teeny tiny pieces of eggplant about 0.34 cubic cm!!! What the heck happened here? A shortage of eggplant stock at the restaurant??? Not cool. 

Beverages: 
Pomo Lemon Drop - pomo juice (some pomegranate juice), vodka citrus, lemon juice. A bit strong and sour. $9
Peach Bellini - peach juice and champagne $8 

I would have to say that the intentions of the pizza menu was there but the ingredients were not.  With a little more care into the pizzas this place would be great. Good ambience.
