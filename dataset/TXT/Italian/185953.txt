OnLlTiUpFRRNOmqKkDUnRw So after much encouragement from fellow Yelpers to give this place another shot as the ownership had changed I have to say I still feel the same as I did the first time. I ordered the sausage supreme sub this time and it was pretty bad. It lacked luster, flavor, a sauce, SOMETHING!!! I could only eat half of my sub, it did nothing for me....  I was hopeful, I really was. :-/

***3rd Update*** So we tried their pizza this time. Opted for their super white pizza. I have to say their pizza surpassed their subs (slightly). When I called in my order the lady on the phone was all orgasmic about how good their super white pizza is and how she eats one slice of it every day. It was okay. WAY too oily from the olive oil they slathered all over it. I couldn't even say it was cheese grease, nope, slathered in oil. Not to mention there was supposed to be sausage on it. We were lucky to have gotten one or two pieces of sausage per slice. Idk. I really want to like this place but it just doesn't seem to be in the cards for me. Oh well!!!
