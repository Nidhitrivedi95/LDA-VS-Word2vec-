pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA What can I say about this place......it has good fresh food you can't usually get anywhere else. The owner/chef Eric, seems passionate about all he cooks/serves. There are times he has special nights with 10 course wine tastings that are worth reserving a spot for. Good date night thing. In the cooler months, there is a nice outdoor patio seating too.
Stop by for Happy Hour 3-6p, it's worth it.

Just look for the Roman Centurion soldier outside!
