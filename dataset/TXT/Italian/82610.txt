DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw I have to admit that I very rarely go to Italian restaurants. Why? Because I love to cook and I believe that I have mastered Italian cooking

That being said, I had an interview that involved being taken out to lunch and this was the chosen place. 

It far exceeded my expectations. Crisp and beautiful interior and amazing service. I had the salmon with vegetables from their lunch special. 

The bread was delicious and they killed the dipping oil. So good and my table mates kept asking for more. In fact, they all pretty much scraped their lunch special plates. 

My salmon was amazing. Light and perfectly cooked and the vegetables were tender but not mushy with a nice lemon sauce. I am glad that I went with that lunch as I did not want to carbo load up. I was nervous but pushed through those tummy flutters because it was so good!

P.S. --I nailed the interview and got the job!
