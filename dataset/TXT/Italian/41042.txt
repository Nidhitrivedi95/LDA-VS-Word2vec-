7JWWeXqil03Ua_wV9KN8ZQ Well. We have frequented luna rosa on numerous occasions. Our favorite waiter, Allassandro is most accommodating, customer oriented, and provides value added service. His friendliness, and attention to detail, will amaze you. The food is always prepared to our liking, appealing to the eye, and presented as gormet dining.  We really enjoy the enthusiasm Allassandro demonstrates while  he opens a bottle of wine. 
Allassandro is always professional. We always leave feeling like we were treated special. To the chef,
Thank you. To  luna rosa, thank you for wonderful dining. And Allassandro, thank you, for making our dinners always so pleasant.
