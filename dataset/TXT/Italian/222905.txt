skQ-HIR664Ivp2-A4kOfnA Went into restaurant yesterday for lunch. I have highly praised this restaurant in the past with great food and great service so I was excited to be stopping in again. I have to say the food was good but lacked sauce on lasanga. Service was bad. Real bad. Jaime was a real good waitress but has since left and this was first time I had been in since she has been gone. Service was horrible! Waitress was unprofessional and unfriendly. We asked for Parmesan cheese to top our lasagna and she was very skimpy with cheese. Acted like she was personally paying for it out of her own pocket. We didn't order drinks just water and she seemed to be annoyed that we were only drinking water. When we asked for additional marina on lasagna she charged us $2 extra on bill. If it would have had enough sauce on it we wouldn't have had to ask for more sauce. My experience really sucked and I'm very disappointed since I consider this one of my favorite places to eat. Don't think I will go in for a very long time if ever I decide to go back
