VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ Love it. I am not a bar person but this is the place to be! Amazing people, the bartenders and the lovely ladies make the experience that much better. I love eating outside. Even in 100 degree weather and some whiskey shots it was still fine in the shade... And I just found out they are getting misters ! Cool . We have gone at all different hours but only the happy hour 3-6  pm or 3-6 am. Both times were cool. And free check in whiskey shots! Psssst. Do not get the coffee infused. I like coffee and I love whiskey but not together. They are slightly new but business in great.
