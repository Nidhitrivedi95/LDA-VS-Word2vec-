jluEI1ZDQDeJlbl-M3YH3Q I made reservations to Toula for Valentines Day dinner. The view wasnt as spectacular as I expect. It was a fixed menu that composed of 4 courses + a drink. 

The service here was extremely unprofessional. The waiters weren't attentive or caring. We waited for a total of 1 1/2 hours just to get our appetizers.... and another 1/2 for our main course.. keep in mind that they would of left us hanging if we didnt complain about the service and repetively told them to check to see if the food is ready.. what kind of restaurant makes their customers have to ask to check on their food? 

Anyway on top of that, they brought out the wrong appetizers. The food wasnt as appetizing as expected.. I would rather go to the keg or jack astors instead. If you guys think Chinese restaurants have bad service, wait until you experience it at Toula. It was $75/ person and the bill came up to $206 hahaha pretty outrageous. They also accidently charged us for 2 cokes.. which we didnt even order. And they automatically include a 20% tip which was $30..... they didnt even deserve $5 tbh. 

Never again. This is truly a Valentines I will never forget.
