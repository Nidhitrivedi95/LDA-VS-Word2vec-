Amazing homemade pasta apparently done from scratch each day. I tried the agnoletti alla lilli with spinach, ricotta, parmesan, sage -- and lots of butter. Just perfect pasta, I love that about proper Italian places. The wines are very expensive and the prices for half a bottle make no sense given what a glass costs, but I couldn't commit to a bottle so I tried a tequila and lemon cocktail that was quite nice. The service was friendly and prompt; the food came quickly, and there is a tremendous variety of seating. A fun, family-style, high-end Italian restaurant using quality ingredients. I look forward to trying the pizza another time.
