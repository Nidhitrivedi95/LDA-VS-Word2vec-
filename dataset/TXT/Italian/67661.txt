BQqwIYQuo2W94smjrBjy5g I hate to complain but im not sure how they collected 5 stars from so many guests. Our spaghetti was average, nothing special. The risotto was not good; rice was tough, not creamy as risotto should be and the "crispy pancetta" was more like tough chicken. Added to that, our repeated request for water refill went unheeded until dinner was over and a complaint of same was made. I love to dine out but I'm not a fan here. Too bad...attractive restaurant and lovely music from guitarist.
