VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Beautifull venue but Quality of food and service to be reconsidered....  We were expecting higher quality of food in this restaurant....The tuna tartar was really ade and no taste... The server was pouring wine to the top of the glass with splilling on the table... Overall experience was not great.
