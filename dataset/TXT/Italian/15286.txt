1rebduwtmrHQhl32djRS7A I had been wanting to try this place for a while and have heard very good things from friends that have tried it. I ordered a meatball sub and hot dog to go. The hot dog came butterflied on a toasted sesame bun and the meatball had good sized portion meatballs with a tasty sauce and cheese on a toasted bun. I am a meatball snob but really enjoyed the sandwich. I can't wait to go back to try other things on the menu and eat in the restaurant. The atmosphere was comfortable and warm and the customer service was friendly and timely.
