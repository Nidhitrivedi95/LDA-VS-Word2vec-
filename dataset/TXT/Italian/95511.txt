epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ Food was excellent!!!  However if you have to wait for your table don't have a drink here.....the bartender service is very slow.  Have them text you and grab a drink elsewhere.  Mia Bella Pasta was fabulous.....wonderful sauce and the meatballs were perfect.  Nice wine selection....not a lot by glass, so order a bottle.
