fzxvmA3Ygu3yrQQ6-cEpTw We have read such glowing reports, so tonite was the nite we decided to try Mora.  Maybe we missed the boat, or the absence of the chef was the reason, but we were sure disappointed.  There were 4 of us.  We all tried different entrees and salads.  We started with the $10 bread plate with 4 different things to put on the bread.  I rarely have to salt anything but tonite was the nite.  None of the spreads had any taste, so I had to ask for a salt shaker.  It helped a bit.  Even the garlic was bland.  On the bread platter (which the platter itself was large)  received I believe 4 average sizes of bread and 4 sauce cups for the 4 spreads..  Then the caesar salad arrived, and it too was void of any taste that is in a Caesar salad,....no garlic, no anchovy, no salt, no lemon, bland parmesan...One person had the tomato salad with no unusual tomatoes, like zebra, or yellow, or orange, or purple, just pale pink tomatoes.  Pizza was burned on the bottom, the octopus salad had lots of garbanzo beans, itsy bitsy potatoes, some more sauce without flavor, plus  a few 4 inch pieces of grilled, or charred octopus.  The Halibut was with kind of a lemon sauce with vinegar.  We thought it was quite bad, so my husband didn't finish it.  All in all, it was pretty awful..  The place is very attractive.  Had we known the soux Chefs weren't trained and couldn't prepare food the way the owner supposedly would have expected, we would not have stayed.  We would have gone elsewhere.  So while the chief's away, the cat's sure did play...
I would say for $120 per couple, including one drink per person, it was not even worth it.  Sorry,  but this review is well deserved.  I want to give credit for the nice servers.
