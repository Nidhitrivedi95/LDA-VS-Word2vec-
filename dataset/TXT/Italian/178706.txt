NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ I've been coming here for about 3years. During the World Series of poker there are few restaurants to eat at in the Rio. My first few times coming here (3years ago) I had an amazing experience the food and service were 5star and it was one of the things I looked forward to while staying at the dingy Rio Hotel. Anyways I ate there 2x in July. The first time just my boyfriend and I dined there and after our meal our stomachs went hay wire for 2days! We got so sick! Then we went back with another couple. Because we werent 100% sure that it was Martoranos that made us sick, but low and behold after the 4 of us went to dinner EVERYONE had horrible issues with their digestive system. I dont know if the food was spoiled or if they just over did it on the grease but we never plan on returning there. It tasted great but the after affects were not worth it. It almost makes me loose my appetite when I think about what exactly they are doing in their kitchen that made everyone so sick.
