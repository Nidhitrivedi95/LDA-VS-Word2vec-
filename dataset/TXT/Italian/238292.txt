u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Came here for the first time for my girlfriends bday the other night. The table we sat at was a low coffee table with couches all around it. I had a chicken panini I can't name at the moment, but it was delicious! Between the ambiance and the food, I have to say I'll be back soon. A+
