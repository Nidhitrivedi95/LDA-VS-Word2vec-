gJdoJM35atJF2_VwxAgNBg I really wanted to like this place but I was very disappointed with my experience. I ordered delivery and it took a little over 2 hours to arrive even though they are located very close by. When I called to ask about my order the man who answered was very rude and sounded annoyed that I was asking about my order that was 2 hours late by that point. I ordered their gnocchi with meat sauce. When the food arrived it was hot (at least) but very disappointing. The meat sauce itself was alright and did have some flavour but the gnocchi was actually inedible. It had zero flavour and was so soft and mushy it looked and felt like mashed potatoes or paste. Although maybe I just chose the wrong item to order, there was nothing good about this experience aside from the fact that the portion size was big and the price was reasonable and I really don't think I would every try this place again.
