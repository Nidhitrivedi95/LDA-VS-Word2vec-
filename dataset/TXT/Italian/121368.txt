HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A Wow !!! What a hidden gem is this place. We when here with my fiancée for our one year anniversary. I didn't expect to be as good as the review said they would be. But it delivery greatness in our meal. 
I forgot to try their garlic knots, but will most definitely become a regular. Reminds me of a nice joint I used to go to in Hollywood California. Anyway. This is what I had. 
We started with shrimp scampi the shrimp was jumbo shrimp. It was hugeee ( trump voice ). Very savory. Followed by bruschetta and end with our entree she had grill salmon with spinach and I had chicken penne spinach with pink sauce which I think that's they're home made sauce. I can't wait to go again and try other appetizer and entree.
