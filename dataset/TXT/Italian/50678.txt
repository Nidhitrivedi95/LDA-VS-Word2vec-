9bxcpud3GREFOxKY2cbheA we just stopped by for dinner on the way to a movie. ordered a spinach artichoke dip and a veggie pizza. some observations:
- the chips that came with the dip were super hot and freshly made. 
- the pizza dough was really soft and the entire pizza was well cooked
- cheese on the pizza felt very fresh. 

The place looks very normal with a rock and roll theme to it. I highly recommend it.
