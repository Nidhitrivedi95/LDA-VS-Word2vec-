r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA Love love love this place! I have had dinner here twice and will continue to go. It's a small little store which also has a restaurant inside. You order your food and someone will bring it to you! I love how quickly they bring out the food, but most of all how delicious it is. The whole size comes with salad as well as some garlic bread. I have tried their mac n cheese, stuffed shells (super good), and lasagna...they all tasted yummy!
