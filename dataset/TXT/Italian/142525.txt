Jpyh7MfaNysY3geXjhzqJQ Best pizza in town. Good service and family friendly environment. Fun games on the patio like Foose ball, connect 4 and bag toss. After having a very rude experience at a different restaurant I felt the need to share good, honest, family reviews on places we enjoy. Thanks Char, keep up the good work.
