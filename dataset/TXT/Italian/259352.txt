WKlMFUCGI7dCysGkFLWvaQ Relatively new restaurant that we tried for the first time last night. The four of us shared their homemade mozarella cheese with red peppers and prosciutto appetizer that was very tasty. 

I believe all of their pasta is homemade. My wife and I both had the fettucine with peas, pancetta and bread crumbs in a cream sauce. We both really liked the dish, but the portions were huge and we brought home enough for another dinner. I had the roasted beet salad with gorgonzola, which was excellent and was large enough to share. 

One of our dinner mates had the pork loin that he said was nothing special. His date had the ravioli that must have pretty good since it disappeared from her plate. 

We shared a lemon tart and a Nutella mousse.....both very good. 

Stagioni is BYOB, which made the evening's bill quite reasonable! The waitstaff were all very efficient and unobtrusive. Well done!!

You're probably wondering why I only gave it 2 stars. I would have given it 3.5 except for two things......the noise level was exceedingly high, over 90 decibels most of the time with a peak of 105 after a noisy group joined the room. Sorry but the dining experience is ruined when it gets this loud. 

Second problem is the single door entry that let chilly air blow over the every time it was opened. Why can't Pittsburgh restaurants use those temporary exterior vestibules like they do in NYC?

We will go back again because of the food and hope for a warm evening and a soft spoken crowd.
