GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA My wife and I have eaten here twice, with the first time being about 5 years ago. It's a classy restaurant with great service.

The food is prepared at the highest standards, and the in-house Sommelier helped us pick out an amazing bottle of wine.

While the dishes are seasonal, the best meal I've eaten here was Wild Boar Stroganoff.
