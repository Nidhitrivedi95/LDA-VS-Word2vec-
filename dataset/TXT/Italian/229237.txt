t43XJ7we7RugvqM5ytr_WQ Attached to Smith's grocery, the little store front does not give one the impression that delectable dining awaits behind the solitary door. But once inside one is instantly greeted with wondrous aromas that trigger salivary glands before the brain has time to identify the source. Friendly and personable chefs and waitresses are quick to welcome and seem happy to serve. The decor and atmosphere are traditional and relaxing with soft contemporary and Little Italy music in the background. 
Pie Zanos offers take-out and dine-in services but unlike similar chains, there is no skimping on the full restaurant experience. Tables are fully equipped with tablecloths, a complete set of silverware, and a generous variety of spices and oils. Everything is neat and tidy and one is not left searching for the neatest bottle of Purell. 
There is a scrumptious selection of appetizers, entrees and desserts to choose from, all of which are very reasonably priced. So far I have zeroed in on the wide variety of savory pizzas. The sauce, abundance of perfectly textured cheese, and cartload of toppings stuffed between two pizza pies makes for an EPIC  experience. If you ever wondered what it feels like when taste buds have an orgasm, visit Pie Zanos. You will not be disappointed.
