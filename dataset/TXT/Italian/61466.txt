aylmrtz1AaFQTeM62cul0Q This was easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.  It was like this restaurant was stuck in the 1980's in terms of dining and decor.  I'm surprised to see that they actually have a website, I don't think they had those in the 80s.  But anyways, moving on to the food, huge portions of poorly thought out and poorly executed dishes.  I had the 'French Onion Soup' or more accurately, the overwhelming about of baked mozzarella that had some onion soup hiding under it.  The table then got a side of 'Sauerkraut Balls', these were conceptualized as a way to make something that's not so unhealthy (sauerkraut), unhealthy (fried sauerkraut).  The balls then came out with cocktail sauce....sauerkraut and cocktail sauce...  Moving on, I ordered an entree of the 'Grilled Filet of Salmon'.  An overcooked flavorless version of otherwise a relatively simple dish.  The rest of my family that unfortunately also had to suffer through the dining experience felt similarly about their dishes.  And then to top it off, the waitress gave attitude when no one wanted to-go boxes of the sad attempts of sustenance that was laying on our plates.
