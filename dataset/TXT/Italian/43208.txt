7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw Now how did this slip by?  been here over 20 times, not sure why/how i missed writing about it - i would suppose it's not exactly 'up there' & 'all that', nor really not bad either.

The major saving grace here would be there comfy patio: ESPECIALLY if you snag a sofa.  And it's not one of those patios facing a road - it actually has grass, birds, fountains.... {o, um, ok: alot of kids playing in the water ---- but the peals of laughter still better than traffic}.

Their HH is awesome: 1/2 off all bottles of wine - by glass or bottle - and that goes down quite well in my books - thank. you. very. much.

a few yummy appies at GR8 prices.

luv the angel hair pasta with basil & tomatoe sauce - i add chicken.

i know which waitress will be a relaxing experiencing - and which one, (when she walks toward me i go - o no.... please no...) will not be so fabby... (i had her today) ah well.....  add the bottle of wine, rose coloured glasses, our temps, the sunshine, and thinking of all my relatives back east who still have another mth or so to enjoy patio life - and guess what? 

it's all good......
