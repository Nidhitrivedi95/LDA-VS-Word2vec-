R7eLlAdeIYsxux_Vm0l5sg Extensive menu and good food were spoiled for me by the unpleasant atmosphere. The host was surly and the waitress was incompetent and impersonal. The staff overall seemed uncaring. We were there mid-afternoon on Saturday and the restaurant was by no means overly busy. I might go back for take-out.
