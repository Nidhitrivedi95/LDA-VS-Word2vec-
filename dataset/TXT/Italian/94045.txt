ElFjivhz41XfFiOogtTCvg I went here on Valentine's Day. The service was so slow. It took them 20 mins to get my boyfriend and me water and we actually asked for it twice. For the 4 course meal, it also took so long, like 30 mins for each course. They has Valentine's manu for that day but I asked for regular menu as well because I wanted to order something else. The waitress gave me the manu but when I finally decided what to order, she told me that they couldn't do regular manu because they don't have enough time. Anyways, the food is good; just the service.
