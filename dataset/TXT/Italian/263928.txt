WX8cx6tfFcEn0cK4cIbWag My husband ordered red snapper and he thought it was very good. I ordered pasta and shrimp but my pasta was hard and not cooked. They immediately gave me a new plate of pasta and the second plate was al dented pasta and very good. The waiter was excellent and the service was amazing.
