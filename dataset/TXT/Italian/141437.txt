jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg I wanted to take a moment to tell whoever is in charge of a situation I experienced. Three weeks ago, my husband and I had a very bad experience. The waiter was not attentive, our food was cold, and when asking for a manager, he never got us one. However, he claimed he did. The story is too long, but because of a wonderful assistant general manager, she took the time to make everything right for our following visit. Honestly, I hadn't planned on returning.Our recent visit from July 13, 2017 was extraordinary. The two key people that changed our opinion of Buca di Beppo was   Vicki Banusevich and Fallon Natolitani.  We had impeccable service as well as wonderful food.Thank you for having a caring staff. This experience could have had a different ending.
