aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw Bartolotta's is probably as good as it gets. Everything is superb. This is a true Italian epicurean delight. Service was perfection and the food some of the best fish I have ever eaten. Very romantic. And they actually have a dress code (not oppressive but thank God you won't see anyone there in a T-shirt and shorts.)

But don't even THINK about going to Bartolotta's unless you plan on dropping a bundle of cash; the food was great, but so was the price!!
