FhVYpbvE8IQeUHAcwPPIXg Awesome find! Heard from a friend about this little gem. The atmosphere is adorable! Great little bar. Awesome service. The wait staff and management were soooooo nice and attentive. I loved the bread and salad that came with our meals. My sister had the Alfredo, which was different because it was really peppery. I had the pesto, which was very light and yummy. If you're looking or something different than the usual Italian places, give this one a try. Pairing this restaurant with the candy store next door and a movie would be a GREAT date night!
