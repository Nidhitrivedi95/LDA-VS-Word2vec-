This restaurant is perfect for big group parties and special occasions. The resto offers wood oven pizza. Staff is super warm and friendly and interior is cozy and rustic ...as soon as you walk in you can't help but notice their beautiful wood oven. Their pizza's are truly tasty and they are very generous with their toppings. Truly enjoyed their food and would recommend.
