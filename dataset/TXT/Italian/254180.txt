VVeT1XqQYwrB_fbp3efdUg The first comment I must note about this restaurant is the interior decorating. It has a different kind of feel and made me feel like I was tucked in a nice decorated alley on a side street of Chicago. 

I've only gone here for the hot dogs and that's all I want to go here for. I'm sure their hamburgers are just as delicious, but I've got other places to get that fix. The menu is easy to read and not scattered around. I always go for the combos because it's fast and usually ends up being the cheapest. They range from about $5.50 to $8.50, the latter being a double dog combo. 

I can't complain about the dogs. They are made fresh and taste thick and juicy. No squishy meats or filler seen in the dogs I've had. Their fries are just as good and sliced in house and fried when ordered. Can't go wrong with fresh, right? They even have a slogan on the wall that states they use "no nukes" for your food. 

The place is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. Good place to go for lunch if you're in the mood for a hot dog and fries!
