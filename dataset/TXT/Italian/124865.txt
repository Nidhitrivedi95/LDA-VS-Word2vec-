Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ Tried this joint from all the reviews.  Crust was horrible. owner should order dough from the people that supply PAPA John'... I will not be back to this place..  The cheese and sauce were really good,, can tell the quality of the cheese, i like either lisanti or grande moz cheese...  My issue is with the dough..  Fix the dough and this can be a great place...

I tried this place again,, mainly because i wanted to give them a chance.  I hate giving a bad review to business owners who are try hard to put out good food and are trying to make a living...  The dough was the same,  seems to lack gluten, I have made dough in the past, and i thought the dough we produced, gave us a great crust that most of us are looking for.  Unfortunately i do not like this dough... If they used my dough and the ingredients they use,, this place would be the best in N Las Vegas...  Lisanti high gluten pizza dough is what we used... Just saying... Hope this yelps
