ft5LUuDwmS8ONnI7AooLjQ The worst tasting crepe in the city is here.   It came cold, was clearly reheated/microwaved, and tasted like it was days old and had been frozen.   The price of a crepe will seem cheap, and perhaps entice you to order it - resist!.

The reason this place doesn't get 1 star is for its selection, price and quality of gelato.   The gelato is pretty good, stick to that if you find yourself here.   They have wifi, a patio and a great location.

When the place first opened, the staff were quite rude (possibly the owners?), but now I go at times when they have new-er (female) staff, and they're not a problem.

If you are going to eat the Zazzu (pizza in a cone), it has possibly been a long time since you were in the gym.   Order this saturated fat nightmare at your own peril.
