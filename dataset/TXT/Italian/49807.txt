9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Cibo provided a mixed experience on a Sunday night.  My son enjoyed his pizza, Da Vinci (?), while my DIL was disappointed with her Di Norte.  The child's pizza looked good and was enormous.   My pasta and red sauce was very nice.   Service was good, price point was excellent, and the atmosphere was casual and comfortable.  Sitting outside was lovely. 
 
I looked forward to a Crepe Suzette and introducing my family to this delicacy. The Crepe Suzette was a disaster.  The server couldn't get the syrup to light in order to flambé, which destroyed the presentation, in addition to the flavor.  The syrup didn't have the rich fragrance of Grand Marnier, just alcohol, the crepe had marmalade in it instead of the decadent orange, butter syrup, and was a soggy, doughy mess.  My DIL described it has an alcohol soaked tortilla.
