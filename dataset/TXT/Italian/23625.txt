3yMmo1sERpks50quoaA8PQ Wow what a great place! It was busy when we went Saturday night but well worth the wait. Food was amazing from the house salad to the entrees! There was four of us in my party and our bill came to $104. Not bad at all for the quality of food we got. The waiter was attentive and surrounding enjoyable. The lighting was a little low but still manageable. The hot fresh garlic bread to the table was a nice touch as well!
