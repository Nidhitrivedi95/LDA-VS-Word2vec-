The waiter was beyond GREAT with the kids, and suggested a kids table so the adults could chat. With the "Kids Eat Free" on Sundays, I can see this becoming a regular after church outing for our group. Only suggestion is a changing table - if possible in the tiny bathroom. We are regulars at the Arrowhead location.
