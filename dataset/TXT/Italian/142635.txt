Jpyh7MfaNysY3geXjhzqJQ Tucked in the corner, nice little modern vibe. They've got an open bar as well. My boyfriend and I looked at the family eating near the front and saw the sizes of the pizza...we decided we would each get our own pie. We didn't customize our own but rather ordered off the specialty pizzas. I got the capricciosa and the boy got the pesto party. In addition we got a board of bruschetta. So we ordered our pizza from the first station and then if you want bruschetta you go down to the next station. Then once you've ordered you head to the register where you can order drinks and whatever else. A bit on the pricy side and we only got waters. But it was a nice experience and the food was delicious. Might be nice to come back and enjoy a drink and a board with some friends. Love that it's not too far from home
