xjjxHavx4RIiW6zS6rasGA This is a very nice contemporary Italian restaurant.

We were here last week for dinner and enjoyed the experience.  Our burrata caponata appetizer was very good.  The burrata was nice and creamy and rich and was delicious spread on their bread.

The service was attentive throughout and I appreciated them bringing an ice bucket for our Sonoma Cutrer wine without having to ask.

I had the bucatini amatriciana and my friend had the shrimp risotto.  Both were good but not mind-blowing.

Overall it was a delightful meal and I'll definitely be back.
