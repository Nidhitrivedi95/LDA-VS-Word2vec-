So132GP_uy3XbGs0KNyzyw We went to Casa di Amore last night for dinner and it was perfect. Even though we arrived at 830 on a Saturday night without a reservation, the hostess didn't give us any attitude, she just directed us to the bar. We ordered drinks and bruschetta and chatted and listened to the live music. About 30 minutes later they called us to a table, which seemed quite reasonable given the crowd.

Our server was friendly and prompt, and the food was great. We all thought the live music was a plus - more interesting than canned music, but at a volume where we could still talk. It's nice to have a place where you can hold a conversation without having to shout.

We left with wonderful memories and will definitely come back on our next trip to Vegas.
