HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA ONLY reason i'm giving 4 stars is because dinning room could be a bit cleaner. With that said....You don't go to this place for the low lit dinning room. Food this good you don't need light to eat! Pizza was so good we ate there 3x on a 5 day Vegas trip (once nor twice was just not enough!). Now it's a MUST GO when ever in Vegas! 
Pizza was PERFECT, great sauce, crispy edge crust and plenty of toppings! NOTE: If traveling with kids don't visit the location on S. Arville St!
