ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg When my friend first told me to meet him here I was a little skeptical. Really, all I knew is that were going to some sort of strip mall/plaza on Hayden and Indian Bend. After driving around, I spotted the place behind the grocery store.

Not only is this place cute with high and low tables, we made it just in time for happy hour! Can't complain with half-off all items from the bar and apps. 

The Pro's:
--Happy Hour is awesome
--The Mozzarella Encorozza is delicious (though it is basically mozzarella sticks
--The rustica pizzas are delicious - went with the garlic + eggplant, and bella rosa, both good
--They have gelato and mini cones that are just $1

The Con's:
--The pizzas are odd shaped. It just makes it a little more difficult to carry out a pizza.
--The location is not ideal and a little difficult to find.

Overall, I'd definitely go back and try out some of their other pizza options.
