My daughter and I ordered a Greek salad and a small Mac n cheese pizza to share for lunch. I have tried Mac n cheese pizza at other  places in the area  and I would say this is the best one I've had.  The crust had a nice consistency and the four cheese Mac n cheese was nicely browned. The order of beignet we had for dessert was huge!  Four people could easily share the plate that came accompanied by a nice raspberry sauce.
