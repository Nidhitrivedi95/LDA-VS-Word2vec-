G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Over the Thanksgiving weekend, the mad Russian and I went to visit my sister in Las Vegas and had to try to the new restaurant in town. We had a little time to kill so we went down to the casino and won some money, so the night was starting in the right direction.
We were seated promptly and had a choice table by the windows. Our waiter, Joseph came straight away and offered us a specialty cocktail menu from which we decided on 3 Blue Velvets. Beautiful to look at and somewhat sweet for my tastebuds but good none the less. The decor is very nice and the restaurant is not loud at all. The waitstaff was very attentive and had all the plates cleared and kept the water glasses full. We ordered a shrimp pizza, veal chop, bucatini and a side of mushrooms. All were presented beautifully and came out hot. I'd offer another half to one star, but after dessert and coffee, our bill came and we were charged for food we ordered and wanted but did not get to try since it hadnt been delivered. 
Upon pointing out the mistake, our waiter corrected our bill very courteously and apologized for the oversight. Overall, we had a great meal and would come back on a future visit.
