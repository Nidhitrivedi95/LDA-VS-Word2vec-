aqrTv6QiU0J9Sxm_T--c5g Decided to try this place out last night. We have been driving by this place for years and never tried it. I'm so glad that we did. We had to wait a bit for a table even with a res but it gave us a chance to review the menu. Our waiter was interesting but he was hilarious and overall knowledgable and entertaining. We started with toasted ravioli which was tasty. I had the the minestrone soup as well. Probably the best minestrone I've ever had! I could eat that every day. I didn't see a particular item on the menu that I wanted which was just plain gnocchi with tomato cream sauce. The waiter said the kitchen could prepare it with no problem! The gnocchi came out perfectly cooked. I wish we were able to try one of their many desserts but we were so full. Great place for great italian! Skip the chain across the street and try this little place out! We will definitely be back.
