_AVXgkX4DiNQAQj_3tNhFQ I tend to visit Mercatto for business lunches as it is located right across the street from my office. While service can be a bit uneven (I've been rushed and I've been ignored), generally I find the restaurant is good. 

My favorite items on the menu are the gnocchi, the pizzas and the cheese and charcuterie platters. This location also has an incredibly pressurized wine bar; this means that they can offer dozens of wine by the glass as they are all kept fresh within the pressurized enclosure behind the bar. 

Great for a quick bite.
