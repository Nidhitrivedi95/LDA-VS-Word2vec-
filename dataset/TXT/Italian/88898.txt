Awesome things about Flour:
- All of their noodles are made in-house. They have a cook who comes in during the middle of the night and makes all their noodles fresh. After dining at Flour, I now totally recognize the difference that homemade noodles make in an entrée.

- Complimentary valet. This is a rarity for anywhere near the bustling Eton Place!

- Really awesome custom drink menu. The Blueberry Sparkler is so legit. Props to their Wizard of Cocktails.

- If you're there for dinner, make sure you're reading the menu correctly. You can purchase entrees in either a "little" or a "lotta" size, but what it really means is "appetizer" size or "full" size. Go with the "lotta" size if you're looking for an entrée.

We started with the fried olives, which are stuffed with goat cheese. Even if you don't like olives, you can get into these cheesy tarts of goodness. The Lamb Rigatoni is absolutely to die-for...super tender meat, tasty sauce and the most delicious homemade rigatoni. 

Literally everything that crossed are table, down to the complimentary bread, exceeded my expectations. If you're dining on the weekend, try to make a reservation around 4/5pm to avoid the mad rush. Either way, i'm sure you'll find the wait worth it.
