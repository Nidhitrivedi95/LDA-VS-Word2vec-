u9R0_pvEkl7QGPJYH3j1sg Just moved to this neighborhood and Times Square Pizzeria is my favorite restaurant in the area so far.  My girlfriend and I went there the other night for dinner and we split a margherita pizza and the Pasta Giovanni (ordered it with angel hair instead of the penne).  We were very impressed with both dishes!  Two night later, I find myself getting some Pasta Giovanni as a to go order.

We also went here for breakfast about a month ago for our first visit.  Great breakfasts at a great price!  

Based on the amazing aroma of this place when walking in you can tell it is going to be good food.  I highly recommend Times Square Neighborhood Italian Restaurant.  I'm sure to be back again and again.
