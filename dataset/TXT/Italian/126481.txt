hSU3MbB9Yu8MlybxfmABeg I was in town with some family and we popped into this little joint on a low key Tuesday afternoon. Almost everything we had was amazing!  Appetizer: mozzarella and tomato basil - how can you go wrong? it was great!  The 4 of us split all of our entrees so we could all samp!  Dish One: Spinach Ravioli (3 came to a dish)-- it was decent! Dish Two: Italian sausage and peppers-- soo good but you better be ready for some spice! When we walked in that is all we smelled in the restaurant so we definitely wanted to order the sausageeeee! it was very flavorful! Dish Three: The Flavella (sp?) was excellent according to the rest of the table - I did not try it. Dish Four: Pepperoni Pizza - it was mediocre. I was expecting more to be honest so I would not recommend.

Overall, great little joint! I would return !
