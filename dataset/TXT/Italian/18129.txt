2l25CpGNVKaxGXZKTzu2Kw Me and my girlfriend went here to have breakfast, I had the "Sel & Sucre" and my girlfriend had the "Bagellox".

Both of the dishes tasted super good, mine was a crepe with egg, bacon, ham and cheddar. It came with potatoes with parmesan on them, it also had fruit on the plate (you could check the picture I added to see what it looked like). 

My girlfriend had the Bagellox and as you can guess it was two bagel halves with salmon and cream cheese (which came separate). It also came with salad (no dressing though) 

Waitress was really friendly and we got our food quickly, and she asked us if everything was okay and if we needed anything after getting our food. So overall the experience we had was really good, I had never been here before! 

PS: Try their freshly made orange juice its really really delicious!
