bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw Went for brunch on Sunday for the first time and fell completely in love! From the atmosphere to the food and service, everything was outstanding! My boyfriend and I each got an appetizer, main course and endless mimosas and/or bloody Mary's and paid a total of like 53 bucks(not including a tip) but about $25 a person...what a steal! I definitely recommend this place to anyone! I wish I remembered our servers name because she truly provided such awesome service. She was extremely knowledgable, friendly and made sure we didn't stay thirsty by staying on top of our mimosa refills! I know I'll definitely be going back again soon!
