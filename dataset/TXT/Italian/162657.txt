lRgjSzMaohV4ElBSlVCezA I've never been a PE fan. PE of the Italian nature in this particular case, but the boy wanted pizza, I wanted kitchen tiles and definitely didn't want the options in our local area. To Leith! And to the offerings on both the tile and pizza front. With great reluctance (me), we settle on Pizza Express as it has a greater variety of options for the non meat eater. 

And I have to say, along with my pizza, I'll eat my words, as this was good pizza. I had the vegetarian 'doughnut' pizza i.e. pizza with salad in the middle (500 calories baby) complete with roasted onions, courgette and pepper. Delicious! The boy enjoyed his chicken pizza in equal measure. 

PE - I stand corrected, you are very worthy of my coinage. At least at this branch.
