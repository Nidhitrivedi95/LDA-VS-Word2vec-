3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A Probably one of my favourite places in TO so far.  The place is adorable, just my kind of place.  Small, intimate, dark... staff I want to be friends with.  

Went the first time without a reservation and we lucked out and got two seats at the bar.  I personally love the atmosphere of the bar, and I asked the bartender to just take liberties with wine pairings for the things we ordered.  I loved that he was up for it, asked a few questions about what I liked and then just made decisions for me.  Good work, sir.  We started with the risotto balls.  My boyfriend is obsessed with risotto balls in general, so we order them every time they're on the menu.  By far the best we've had in a very long time.  For dinner we shared the cacio e pepe and the gnocchi.  The pastas could NOT have been better.  The gnocchi is like a tiny pillow made of heaven, happiness and carbs.  I firmly believe that this gnocchi could not have been better made if italian angel-chefs flew down from heaven and made them.  Delicious.  

Can not WAIT to return.
