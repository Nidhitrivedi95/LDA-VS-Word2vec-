dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg I love Oregano's! The portions are so big and always delicious. 

I've been to this location a number of times and the service is always on point. Great staff! All of them that comes in contact with you says hello or welcomes you to Oregano's.

Nice, relaxing ambience; with indoor and outdoor seating.
