h_xy5XuOiKqk-6OpQTGJvQ When this place opened, the first thing I noticed was that their prices were about 50% higher than the pizzeria (Gino's) that previously occupied the same space.

The pizzas are doughy with way too much cheese. I tried them a couple of times and then gave up. Meanwhile, the sandwiches have both too much sauce *and* too much cheese. And, finally, the food has been steadily declining in quality since they opened.

Tonight was my last time trying the food here. Tonight's food was both overpriced and undercooked.

If you're not picky about quality and you like paying too much, then this is the place for you.
