G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Food was was pretty good but ruined with bad service. Unpleasant people should not work in the service industry. A group of 6 of us were having our last meal before saying our goodbyes before taking off on our flights, and the server made the experience so unpleasant! Brunch is supposed to be filled with laughter and mimosas but instead we were all dead silent and sulking because the waitress was so unpleasant. Not just rude, but intimidating--"are you done? Can I take it?" We hurriedly shoved the food in our faces and got the hell outta there. Yeah not going back. Sorry, Giada--- get better servers.
