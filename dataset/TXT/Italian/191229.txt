PebX-Sf_h4FJGgsRAA5Fng Our friends who live in Gilbert really like this restaurant. They have talked of it often. We dined there recently at our request. This is a mom and pop operation which operates in a space in a strip mall. The location doesn't concern me. Many fine restaurants are to be found in a mall setting. The problem we faced this visit was that the owner who runs the front was home sick. She normally takes care of our friends and service suffered. Service wasn't awful but our friends could tell the difference. The food was good but not five star.  The prices were on the high end but not extreme.  My clam linguine was decent but I have had better elsewhere. My wife was happier with her tortellini in cream sauce. The salad that is included was good. We didn't have dessert. If our friends suggest it, we would be willing to try it again.
