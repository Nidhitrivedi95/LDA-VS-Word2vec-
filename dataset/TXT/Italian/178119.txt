nOkSC1GtMUJ_I70sb0SaeQ I've been in Vegas for over two years now and it's been tough trying to find a pizza place that can compare to Boston pizza till now! First off I ordered a pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and pepperoni and it came out to $13! I didn't realize how far the shop was from my house when I ordered but they still accommodated me. The pie got to my place within 40 minutes which was great time. If your looking for a good pie and your around the airport look no further.
