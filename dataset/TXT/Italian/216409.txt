RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ I have to have Mineo's whenever I come home to see my family! 

Its become our tradition to order a few pizzas, usually larges with extra cheese, mushrooms and pepperoni! 

My review isn't very long, but my fellow burghers, that know Mineo's Pizza, know the deal! 

If you visit the Squirrel Hill location, you won't find parking on Murray Ave.  Park on Hobart street, just down the block from Mineo's, on the same side of the street.
