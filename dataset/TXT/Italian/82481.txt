DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw Ferraro's is getting a solid 3 stars from me.

The restaurant is decked out in nice rustic Italian fashion with dim lighting and white table cloths. My party and I arrived about 10 minutes earlier than our reservation slot, but we were seated immediately anyway.

As per the norm of most Italian restaurants, warm bread was brought to the table in a basket covered with a napkin. Brought along with the fresh bread was a ramekin filled with a delicious concoction of what I believed to be olive oil, a bit of roasted garlic, and perhaps a hint of pesto. For appetizers we went with the calamari fritti (fried calamari) which was adorned with a lemon and marinara topped with red pepper flakes. Overall the calamari was mediocre, in my opinion.

For my entree I went for the Bucatini Corti all'Amatriciana. A $24 plate of thick, but hollow bucatini noodles topped with Italian bacon, onions, red wine vinegar, and red pepper flakes. I've had variations of this dish in the past but this particular one did not rank up near the top with the others. Don't get me wrong, I knew exactly what I was getting into with my order however for the price I was expecting to be wowed. Unfortunately, I was not. I am making a general assumption in that the dish prices are predicated upon the restaurant's proximity to the strip, and I am certain the cost of the bacon is something to take note of.

The waitstaff certainly deserved 5 stars. Friendliness, knowledge of the menu, and attentiveness were definitely their strong suits that evening. I did feel bad for the bussers who had to constantly refill the tiny water glasses in front of us, but I suppose I could've just asked for a larger glass.
