x2SsRpZyMORwKLyTNNoBWQ We've been wanting to try this for some time so we finally made it. The restaurant was clean and open and nice. The food was good but a little on the pricy side. The chicken vesuvio was very good. The staff was EXCELLENT!  Everyone was very helpful and attentive and met all of our needs. This is a 3 star restaurant but I give it 4 stars because of the staff.
