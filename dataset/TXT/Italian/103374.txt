FmraE2CWt65VRnEqCAqNEg I was very hopeful for this place... and still am, but the have some work to do. This area is in need of more options like this, things to do later at night. Went with a group of friends a few weeks after their opening. (Maybe a month?) Maybe they need a little more time...

The Good: great atmosphere, lots of drink options, lots of beers on draft. Live music. Jalapeno burger got two thumbs up from our group.

The Bad: our server did okay, but wasn't very knowledgeable and was incredibly SLOW. The place wasn't even busy. Drinks are a little spendy.

The Ugly: All of the food, minus the jalapeno burger. The Italian Beef sandwich is tough, dry and almost inedible. Fries were very cold, but don't worry they are overly seasoned and you can get a thimble of cole slaw instead. Then there's the chef's favorite sandwich, which is described as ham and cheese with chopped apple compote and noted as being served on a pretzel bun, WRONG. It was basically ham and cheese with apple pie filling on a unidentified dry bun. It came out with a hole on top as if someone had taken a bite out of it. Our group was laughing about this when a manager, who must have been nearby and overheard, came out with a bun top and handed it to me. REALLY? What was that?

Again I have hopes for this place, they just need to work out the food situation and maybe get a few better servers. (Take a note from Oregano's, they do service right over there. ) Maybe would go back for drinks and music...
