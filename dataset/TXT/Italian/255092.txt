VxgjMl8tQrT4idJW_z8daA First time ever at Carrabba's & was pretty impressed with this place. The service was great. Very knowledgeable staff  [Alex was very good]. Food was good. I had Chicken Parm & it was extremely tender & good. My wife had the Shrimp & Scallops with Ala Vodka sauce & demolished it. If you have pasta included make sure you ask for extra sauce. The only problem was the linguini was a bit dry. Should've asked for more sauce. The house salad wasn't great. But my wife liked the Caesar. The best part was that we were NEVER RUSHED at all, Sat nite arrived at approx. 5;15. When we left we noticed lobby had about 10 + people, yet they never seemed to push or rush us. Mini Cannolis for dessert were very mini but good.   Also a friendly greeting at door when arriving & leaving. Will definitely return.
