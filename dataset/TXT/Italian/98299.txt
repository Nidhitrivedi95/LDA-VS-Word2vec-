eVv6cnwhabK8ig5Di2hXQQ I guess there are no Yelpers in Tukee, because none of Tukee's neighborhood favorites seem to have ever been reviewed. Maybe I need to start a Tukee list, which would be kind of sad since I don't live there anymore. 

Florencia's is a fun little bistro that's often jam-packed with Ahwatukee residents. They serve excellent beers from local breweries and elsewhere. The pizza is delicious and uniquely made; good enough that locals might order it for take-out to bring home for guests at a party. I've also had calzones here and they were excellent. The atmosphere is cozy, quaint, and fun, while somehow maintaining a family-friendly environment at the same time. The staff go out of their way to be friendly. 

Not a destination unto itself; but a fun place to dine or have a beer if you live in Tukee or are in the area.
