VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w What a wonderful experience! We came in for the meatball appetizer and couldn't get enough of this place. The ambience, the food, the fine service of Ahmed made all the difference! He really took care of us and made us feel as if we were his special guests. Thanks for the experience! With all the restaurants to choose from, we found ourselves wanting to return to LAVO..... we thought, WHY NOT?!
