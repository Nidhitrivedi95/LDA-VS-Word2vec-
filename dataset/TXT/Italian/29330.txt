There is an Everything slice on the menu which they didn't have so that was disappointing!
I had to settle for a Sicilian slice with a few toppings and then dump some extras on it from the toppings bar (which is for hot dogs I think) but that didn't stop me!
I added bacon & tomatoes and who remembers what else from that bar and made my own Everything slice. The pizza was pretty tasty and if you're impatient like me, offers instant gratification!
Isn't that fitting for the Hard Rock??
