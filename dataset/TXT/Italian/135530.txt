IwMhD-JhfhEY_nk963h7Vw This place has very uneven reviews and my conclusion is that your perception may well depend on the time of day when you visit.

I don't blame them for the sounds of construction booming through the place, because that stuff happens and it will be temporary. And I don't blame them for the subway rumble under the restaurant because that's life in the city and part of having a great location right on the subway line.

But I do blame them for being a caffe (yes, a double f caffe!) that doesn't make good coffee drinks. Coffee drinks that must be sweetened to be drinkable. Coffee that is so overheated that it spoils the espresso and renders it, yes, undrinkable. But I don't rule out that we had an inexperienced (but very pleasant) barista and maybe there are others that are better.

And then to present a breakfast that is so lacklustre that I wish I had stayed at home and scrambled my own eggs and toasted my own toast. Breakfast out is supposed to be a treat and this was... ok.

So they get 2 stars because it's a pretty little space and when it isn't full with people whose conversation are bouncing off the walls and tables, in concert with the sound of drills, I can imagine it would be a nice place to come and have...pastry. The pastries looked really good.
