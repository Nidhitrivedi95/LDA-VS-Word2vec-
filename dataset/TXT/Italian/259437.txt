Went here with my husband for lunch! Best pizza I've had in a while. I don't remember the name of my pizza but it had arugula, goat cheese, and balsamic vinegar. HELLOOO!! I know to some people this may sound awful, but in reality it is a terrific party for your taste buds. My husband had his usual pizza which consists of a bunch of meats and it too was extraordinary. Our waitress was kind and the food came out quickly which I find terribly important for us business people allotted the 1 hour lunch. 
Parking is a little iffy and there is currently road construction in that area as of 11/21/16.
