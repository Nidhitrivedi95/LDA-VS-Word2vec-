JK_DiDwbl7HX5OhCAh3h4g Not very impressed with Cafe Dip. It looks like it should be some sort of age old college institution. But it ain't!

Instead, it's a fairly dirty restaurant with mediocre food and no spectacular deals. I found the menu to be seriously blah. 

Bottom Line: If you are on college street, there are much better places you can go to get better eats at similar prices.
