They have a fine selection of wines and the bar area is very sleek, cool, and inviting.  I came here for a hearty dinner and was not disappointed.  We started of with some delicious home made bread (made, I believe, in their onsite wood-fired oven), wonderfully flavorful salad, and a calamari which was lightly battered and melted in your mouth like butter.  For my entree I had a delicious medley of seafood over linguine.  Everything was excellently prepared and impeccably served from beginning to end.  The meal was rounded off with tiramisu and some homemade limoncello.  Bravo Amarone!

P.S. Amarone's much smaller sister restaurant (Pizza A Metro in Phoenix) is just as good if you're looking for a more casual pizza bistro dining experience.
