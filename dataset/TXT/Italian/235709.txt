tVyLQzyhhinKcGzlZIFZjQ I had seen Oregano's in Tucson and always wanted to try it. I was happy when my bff and her husband suggested we eat here when we came to visit. I think a lot of people felt like pizza that night because it was sooo crowded even on a weekday! We were brave enough to sit outside on the patio in the murderous Phoenix heat, so we didn't have to wait. Agreeing on a shared pizza for four people is difficult, so we just had cheese, tomato, and basil. It was very basic, but very good, and the large fed all of us comfortably. My friend is always on a diet, so we had the thin crust instead of the deep dish which was perfect for our type of pizza. We also shared a small dinner salad which was plenty for all of us too. The service was great and they were very attentive in refilling our water which was good because it felt like we were eating in the Sahara. We also shared their version of a BJ's Pizookie and that was delicious of course! My friend and I had a frozen Bellini which was perfectly cold and yummy but weak in the alcohol content. My boyfriend said his margarita was really weak as well. Kind of expensive, but this ain't Domino's. I would come again.
