UfSwz2LHiVu0K6CJJ6-2gg Sorry, little grey heads, Mia Bella Cafe is just Meh for me and not the 5-star experience that everyone else seemed to enjoy (did you?). Came in around 11:15am and the spot was empty. Like, 0 people in there. 0. I was aiming for a light meal, but there were signs for shawarma outside and I'm weak for the stuff, so I went for a shawarma wrap with a side of potato salad and then grabbed a turkey panini to eat later in the day. 

I'll make this quick bc it's Friday and I know you gots some partying to do... the wrap wasn't cut, so I had a shawarma burrito that was eh. I was confused the entire time on whether it was OK or not. The potato salad consisted of diced potatoes, but no mayo to tie 'em together. So, yea, just a bunch of dry potatoes. The panini was OK. Turkey, cheese, let, tom on some nice bread.... but they put it in a box with an Israeli salad which leaked all over it, making the bread soggy as hell and an open-faced panini for moi. Overall, meh. I wouldn't return.
