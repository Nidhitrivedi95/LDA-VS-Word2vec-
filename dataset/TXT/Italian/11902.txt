Fresh bread is provided to the table with olive oil and balsamic, but don't make the mistake of filling up on it like I did. We had the calamari and nachos as appetizers. The calamari was good, but the nachos were amazing! I have never had nachos quite like this, with an Italian spin. I had the Pappardelle Carbonera, and my boyfriend had the Sicilian pizza. Both were fresh and delicious, and the serving sizes were more than enough for us...we were able to take some home for lunch the following day. I would definitely recommend this restaurant, especially over the other Italian restaurants in Oakville and Mississauga.
