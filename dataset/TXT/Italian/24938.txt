4gXdyihRiytmXEAfqLNMBw My husband and I enjoyed the food. The ambiance waz great. I'd give them a five star, but our waitress disappeared for long periods of time to take our orders for drinks and food and to bring us our food and drinks. We thought it was a bit strange. But overall, the food was worth us going back in the near future.
