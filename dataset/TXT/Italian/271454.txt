Xra1TtWtf069Am5hHWs3Ug This place is tiny so be prepared to wait for awhile during dinner hours or whenever it is nice out.  There are maybe 15 tables so there are not many people shuffling in and out constantly.  The place is older but quaint and honestly kind of reminded me of being at my grandparents house for dinner.  I think that is what adds to the charm of this place!  If you are lucky enough to get a table, you will not be disappointed.  

They are famous for their lasagna and unless you are really hungry, you will be taking some home.  The portions are HUGE and you could easily split with someone.  I have been their twice and both times I have gotten the veggie lasagna.  Usually it is made with white alfredo sauce, but I get it with their wonderful red sauce! You really can not go wrong either way.  Both times it was amazing and they fill it with a good amount of veggies such as carrots, broccoli, and peppers.  Entrees are served with salad and bread, both of which are pretty decent.  I have always heard that they are well known for their pizza, so I want to try that next time!
