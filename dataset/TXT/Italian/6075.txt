_VHU9KZUHRLp2Hc2JOKlYg went for a glass of wine and ended up having 3 along with some calamari.  now, i've had a decent share of calamari.  this was in my top 2.  it's tender and just delicious.  they serve it with lemon zest.  the dipping sauce was just different with a lemon garlic flavor.  my other top calamari pick is actually at a chain in manchester, ct- john harvards.  it's little rings and spicey.  so, 2 very differently prepared types of calamari both good.  cioppino is also in a great location -the strip.  it's a beautiful restaurant.  bartender was nice too.
