PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA Would have loved to enjoy a few after-dinners drinks with my girlfriend at this spot many friends have suggested we check out. Hours on the doors say Friday-Saturday 11am-11pm. They also say that on their yelp page.  We walked in just a few minutes after 10, walked up to the bar and asked the bartender if they were closed. Her response was "if it's 10, then yes" as she went to check the time on her computer to confirm it was 4 minutes past 10. I followed her reply by saying that the sign outside the door says 11 and got no response as she turned her back to us, so we decided to find another nearby restaurant.   We have heard great things about this place and the two of us just wanted to check the place out before trying it for dinner.  Not a very warming first impression nor does it make us feel like we want to go back.
