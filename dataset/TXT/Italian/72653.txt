Cg3sK4ptre1uPPCzPWH1aw The service by the waitress (who did not tell us her name) on June the 9th during the day  was extremely poor, her uniform was ripped, hair was messy.  The service was almost unbearable  as we were asking questions about the menu ,she looked uninterested and annoyed.  When we got the Food it  was not prepared well pasta was hard, dry and tasteless , bruschetta was gross ,Salad  looked like it was thrown on the plate  and I did even touch my burnt veal sandwich. Won't be coming back to East Side Mario's
