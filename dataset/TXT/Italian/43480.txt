8-4bSRRiD4ObiJ5UqxqNiA This is a real Italian Restaurant. If you are not used to Italian culture, you have an excellent opportunity to learn how is to be served in an Italian way. Food is fantastic and is prepared right in front of you, since the kitchen is open. Service is slow as it should be, once you are eating Italian food and the Chef himself is attending you. It is already marked in my Notes as THE Italian restaurant in the north of GTA.
