2. We had to go to the airport in less than an hour, so it couldn't be a drawn out meal.
3. We are foodies
Man, were we blown away. All we ordered was a 'Choked Pig Pizza and it was the greatest pizza I've had since I can remember. Service was fun and personal, and very accommodating to us needing to get out. 3 of us girls DUSTED the pizza, and should have ordered a second one to go for the flights home.
Will definitely be back there on my next Vegas vacation!
