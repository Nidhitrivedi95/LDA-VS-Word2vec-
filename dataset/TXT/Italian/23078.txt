3prYLfbO9h30ozqdUCZ_6A Very disappointed! We don't mind paying extra for a nice dinner but this was extremely overpriced for what we got. The wine was subpar and overpriced, they ran out of meatballs but charged us anyway. Then blamed it on the PGA tour. We were seated immediately so they weren't that busy. The waiter wasn't attentive, esp for a restaurant at this price point. Then when we questioned it, the waiter said the garlic mashed potatoes that were substituted were more so he left the meatball in the bill.  Really? Mashed potatoes cost more than meatballs? We should have gone to Olive Garden for the meal we received. Not going back here again. I forgot.... when we first sat down, I put my hand in sauce in the seat. Good thing it wasn't my white pants!
