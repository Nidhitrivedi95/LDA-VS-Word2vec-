BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag My boyfriend and I frequently eat at Local Bistro. It is the perfect compromise for us: we always sit at the bar (where the full menu is available), he gets to watch sports in the bar area and I get to eat good food. We live in the neighborhood and it is our favorite place to stop in and have a drink close to home. The service is always great and I haven't eaten anything on the brunch or dinner menu that I have not enjoyed. See you again soon Local Bistro!
