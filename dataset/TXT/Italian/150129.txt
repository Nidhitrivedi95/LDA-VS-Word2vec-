The food here is mostly pasta.  You would think for $30.00, and a serving size that would fit in a salad bowl, the pasta would be good.  Sorry, it's not good, and sadly, not even house made pasta, it is purchased outside, as told by the waiter. The fried calamari was nothing to write home about either. Three people, three pasta dishes, 1 appetizer, 1 meatball (half order) 1 glass of wine $285.00 not worth the money at all.  Only upside, waiter was very friendly.
