ZBSha-zoPLias7wCQ0ZyVw The décor is quite outdated, but I figured that was part of the charm. The waiters are all surly men...again part of that old European charm right?

Took their sweet time to come and take our order, very few properly Italian food...unless you only like pasta. 

I had the chicken marsala and the tiramisu, my boyfriend chose I believe something pork. 

It took close to 40 minutes for food to come. No explanation, no apology. 

But finally I thought, food...this should all be worth it. 

Nope, some of the blandest, greyest mush I have ever had the misfortune of eating. It wasn't disgusting, it was just offensively bland. 

But I had Tiramisu coming, that should be good. 

No, watery coffee sponge is more like it. 

Total price for 2 plates, 2 desserts and coffee?

96 dollars. 

For food I would be ashamed to serve at home. 

Never again.
