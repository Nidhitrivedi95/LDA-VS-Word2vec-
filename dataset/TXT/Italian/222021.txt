sgmzN_YnOPtHAAfGlhc9yA The hubs and I went here for our HOA block party. It was out the wazoo packed on a week day night. Holy moly, I had to stand up the whole time. I think there were at least 5 other parties or events going on simultaneously and our HOA definitely did not book enough seats or something. Yes, there was a parking lot but it was viciously narrow and did not even accommodate a fraction of people in there. The setup is super weird and awkward. It reminded me of Pugliano's where there are 3 or 4 separate rooms/areas that don't really associate with each other so you just have to know where you're supposed to go. 

Food here was kind of blah. The pizza was really thin, greasy and sparse in toppings. The wings were dry, small and sauce was on the side. Granted, this is their catering selection but it was probably a 2-star for me for just the food. 
Service was surprisingly fast and attentive for all the people being there. Even while I never had a seat, the waitresses always spotted me and got me my 2 soft drinks very promptly. So I guess John Anthony's has this going for it. 

The location is out of the way and weird and I have no clue why anyone would choose to purposely dine here. The quality of food is pretty bad and the selection is very limited. I would not recommend this place.
