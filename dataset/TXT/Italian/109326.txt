G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Fabulous! The food, service and atmosphere were all exceptional.

We spilt the buratta and spicy sausage pizzette for appetizers and the lobster ravioli and rissoto for entrees.  

Paired with one of the best Sangiovese wines we''ve had in years, it was the perfect meal for the two of us.  

Don't be fooled by the negative reviews, Giada is top notch!
