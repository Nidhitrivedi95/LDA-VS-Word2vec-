UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ I always enjoy my time here. The food and ambiance is amazing. What I order: Artichoke Crusted Fliet Mignon with mashed potatoes, house salad, Shrimp Verduta (angel hair tossed in artichokes, shrimp, garlic, sun dried tomatoes, feta, spinach, with pesto and bread crumbs), and their white peach sangria. My family usually orders all of these and splits. My mom always asks if I want to check out other restaurants when I am back home, but I always insist on going to Brio.
