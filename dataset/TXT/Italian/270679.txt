xoisXoqK68W2euSKbj5ybw Finding good pizza in Charlotte that doesn't involve a long wait can be a challenge, especially on the weekend. We didn't have the patience to trek far just to wait, so decided to try this little joint not far from home. 

The pizza was definitely good - more of NY style with big slices you have to fold. We got the supreme and the ingredients tasted fresh and the crust was divine. I'll have to try the breadsticks next time. Speaking of next time, I think it will be for takeout or delivery (if they come this far). The décor/ambiance leaves a lot to be desired!

Their pizza didn't change my life, but it was solid and no wait to get a table!

Oh and I almost forgot to mention, they do have a small wine & beer selection. By small I mean mini wines!
