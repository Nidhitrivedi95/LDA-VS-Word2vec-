KT8Lyc7lhL48SXalBSwLfw The most AMAZING ice cream in the whole world!! - Award winning in fact, I'm surprised there is only one other review because I feel as though I'll be raving about this for a while.

The food here was great, all 5 of us enjoyed different meat and vegetarian meals and all agreed that we would go back here again in future for a good Italian. 

The staff are genuine Italians and very friendly. Decor is a bit tired but that was irrelevant once we tucked into the Bruschetta starter and it only got better from there on in.

I'm almost considering going again tomorrow just for Ice cream, seriously.
