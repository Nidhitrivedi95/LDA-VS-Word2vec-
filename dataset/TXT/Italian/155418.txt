L23qeWacyCZFjF9DL6o04w I seen mixed reviews before I ordered from here. I'm not sure what the other people are complaining so much about. I ordered delivery and the pizza and garlic cheesey bread was soooo delicious! The nice smoked bacon, the candaian bacon and hamburger. The crust has a nice chew and crunch to it. The home made red sauce is out of this world (delicious!!!). I think I finally found my go to pizza place. I will definitely recommend you guys to people I know! Not over priced either.
