Well, on Sunday I decided to dine here with a friend before going to a show later on in the evening. We arrived at 5pm and while we did not have reservations the restaurant was barely half filled. We got seated outside by our hostess and were given menus. 

We waited for 12 minutes and still nobody had so much as come by our table to bring us water. When going to look for a server, the hostess was friendly enough to bring us water and apologize letting us know that someone would be with us momentarily. 13 minutes later (mind you it has now been 25 minutes with no service), still nobody has come by our table.
I went in search of the manager and the hostess was polite enough to apologize again (she looked mortified that we were getting such horrible service in a restaurant where she worked). When I mentioned to the manager that we were seated for 12 minutes when we finally got water and now it has been an additional 13 minutes and no sign of our server. He smugly replied that "he brought you water". 

I smartly replied that "no not 'he' our polite hostess, 'she' brought us the water and no sign of our server anywhere when everyone around us had their drink orders taken and then also their dinner orders taken in the 25 minutes that we were already seated. He seemed completely flippant when stating that someone will be with us shortly. 
Needless to say, I and my friend walked out deeply disturbed by their careless attitude. It has been the only time I have ever walked out of a restaurant due to complete lack of service.
