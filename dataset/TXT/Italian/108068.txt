FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A Mac Shack makes creating your own pasta meal a breeze because all you do is pick your pasta, sauce, and toppings. There's so many different options that it really made me think of what I wanted...

I got the chicken pesto fettuccine with mushrooms and broccoli. I also got a side of their cauliflower gratin.

The pasta was more on the al dente side, but I think I prefer that for a pesto dish. The only thing I didn't like about it was the fact that my pasta was sitting in oil. I understand that some pasta dishes can get oily, but this was like a swimming pool of oil at the bottom of my bowl. It's not really appetizing to me if there's oil dripping off of my noodles. Don't get me wrong, it was still good (had very rich pesto flavor) but I think they were really heavy on the oil.

The cauliflower gratin was amazing, though! It was creamy and cheesy at the same time, and the bread crumbs were a little crispy which added even more texture and flavor. It was surprisingly filling, so I guess that this made up for the extremely oily pasta...

I think that Mac Shack is a unique concept. They give you good portions for your pasta at an okay price. I'd definitely suggest it here if you're looking for something heavy for lunch/dinner.
