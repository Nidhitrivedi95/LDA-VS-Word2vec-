IS5tQNVzyVYbI2zl8yEaKA Wonderful food.  Best manicotti I've had.  Kid friendly?  VERY questionable.  Maybe for older kids, but not a 4 y/o.  Count on multiple water spills because the glasses are huge and hard for a kid to hold.  The service was good as was the complimentary bruschetta.  The bread was fresh and hot and even the house wine was really tasty.  I'd go again, but only with adults.
