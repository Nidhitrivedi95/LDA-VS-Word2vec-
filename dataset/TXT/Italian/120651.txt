H6Gb3P21h4e_stdjFQO9oQ I love me some Rocky's once in a while - their pizza is always spot-on and the various restaurants are mostly consistent.   This location does not disappoint - it's larger than others, so you can find a table off in a quiet corner if you need one.  It's pretty clean and the staff were friendly enough.  The salad bar ingredients were pretty fresh and tasty.

For me, this is a nice meet-in-the-middle location for lunches with folks working in other areas.
