9S7RUjzkdpU4MDxUxkvLvg Ghetto and ratchet. Is all i can say. Walked in about 830pm on a monday and all i heard was loud ass music bc they have karokoe on mondays. First walked in and was not acknowledged at all. 5 min later we were finally seated and of course they werent busy to be having to wait that long. We were sat at a dirty booth with trash in the midddle of the floor. So we asked to be seated elsewhere. Had to wait15 min for another seat even though 50 tables were empty. Wen sat again never was acknowledged. We left 15 min later without ever being greeted for a drink or order
