Otherwise, skip it. This was the only blip during my holiday in Scotland, so I'm going to get these thoughts out of the way and then pretend it never happened. 

We stopped because there wasn't a wait - maybe that should have been a sign. We quickly realized that very recently this place had changed hands (i.e. the wine menus were from the former restaurant), and they were still figuring things out. Our server was rude and dismissive, but that was because he was trying to manage serving all the tables in the front end of the restaurant while acting as the host to the steady stream of people coming in (bank holiday weekend, so it was buuuusssssssy). I get it. But still. 

The food and drink?
- My glass of valpolicello was FILLED with sediment - I've actually never experienced this at a restaurant before; it was a huge turnoff. 
- I asked for a side of olives (something not on their menu alone currently), and out came a huge portion of pre-pitted generic green and black olives. They were flavorless and very soggy. 
- I got the linguini with tomato sauce... Plentiful, yes. Flavorful, no. The sauce was soupy and the pasta was a bit limp. 
- Tried a bite of the garlic bread (a big disc of it; it looked like it could be a pizza crust) and it was a bit too cardboardy for my likes. 

But...to their credit, I'm full. And I no longer crave Italian.

However, I am also wondering why I didn't just run over to Sainsbury's and make some spaghetti myself.
