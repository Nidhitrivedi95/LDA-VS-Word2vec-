GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA In a city where you can find pasta anywhere, this is truly a great Italian spot inside The Venetian. Enjoyed cocktails, appetizers, goat cheese tortellini and then dessert with two friends visiting from Baltimore for less than $250....very authentic and impressive.  

The wait staff is very attentive to your needs...even anticipating things before you can ask...impressive.

I would recommend Mario's place again and again...
