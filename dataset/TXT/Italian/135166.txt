ITde2CeOZ6fUG9h3xb-Nag This was my first time at Valenti's, and I was very pleased. I had dinner there with a friend, we both ordered salads as starters, I had the arugula salad, which was very simple, but very tasty.  Arugula dressed with fresh lemon juice and EVOO, topped with red onion and  shaved parmesan.....excellent!  I then ordered a flatbread pizza topped with sausage and mushroom bianco.....very good.  The Italian bread served with dinner was warm, slightly crusty and delicious.  My friend and I shared a slice of cheesecake with raspberry sauce, NY style, very good, but a little bit pricey ($8.00), same price as the pizza:-(.  Our server was not as attentive as we would have liked, long wait between refills, next course, check etc.  The Executive Chef stopped by our table to see if we enjoyed our meal.  I will definitely return.
