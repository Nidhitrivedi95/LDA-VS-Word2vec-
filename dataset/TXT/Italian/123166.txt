HKsDnEbwZ6DYKqEWtVdWJQ What a delight!  First time in & won't be the last.  Great atmosphere starting with Giorgia & Ana  who greeted us so warmly.  We started with Calamari which was beautifully seasoned with a light breading & fresh, tasty sauce.  Then we shared an Arugala & Pear salad with Gorgonzola crumbles. With that came warm, crusty REAL Italian bread with a choice of olive oil or a creamy pesto butter.  I had Fettucine Ala Carbonara....Outstanding!  The hubby had Veal Scallopine Francese that came with a crispy potato cake & sauteed veggies.  All were artfully presented, perfectly seasoned & just flat out tasty!  Save room for dessert!  We tried both Cannoli & Tiramisu.  You can't go wrong either way.  Delicious!  So much on this menu we want to try.  On top of everything, was the manager, Phillip, who stopped at every table and made you feel like long time friends that he was thrilled to see again.  We eat out a lot & rarely has everything come together as well as our first visit to Tomaso's When In Rome.  Motto bene!
