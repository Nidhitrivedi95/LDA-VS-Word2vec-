LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Good place to eat while you shop. In the center of the mall that's an actual sit down restaurant that is way better then the fast food places. It can be busy around dinner time so just be prepared.

They have a great bar with lots of selection and a very big menu. One of my favorite dishes that actually isn't on the menu (but they will make it for you) is the spinach and artichoke dip. So yummy and so creamy! Their bread is freshly baked and comes nice and hot.

I always order the lemon salmon and it's normally served with spinach and I sub for asparagus and they don't seem to have a problem with changing anything on the menu! If you don't see a pasta that you want they can easily make one for you! (My sis does that)

The staff is pretty nice, I mean they are pretty busy so you might not feel that they are "paying attention" to you but overall pretty good food!
