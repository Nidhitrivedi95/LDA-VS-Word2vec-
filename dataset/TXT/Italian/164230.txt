LXheNwqZPoXuXNNeP1sNew First we are THRILLED to have Humble Pie on our side of town now. We'd been driving to Scottsdale once we discovered them. Lovely! Our favs are the vegetable salad with avocado, jicama, white beans, fresh mozzarella, green beans on greens and the shrimp pizza with house-made mozzarella, fresh basil, herb oil, chili flakes. And their Happy Hour is a good deal as well. Last time we tried the roasted mushroom pizza but we won't get it again. The mushrooms were microscopic and the flavor was mehh.  Their happy hour is great - the standard buy-one-get-one . Love their house made margs.
