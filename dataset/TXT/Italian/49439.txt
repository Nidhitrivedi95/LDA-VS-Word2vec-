9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw After shredding downtown with the little lady we decided to check out this quaint little restaurant. First, their is a lot of outside seating. The ambiance outside is very nice as well. The inside is smaller but nicely decorated. This is a great place for dates or romantic one-on-ones. Our meals were great. We had the calamari, a pizza, and a wood fired sandwich. 

Pros
- great ambiance
- good food
- decent prices

Cons 
- limited inside seating
- just okay service
- parked in the back. Trash bin was overflowing and smell turned us off.
