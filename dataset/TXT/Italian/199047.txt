pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw NOTE: This review is based off an experience I had a number of years ago, so things may have changed since then....

I went with a group of about 6. We had to wait for 4 hours total to get seated at the bar. The service was awful and took forever to get our order in. When the pizzas came out, they were all burnt and not worth the price point at all.

If you're looking for a good pizza recommendation, check any of the other reviews I've made on my profile. This place is not worth the wait, price, or its own hype.
