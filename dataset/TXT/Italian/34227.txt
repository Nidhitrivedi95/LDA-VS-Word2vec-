6bVEM9jD-mpU4WNXcJ9tHA I ordered something. I was not impressed either! I made a complaint over the phone. Along with Yelp and now I have two charges on my bank account! They are retaliating and I  do have the upper hand all because I  can prove it! Two different charges for the same amount on the same day! Like I  posted before, this establishment is nothing but a rip off of your money!

I also contacted my bank and I am in the process of disputing the second bogus charge. 
This establishment is highly not recommended due to their dishonesty and their business practices!
