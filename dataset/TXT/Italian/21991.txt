3e-M7oQWILM9xbpx9fyUWQ I would have give this place s 5 stars if it wasn't for the ridiculous wait for the food. And when i say ridiculous,  i mean at least an hour wait. However,  food is amazing and generous and that's the only reason why we keep coming back. Great authentic italian food with huge portion. Also, the BEST panna cotta ever!!!
