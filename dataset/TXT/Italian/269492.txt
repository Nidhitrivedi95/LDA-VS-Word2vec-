xjjxHavx4RIiW6zS6rasGA This was a wonderful treat after a long day. We were visiting the area for a half ironman event.   After a long day of racing we were looking for  a nice place for dinner.    Tommy V's didn't disappoint.   Nice ambiance and great food was delivered.   My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs were great and went well with the marinara sauce.   I had the pasta trio and I loved every bite. Thanks for the great post race dinner.
