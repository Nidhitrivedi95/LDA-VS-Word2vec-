XxXJat55Oep1BMzQ9yJJhQ Finally got to check out this place this week and was quite impressed. Tiny but nice little patio overlooking College, attentive service, and a helluva panini! Minus one star because I seemed to catch them on a day that they were running out of stuff... No arugula pesto:( So I had the mushroom and goat mozarella panini ($11) with basil pesto instead, still tasty and served with a delicious salad. The mixed greens came with these tiny couscous-like pasta-ball things. What a great idea! 
My friend had already eaten dinner so just wanted dessert. She was dying to try the famous peanut butter ice cream, but our waiter told us apologetically that the ice cream that day was "runny" so they took it off the menu. She had the panna cotta instead and said it was very good. 
I'll definitely be back to try the dessert panini!
