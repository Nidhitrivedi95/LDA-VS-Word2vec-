esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA This place is a must do whenever we're in Vegas. The food & service are both  excellent, not to forget the view of the people walking by inside of Harrah's or are they the people of Wal-Mart walking by. Wait,  they might be the same. I can reccomend the Steamers in white wine, any of the Oyster plates especially the Oysters Royale. Oh, the blackened shrip are excellent we did not order them but on our 2nd visit the chef had made an extra plate so our waiter offered them to us, a very nice comp & now we always order them.
