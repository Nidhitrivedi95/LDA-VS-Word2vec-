2Zeh89IUg7T4dUFjRfqtdg We went out to have a family dinner at guidos deli after Watching "CHECK PLEASE". Well we order the 2 plates broasted chicken and wedge potato and we recieced cole slaw was watery and very very sweet. we also got the pototoe salad it also was very very sweet to hard for me to each since i am diabetic .The Broasted chicken was very very dry and the pototoe wedges was very wet and soggy on the inside and fried on out side was not very good.We also had the pepproni pizza blan no taste.Husband order the caesar salad it was simple just alot lettues and some hot chicken on top and to much vinegar and water for dressing .He did not like it .We also order the gnocchi with a red sauce that was good but little blan for me.all and all I was disappointed with my order.They are very over price for the quality of food they put out .We paid $80.22 for our order last night 01/24/2017 we arrived at 9:20pm.Maybe the food is alot better early in the day I don't know .We wasted all the food it was like a taste test .We where still hungry when we left. Well I return again .I'm afraid not.My kids love to eat ... First time they did not like restaurant food.Customer service was great.
