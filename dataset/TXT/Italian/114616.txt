GMriYorKj1v-dhhJ1om-Sg The Pizza was delicious, however ordered delivery and after 1 hour and NO SHOW, I called and they said they had delivered it to me already, NOT. After the second hour I got my Pizza. 

Didn't appreciate them accusing me of telling a lie to get a free pizza. The nerve. When the delivery guy finally showed up he admitted to me that he gave my Pizza to the wrong address but they paid for it?? Nobody from NYPD called to apologize for the mix up and calling me a liar. 

The person on the phone said and I quote, "we have to look out for people that lie to get free pizzas" BTW, I paid for my Pizza (gladly) and so did the person who got my first order.

Don't order delivery and you will be just fine.Maybe they should get GPS instead of upsetting customers.   Does that sound like good business?
