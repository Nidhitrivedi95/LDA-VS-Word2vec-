TFftsYkRIUtdo6ZhRwJ2lQ both my friend and I each got a plate of Carpaccio and the cut had an amazing smooth texture that had me sold - no complaints.

The two of us then shared a pasta that I felt was way over priced for something I could make myself.

All the wines are also terribly expensive for mediocre taste that came in low wine glasses that lacked class.

Bread was decent, but they only served olive oil and no balsamic.

All in all, for an $80+ bill I only liked the Carpaccio.
