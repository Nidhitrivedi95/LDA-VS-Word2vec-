OJ6zfenoK-eBNI7vvNrOsg I've been here twice and loved it. The decor looks like the sort of place where Tony Soprano might hang out, but the food is out of this world. Must-try's include the stuffed gnocchi (I'm not a fan of gnocchi in general, but these are special) and the SEAFOOD SALAD. I dream about that lemony, delicious salad frequently. 
Will definitely come back again and again!
