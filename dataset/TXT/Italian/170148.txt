MtvN8vMiKcLkkz_tCvBx3g Went here for dinner and ordered the scallops.  The scallops were very salty and the rice was under cooked.  The waiter also took a long time to take our order and waited about 15 minutes for each wine.  Also the girls seated next to us at 9 pm were full on swapping spit in between bites of their food.
