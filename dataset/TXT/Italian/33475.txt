5zjYrtSK1NdVoWNmo96rYA My Second, and Last Time!   Really disappointing!!!

Appetizer..
Zucchini Fritte- Edible, but terrible. The outside was thick and cake-y. The sauces were not good. 

Meals..
Fettuccini Alfredo with Spinach- one of the worst sauces I've ever had. The spinach was wilty.

Linguini carbonara - not good, flavorless

Mashed Potatoes- (side) delicious, really yummy
