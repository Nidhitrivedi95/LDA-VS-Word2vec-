GfHBBCi6LJAPVFTcCwu9aQ I've only been there once but I dug the hole in the wall feel, the very dim lighting, ever changing music (from soft rock and jazz to salsa and brass), copper floors, candelabras and the swanky bathroom. 

But, the bathroom was really the only part that was posh. New pedestal sink, mirrors of varying sizes on multiple walls, cubbies and a couch that could seat 3 women. Yes, a couch. In a one person bathroom.

I had a beer, which is a typical choice for me, but I didn't see anything on the menu that I wouldn't be able to get in a pub, large brew house or a restaurant that has dozens of choices. I didn't order any food and unlike other reviewers my table had fast and friendly service, but then one of my table mates knew the bartender/owner so I think that helped.

I think something that inhibits this place from being a larger local hang out is there is barely any parking (only two spots out front) and the place can hold probably 15 people? If you're looking for a small and quiet place to go this would be it, but if you're a group larger than four I'd recommend going somewhere else.
