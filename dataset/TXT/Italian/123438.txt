Ive been here a few times.  Is it the greatest spaghetti I've ever had...well definitely not.  Does it have the best salads, no it does not.  It is rather simple, and somewhat symbolic.  Those of you who have lived in Toronto your entire life know what I mean, you know the Spaghetti factory is there, and for me its tried tested and true.  Its got this old school charm to it, and the ambience is hard to describe, though classic would be fitting.  
The dishes Ive had were all decent, and I was satisfied and every now and then I come back and pay them a little visit.  Now the question is, Should the spaghetti factory be "the best spaghetti" you've ever had?  That's really up to the company, and their recipe culinary arts sector to decide if anything needs revamp, updated, or if they really want to be competitive to step up their game etc.  
Personally, I'm happy with all of its simplicity, but I would never said that it was, THE BEST..and if I wanted the best, Id yelp "best italian food" and...well it appears to be corrodes on john street.  And if I wanted the best steak, I guess id have to go to jacobs, but then id expect to pay a premium lol.
