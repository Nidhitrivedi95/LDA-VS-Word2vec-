yqEKA6wOQUfn66BeftXmXw Had dinner at Al Dente with a high school English teacher of mine last week.  Although I have been much spoiled by the variety of choices that Toronto has to offer, Al Dente met my expectations.  It is a fine-dining restaurant located in the business district of Pickering.  It's located in an office building, but was easy enough to find.  Our waitress was very attentive and down to Earth, and the service was great.  For $24.95 we got a choice of appetizer salad or soup and main course.  Dessert was not included.  I found this kind of strange, as it wasn't quite a prix-fixe menu.  I wouldn't have minded paying a little more if they included dessert, but that is just a minor detail.  I had the Baked Tilapia which was served in a tomato cream sauce over a bed of Pesto Angel Hair Pasta and vegetables.  The pasta tasted light, and fresh, although a bit heavy on the salt.  The fish was done just right - very tender, and the sauce was not too overbearing, but added a nice touch to the fish.  Their caesar salad was nothing spectacular.  My dining companion had the chicken marsala and she had no complaints.  We ended the night sharing a dessert, a Chocolate Mint Cake.  I am usually not a fan of this combination, but it was really good!  Not too heavy!  I also had a cappuccino, and I like stronger cappuccinos, and Al Dente served it up with just the right level of caffeine.  I would definitely go back.
