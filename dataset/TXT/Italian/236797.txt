txAKid34IUd9spo6MLF_Sw Came here with 6 girls out on a whim. Food was good, service as excellent. Gluten free pasta was amazing and their pizza was tasty. The staff were very Funny,friendly and sweet. Found it a little odd that there were only 3 other occupied tables on a Saturday night but apparently their busy in the summer with the patio. All of us decided we would go back :)
