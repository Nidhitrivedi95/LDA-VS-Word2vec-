pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I had heard soooo much about this place I anticipated dying and going to heaven in a Brooklyn pizzaria. Well I was totally disappointed. Being from the East coast one has a higher than usual expectation when told a pizzeria is really good. I would say NYPD has got this place beat by a loooong shot. Only went once and would never go again. Especially fer the price they ask fer a lil bitty thing of a pizza.
