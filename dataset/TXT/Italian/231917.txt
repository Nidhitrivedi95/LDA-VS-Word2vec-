tIiiq23utFKTs1At2bVD6w I always have the weakness for Italian food, but this was a great choice to go out for dinner last week. They had great service and the food was amazing! I absolutely fell in love with the Bocconcino Emiliana and the Agnolotti Alla Panna was a fine choice for dinner. Not to mention the chef was so sweet to give us a creme brûlée for dessert. I'm definitely coming back!
