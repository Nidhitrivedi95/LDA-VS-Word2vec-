6okGKL2PA7kkc-GjZzNHnA Was  in Middleton on February 14th for a medical appointment for my sister. We stayed at the Residence Inn across the parking lot from Johnny's . Neither of us felt like going out after the day we had, especially on Valentines Day. Ordered take out from Johnny's and was delightfully surprised we were able to bill order to the room. Hostess who took order was friendly, but seemed new or not as versed with menu as she should be for taking phone orders. I verified my order a couple of times with her. Nonetheless, the food order arrived incredibly fast, hot and correct. The employee delivering order was pleasant and professional. Food was so good! I had the Smothered Steak, which arrived prepared as ordered and hot. One of the best steaks I've had in awhile, especially as a take out order. My sister had the Chicken Madeira, which was also good. Save for the fact the two baby asparagus stalks with the order, barely qualified asparagus to be included the menu description of this item. We both had Caesar salads & baked potatoes as our side items. Turtle cheese cake topped off the meal nicely. Was overall pretty pleased with service & taste of food. Would definitely patronize again.
