lvv9Vv_5i4IwvDdofO_rKg For a mall restaurant, this place has great ambiance and pretty good service. The food is also not bad -- we got a zucchini pizza and their pappardelle. 

The pizza was cooked nicely but I don't think there was enough zucchini on it. Would have loved meatier chunks of that zucchini. Still it was pretty good -- the tomato sauce was on point and the goat's cheese added a nice touch. We had 4 humongous slices. Remember to ask for the chili oil like the other reviews have stated, it makes EVERYTHING better. 

The pappardelle was the star for me. Perfectly sized noodles, lots of sauce, lots of meat, rich flavours -- a very comforting dish.
