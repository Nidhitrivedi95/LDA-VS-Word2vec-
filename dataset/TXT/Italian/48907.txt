9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw We just went here for the first time last week. 
First off the place is pretty small inside. We were a table of 4 put in the corner of this really small room with a ceiling fan. But there were so many people in this little room that it was warm so it made it uncomfortable. 
Our waitress was polite. A little timid which sometimes made her unhelpful but all in all she was ok. 
We got a appetizer which was this fried rice ball with cheese. Nothing special. Pretty bland.
And we got two different pizzas the margarita and the pesto potato one. 
The margarita pizza was awful!!!! It had so much sauce that was the wrong consistency on it that it made the pizza a instant droopy mess and totally soggy. It was gross. The pesto potato pizza was actually very good and it is what we ended up eating. The rest of everything else we just left there and was a total waste. 
We probably won't go back here just cause there is definite better options out there then the experience we had here.
