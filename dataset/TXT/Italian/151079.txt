klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw The service here is great.  The food is good 'tho the portions per pricing is a tad lackluster in the bang for the buck quantity for the quality.

I had the lunch special fixed price 3 course which was tasty but for the approx $25 was a bit not fulfilling in terms of appeasing my appetite to get me filled or my hunger satisfied with a full belly compared to what that same money could have gotten elsewhere (like the Wynn Buffet Lunch for roughly the same price and that's AYCE with drinks, appetizers, soups, salads, entrees and deserts)

It's a reliable place, and the pretzel bread sticks are delicious.  It has nice decor.  I'd rank this * * * Three Stars as A-OKAY which I'd recommend and come back to.  It's not necessarily a place I'd crave and think about as a must return to place, but it's also a place where I'd revisit if others wanted to go or the timing and opportunity was right.  There's a lot of great dining options at the Encore and Wynn however too.

I think if they upped their portion sized and left the pricing as is, it would be a lot more fulfilling, satisfying and desirable to crave.
