i4Jb_b28YAphS9_jPPzwkQ Ordered food, it arrived 25 min earlier than the estimated time. The food was still piping hot, everything was crispy, and all of the special directions were followed. Their prices are amazing for the quality and the amount of food you get. We ordered the spicy chicken wings, 2 piece fish and chips and an order of hush puppies. The catfish was a really good size, and the cornmeal breading was delicious!! The hush puppies were awesome, and I couldn't believe that you got 10 in an order! The only complaint was that the order of "hot" or "spicy" wings were extremely mild; although were still good and cooked as requested, my friend had to add her own hot sauce to them. I thoroughly enjoyed my food & will be definitely be eating at the Italian Spoon again, but next time I'm going for the 4 piece catfish!
