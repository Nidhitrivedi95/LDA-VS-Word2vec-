P.S. The delivery guy stunk. He pretended like he couldn't speak English and could not come up to my hotel room. I met him on the street outside the hotel and discovered that he forgot one of my sodas that I ordered. I had to send him away with instructions to get me my soda.  I also explained to him how to deliver to a hotel room, which he did on his second trip.  Altogether laughable customer service.
