j_PL_u4SWW1LoEd2dCu0Iw so as a yelper i saw the reviews for this place one day and decided to take my husband there and we were suprised of how nice the service was and how homey it was there. my husband ordered a small pizza and it was not so small. and i ordered pasta with chicken carbonara it was delicous and the portion was big! definitly a good place to go eat but large groups is limited due to the small space! would be great if they expanded!
