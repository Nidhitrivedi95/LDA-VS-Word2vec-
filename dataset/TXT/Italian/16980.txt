277ETKOLg1XreTWL8hGlHw I came here with a large group for our August Supper Club and had a wonderful time. To begin, Molto Bene is adorable. The decor is modern Italian and inviting, and the restaurant itself appears to be sitting in a former cottage-type building. The minute you walk in, you just get really good vibes. Oh, and if it matters to you: it's BYOB. Should you BYOB, there's also a small corking fee, so be ready for that.

Molto Bene has a wonderful, full Italian menu. I had the Cioppino, which is a seafood stew of clams, shrimp, mussels, scallops, and white fish. I'm a creature of habit and order this dish often around Cleveland, and can safely say this was the best Cioppino I've ever had in Ohio. The herbed tomato and wine broth was rich, decadent and full of flavor, and the minute it hit  my lips, I turned to my friend and said "OMG." I legit ate every single bite. Drooling. They also have the standard pasta, chicken dishes, and anything you could ever want in an Italian restaurant, making it a great place for all ages and taste buds. The food feels authentic and well-prepared. The big highlight of Molto Bene though is the gelato bar-- is made fresh daily with the yummiest flavors. I had the brie with fig, which sounds gross, but was super delicious.

To note: Molto Bene is small, intimate, and romantic. We came here with a large group, but I probably wouldn't do this again. I felt terrible for the amount of stress it put on their small kitchen. It's definitely a cozy joint, and more suited for a date night or small family dinner. Also: it's really warm in there. Dress light. Overall, I left feeling really excited about this family-owned Italian gem and will be back soon.
