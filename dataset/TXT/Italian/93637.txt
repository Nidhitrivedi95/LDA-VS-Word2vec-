EIol8eFrS4WtRUhGbOUUgA One day I complained to a girlfriend who is from Queens NY how much I miss NY pizza and she was the one that mentioned this place to me. But I ignored her wonderful comment "this is the real NY pizza and it taste just like it". The place is down the street from me, so I stopped by and when the smell of their pizza hit my nostrils I remembered her comment...she asked them if they were really from NY and she was told the entire family is from Long Island. After one bite of my one slice of pizza I was taken back to BK (Brooklyn). With closed eyes I had another bite and another and I found myself coming back for more. I am glad my friend told me about this place and I've taken other friends to experience the same excitement I have.
