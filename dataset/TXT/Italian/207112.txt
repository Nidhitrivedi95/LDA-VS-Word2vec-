qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA I was out in Tempe with my pal Kahlua out for a walk when we stumbled across the Postino patio. It's hard to find dog friendly places and even harder to find ones with such excellent service. Little Kahlua is a good judge of character and noticed the friendly attitude of our server Paige who found us a place not too crowded and got both of us waters. She was excellent in offering recommendations, even giving samples of the excellent turkey and bean soup which I settled on with a prosciutto and fig jam sandwich, which was even little k approved. She them recommended the delicious creme brulee. Everything came out fast and even though the restaurant was busy we felt like we were the only ones there as the whole staff especially Paige gave us attention, especially little k. If anyone wants to enjoy an excellent al fresco dinning experience with a little friend then I highly recommend postinos and it's friendly staff especially our server Paige.
