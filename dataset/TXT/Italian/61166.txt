Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg Yum! Warm crusty bread to start, prosciutto caprese with olives antipasto, fettuccine sausage ragout special and a nice cold Peroni. Everything was delicious! Pasta was al dente and the sausage ragout was so creamy and tasty. Husband had Gnocchi and said it was bland - he was very jealous of my dish (I always order better than him :)! My brother had the Chicken Parm and said it was great. We will be back and hopefully have enough room for dessert!
