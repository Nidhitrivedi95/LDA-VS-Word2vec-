2gzB4EE7B_QEFWZtJTG4dA I stopped in for the first time last Sunday. Upscale decor with and service to match.The bartenders are so friendly that they have a following of neighborhood people that are so genuine that I felt like we were drinking in my living room. Great quality food for very reasonable prices and  Happy hour every day
