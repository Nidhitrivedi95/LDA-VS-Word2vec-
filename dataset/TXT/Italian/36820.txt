6We2O5X62J_gduXU7jvf8w Spinatos is my favorite pizza in the valley. The sauce is on the sweet side, but very good. I prefer the thin crust. The service has been above par every time I've been. They gave me a free second pizza once because they weren't satisfied that the first one had a bubble in the dough. I hadn't complained about it, they just weren't satisfied themselves. They gave me both for the price of one, and I happily ate both (with a little help from my daughter).
