5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA Love love love the food, the wine, the view and the service!!  Mike is a phenomenal server who knows the menu inside and out and offers the best suggestions based on your needs! The gluten free pasta is so good you won't even know it's gluten free!

Like...hmmm...I think everything is a love here!!

Dislike absolutely nothing!

Favorite dishes 1) Chicken Francese with risotto "OMG lick the plate delicious" and 2) the shrimp scampi with risotto.  We love shrimp on stone as an appetizer!  The Staggs Leap wine is so good but it will set you back $89...worth it though!
