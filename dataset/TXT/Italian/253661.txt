suspended charcuterie
visible kitchen

cages full of cans
tomato sauces galore
very italian

prompt waitstaff service
though awkward, taking orders
using smartphones? uh

scrumptious margherita
plenty of cheese and basil
nice sprinkle of salt

great crunchy thin crust
though, difficult division
with a fork and knife

on the pricey side
but that pizza was top-tier
it isn't bad here
