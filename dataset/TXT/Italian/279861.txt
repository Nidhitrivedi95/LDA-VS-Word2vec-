yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w My first trip to Battista's came some 12 years ago, and then again a couple years after that for the wedding of a friend.  On both of these visits, I am pretty sure that I did a whole lot more drinking than eating, and my memory is that the food was good, if not downright tasty.

When we went back to Las Vegas, I figured that we had to visit Battista's again, so we stopped by - with the same friend who was married on our last visit.  As it turned out, none of us really drank (other than to taste the wine that still flows freely).  We found out that it's really pretty bad.  Sure, it is included, but the reason for that is that it's just not very good.

The food portions don't seem to be as large as I remember, though the prices haven't really changed that much.  All-in-all, it brings to mind that old saying "you can't go back again".
