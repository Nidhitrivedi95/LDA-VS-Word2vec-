UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ Great pizza spot. Garlic knots were really good. Super filling. The pizza was very good. The service was pretty slow. It took our waitress approximately 16 minutes to come to our table. It wasn't busy at all during our visit, she just seemed to be a very slow paced waitress. Still a good place to eat as long as you have the time to sit. Unfortunately the waitress made me take the rating from a 4 to a 3.
