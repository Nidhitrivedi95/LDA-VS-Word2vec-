It has the same owners because it is a family owned business. It simply has the best sub sandwiches I have ever eaten. I could tell the mechanics of what they do to them, the toasted bread (long before Quizno's and much better), the lettuce, the meats. But they add something else that just marries all the flavors together. I don't know what it is; I understand it is a secret recipe written in Greek that only the owners know (the owners are Greek Americans), but whatever it is, it just takes a good sandwich and makes it great! The sandwiches are worth the drive. DO NOT look at the menu, just order the Super Sicilian like Andrew said, I like to bite the tips off the pepers that are served with it and dump the seeds and juices in the sub. 
As for the price, its close to the big named sub companies...though they are second to none in flavor!
The shop is a little shop, can house arround 25 people. I would sugest to go when its not lunch rush. When you have little more time on your hands, besides you want to enjoy it!
