The bartender was attentive, good humored, and knowledgable. I enjoy starting off testing the house wine. I ordered the house chianti and it was very nice. We devoured the eggplant parm, meatballs, penne pasta, and authentic warm olive bread in a savory marinera sauce. The little Deli was also impressive. Looking forward to our next visit! Thank you Corrado and Staff.
