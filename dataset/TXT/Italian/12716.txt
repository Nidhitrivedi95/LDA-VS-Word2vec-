0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q I was attending a conference at the Aria and one of the vendors at the conference had a "customer appreciation lunch" at Sirio. We had a set menu of baby field greens salad, grilled sea bass with roasted zucchini, potato gnocchi with string beans and basil pesto, grilled beef tenderloin in a barolo-roasted garlic sauce with melted stracchino cheese and asparagus gratin, and Sicilian-style pistachio cannoli. I mentioned to our server that I couldn't eat the beef (I'm vegetarian), so I was served an extra serving of the bass. The salad was good-- not drenched in dressing. The sea bass was tender and flaky-- perfectly cooked. The potato gnocchi was nice and doughy. The crunch of the string beans added a different texture to the gnocchi, which was nice. The cannoli was huge-- at least 6 inches long. Not the most elegant dessert to eat, but it was tasty. We watched the pastry chef prepare the cannoli from the kitchen while we ate. The lunch was only an hour, but the servers kept the pace of the meal going. I'd have to say this is one of the best meals I've had at Las Vegas at the Aria.
