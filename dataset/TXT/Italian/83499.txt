dj6nbGIqguJDXgz49nmFBw I give this place 1 star only because the pizza was still edible and because you wouldn't see my review otherwise. I ordered the two medium deal, along with an order of fries and brownies. I am highly disappointed in the quality and appearance of the pizzas I received today. It seems the cheese on my cheese and pepperoni pizzas migrated to the middle of the pie, leaving both pizzas nearly naked of cheese except at the tips of each slice. Is there no quality check before delivery? Should I have to inspect each item before letting the driver out of my site?My 3 young children were eager to dig in as soon as it arrived, so I couldn't return the pizzas or have the driver come back with replacements, without at least one child having a melt down. As such, they all just had to suck it up and eat what was in front of them, no matter how pitiful its appearance. So sad!!! I only hope that you'll reconsider having food delivered by this location...unless naked pizza is your thing. At the very least, look over your entire order to ensure quality is up to your standards before your delivery driver leaves your door.
