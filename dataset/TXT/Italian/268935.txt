No one came to greet us or take our drink order for 20 mins so I went and asked the hostess if we had a server. She pointed to an older women next to her Lisa and said she would be there in a minute. Lisa proceeded to come over and help the table next to us that had just been sat. The hostess saw what a horrible employee this Lisa was and asked if we wanted to move to the bar. We moved to the bar and this place only regained us by Sami helping us and that the food was fabulous! Sami please fire Lisa!!! Bringing down your business. She Has a chip on her shoulder and an attitude. Almost lost us as customers.
