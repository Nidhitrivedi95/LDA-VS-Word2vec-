Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA Yummmmm, love me some good Italian. 

Straight and to the point: the food was delicious and our waiter was super sweet. He even got all the waiters to sing me Happy Birthday in Italian. 

For Vegas and to be inside the New York hotel, prices were reasonable.

I recommend the Pennoni a la Vodka.... my fave!
