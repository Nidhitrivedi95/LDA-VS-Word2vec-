N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ Went here today to pick up a pizza (my favorite food)  When I called to place the order the person that answered the phone just said: "Hello?" Instead of a proper greeting like most pizza places would offer.  It's not a big deal though because the pizza was really good.  The price was high though... $20 for a 2 topping med. I asked if there was any specials and they said: "No."  I personally like to feel like I'm getting a good deal but no deals on pizza here.  It's all full price.  The pizza was good and was ready on time without having to wait.  For that I'm thankful and may go back some day if I feel like splurging with family or friends that want really good tasting pizza without waiting for a long time.
