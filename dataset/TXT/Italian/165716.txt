M8jzd1hpwI8p0JqcBCINZw I've been to this restaurant a total of 3 times, and each time I've gone, the food was great and I don't really have any complaints.  The atmosphere is welcoming with friendly servers, and its pretty spacious inside as there is also a bar/lounge side and outside patio.  Came here recently for dinner and we ordered the Antipasto Board for Sharing and Chicken Arrostito, which were excellent!  The prices are reasonable, as their pizzas, sandwiches, and pasta are all under $20, and if you sign up on their website to become a 'friend with benefits', you'll also receive a $10 off coupon..sweet. =)  Overall, its a casual restaurant that I prefer over Milestones, Jack Astor's, or Montana's any day!
