usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA Not impressed by this place at all and the wait was really long.  Service was average, decor/atmosphere was average, prices were ok, and the food was disappointing.

I ordered a lamb ragu pasta, but got something that tasted like chicken noodle soup.  Pizza was ok, but nothing memorable and definitely not worth the wait.

Only good thing was that it's BYOB.
