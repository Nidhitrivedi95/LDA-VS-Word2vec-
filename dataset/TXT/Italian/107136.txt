FvJtjO5nuIy5erGbkJpJXw I ate here for the first time recently for a celebration.  We were in a private room so I did not see the main restaurant and can't comment on the atmosphere.  From many of the reviews, people seem to love it.  I found it average at best.  

Upon arriving our drink order was taken promptly, but trying to get a second was nearly impossible. They had one waitress trying to handle about 30 of us.  Now taking that into consideration, she did a good job, but she definitely could've used some help.  

Appetizer platters were brought out, consisting of your average fried bar food.  Not bad, but nothing special.  

The portions are huge.  Almost too big. I ordered the shrimp fravadollo which was supposed to be "made with hot spices" according to the menu.  (And shouldn't that be "fra diavolo"?).  I want to know where the spice was.  If I order something spicy, it's because I want spicy.  Not even a hint of heat.  Kind of bland.  The pasta was cooked correctly, as were the nice sized shrimp, but it was too dry.  Needed more olive oil or something.  The French onion soup was just ok.  I took the leftovers home and fixed it up a bit.  Parmesan cheese sitting out in the little shaker jars....I'd like some fresh grated Parmesan from an Italian restaurant.  

That said, with the waitress working our group by herself, the food came out in a decent amount of time and was hot.  I don't know if being part of a large party was the reason it was so mediocre.  Maybe for a regular dinner visit it would be better, but there are too many good Italian places out there to choose from for me to consider going back to give this one another try.
