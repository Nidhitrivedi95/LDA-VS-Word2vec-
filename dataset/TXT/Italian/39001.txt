7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA Placed a carry out order through grub hub. I got the cajun chicken alfredo and bread sticks. The pasta came to my apartment still piping hot. The meal was good but the noodles were all stuck together which made it difficult to eat. Not sure if the sauce was just super thick or the noodles were over cooked. Either way I'd still eat there again.
