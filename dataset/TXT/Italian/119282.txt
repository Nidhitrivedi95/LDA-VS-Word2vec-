H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g I had a great experience with my family that has two young kids.  The service was fantastic from the server to the water guy, the plate guy ( I guess he was the bus boy.)  Food was very good and the server knew the menu well.  We've never had an experience better even at other fine dining places in Vegas.  It was a one time hit for us and hopefully the next time would be the same.

Our food choices:
Octopus salad was great, a little spicy and not that chewy just like the server described.  The Pork shoulder was enjoyable. The fried mashed potato was amazing.  The potatoes were just slightly crushed so the center can get fried too.  
The other stuff we had were as expected so I leave that out but nothing was disappointing.
