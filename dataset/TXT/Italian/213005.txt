r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA Ate here for the first time today, my husband has eaten here multiple times before and has always loved it. I was not disappointed. We didn't order anything fancy, just some sandwiches and a side of macaroni & cheese for our daughter (we ordered a side because they don't have a kids menu.) The sandwiches were great, just the right amount of meat and the bread they make there was delicious. But, the macaroni & cheese, someone must have sold their soul to the devil for that recipe. It was so good. Even our four year old said it was 'really, really, really good.' It lucked out for us that the side was a full bowl because when she was done with it, my husband and I got to finish it off. We will be going back.
