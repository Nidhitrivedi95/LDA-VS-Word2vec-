qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ Absolutely love this place. Pizza is always fresh and just like New York. I live far away so I am only able to come in around once every couple months, but the owner still seems to remember me every time I am in there and greets me by name! All the guys are super friendly. Would recommend this place to anyone that wants some real New York pizza.
