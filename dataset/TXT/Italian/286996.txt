Zja7ykq3icDzkN20XX6j1w I'm not from this area, so I was unbiased in the great Aiello's -v- Mineo's pizza war that takes place in these parts. I tried both, and while both are good, my clear favorite is Aiello's. 
For traditional pizza, I recommend an 'off the top' pie. It's deliciousness cannot be explained. It's warm meltiness will soothe what ails ya! 
But my all-time go to our is the white. I love a good margarita pizza, so we ordered one here. It was delicious, as expected, but tipped the scales at about $30. Unable to handle the sticker shock, I spent a few minutes looking over the menu before out next visit. If you order a white pizza with stewed tomatoes as a topping, it'll cost you about $10 less! Then we top with fresh basil from the garden and there you have it! So flavorful, and it'll reheat nicely in a toaster oven, but is still good cold, which is the true pizza test.
