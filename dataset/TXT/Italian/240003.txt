UbycymnVPeXDpKCgMssZhA this was actually for Jo-Jo's Sports Bar and since we were just having lunch i didn't get to try much. that said, we got some wings and i had a meatball sub. 

the sub was good enough - though nothing special. 

the Szechuan wings weren't that great - think teriyaki but spicy - actually quite spicy. the Stingin' Honey Garlic wings, however, were delicious though really wet and messy.

i'd really like more of those wings cooked a little more and with maybe a little less sauce.
