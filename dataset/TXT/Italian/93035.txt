Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag I've never really been a fan of Wolfgang puck but i wanted some Italian and this place was the only one open at the time within 0.3 miles lol (yes, I don't like to walk very far).

sat at the bar so we could get the happy hour menu.  ordered chicken wings from there.  $6 for 6 pieces of wings. omg so good!  wings were tender and juicy.

for the entree, I wasn't too hungry so we split a crispy egg plant parmesean with spaghetti noodles on the side.  this dish was also very good!  one complaint is that if you order this, get the egg plant on the side to it'll stay crispy.  they were so nice to split the plate for us.  oh yeah I wanted some type of meat so added chicken to the entree.  $5 for like 6 slices of chicken.  

overall,  cute place and great food!  THOSE HAPPY HOUR WINGS THO :)
