O4-yHHUYMYaiOVsgg8ImUw Ate here for Mother's  Day. We had a reservation  and I'm  glad. Those without  one had to wait for  a while  to get a table. The food was good but it took about an hour and 20 minutes for us to eat. 2 sdults and a child. We only  ordered dinner and dessert ,  no appetizers . The service was slow. The staff were extremely  polite and attentive. There were a lot of large parties being that it was a holiday, however I feel like the cook needed more help.

Heads up, this is not a place to go for ambiance. There is literally  nothing on the walls other than paint. Though the food was good and we'll  go back, the plating was nothing special and quite plain.
