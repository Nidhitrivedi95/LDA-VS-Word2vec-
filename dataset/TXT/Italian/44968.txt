8E6Cu9E0gCg6FgffWXl8mA I had a bad experience at this restaurant. My boyfriend and I came here a few weeks ago. We made reservations, however when we got there, our table was not ready. We were seated in a very awkward spot at the back of the restaurant while we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. When we got our table, we literally waited a half hour before someone came to attend to us. My boyfriend actually had to get out of his seat and track a waiter down to come and see us. After letting someone know we were STILL waiting, we waited another 10 minutes before they were able to see us. Not to mention the waiter was not very apologetic about the situation.
The food was okay. Not spectacular, although I'm sure I would have found it in me to appreciate it more had the experience been better. I understand all restaurants have good and bad moments - but this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. The service was something I would expect to happen at a cheap franchise, not upscale place.

I will never go back
