4sPSNBZo2sLxEGDvUHGdbg Time to check out the new Italian Restaurant in Vaughan.
Tucked away behind Vaughan Mills this place a hidden Gem.

Even though Yelp and a various other website rate this a simple restaurant it is far from it.

The place is nice with a very modern ambiance and some rustic elements.

Food is very good here yet slightly more expensive than the neighboring two other family restaurants in the plaza.

I ordered two pizzas one pasta two appetizers and a bottle of wine for three people and the bill was close to $200.

The Gorgonzola gnocchi was perfectly done and you can taste the cheese.

Vegetarian pizza was very nicely done enjoyed every bite the other pizza was slightly too salty.

The appetizers including polenta fries and Caesar salad we're done to perfection. I would say it's better than most others in the area.

Drinks including the house wine and coffee or excellent.

We ordering the house-made desserts since the other items like cheesecake or just brought in from a local supplier.

Overall I was very happy with the meal and I enjoyed being there. I will come back for date night and special occasions.
