Zja7ykq3icDzkN20XX6j1w I was in Pittsburgh for a Pirates game and had to stop in at Aiello's Pizza once again for my favorite pizza. Oh man, Aiello's is the best of the best. 

We wasn't able to eat at Aiello's the last time because there was no place to park, so this time we had pizza for breakfast. It was a rainy day and plenty of street parking. We had the white pizza again and I could have ate my weight in it.
