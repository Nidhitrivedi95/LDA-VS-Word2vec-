U7fZfH9C4hj5BFRYaPOo2w As we were at the Montelucia resort for the night we figured we would check out their 'Slow Movement' restaurant Prado. Well slow service just what we received. The place was busy (not jammed) and the waiters just couldn't cope, The service was painfully slow and our guy was frankly jaded. He said all the right things but you didn't believe a word of it.

I had some delicious scallops but with polenta that was essentially fancy grits. I have tasted much better elsewhere. I went on to lamb for my entree which was OK, but again just OK. 

To top off the evening our red wine was served at room temperature and I mean Arizona with no AC room temperature! Not good. 

I would pass on this place and if you are staying at the otherwise excellent resort. Jump in a cab and head to the nearby excellent Tarbells on Camelback Road.
