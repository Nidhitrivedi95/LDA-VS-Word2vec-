mkjIZdBL8IDcBx804P4uZA Haven't had a Pizza Hut pizza in ages, but had a coupon for 2 pizzas with 2 toppings for $6.99 each so I thought I give them another chance. In the past we found the Pizza Hut pizzas too greasy and soggy in the middle. This time the pizzas were spot on. The hand tossed crust was soft around the edges with just the right amount of sauce and ingredients and no soggy middles!
Parking is easy and the staff was friendly and efficient. The pizza was ready exactly when they said it would be.
