vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA great place! starts with a nice selection of Scotches or Bourbons. A very nice wine list with bottles ganging $150 to $45,000 (I have no clue who would order a $45,000 bottle of wine...)

The food is great and the service is excellent. I would describe it as boutique family style atmosphere. 

All in all, not the bast place for the money - nothing spectacular, good average food.
