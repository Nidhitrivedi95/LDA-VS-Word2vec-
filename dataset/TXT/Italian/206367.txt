qFqueIKCVF5PlXmjl1YY9Q I took my office to Frost after a team building event and I couldn't have asked for a better experience to end the night with our Associates. Marisa was one of the servers there who really stood out. She was fast and had great leadership and she was really patient with our large group! Because of people like her and the others there you earned our business forever. Great gelato product there too!
