ws09HDqOIfyKMN0TSp3YKQ Let me just start by saying, I LOVE noodles&company.  However, this location has messed up the last time.   I was there 3/21/16.  Probably around 8pm.    Line moves very slowly because the girl at the counter was also taking the calls (throughout the visit, I had seen at least 5 or 6 different staff so someone else could have done that so she could take orders).  
I ordered the pad Thai with extra sauce, no tofu, because they were out. AGAIN!  every visit I've had to this place they have always been out of something. Last time it was the cheese for the Mac and cheese.
I wait for about 15 minutes as people get there food that came in after me.  I can hear the girl at the counter telling customers trying to order that they are out of this or that.    
I finally get my food, and go to the station were they keep the lemons.   None are there (just like last time)
Takes me 5 minutes to get a staffs attention before they tell me they are actually OUT.   
Tables and floor were littered with trash.  Honestly never seen any resteraunt so bad.   I should have asked for my money back. 
I paid 10 dollars to get food I didn't even get how I wanted, and wait in a disgusting dining area.
I have been to many other noodles and have never been disappointed!  This one however needs some serious changes.  The only thing this noodles had Goin for them was a mostly friendly staff.
