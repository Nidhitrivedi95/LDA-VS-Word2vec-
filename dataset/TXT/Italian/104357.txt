FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Recently met up with friends on a Saturday afternoon for mimosas and $5 wines. I had not been to this location! Postino Arcadia is my hang out. Gotta say.. I like this one as much! Well, minus the valet dealio. But really there is not much space to do much with. I am such a fan of Postino bruschettas..I raved about them to my boyfriend for months before I got him in here on this particular Saturday. So, instead of him letting me shine my bruschetta knowledge on him..somehow he tells the waiter he wants a mix up and before I could intervene.. the waiter is off and brings us a variety of bruschetta he chose. NOT what I would have chose. But okay. Sometimes I like to be controlling. I am working on that;-) We gobbled that one board down.. and we order another.. Always my favs, of course, (there's that Postino bruschetta knowledge and control thing again!), salami pesto; tomato jam/sheeps milk cheese;roasted peppers/goat cheese; proscuitto/fig/mascarpone cheese.. yum. I wish that Postino would let the customers fill out a card though on 'ideas' for bruschettas. I'd love to see a hot jam with a goat cheese. Or a pancetta and sharper cheese like a french salut or even a sheep's milk cheese. I am never, ever disappointed with Postino. Not.Ever. Great salads. Paninis. Adore the cheese board. Love the $5 wine hours on the daily and the mimosas too. Now I have my boyfriend loving it and thankfully, there are enough brews on tap that he likes should it not be a wine day for him.
