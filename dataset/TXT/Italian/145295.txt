k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ Pretty damn good pizza! The rice balls were great as well! The only thing we ordered that was not a 5 was the eggplant caponata. I grew up eating eggplant caponata and it's one of my faves. This version lacks that classic taste. I would rate the caponata a 2. Now back to the pizza, the reviews don't lie. This place has really good fired pizza. The toppings are delicious. No need to rewrite what has been said before. The mini arincini (rice balls) were pretty good as well, we'll be back!
