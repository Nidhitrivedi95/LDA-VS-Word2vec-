81mlHKogQMh8E6f0r6AYTQ We've been waiting for Times Square to open this new location. It was well worth the wait with an extensive menu (even including breakfast) offering a variety of dishes to suit any palette. The service was very good even as the restaurant began to get busy with the 5 o'clock dinner guests. I try to order my standard baked ziti w/ meatballs to compare against other places we enjoy.  Scrumptious!  Loved it!  The Mrs. brought half of her very delicious ravioli home. I don't think she plans on sharing.  Welcome to the West Valley!  No doubt we'll be back, with friends, and often.
