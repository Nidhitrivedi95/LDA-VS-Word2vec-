BXRMY37d7gNLop2eSWjPWw One of the best Italian restaurants in Fife, a great meal at a good price in a nice atmosphere can't really ask for more. The Lunch time menu is particularly good for the price but we've been coming here for around 5 years and never had a bad meal yet, thought I'd leave feed back as I've just joined Yelp but their trip advisor rating is excellent too.
