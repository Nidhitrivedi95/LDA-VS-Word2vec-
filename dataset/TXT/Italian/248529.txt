VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ Great facility. Many menu selections. Service SLOW. Kitchen very slow. One great server other two had no clue. Had to track server down for coffee refill, utensils, order another drink. Got our own catsup salt pepper Tabasco to add to our cold breakfast once it finally arrived. Oh and got a steak sandwich not the steak tacos that were ordered by one of us. Only took another 25 minutes to get the tacos. Really? Scrambled eggs and steak tacos not exactly difficult to prepare. Go, but do not expect attentive and competent service and make sure you have lots of time.
