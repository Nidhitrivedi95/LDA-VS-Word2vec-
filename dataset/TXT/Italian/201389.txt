PxTKXsdYqoFHWAG2amz0XQ A cute little restaurant located inside the Hilton Garden Inn downtown. I really enjoyed the modern decor with the symmetrical gold light fixtures. They offered both inside and outside seating and I love how they use the wine wall to separate a part of the dining room next to the bar. 
I started off with a Moscow mule and I loved loved that the drink was served in a copper mug. I know it's only a mug but when I order that drink, i expect it to be served in a copper mug. The beer choices were also really good.
Then we ordered the Charcuterie plate which was amazing!!! The portion was generous and everything on the plate was so delicious. It's one of the best charcuterie plates I've tasted. I was a little bummed that it was served on a plate instead of a cheese board but it was so good that it didn't matter. Then for our main dish we ordered the baby scallops served with grill white asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, grilled potato coins, white chocolate bean cream topped with fried wonton strips. The scallops were plump and juicy and it had a nice sweet taste from the white chocolate bean sauce.
Overall I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant, the food was delicious and our server was great. For our 3 drinks, appetizer and main entree our bill came out to $100 which is a bit pricy but at least the food was amazing so it was money well spent!
