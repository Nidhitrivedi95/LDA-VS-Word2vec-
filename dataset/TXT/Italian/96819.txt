2. It was not busy this Monday late afternoon, early evening. It read "Seat yourself" and we did but the staff seemingly ignored us. 

3. The service was minimal. An order was taken, food was delivered - there was no intermediate service for refills or asking how our food was or checking in on us, and then the bill. The waiter disappeared on us twice for extended periods in this small place. Once, he was chatting up another waiter with his backed turned to us for several minutes. Another time, the male waiter walked quickly, hands free, right by us - with our two glasses empty, one Pepsi and another water - and didn't bother to look or notice. A second female waiter eventually came by but by then it had been about 10 minutes. 

4. Furthermore, when the small complimentary bread was gone, I wanted a little more but then again the waiter did not come by. 

5. The price for my Salmon at $22, a dozen oysters at $22, clam chowder at $7, a Cosmopolitan drink at $14, and Pepsi at $3.50 plus tax and tip seemed excessive to us for the quality, portion size and (lack of) service. 

6. My Salmon was a little dry but okay. The Asparagus consisted of four stalks and four carrots with some okay rice. 

7. I think many of the reviews are valid but some appear to be paid reviews to counter actual negative reviews.

8. On the good side, the oysters were good.
