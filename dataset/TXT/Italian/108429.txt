fzxvmA3Ygu3yrQQ6-cEpTw Awesome experience-Scarpetta has been my favorite restaurant for years now and I couldn't wait for Mora to open up out here in Phoenix . Everything we got was delicious. The staff was extremely  pleasant and friendly and  I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu .
