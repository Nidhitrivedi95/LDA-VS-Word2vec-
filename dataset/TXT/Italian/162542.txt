LqO_983CEmi1_X1En4mZow Awesome place!  Ate in the steakhouse, enjoyed a cigar in the cigar lounge and then sat on the patio listening to the bands outside.  The food was great!  I lived in New England over 30 years and the lobster roll was as good as any I would get there and the scallops were cooked just right.  Our waiter, James, was great, highly attentive.  The inside entertainment, Ronnie Hazelett was great in such an intimate atmosphere. We will be coming back in about two weeks and bringing friends. This may become a weekly trip.
