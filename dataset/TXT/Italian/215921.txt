RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ We hadn't been to Different Pointe of View for at least 12 years, so we decided to make a visit during Restaurant Week.  First off, the restaurant can boast 5 star views of the Valley...truly stunning!  The service was quite good too...everyone that came by the table was professional and friendly.  The decor is actually quite dated when you really look at it...however, you are so distracted by the view that you barely notice.  The food was 2 stars at best and quite disappointing.  We started with the pear and butter leaf salad (best food of the night) and the lobster bisque (my husband said it tasted burnt), continued on with the pork chop (dry and chewy) and the fish special (overcooked with rice that was crunchy) and finished with the carrot cake (something crunchy other than nuts in there...not sure what that was) and the peanut butter chocolate mousse (hard, didn't taste at all like peanut butter and appeared to be full of sugar/caramel in the center).  In my opinion, they need to step up their food game in order to be competitive with the many first rate restaurants in the Valley!
