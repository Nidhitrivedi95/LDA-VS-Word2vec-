W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg Groupon strikes again!  I usually stick to the old stand-bys in Little Italy (Mama Santi's, Trattoria) but thanks to Groupon, I was forced to try something new.  Now, I can't entirely say that I'm happy I did but I'd be willing to give La Dolce Vita another try when I'm not in a hurry.  My husband and I split a salad (arugula, goat cheese, tomatoes, roasted red pepper, black olives, served on a bed of lettuce) and a pizza (Mediterraneo -  tomato sauce, eggplant, zucchini, roasted red peppers, smoked mozzarella cheese) as well as the lemon sorbet and the tiramisu which was PHENOMENAL.  Definitely large enough for two people to share and pretty complex for tiramisu.  The salad and pizza were good but the crust isn't anything to write home about.   It seems like they haven't quite figured out how to get the recipe right.  

One plus about this place is their outdoor patio. It's large and bright and comfortable.  If I'd had the time I would have ordered a bottle of wine and lazily sat outside all day, eating bread and olive oil to my heart's content.  Oh well.  Guess it will have to wait until next time.
