P034NqfS_1sf-pC51170Kg l like bravo for my aunt, it's close to her house, and she's ninety. My partner and l took her out for Easter. The place was packed and I'm sure it was a nightmare for all who worked. With that being said I blew a hundred dollars on the eggplant that was impossible to cut. My poor partner who has celiac, ordered the gluten free pasta. It floated to the table in watered down sauce, the pasta was chewy, and cheap garlic powder made it uneatable. The best part of the dinner? The cofee and desert. l really dispise paying a lot for crappy food. Bravo was good at one time, but the last few times l was there l felt as if it's a step away from the Olive Garden.
