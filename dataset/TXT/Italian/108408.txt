fzxvmA3Ygu3yrQQ6-cEpTw Another great meal at Mora! I've been in a few times and have yet to be let down (not that I would expect to be!) By far my favorite thing are the veal & pork meatballs, simply perfection! Be sure to have a reservation on peak nights, this place is the hottest thing in the valley right now! My favorite drink has to be the Rose on tap, it is the best rose I have ever had. I will be back soon! (Be sure to try the bread cart as well, you won't regret it!)
