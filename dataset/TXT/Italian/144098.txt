jW4-bGuymLGlB9OBsTq3TA Was here when I was at southpointe for a meeting. I ordered a chicken salad. The chicken was not my favorite. It is dry and not seasoned well. I liked the dressing and the greens tasted fresh and crispy. 

They also served bread with olive oil and some seasoning that I don't know since I didn't eat it. For a group of six people, it wasn't easy to stretch and get the bread from a single plate that is at the center of the table; especially in a formal meeting set up.
