Jv5NmXlB3XuLR3yk7B8amw The wife and i after being wishy washy about diner home or out chose out not wanting to venture to far we chose anzios we have been by this place 100s of times and always say.........we need to try this place.....so last night was the nite when we walked in i had visions of sitting in the bar having a cocktail and a app so we ventured into the bar which was empty and the lights were up bright and the tv blasting  we pulled up a tall chair at a table and sat the chair was very  uncomfortable  the server was nice to shut the tv off after my wife said it was to loud then after all that we decided to sit in the dining room. the server seamed a little miffed but not to. we pulled into a big comfy booth and ordered calamari which came w/marinara sauce for dipping no james beard award but tasty then we split the chicken/sausage diablo w/bowtie pasta which were NOT aldente way overcooked for my taste but the sauce was good the dinner came w/1 salad he accedently brought 2 and left it for no charge the server was prompt and friendly and the food all and all was decient...........so now we've tried it not sure i will rush back but worth a try.the wine list is pricey 31 dollars for a bogle petite syrah    ( 8dollar at trader joes) and higher
