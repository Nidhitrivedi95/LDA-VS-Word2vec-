Horrible girl behind the counter could not have been less friendly. Mexican guy wearing an Italia shirt refused to say hello.

Slices are now quite tiny and far from as flavorful as they used to be. The crust is still some of the best in town but unfortunately everything else fails.

Oh well I guess.
