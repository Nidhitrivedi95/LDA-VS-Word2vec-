nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A My husband and I ate here in late June 2017 in between lunch/dinner crowd. We were seated and our waiter was spot on (not hovering but available whenever needed). I had seen Eggplant Parm on the lunch menu but noted it was not on the "Sunset" menu (3-5pm) and our waiter responded he thought they could manage that but said he couldn't promise...but he delivered. OMG...it was DIVINE!!! It was the perfect balance of crispy eggplant on the outside and not too squishy on the inside. My husband got the Spaghetti Pomodoro - it was delicious. But, honestly, it was the Caesar Salad that was even more memorable. My husband took a bite of the "crouton" and told me I had to try it. Well, it was polenta squares that were deep-fried. WOW! It transformed the salad to something we had never experienced. Their Acai Mojito was great, too. Impressive and memorable!
