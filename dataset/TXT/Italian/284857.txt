ZE1n6H-4qgq_7z67qa4yUA Mmmmmmmmmm....Gaaaaaaaaspers!  Mary S. took me here (see her review below) and we definitely enjoyed ourselves.  The fresh bread they brought out enticed me right away and their menu choices for creative pasta and meat dishes did as well.  I had so much trouble choosing off the menu, that our super nice waiter talked me into one of their specials.  It was a chicken dish that had a lemon sauce to die for!  The chicken was cooked to perfection and the sauce was not too tart or thinned out.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and ate way more than I normally do.  

Mary let me try a piece of her margherita pizza that she had them add sausage to and I must say, it is way better than the pizza over at Pizzeria Bianco.  It wasn't burnt on the bottom or edges and the toppings were flavorful...and I didn't have to wait in line for 2 hours to eat it!  

We agonized over the dessert menu and finally decided to share the cheesecake.  It did not disappoint and was moist as moist can be.  Yum!  Gasper's definitely requires a return trip, or two, or three!
