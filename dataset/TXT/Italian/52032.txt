9NGXZyn-GHYB-vKC63gOag This place is so much better as an Italian restaurant! I went when it was  Eddie 'n' Eddie. My burger was alright and the service was good. We ate there for the again last week (after they switched to just Italian) and loved it! Not expensive and the food was good. Our service was great. We waiting a half an hour for a table but you are going to wait anywhere on a Saturday night at 7:00pm. Totally give Eddie Cerino's Casual Italian a try, you won't be disapointed.
