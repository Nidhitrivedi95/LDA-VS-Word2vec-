8yiLVWzJyyTEhYE0fVNvlA I've eaten here twice and both times I had a great experience. I love how they (several people each with a separate offering)  show up with appetizers as soon as you sit down (Cheese, bread, olives and bruschetta).You have plenty to eat before your cocktail arrives (sorta). They have a great blend of Italian dishes from pasta to fish. They have so many specials you really don't need the menu. Service is very good - some of the best I have experienced in Las Vegas.  It's a little hard to find, but when you do you won't be disappointed.
