AKQbrvRBZvU5kB9Ut4gVkg Top notch Italian food in the heart of the city. Started with the fried mozzarella with pesto and marinara.  Without question, the best I've ever had.  Then had a very tasty Mista salad.   After reading other reviews, I knew it would be an 'on top of old smokey' meatball night.  I went with the old school rigatoni with marinara and meatballs.  The meatballs were as tender and good as others had said.  The portion was generous and pasta cooked to perfection...with just the right snap when I bit down.  No mush mounds being served here. 

My 21 year old son was just as impressed.  He had the margarita pizza with meatball.  I sampled a piece after seeing the big pizza oven and reading the rave reviews.  The crust was especially good.  Crisp with a hint of sweetness.  

The service  was also excellent.  Our server, Casey, (a Cameron Diaz look-a-like) checked on us throughout our meal.
