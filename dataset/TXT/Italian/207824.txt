qlg2QMEErgseygqs_MQETA My fourth and last visit to M Tavern.  I am admitting defeat.  The other restaurants in this group are not run as poorly.  At none of the 4 visits was our table ever ready on time, no matter how early we come.   Our server, a seemingly nice enough guy, never came back to ask how things were.  We literally had to flag down someone to help us.   Ordered lobster bisque & a margarita pizza.  Bisque was served room temperature and pizza was barely warm.  The food is so uneven.  Too much of dinner with friends was spent dealing with food and service.   Of course, they took care of the check but still resulted in not a nice evening out.
