CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA I've been getting Venezia's pizza since I moved out to Tempe for ASU and have loved that it's so close to my place and usually pretty quick for delivery time. 

However, this time I got my delivery and was not too impressed. I ordered a salad, which was opened and spilled in the bag it came in and didn't come with the dressing. Everything else was pretty good and the food tastes very good!! 

I was just taken back by the person who delivered my food. The issue was he couldn't find my apartment so I answered his phone call and tried to direct him in the right direction. I decided to step outside to see where he was. Well he was right in front of my place so I went and got my food from him. He was very rude and argued with me on why I wasn't more clear of where I live. I guess I should have been, but the directions I gave were pretty descriptive. 

All in all, I was just very disappointed in the service. I guess next time I'll be picking up the food instead of getting delivery.
