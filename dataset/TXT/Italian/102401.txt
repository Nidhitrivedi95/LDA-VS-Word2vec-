FhVYpbvE8IQeUHAcwPPIXg I went to this restaurant based solely on the reviews I read here. I was very hesitant because there where a lot of warnings to stay away but I live around the corner and I want small businesses to succeed!
Unfortunately, It just wasn't good. The entire process was wrong!
Food listed for one price was another, our waitress was horrible...talk about upselling, she kept trying to steer us to the most expensive for everything, we waited FORRREVVVVEEERRR for every item we ordered and forget about the check??? She took 20 minutes to get me back my card, and then told how she likes people to relax with her so she purposely stalls...her words, not mine!
The food wasn't horrible but isn't good either! The tomato sauce is SO sweet on the pizza. The white sauce pies were off-putting and the salad dressing the give you with dinner was terrible.
I wanted so much to like this place, the manager was so sweet and appeared to really care but unless something changes this place will be a statistic in 6 months!
