While at Spinato's, I was treated to a display of the restaurant's outstanding service. A table of business diners were upset because one had asked for cheese after receiving a calzone and didn't realize that meant making a whole new calzone. Instead of appreciating the lengths Spinato's will go to provide a fresh, delicious meal, she shrieked, "Can't you just throw some cheese on top?" And her pal was mad because he asked for sweet peppers and then ate his sandwich before the peppers arrived. 

To the servers' credit, they comped a few items, boxed what couldn't be waited for and apologized profusely. I wouldn't have handled it so well.

So, for me, Spinato's doesn't compare with Pino's, but we're talking a different style of pizza. I certainly will be back when in Arizona.
