CR2DMfg3uP02PKT_fuygIw My husband and I ordered a calzone and half rack of ribs...the calzone had NO flavor No seasoning of any kind, completely bland.  Literally a few bites in (I say few because he wanted to make sure) it went in to the trash:-(

My ribs were so dry it was as if they where sitting under a heat lamp ALL day....no amount of Bbq sauce could hide the dryness.  The onion rings were good. 

After they took are delivery order they called back 20mins later asking for are debit card number again....they had in put it incorrectly:-/

We won't be eating from here again.  That was like throwing are money directly into the trash.
