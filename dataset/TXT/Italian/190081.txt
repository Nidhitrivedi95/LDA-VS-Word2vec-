P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw We went to NCP on a Monday around lunch time and they weren't too busy which we were happy about. We ordered the Garlic rolls for the appetizer. They were so delicious and different from any other knots or rolls that I had had before. They have cheese in the middle and plenty of garlic taste. I will definitely have those again. there were 5 of us in my party, so we decided to order 2 pies. We got the Guinea's pie and the Back Home pie. They were both really good! I'm not a big an of spinach on my pizza, but I even liked it on the Guinea's pie. I'd try it again. I really want to try the Margarita pizza next time. We will be back soon!
