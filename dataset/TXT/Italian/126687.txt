HtpNW2ksFbflBHBs7t3AFw Simply the best Veal parmigian sandwich.  Ask for hot peppers on it!!!  They make a great meatball sandwich as well.  The place is pretty much a dump or whole in the wall...but isn't that what you want in a "dive" ... those are the best places for good food!

I feel sorry for the people that go to Subway or Wendy's in the same plaza, they have no idea what they're missing out on.  i say keep it dank, keep it old looking, but keep it comin'...... never had a better veal parmigian sandwich anywhere!
