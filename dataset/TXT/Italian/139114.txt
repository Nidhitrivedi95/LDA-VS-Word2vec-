I've been wanting to go to Bacaro for awhile, but my husband and I have been too busy.  We finally made time last night.

Atmosphere: 5 stars.  Great atmosphere, dimly lit, very nice.

Service: 5 stars... we found the service to be extremely high caliber without being 
snooty.  We ate at NOMI in Chicago a few weeks ago and the service was comparable.  Quality and Kind... just the kind of service we adore.

Food: PERFECT.  I'm not a "foody" but I adore good food.  The octopus was the best I've ever had.  The gnocchi was incredibly savory.  My husband tried the steak and I had the lamb special.  Both were FANTASTIC.  

Wine suggestion: 4.5 Stars.  Wine was good, not great.  I'm not sure if we failed to describe what we wanted.  Would be nice to have some descriptions in the wine menu.  We've been to several nice restaurants in Chicago that provided descriptions of at least a subset of wine choices.  This is such a minor point though.

We did not eat dessert as we were stuffed.

I can't say enough good things about this very very special restaurant.  I'm just disappointed we took so long to finally get around to eating there.  We will be back... this is now my favorite restaurant in Champaign Urbana!!
