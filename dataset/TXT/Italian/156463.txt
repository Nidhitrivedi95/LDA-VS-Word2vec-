The cooking is honest, simple and delicious.  I generally avoid pasta at restaurants because it's usually boring. But here, even the humble spaghetti is noteworthy.  Salads have just the right amount of vinaigrette. Bread is the best bread ever!  Desserts are homemade, delicious and generously portioned.  Everything about the place is humble, honest, caring and inviting. Great atmosphere for a quiet, romantic dinner.
