iNhP0ejUf2jVzaR5YCOoEQ Came here on the recommendation of a friend and the food definitely didn't disappoint. I ordered the shrimp Alfredo which was so flavourful and the pasta was cooked to perfection. Also got the mussels for my appetizer (which I normally don't do) and really enjoyed that as well--the sauce it came in was so tasty and perfect for dipping bread. To drink I got a mojito which was also very tasty.

The decor at this restaurant is really outdated and the crowd is more of an older one. The service was average--our waitress did take quite a while to come take our orders but other than that, everything went well.

Overall, I enjoyed my time here but it's not near where I live so I probably won't be back unless I'm in the area.
