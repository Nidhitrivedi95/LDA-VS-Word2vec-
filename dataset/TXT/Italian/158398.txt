LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Last night was me and my boyfriends last night in vegas.. We asked our server Corinna  what was her favorites  and she told us the beef madalions and lobster pasta (cant remember the name) omg died and went to hevan after the frisf bight..beef was soo tender didnt need a knife and pasta was so cheesy  and delish. Plus you get warm rolls with butter and vinegar  and oil. Sk as the dinner came to an end we had left overs so she boxed them up for us and put in free lemon cookies. All around best service  thank you Corinna
