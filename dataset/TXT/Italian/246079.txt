UYJLWDj_jytplZEkjPe6sg After my complaint, the corporate office contacted me and offered a $25 gift card. That was nice. But what really made the difference for me, was when Mark the general manager called me directly to apologize and wanted to know who my service was with so he could use it as a coaching experience. These are the qualities of good leadership. Since then my family has been back several time and always had a good experience. Thank you Olive Garden for putting in the effort to continued good service.
