go_uJsNgk2WCRtl5m-v72g Last night after a very long day at work my hubby decided to take me out to dinner we got there only 45 minutes before closing and were seated with Tom (our server) he was AMAZING! Didn't make us feel rushed and every order was out fast. The food was fantastic. We will continue to return to this location because of Tom and the amazing staff:)
