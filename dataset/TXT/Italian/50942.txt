9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg I've been to Scaddabush quite a few times and while the atmosphere is nice, the food is just okay. Here is a list of everything I've had here and its rating out of 5. 

*Appetizers*
Calamari - 3/5. No spicy mayo or chipotle??
Chicken Parmesan Bites - 2/5. Would not try again.

*Mains*
Margarita pizza - 3.5/5. Basic, good. 
Sophia pizza - 4/5. Second favorite main here. 
Brick chicken - 3/5. Extremely salty. Not worth the price.
Lobster Spaghetti - 4/5. Best main though it's very oily.

*Dessert*
Tiramisu - 4.5/5. Yes, this is good. Comes in a mason jar. Super creamy, strong coffee flavor, no lady fingers.

**Final verdict**
Go here if you feel like having okay/good Italian food and you don't want to shell out too much dough. That was a joke cause I said dough and this is an Italian place. 3/5 overall.
