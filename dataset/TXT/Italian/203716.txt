Q6Lp73mfUnb7_DVkbzijYA Was in one evening last week and had dinner with my partner, had a soup issue, everything else wasn't bad.  The two guys working that night were raving about the brunch so we thought we would take two of our dear friends out the following Sunday.   

We Arrived this past Sunday and the waitress didn't even know there was a brunch menu.   We asked for coffee and she brought it to us.  We were the only 4 people in the restaurant and we had to flag her down to ask for more coffee.  

The same waitress did not know what was on the benedict plate, and the cook had to come out and tell her if there was potatoes or not included with the eggs benne!
So we ordered 3 benedicts and one lox and onion......We were surprised when it arrived and the LOX came as a western omellete that was raw inside.  It came with toast (the cold dry type with no butter on them): the end pieces of the loaf that should have put in the garbage 2 days before.  It also sported cold potatoes.

When the 3 benedict arrived, eveything was cold.  The english muffin had just been opened onto the plate, falling apart from dryness.  Not toasted at all.  The backbacon was grilled (not griddled) so it was allowed to cook in it's own fat and was burnt which eggs benny is not supposed to be.  The eggs were cold - told by the other servers in the previous visit that the hollandais sauce was home made - but for the amount given, it didn't  matter if it was homemade or not because you could not taste it.  

I went over the 10 things that were wrong with the food, she did offer to send it back to the kitchen, but by the time I was able to get her attention,I was already over 1/2 way finished.

I left very upset.  I've never left a restaurant so upset in my life (and I'm close to 50  and go out quite a bit)

Stay away from this place - unless the other 3 restaurants on Baldwin street are closed and your legs are broken and you cannot walk to another street.  Even then, have someone carry you.
