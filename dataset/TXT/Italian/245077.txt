UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ My department of 8 came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon.  Without a reservation, we only had to wait 5 mins prior to be seated.  The lunch menu was pretty decent.  Many options to chose from, such as salad, pasta, paninis, flatbreads and more.

I decided to go with angel hair pasta with salmon.  The angel hair pasta was cooked perfectly, not too soft, not too hard.  The salmon was a a tad bit more cooked than I would have liked, but because there was a nice scampi butter sauce, it was still delicious.

I will definitely return to try their items on the happy hour menu.
