LFxMt7Oi0vdsmZ3h_UBV-g Third visit to Nodo - second to this location and both times were a 'miss'. The other location just seems to have their flavours down and overall higher level of service and thus, just a better experience.

Were a group of six friends -- all of us visited the other location a few weeks ago but since this location is closer to us, we thought we'd give it a try. Left a lot to be desired in the wake of a fabulous experience at the Junction location.

Bruschetta (6/10) - great dough but totally missed the mark with seasonings
Salad (7/10) - decent but nothing noteworthy
Pasta (4/10) - noodles were mushy and cream sauce had hardened since the pasta came out quite cold
Fish (6/10) - tiny portion and again, lacking seasoning/flavour
Pizza (5/10) - great crust but toppings were not fully cooked through and cheese hadn't melted. Also came out very cold. 

Service was friendly but S-L-O-W.

Overall a miss, which is a shame since we love the other location! There are other great options in the area, but if we're ever craving Nodo we'll be trekking to the Junction and skipping the disappointment at Hillcrest.
