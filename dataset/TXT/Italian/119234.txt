H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g I had the lasagne and a glass of recommended red wine. The lasagna was as good as expected, the wine was better. She had some moscato and pizza... both were better than average. It was busy, they looked a little short staffed. We both kind of felt a little forgotten about in the beginning and rushed towards the end. Definitely a good time!!
