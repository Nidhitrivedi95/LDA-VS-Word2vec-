vxadNrpTY7OHNmWsrEpNnA Went with some friends for brunch.  

Food was delicious and we were seated right away!  Our server was definitely not on his A game - super spacey/all over the place...not quite sure what was going on there but regardless I'd definitely go back for the food. 

The woman at the register was super friendly too!
