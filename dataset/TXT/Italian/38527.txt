7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ I have been to the grocery store a few times and to the restaurant once. The grocery store sells this really good pistachio gelato and some interesting wines. The service was always good but the lines were ever-present when I visited (weeknights). 

My experience at the restaurant was good. My date and I had the pizza I think, and even though we had to sit at the bar because of the crowds, it was a decent experience and I'd recommend this place for anyone looking to change up their usual restaurant choice for a night.
