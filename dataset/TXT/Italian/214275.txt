RFbMVekR8lU9tPJ8sWrwHg The food and service were great.  Our waiter Andre' was a good waiter and the restaurant is a nice place, however; what's the deal with the owner ?? This old and crusty owner was on the staff so bad my wife wanted to leave and not finish her "Spigola" (which was superb). He was really abusing his staff and we could see that one of the Servers (who we were told was new) was visibly upset and we watched the owner chew him out behind the bar. Not sure if we can recommend this place based on that type of behavior.  Too Bad.
