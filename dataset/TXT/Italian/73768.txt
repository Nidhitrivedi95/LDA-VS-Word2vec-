cOWXtCz7F9GQhPIks8gm6Q I was actually looking for another restaurant that no longer existed apparently so stopped in here on a whim because I was so hungry.  I have the broasted chicken sandwich with an arugula salad  and I have to say it was probably the best sandwich I have ever had.  The bread was fresh and warm, the cheese on the sandwich was yum and hte sauce was not over powering.  Would go back again if I lived here.
