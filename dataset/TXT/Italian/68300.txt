BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I have lived in the area for about 10 months and was looking for something new to try.  Found this place with my dad one night and had a blast!  The staff was super-friendly, food fantastic and the atmosphere perfect.  It is owner-operated and not a chain so the care and attention of a "Local" restaurant shines through.  Thank you!  Will definitely return.
