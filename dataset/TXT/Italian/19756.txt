2YnUIGGmhoJX4Cd61nQLkg Honestly I really don't know why people like this place so much. It's incredibly overpriced for smallish portions, and just watching them make the food, you can tell not much thought goes into it and it's all just thrown together. Even the pasta is preboiled and just thrown back into the sauce. A robot could cook here and nobody would notice a difference. Save your money and eat somewhere else. The only good thing about this place is the tiramisu and the cheesecake, and Za's doesn't make either of these themselves. Skip this place!
