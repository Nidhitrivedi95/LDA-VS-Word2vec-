JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A I went here for my birthday breakfast a couple of weeks ago and the experience was sub par. I've been here before and the food has always been just OK. 

The restaurant is located in an old house just west of Yonge. It's two stories high, and the dining area on the second floor provides a nice view of the street. The decor is simplistic, wood tables and hardwood floors.

The breakfast menu is pretty standard, eggs and sausage/bacon, pancakes, french toast, etc. I ordered the breakfast bagel and it was HUGE. I was expecting eggs cheese and ham sandwiched between a bagel. What I got was a huge open faced bagel with egg ham and cheese on each and a huge garden salad. There was just too much food (which I know isn't a complaint, but when you're expecting something simple it leads to disappointment). I could barely finish one bagel and the salad itself didn't leave much to the imagination. 

The other thing was that from my table, I could see into the kitchen, and was able to watch them prepare my food, which was a little disconcerting. I do have to say though, their one saving grace was when I ordered the mimosa, they brought out the whole mini-champagne bottle, and I'll never complain about too much booze! 

It's a good spot for brunch if you're in the area, but if you walk down the street to Wish (just east of Yonge), you'll have a much better meal.
