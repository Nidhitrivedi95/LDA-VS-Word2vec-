G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Unbelievably disappointing! 
Party of 8, with reservations-
We waited 20 mins to be seated, in a mostly vacant dining room, with plenty of staff. Once seated, we waited over 20 mins. for the 1st acknowledgment, by staff, other then water service.   We addressed 2 staff members, requesting service, to no avail.  Spoke to the manager, to no avail.  The one and only time that a server addressed us, is when we got up and left.  
You would think a high-end restaurant would be ecstatic to serve a party of 8, on an obviously slow day.
Sorry Giada, no second chances!
