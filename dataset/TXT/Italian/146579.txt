k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw Sorry. i can only give this two stars.  Our server was Roger. He was great. Very attentive. I can't blame him for the food. I had the osso buco. Eh!?  Too fatty. Not as tender as I've had at other restaurants. I didn't finish it nor did I take it home. My wife had the seafood diavalo. She said the pasta was just right and the mussels were goo but all the other seafood was way over cooked. Nice wine list and the canoli was awesome. Probably won't go back unless I want less complicated food.
