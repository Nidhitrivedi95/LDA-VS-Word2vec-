sKy8HkP6X-8dCKq_SzeIpw Let me start off by saying the food is still good and the service that Sarah gave us was perfect. The reason for the 2 star rating is the outrageous charge for pizza toppings. We ordered an 18 pizza half cheese and half bacon and pepperoni. We were charged 4.99 for each of these toppings. I find this high of a price for topping completely ridiculous. This will be the last time my family will ever go to Queen's. I feel complete ripped off.
