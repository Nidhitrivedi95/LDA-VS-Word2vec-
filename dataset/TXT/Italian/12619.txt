0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q Was not impressed with this place.  My friend ordered the veal and I ordered the squash ravioli.  The ravioli was nothing special and the portion was small.  I tasted my friends veal and it was absolutely terrible.  Being in Vegas, the service was great - the entire staff was very friendly.  The only thing worth going for, besides the service, was the tiramisu... I would return for that.  There are far better places to eat in Vegas.
