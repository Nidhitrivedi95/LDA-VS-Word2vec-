kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg When I originally visited this location 1.5 years ago, my experience was on the 1 star end. The lack of professionalism displayed by the owner discouraged me from ever going back to this location until my boyfriend asked me tonight to give it another shot. We were big fans of their old location so I knew the opportunity was their and was not opposed to eating there for dinner.

We're a laid back couple and decided to be casual and dine at the bar.  Once settled in, we were immediately greeted by the bartender (name on the check is Carl) and he offered menus and water. The bartender was very pleasant and efficient. He quickly answered any questions we had and before we knew it, our dinner was arriving.

I ordered the "gluten-free" Primavera and my bf had the chicken marsala.  Both dishes were absolutely delicious and so happy I'm able to update my review to a positive experience. 

Even though we weren't drinking tonight but only enjoyed dinner, our bartender showed equal service to us as he did everyone else. The bar was steady with a good crowd but that didn't keep him from taking care if us.  We will return for another visit sooner then later
