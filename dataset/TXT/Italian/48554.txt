The service was professional and attentive to my group of 20. The selection of food options was amazing, with plenty of delicious choices and for a price that was not bad at all - ideal for a special night if you're still on a budget! I had the gnocchi Gorgonzola and it was great.

I also managed to learn the name of a dessert I'd forgotten the name of (Tartufo), ordered it, and was not disappointed.
