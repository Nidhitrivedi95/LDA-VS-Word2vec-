jOseCpGmgbQWEfX2Wn_TGQ Took a friend visiting from Spain to this place and we were both very with the food and the service! The food was great, the bottle of wine was superb and the flan was also great. Considering the food that we ordered including crab cake appetizer and dessert along with the bottle of wine our tab was only about $125. I came out of this place very satisfied!
