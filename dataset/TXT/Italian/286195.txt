zgGoxOsThXKAcs2lAgC9yg We have always been big Bucca fans!  We have frequented Chicago and Minnesota locations.  This is our first time at this Bucca.  Food was excellent as always.  We are big fans of the Mixed Green salad with the prosciutto and Gorgonzola!  Also love the baked ziti and chicken saltimboca.  Our server Jarrett was great!  Friendly and helpful and knew how to handle a table with little kids!  This was my birthday dinner this year and it was great a choice!
