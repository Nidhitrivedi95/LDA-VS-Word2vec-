wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg This review was a bit late but we went here a few months ago for my friends Birthday and it was great. Between the apps, meals and desserts we were all happy. I don't remember what everyone ordered but I remember sharing the calamari dish and the cheese,meat and veggie chef  board and they were great we could not get enough. For my entree I ordered the the Riccota Gnocchi with braised short ribs, the Gnocchi was perfectly cooked and the braised short ribs melted in your mouth. A lot of us shared our entrees with others and I got to try the bolognese with fresh pasta and there is nothing like eating fresh pasta, I also tried the fig and  prosciutto  pie and that was awesome (besides the goat cheese I do not like goat cheese. Don't judge me). I ended my night with the Bombolini , I also shared these with others and loved them along with tasting the salted caramel budino. next time I go back I am set on getting the bolognese and the Salted caramel budino. I def suggest going here the service was on point also.
