3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg Been here a few times. After hearing about the rooftop dining, I decided the next time I came here I would try to get the poolside table. So this past weekend we decided to come here and just as my request they seated me next to the pool. The service here has never let me down. The food has always been amazing. It was just so beautiful being able to see the clouds and stars while eating. The rooftop has a different ambiance more quiet and intimate. I cannot wait to come back again!
