I came here for lunch the hostesses was dress in all black was the only sour grape here,she did not smile at all,not only at me but everyone she seated thats a fact cause I was keeping one eye on her she was kinda sexy ;) and the other eye on my meatball's,  the hostesses has to leave her post to seat customes and sat up the tables when they got there while the line is forming up with people waiting to be seated.The manger Jackson waited on me he was very helpful explaining the menu,I had three turkey meatballs which were a little larger then golf balls with Parmesan cheese,garlic and herbs,with the pesto sauce that was made fresh basil,pine nuts,garlic and Parmesan cheese which was the (bomb) free refill on sodas, they also have other Items like,spaghetti,pizzas,sandwiches, salard,risotto,gelato/sorbert,milkshakes,Ice cream,this is definitely a come back to place next time in Vegas until we try just about everything on the menu, you can also make resavation on line,oh the bar area is huge.
