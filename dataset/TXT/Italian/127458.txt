HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw yes, zizzi is a chain but there is nothing wrong with giving a chain restaurant a good review if they provide good service and tasty food.  this is exactly what this zizzi did for eight hungry people on this past friday night. 

after being told we couldn't order food in hyde out (for reasons unknown to us as the cook was clearly making food in the kitchen) we headed to the next closest option and lucky for us it was this zizzi.  we we first came in the waiter that greeted us seemed a bit put out that there were eight of us for a table without reservations (although they were only moderately busy with empty tables available).  luckily for us the guy set a table anyway and we were shown to it with our drink orders taken by a lovely and friendly waitress.

i really have to compliment the waitress on her service for us.  she was lovely and polite and helpful the entire time, checking on us after the food arrived but not constantly being around or disappearing for long lengths of time.  after such poor service at hyde out i was really pleased that this girl was so attentive and friendly, well done to zizzi for hiring her!

the food was also very lovely.  we had an assortment of garlic breads to start, my favourite being the tomato with pesto although the garlic bread with cheese was also quite tasty.  i had a rustica pizza for my main with auberinge, rocket, olives, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms (which i'd subsituted for the peppers) drizzled with pesto.  it was awesome!! and the perfect thing to line my tummy for the drinks to come in the night ahead.  i also shared a really lovely sauvigon blanc that was fruity and fresh and so enjoyable :)

so yes a chain restuarant, but this place had good quality food and good service.    it's a bit of a shame that it's tucked away behind cargo but this didn't seem to stop people from finding it.  so well done zizzi for proving that chain restaurants can also provide a lovely and tasty meal.
