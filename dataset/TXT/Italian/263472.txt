wWDNwNb6ygJorKujOuifhA We love Forno and the staff.  We have been there many times with guests and everyone loves the food, location, reasonable wine and staff.
Try Mili's meatballs if available, they are terrific.
All the pizza's and salads are really good and every pasta special we have tried was well worth it.  The Gnocchi with pesto sauce is hard to beat and always on the menu.
if you want real Italian food, not americanized, try Forno, you will be rewarded.
