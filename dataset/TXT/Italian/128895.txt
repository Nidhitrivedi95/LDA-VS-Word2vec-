I1Y_Nal9YsnSPvvXb47Ofw I had a great lunch at Vittorio's (although they're only open for dinner now). The hosts and servers were engaging, funny, and helpful. The pasta was...outstanding. It was a sausage and pepper on penne which just made my heart jump a little remembering the succulent spice. The succulent spice. Very good, Vittorio.
