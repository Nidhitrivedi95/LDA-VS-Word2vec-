q3uuXi_U-Jqxsk5Nx1Iomw After reading all of these amazing reviews I felt compelled to try this place out. I live close by so I ordered for pick up. Walked in, everyone was real nice, they claimed they had "the best pizza in the city" so I was excited to get home.

Man was I disappointed. The pizza wasn't cut at all, the middle was cold, there was way too much cheese, it was greasy as hell and even after cutting it myself, every topping would slide off of very slice I tried to pick up.

I'm not a picky guy so I attempted to eat a slice with a fork and a knife and to be honest, it didn't taste all that great. At that point I had paid $25 for a meal I wasn't at all happy with. So I called and they delivered another pizza free of charge.

This time it was cooked and cut much better, but it still didn't taste all that good. I'm not a complainer but not only was FBI pizza no where near the best pizza in the city, it was one of the worst pizza's I've ever had.

Better? Marconi's in Sauga is by far the best in the GTA and then Nino Daversa or even il Gato Nero are both great as well. All are authentic Italian and never disappoint.
