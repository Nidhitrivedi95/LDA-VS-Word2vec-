FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q Third time here, the first two were over five years ago and since we had moved back into town, we figured it was time for another round!  Third time was not a charm, at least not 100%.  The service was pretty good, but the food was just OK, which means it was too expensive for what we got.  I found Maggianos a few months back and would recommned their food over this, despite the fact that I hate to choose a chain over a local biz.  Sorry Pasta Mia, I don't think we will be back.
