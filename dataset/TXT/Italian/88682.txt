e_BiI4ej1CW1F0EyVLr-FQ This restaurant has gone downhill over the years. We used to go there almost every week, but the service is horrible now. The food is definitely not worth the cost...it is subpar, and they left out items, such as sauce and potatoes!  Too many good Italian restaurants around to put up with poor food and service.
