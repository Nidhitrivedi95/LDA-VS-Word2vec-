I just moved into the area and passed by. It was busy, not an empty table in the house, so my party decided to eat at the bar. Kind of an uncomfortable spot to eat. It took a while for the wait staff to take our drink order and when they did, actually came off fairly rude and I am always a really pleasant patron, so it caught me off guard.

When I went to the restroom, I came back to another party taking my seat, even though my drink was just placed there, so I was put in the uncomfortable place of having to say the seat was already taken.

I ordered the soup of the day to start - it was a lemon chicken soup. It was so salty, I had a very hard time finishing it... but I was so hungry that I did anyway. It was just such a bad consistency on top of it. So, I ordered the fish & chips, simple enough. The fish was decent. The fries were pretty bad. I guess the best way to describe everything is to say it was bland (outside of the bizarre tasting sodium soup, of course). The fries were limp and had no taste at all.

All said and done, I get the bill in a hurry, well before I finished my meal. Then, the waitress literally stood as close as possible to me to prod me on in giving her my payment. It was awkward, made me feel super uncomfortable. I feel bad that I was the one who suggested giving it a try.
