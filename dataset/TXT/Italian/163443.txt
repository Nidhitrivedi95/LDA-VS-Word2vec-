lwpQQflP1CGJPV7QLybzOg Good prices. Horrible bartender (Mike). See picture. Sooooo inattentive.  Maybe that's why it's empty at HH. He's also Dropping f-bombs talking with clients. Checking cell phone instead of filling drinks. 

No HH menu/price list. Heard servers and bartender try to explain to customers, both here and over the phone, what the HH prices were.

Men's room missing soap dispenser and has graffiti on the mirror.
