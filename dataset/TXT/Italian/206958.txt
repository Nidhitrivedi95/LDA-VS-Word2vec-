qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA First off my friend who lives in Denver insisted on coming here to this location. She was in town for work. You have to pay to park in the parking Garage and Postino's does not validate.
We sat on the Patio and for a Tuesday night they were quite busy.
The place is nicely decorated and we were seated outside after just about a 12 min. wait. Not bad.
Our server came directly to get us started. we all ordered drinks and my 2 dining companions ordered a Bruschetta. Which was beautiful and very nice tasting. We also ordered an appetizer of Olives. Julie wanted the Olives, I just have to say.
Well I ordered Half a Sandwich and Soup. They other 2 each ordered a Salad. After about 30 minutes after the olives and Bruschetta came , I said it is really taking a long time to get our food. Julie called the waitress over and asked her how much longer did she think it was going to be till we got our food.
At this time the waitress admitted that she had forgotten to put the order in. Hey, in my book worse things have happened. It could happen to anyone. I said well it is just a little too late now. I really did not need to eat anything else. 
However,my friend was very upset and asked for the manager. The manager was a very nice young lady named Amanda. She apoligized ,even though it was not her fault and asked what she could do to make it better.
I said nothing all is well, things happen. But, she still gave us a cheese plate and tried her best to keep the peace. The server did not seem too sorry. But, I felt sorry for the Manager as she was really upset for us and wanted to fix it as best as she could.
I wish I could tell you more about the food. But, the cheese plate was good and so were the Olives and Bruschetta.
Hey what can you do things happen. I would go back though.
On another note the ladies room was clean with lots of T.P. everywhere. Very industrial.
