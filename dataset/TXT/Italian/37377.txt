74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw Awesome service that made us feel like VIPs and definitely excellent food and atmosphere! Loved getting to speak with Chris, the GM, who was very helpful in selecting a wine with our dishes and you could tell how passionate he is about the food and restaurant.

The dishes certainly didn't disappoint. We did our research and looked up the dishes people were most raving about so our expectations were pretty high. I literally crave the butternut squash gnocchi I had and can't wait to go back for more!! The beet salad as an appetizer was also excellent.
