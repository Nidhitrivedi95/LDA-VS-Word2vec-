9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Never had anything bad here from pizza to appetizer to lunch including salad and/or sandwich. Always freshly cooked and staff is always very nice greeting you as soon as you arrive. May be the only place I never have to ask for more water or tea!  Perfect date night at night outside with live music and lights. Only negative sometimes can be parking.
