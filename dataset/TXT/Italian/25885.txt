4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg I love the Wynn and Encore properties, but this experience was disappointing.  Service was inconsistent, we got our food in 5 min and table next to us 40, they then had to rush to get to a show; and they only got pizza, my pasta was warm and then so scolding hot I actually burned my mouth and couldn't finish. Not a good way to start a Mothers Day weekend with this dinner.
