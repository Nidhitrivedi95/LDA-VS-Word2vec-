miUmZ27vC-gHoyEmUQMYuQ Pizza Tuesday at Marca Trattoria is a sweet deal. For $15 you have a choice of main (pizza, panzerotti, pasta and mussels) with a glass of wine or beer.

Don't order mussels if you are really hungry or when mussels not in season as you will left hungry... really hungry.

Panzerotti is ok but I would not order that again.

Maybe I should stick with Pizza or Pasta??

The Tuesday menu supposes to change frequently. I might be back to try them out again.

At least I was in a good mood after drink two 5oz glasses of red/white wine. 

The interior is dark with dim lighting. Good for a romantic date.
