The crust is perfect, the sauce is delicious (just the right amount of sweetness), and the cheese is very obviously fresh and real! They're a little pricier but the size of the pizzas definitely make up for it. And the wings and zucchini are absolutely fantastic! It's the only place we go for pizza now. We cant wait for it to cool off so we can sit out on their patio and enjoy the fresh air along with some delicious food!
