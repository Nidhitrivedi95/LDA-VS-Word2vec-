tWdp26XQEJqJGnRmFVJQxA A friend and I discovered this spot after trying unsuccessfully to secure reservations at several Distillery District restaurants. We were looking for a nice meal before attending a play at Soulpepper. The entrance to the restaurant is actually inside the entrance to a commercial building. Our wait staff was friendly and efficient. We shared a large roasted beet salad which easily could feed three and a zucchini pizza. Both were tasty although the beets were a tad on the mushy side and the pizza crust was somewhat soggy, not crisp. We also split a 1/2 bottle of wine. The washrooms are outside the restaurant itself and are available to anyone in the building in general. All in all a reasonably priced, good meal within an easy walking distance (10 minutes) of the theatre.
