UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ I'm going to be honest here.  This is my third terrible experience this week eatting out. And this is one of my FAVORITE places. Its one of the few great locally owned restaurants that has diet coke. The baked spag and pizza muffins are amazing. 2 of my all time favorite foods that I can only get here.  

But I feel the need to report a problem.  This is the second time this has happened sour cucumbers in the salad. I know I'm a pain in the ass  because I always ask for extra.  And the service is great in this place. One of the best in the city. But this is the second time this has happened.  Once I can understand but twice.  There is simply no excuse.  And too top it off tonight our eggplant was raw. I know it was busy and accidents happen but the cucumber thing really angers me its gonna be a long time until I go back. 

I feel very guilty giving this place one star but I'm upset.
