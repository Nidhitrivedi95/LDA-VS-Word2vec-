pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I understand waiting for 1-3 hours to eat a pizza is a little ridiculous, but all these people can't be wrong.  Luckily I live across the street.  The ingredients are so fresh you can taste them in the sauce.  The crust is not made from cheap all purpose flour, not chewy, not sweet, not greasy.  Some people may end up with too much olive oil, I haven't had that problem, but I would recommend letting your server know to go easy on the oil just in case.  The pizza creations are simple, delicious, and customizable.  I would not change the set up, great location, great spring and fall place to go.  It's a great business plan with the bar next door, but they should have small bread stick apps or something to have with your drinks while you wait.  If you really think Papa J's, Pizza the Hut, and the other terrorist franchises are better, great!  Less waiting for me and more rot-gut for you.
