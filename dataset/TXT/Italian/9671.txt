The service team was attentive and friendly.  The bread basket is filled with tasty options.

For my meal I ordered the Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti.  It was very good.  It also has brown butter, horseradish and bread crumbs as part of the meal.  The horseradish is very subtle, so do not get scared away by that.  The bone marrow helps give it deep flavor.  The meal is very good.  The portion is modest, so definitely consider an appetizer, soup or salad to pair with it.
