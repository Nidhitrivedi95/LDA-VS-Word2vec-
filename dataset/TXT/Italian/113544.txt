ghpFh6XpH1TYZhjAGdx-xw Similar concept and price as Pieology in Irvine -- Unlimited toppings on an 11" pizza for $8...how can you go wrong? From the creative (making 2 different halves on 1 pizza) to the artisanal to the economical (everything on it plz!) you can eat any kind of pizza possible. 
For ingredients they have a fairly decent selection of meats and veggies but not as much as Pieology. Still, it's definitely enough for me though. And being so close to the hospital, I will definitely be back soon yumz
