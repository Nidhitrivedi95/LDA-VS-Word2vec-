5mb-6Guz9xqNXMigh8noMQ Long ago, when I first moved to the QC, I worked in this area and used to frequent this place with friends or for lunch. It's nothing special, but rather just your run-of-the-mill neighborhood/family pizza place. 

I've been here a few times since and have been pleased each time. Namely, the Hawaiian Luau Pizza is a favorite. The sauteed onions are a wonderful touch and, surprisingly, fantastic when eaten cold. I'd get this every time. 

The interior is as expected. Booths, tables, kitschy decor, and tons of appeal for little league baseball teams/NY enthusiasts alike. 

A-OK in my book.
