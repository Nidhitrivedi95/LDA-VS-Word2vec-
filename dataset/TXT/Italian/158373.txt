LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA The service was adequate if a bit stuffy.  A guitar player wandered the tables, playing Sinatra and various dubious Italian classics.  This place was... loud.  We had to shout to be heard.  They have crammed every inch full of tables so good luck trying to walk through without bumping someone.

We had the calimari, which was passable but was soggy in parts.  The disappointment of the night was their Steak Delmonico: unevenly cooked, it was drenched in a ghastly sauce from deep in a boiler pot somewhere.  No spice or pepper, and not a whiff of flavor from the fatty meat.  Marbled goodness, this was not.  Ravenous from a heavy workout earlier, I would have normally savaged this piece of meat.  But my body would have to do with a protein shake.  The waiter gracefully took the large remnants of this steak away without any chance of it going into a takeaway box.

"Dat's Amore!"
