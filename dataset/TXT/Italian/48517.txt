98V9R-7YT20KmcmJyMiJmg I've had friends tell me that they consider Il Fornello a bit formulaic and on the safe side, but my experience here was nothing short of positive. Our server was peasant, friendly in her demeanor and was attentive. Any menu questions were answered promptly. The bruschetta was tasty and out pasta dishes were flavorful and balanced without going over the top. Price is often a point of contention with Italian restaurants as people lament that they could make the same for less money, but I think that when the food is this quality and leaves you wanton for nothing, these complaints should take a back seat. Aside from that, the prices were very fair. Atmosphere was cozy and warm. Highly recommend.
