gjATEWAllTfxfxhGqJ93sQ Honestly, this place was awesome! From the moment my friend went in to reserve a table just as rush hour was ending, staff weren't overwhelmed, they were extremely welcoming! Two gentleman held both doors open and made way for us considering a had my stroller. They sat us down, made things really comfortable, offered my daughter a high chair. Service was excellent! The atmosphere is perfect for great lunch experience. I needed to change my daughter, one of the lovely lady receptionists came down stairs to the washroom and made sure I had space to change my daughter considering the restaurant has no baby diaper changing table. I was actually quite worried when I looked this place up to visit when in Montreal, but the staff really made it easy. Pizza was delicious, enough for two to share, if getting a salad too! Dough doesn't leave you bloated, and the pizza sauce didn't cause heartburn, so authentic!
