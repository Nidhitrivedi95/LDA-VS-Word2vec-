OThAF-lt6d7jY-pB1ajWPg Hey Berea!  These's a real authentic home made Italian restaurant not 10 mins from 237!

Three generations making everything from scratch every day.  Pastas, meat dishes, pizzas, wings soups, salads, wine & beer.

Extremely reasonable, owners are very personal and they've got Dean, Dino and Tony playing all the time.

Finally, real Italian food close to Berea that's not a highway chain.
