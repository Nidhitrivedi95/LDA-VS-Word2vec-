NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ I went there last night. We sat at the bar to eat because the restaurant was full. Which was okay with us. The bartender was great. But the food was not the greatest. We had a salad which was tasty but the spaghetti and meatballs were awful. The noodles were under cook, the meatball tasted like they were raw and the sauce was to bland. I'll never go back to this restaurant.
