SgSVJWgMwFteYyz4OlHu9Q Great pizza and even greater people running it. New York style pizza in Las Vegas and this is the real deal. This is a great family owned business and Ralph and Anthony treat me so well every time I go there. Whatever I buy they always add more at no charge just so I can try it. Typical Italians.. Mangia! Mangia!. If you're from the East Coast this is definitely a place you have to try. Believe me, I know good pizza and this is good pizza.
