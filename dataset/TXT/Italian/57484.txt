anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg Saturday night , 16 other guys including myself had an amazing dinner. Our server was flawless, took our orders promptly , explained dishes perfectly , suggested the best cocktails , and even laughed at our horrible jokes . The whole staff was extremely professional and accommodating . I had the 26oz Ribeye which was something that should've been stamped with an American Flag ! Soo good . When our meal was over they gave us a complimentary ride to our next location . If I'm ever in the area again we'll definitely have to come here .
