5Hu5StOBGtxFhgV0OSkPSA The only positive thing about Glass Nickel is that they're open late. The quality is horrible compared to what they charge. They have yet to get one of my orders correct (simple things like extra side of marinara and I get ranch) and when I call about it they don't even seem to care. I'm officially done from ordering from them and I don't recommend them to anyone
