USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Went and ate here last night and was not too happy overall. I ordered the antelope chip which i ordered medium, it came out medium well and was dry, I ended up feeding half of it to my dog. I had some sort of apple bread pudding that came with the chop, which was kind've bland and didn't compliment the food at all like a nice potato dish would have. The bread they bring out for you is also not the best it's very dense and almost pound cake like, they serve it with what seems to be simply garlic put in a blender ...was not a big fan overall. My friend ordered the filet and said he woke up this morning because of a stomach ache. The place is very nice though and is a great spot for a romantic type date, not a casual friendly dinner place, next time ill go to la Bon or del friscos when I want a 5 star meal. I was quite disappointed and will not be back.
