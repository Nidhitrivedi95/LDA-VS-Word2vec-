ohEGwJtSqrVd2SD-FKKrUQ This place is absolutely to die for!! Authentic pizza made in an amazing oven. Cool brick facade inside. Very fast and incredible service! The servers are very attentive and kind. The bread is delicious as is the hot garlic sauce. I highly recommend the salads as well. It is so hard to find good Italian pizza in the city--this place wows!
