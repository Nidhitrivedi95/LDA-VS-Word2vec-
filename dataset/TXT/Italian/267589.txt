XdcRr8R5H8psvf-QxtuLMg After living in Arizona for 40 years we decided to try Barro's a little over a week ago.   The food is so delicious we have been back four times now.  The first time we went three of us tried the pasta and the other two had the pizza.   Oh how delicious was our food.   I am Sicilian and have always made my own sauce but I have to say their sauce on the pasta was better than mine and mine is quite delicious too.  It was nice and thick and so tasty.  Their meatballs are scrumptous.    The pizzas are large and just perfect.   Our favorite so far is the Hot Wing pizza and also the Mega meat pizza.  It has bacon, ham, meatballs, pepperoni, and sausage.  The other night we also tried their salads.   I had a small and it was huge and tasty.  Love their garlic bread that comes with the pasta too.   So glad we finally tried this place.  It has a very comfortable and pleasant dining room too.  Highly recommend it!!
