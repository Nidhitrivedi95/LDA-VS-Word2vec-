nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A We had the opportunity to visit the new Buddy V's at the Venetian Las Vegas. We found the outside menu to be very interesting and the offer of happy hour irresistible!  unfortunatly, the man we met at the front desk did not share our excitement.  He acted irritated with our presence, but when asked, directed us to the upper level of the restaurant as the appropriate area for happy hour values.  after selecting a place to sit, we were accosted and told not to sit "there" as "that" isn't happy hour seating, "this" is happy hour seating.  (beware the hi top tables as they angle your drinks to the floor). Our poor waitress (April) seemed very unhappy to see us. She described a few of the beverages when asked, but after ordering "bellinis", she told us the Bellini machine was broken. When asked if the drink could be served on the rocks, she acted shocked and said it was impossible as it was made from a mix. We heard the bartender say the machine wasn't quite ready. When quizzed, the waitress said it wouldn't be ready for "hours!". We settled for the house red, and let me tell you, i do mean settled.  the transparency of the liquid lent itself more to watery cool-aid, with legs and bouquet to match. We did sample a pasta appetizer, which might have lead us to believe the food was worth putting up with the service, but a smart phone app lead us to better Venetian opportunities. Our party was met with a hostile glare as we were fleeing the establishment, and i was forced to resort to mad dogging the man(ager?) to make good our escape. 
greeting cold, directions sketchy, service irritated, food potential but unknown, farewell hostile.  1/2 star....
