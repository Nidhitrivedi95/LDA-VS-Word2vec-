hrNIDao4XnOhrv7aaFehTg We called because Familia Pizzeria was already closed and my husband and I had some serious late night pizza cravings. We ordered a large with pepperoni and mushroom and I wish I read that they used canned mushrooms so I could have chosen a different topping. The pizza was alright, though I found the crust to be too thick for my liking, and the canned mushrooms looked like escargot, in mushroom form. They were having a special for a large 2 topping for $10. I wouldn't have paid one penny more. I may possibly make a return visit given that they are the last people open once again, but will definitely skip the mushrooms.
