ARY1LFP2pS2W8d8IBYaZlw We have been eating Italian Creations for years. This is a great local Lakewood business run by one of the nicest families in the city. Most recently indulged in their cuisine at an after wake get together to mourn the loss of a friend's father. Rest in peace. The food was excellent enough to momentarily take people's minds off the sadness and loss. I would highly recommend their catering service for any occasion. They offer carryout options as well which is great for some quality Italian food on the go for a great price point.
