Mq1_dvcg5mbeplEmCEoUtQ I asked the waiter how long they had been open. This Italian restaurant features classic decor, pictures of Sicily peppering the entire dining room. In short, the entire restaurant oozes that Godfather feel you'd want in any small Italian restaurant.

The escargot was EXCELLENT. The sauce was incredible, and the garlic was plentiful. 

My chicken parmigiana was very tender, and they managed to not overdo the cheese, a common pitfall of many restaurants serving this dish. 

The shrimp francesca sauce was delicious. The lobster ravioli had great flavor and texture.

And finally, the creme brulee. Excellent. No complaints here.

Service was up to par. The waiter staff was very attentive and friendly. Our own waiter was a little strange, but he was nice.

I definitely plan to come here again.
