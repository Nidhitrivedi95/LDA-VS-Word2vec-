pt7p4klGicvPZe04mhhVGQ My friend and I go here at least once a week. I was skeptical when he drug me there for the first time (this book doesn't have the prettiest cover). Now I'm hooked. At this point I've had just about everything and it's all five stars. My only tip is if you order the wings, ask them to fry them a little less than usual.
