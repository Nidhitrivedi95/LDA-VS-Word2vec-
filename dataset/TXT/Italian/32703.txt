The menu has pizza, salads, two appetizers, and two desserts.  They have a wood fired pizza oven, which gives their pizza the perfect crust. They do have beer and wine, although a limited selection.

I ordered the Joanna Pizza - pepperoni, sausage, cheese and tomatoes, and had them add onions. It was delicious, one of the best pizza's I have tasted.

I was going to give it a four star rating, but had several pieces left over, which I took home for breakfast the next day.  Wow!! It is the only pizza I have had that actually tasted better the day after!! That in and of itself, bumps them up to a five star rating.

Another plus is their prices are very, very reasonable.  All in all, a great little restaurant.
