I said it, the only downside to a recent visit to Lo Zingaro. Excellent everything, from service as soon as we walked in the door, to the wine selection and choice, price, pacing, a fantastic basic Italian menu, this is the type of Toronto-Italian restaurant to bring your friends when you need to be guaranteed of your event going smoothly. Highly recommended!
