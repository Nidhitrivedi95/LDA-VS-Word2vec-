UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Hopefully someone who is gluten-free by necessity reads my reviews. Amazing, delicious, incredible are the words I would use to describe the gluten-free Chicken Pomodoro. I ate it all and the only thing that would have made the meal total perfection is a gluten-free baquette. Seriously folks, I would pay extra just to be able to reach into a bread basket, slather it with butter and then swipe my bowl with the crust.
