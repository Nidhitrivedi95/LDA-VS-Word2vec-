fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg Gigantic menu...and kind of all over the place.  Everything from noodles to sushi, so it's a great place for the family because everyone can have something different.  Service is ok, but this place is swamped.  Food is very good...and the noodles authentic, so we'll definitely visit again!
