That did it, the rave reviews convinced me that this is a place worth checking out for myself! It's a sexy little restaurant tucked in an unexpected spot and lucky for me it's on my side of town, East Side! The decor was beautiful, I wanted to take the chandelier home to put in my own kitchen, but it was too big to fit in my purse, jk . 
So on with the more important subject, the food! It was fabulous, wish I could speak Italian so it sould sound as wonderful as it tasted! My daughter got the children's Mac & Cheese and it looked so good we all tried a bite. I had the Curry chicken and pear pasta, amazing.so good that the leftovers I planned on taking to work the next day I ate that same night. I also tried my son's Chicken Chipotle & pasta and his Dad's Chicken Limone, all so yummy! 
Our server was Dean and he was prompt & curteous and funny, he brought me my "diet whatever drink with lemon" and kept my glass full. The portions were filling and more and the prices were affordable! 
I'm definitely going back, there are so many things on the menu that I want to try. Next time it is dessert first!
 I'm  in love with Babbo Italian Eatery, it's definitely Amore!
