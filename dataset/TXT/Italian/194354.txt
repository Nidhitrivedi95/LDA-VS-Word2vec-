PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ Came in here around 9:30am with K.O. We came here specifically because we wanted to try the the Beef Wellington after watching a show with Gordon Ramsey in it. 

When we came in we were greeted by a very friendly waiter. The restaurant was pretty empty so we were seated very promptly. 

The waiter went over some of their specials and explained the menu to us a little bit.

Appetizer
-tomato caprese: never really a fan of this dish but it was ok here. 

We split 
-beef wellington: we both had the Caesar salad with our entree and they weren't kidding when they said it's super garlicky. It was delicious. The beef Wellington was super juicy and tender and the knife cut through it like butter. The outer crust was very crispy and flaky and delicious. 
-lobster ravioli: this dish was a little lacking. The sauce was kind of bland. It just didn't have that much flavor. This was the only dish we were disappointed with. 


Now we paid for the check then decided to check out the dessert menu last minute. The waiter was really cool about it and just gave us a complimentary slice of cheesecake. He said that we had to try it and it's on the house. He wasn't lying when he said the cheesecake was delicious. It was very cream cheesey and the bottom graham cracker crust was delicious. 

Only reason this place didn't get 5 stars was because the lobster ravioli wasn't up to par. But everything else was spot on. Will definitely come back and try some other dishes.
