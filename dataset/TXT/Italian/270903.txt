XPgurhZwZgNAwHcrpoe3Zg I was making a "HAVE TO" trip to Trader Joe's on Saturday and pulled out my yelp app to see if I had anything worthy of lunch bookmarked in the neighborhood.  I did not, so I then searched and filtered based on highest reviewed.  Niccoli's came up, and it was settled.

The parking lot, for the most part, was empty... but that didn't deter me from going in.  The smell that hit me upon entering reassured me that I had made the right choice.  Since I'm rarely in that neck of the woods, I ordered a meatball sub and an antipasto salad - knowing full well I would not be able to eat both in one sitting.  

While waiting, I struck up a conversation with the female owner, who proceeded to tell me a story about a photo on the wall I had noticed of her and her husband, over 50 years ago, on the night of their wedding night.

Just the fact that she took a few minutes to tell me about their lives that long ago while I waited for my food was worthy of at least four of these stars.  Then, as I was seated in the dining room next door, listening to Sinatra's greatest hits, the food came and it was out of this world.  Easily one of the best meatball subs I've ever consumed - the bread had the perfect chew - and wasn't soggy from the delicious fresh marinara.

The salad had banana peppers, delicious olives, provolone, three different meats (salami, mortadella and pepperoni) and quite possibly the best Italian dressing to cover it in.  There were not many others who came to eat - but plenty were in and out for various Italian needs.  Their store is small, but appeared to have anything you might need for an authentic Italian meal.  

Check this place out, whether you go for ingredients to make your own meal or want to try something they make fresh it's totally worth your time. If they're not that busy, ask about the beautiful picture on the wall and you're sure to hear a great story about Joe & Peppy's wonderful life.
