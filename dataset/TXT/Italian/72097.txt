CbI4IFtWCNm4rLvWr0veEw I've always loved Villa Dolce but last night they exceeded themselves. We had a birthday surprise party for my boyfriend and they accommodated 12 people in such great style. The food was impeccable and the servers, as always, were a delight. The desserts menu was incredible, we were so comfortable after dinner but we could not say no to their sweets - gluttony at its best on our part. Super nice people. The drinks were so yummy and nothing took too long of a wait. Such a cozy venue, very beautiful interior decor. It was a perfect night, big success! We are coming back for sure!
