aadG1TzULt-ezzUJZUSSJQ Factory girl impressed me. I visited here for a friends birthday last year and split a pizza with my bf. I wasn't sure what to expect but must say we both thoroughly enjoyed it. There was about 10 of us and everybody enjoyed their meal. The food was great atmosphere was nice and relaxed. 

I live in the beaches so it's not as close as I would like. Planning a return visit in the next couple of weeks for some beers and nachos. Definitely worth checking out if you're up in the Danforth area.
