Went to it one night when they had dueling pianos though and was not a fan. The crowd was small for the dueling pianos and when people would put in requests with anything less than five dollars the piano players would make comments about that being insulting and not do the songs at all even after taking the tip. Other than that experience, I would highly recommend anybody stop by if they are downtown.
