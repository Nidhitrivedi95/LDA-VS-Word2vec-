7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Extremely overpriced on every item. Ribeye came raw. Had to send it back. Wines by the glass were insanely priced. The seating was mediocre. They put us in a room as big as my bedroom. They never bothered to even ask where we preferred to be seated. I got to see the main dining room after dinner which was much nicer. I do not understand what the big fuss is over this ribeye. Pfffft. Never going back. I am a local.
