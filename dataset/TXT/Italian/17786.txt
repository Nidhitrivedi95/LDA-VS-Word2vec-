2hgfYu-jBRUGybzl_CvqvA You know , I have ate at Romanos several times before and it was always good . Tonight was the best I have ever had from there . Is it Dannys in Ft Mill ? Nope , but Dannys pie is special , lol. If I keep on getting pepperoni/mushroom pies like I got tonight Romanos will lay claim to the crown of best pie in Concord
