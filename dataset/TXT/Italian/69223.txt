We had a newer waitress who was pretty slow and didn't give us very good service. The food she brought out was really delicious, so I can't complain too much. Everything was hot and fresh. The new server put in one of the orders wrong, though. 

The manager, Mr. Sheets, came out and listened to all of my concerns and was super helpful with getting the problems solved. That's all I can ever ask for with management. He turned a meh experience into a fantastic one, and really left a good impression.
