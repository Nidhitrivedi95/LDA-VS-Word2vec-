Came here with some friends for their lunch buffet. We arrived at approximately 11:50am. After we were seated the server told us the food would be available in 5 mins and ask if he could bring us some water. He came back with our water but there was some...stuff that was floating on top..yuck. 

The salad and pasta were ready but the pizza came out slowly one after the other. I kind wished they all come out at the same time cause pepperoni came out first and the Hawaiian/Meat Lover (the ones I wanted) came out much later. They also had an apple pizza available for dessert but it was pretty good. It was like a mix of a donut and apple pie. All we're missing is the ice cream. 

No one came to clear our table even though the plates were building up. Also needed to go up to pay.
