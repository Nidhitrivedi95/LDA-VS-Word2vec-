pM4mWLjeaZJlcdUxut2lMg I wanted pizza, and Vittoria is known to be an authentic Italian kitchen. I was extremely happy with what I got. Ordering off the lunch menu, I got the 7" parma ham, cheese, rocket and tomato pizza, that came with a bountiful salad with olives. It might have looked small in comparison to my companion's regular sized ham and pineapple, but for lunch it was just right (and left room for pudding later!)

Short and sweet, just like my lunch and pizza here. The food was good, the ambience was nice for lunchtime. A gentleman next to us was enjoying what looked like a delicious carobanara, red wine, coffee, and chocolate cake. The staff were friendly, attentive but also quite brisk in that Italian way. And it's big inside.

Also, at the moment they have vouchers for 50% off your order in January, if you book in advance. Well worth looking into!

Price reasonable too - same as you'd pay at Pizza Express down the road but faarrrr tastier on nom nom.
