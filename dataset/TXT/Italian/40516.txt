7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ The bland steak was not worth the price you paid. & to top off my experience here, the waiter messed up the amount on my check and charged me over $350 for my $60 bill. The restaurant fixed the issue but my bank couldn't release my money until my vacation ended. Complained to the manager but all he said was "it's not our fault". Are you serious? Your waiter clearly caused the problem in the first place. Thanks for ruining my last couple of days in Vegas Carnevino! Never coming back again.
