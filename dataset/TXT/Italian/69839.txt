By2DQwaG2EiOxsuHnS8FoA Popped in Thursday after work. Because of the weather the patio was packed. Were were fortunate enough to grab a small table. Apps had been ordered before I arrived so I'm not entirely sure what everything was however I found the chick pea fries lacking flavor -- even with the "spicy" (not spicy at all) ketchup. I also had this bruschetta-like app with pesto, cheese and tomatoes that wasn't great either. However, my friends had the duck fries and chicken wings (?) that they enjoyed. 

I thought the service was great despite her being swamped by tables and people and the wine was tasty and poured very generously.
