w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q Was in town for a friends 40th bday this weekend. I had eaten here before several times in the past couple of years I come to the LV and always with a reservation. I raved to my buddies that were I was with how great this place was!!!! Well again they didn't disappoint!!! It was full as usual and I ask the gentleman at the front can you sit 4, he was polite and answered let me see what I can do. Not even 5 min later I hear "right this way sir". The treatment here is as if they know you've been here from previous dining!! 

I proceeded to order ask the waiter if there was any Prime Rib left...oh I forgot to mention it was 10pm when this all occurred. The waiter says sir it's to late I think we have run out...let me check. He comes back and says there is 1 piece left that chef has saved for himself, but he is willing to part with it if you eat the whole thing....I said bring it on. My boyz order New York's and all the food arrived as order and we all ate happily ever after!!! This place is the one of the best!!! If I had room for a 5lbs lobster I would of gone for it but the Prime rib cut was overly huge!!! Thanks again Palms!!  Great food, great service.
