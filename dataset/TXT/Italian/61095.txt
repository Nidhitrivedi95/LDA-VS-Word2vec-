Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg I've had a pleasant experience both times I've been here. I'm always on the lookout for authentic cuisines and it's somewhat hard to find in Vegas since buffets and strip restaurants overshadow small businesses. I'm glad that real Italians live in Vegas so I can stuff my face with their food. Their pasta is always al dente and their sauces are flavorful. AND THE CHEESE! They use smelled amazing, iit wasn't some processed "fake" cheese, thank goodness. Unlike commercialized places, Roma Deli reminds me of pasta I grew up with. No I'm not Italian but my father was in the restaurant business when I was a lot younger and I remembered his old Italian friend who would make me the BEST spaghetti in the whole entire universe! And Roma's meatball sauce brought back memories. It's almost nostalgic :') 

I have not yet tried their deli items but they all looked so delicious. I think I might just visit them soon...
