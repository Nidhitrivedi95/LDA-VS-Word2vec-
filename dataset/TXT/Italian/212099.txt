Upon arriving at the place, we waited 10 minutes to be seated even though the place only had a few other patrons and tons of empty tables. When we were finally seated, an employee (owner?) was engaged in a very heated conversation about money with some executives directly behind us, which kind of made for an uncomfortable dining experience. Now for the food: although my boyfriend is a huge pasta lover, he was unimpressed with the large selection of dishes offered, nothing standout or spectacular, but then again the food is typical buffet quality. I was surprised that there weren't more pizza options , and the ones that were offered we're kind of dry and the ingredients weren't exactly the freshest. The worst thing about Vinnie's however was not the bland uninteresting food or unprofessional service, but the fact that both me and my boyfriend found ourselves oddly stuffed after just ONE plate, that wasn't even full! It was weird considering I can have at least two HEAPING plates at any buffet before I start feeling the damage. The only thing we did not feel weird for eating were the sweets, which are divine! I would maybe seriously consider going back to this place just for their sweet selection, they had ice cream, waffles, macaroons, cookies, and cakes galore! However, the food left us feeling sick all day, which was a deal breaker. Definitely would not recommend this place to a friend.
