E0YuuRpK_4RpaUF7JK3mhg We love Bratalian.  The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable.  Expect to wait on the weekends.  It is a busy, popular location.  I would make a reservation.  
The only thing I would improve on is they only have a beer and wine liquor license so no cocktails!  Fridays are meant for a cocktail or two!  Service is good.  Our waiter has always been attentive.  I would definitely return to eat here!
