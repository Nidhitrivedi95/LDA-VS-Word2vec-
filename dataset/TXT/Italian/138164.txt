JBrBsKpw0bbXK5nlrXVOYQ This place was very friendly and great for families.  I had the veal parmigiana and my colleague had the egg plant parmigiana.  Both meals came with salad and French bread (or garlic).  The meals were outstanding and service was great.  Our waitress was very friendly and did her best to be on top of things.  Also, when we asked about her favorite meal she was very quick at responding to her favorite.  I hate it when we ask and they say "well" and give a cop out answer.  Everything was great aside from the French bread it was a little too cold.  Wasn't stale but it would be nice if they were warm.  Otherwise I recommend this place for anyone who likes Italian food.  Also, found it strange they had teriyaki chicken on the menu.  Everything was in line, but teriyaki chicken?
