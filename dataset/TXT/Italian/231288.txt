TFftsYkRIUtdo6ZhRwJ2lQ This place is the go to Italian place for a lot of people and I don't really see why. There are many better ones in this great city of ours.
Decor is nice and the ambience is pleasant but it's about the food and in that regard they underwhelm.
Pizza is bland and nothing special and the wine is over priced. 
Inflexible menu which means no changes.
In a pinch they will do (if the waits weren't so long) otherwise keep looking.
