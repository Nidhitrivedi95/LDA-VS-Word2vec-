7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw I knew this was going to be good when we walked in at ten past 6:00 and had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  We ended up sitting at the bar when a couple of spots cleared out and that worked out for the best.  Our bartender was fantastic and made some great wine and dinner recommendations.  We split the short rib pasta and chicken parmigiana and both were excellent.  We paired that with a very good and well priced bottle of Nebbiolo.  Ended with Tiramisu and an espresso and all was right in the food world.
