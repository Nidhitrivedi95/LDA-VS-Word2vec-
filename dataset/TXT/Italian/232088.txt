Since this place opened, we have been here twice. Both times, I have ordered a personal pizza with my choosen toppings. My husband has ordered their bolognese pasta as well as their regular marinara pasta. Both pasta dishes were really good and well portioned (especially for lunch time). As for the pizzas (perfectly portioned for individuals), both were really good  although the second time was an improvement from the first time. 

Story: I love proscuitto and arugola on my pizza, as well as mushrooms and pepperoni. The first time I ordered my pizza, the proscuitto was on top and therefore dried out. The arugola had been put on the pizza before going into the oven, therefore coming out melted down. Not the way it should be prepared. I left a comment on the back of our charge slip with a couple suggestions regarding the proscuitto and the arugola: proscuitto should not be on top if working with a regular pizza oven (different than wood burning) and that the arugola should be served fresh on the pizza when it comes not (not going in). 

The second time we went to the restaurant, the pizza was perfect which means that the management does listen to its customers. My husband & I are pizza snobs and we both recommend this place. In fact, my husband is having his going away lunch with his office there soon before leaving for a tour in S. Korea. I can't wait!
