IXUoO2QcFergBHdR4wPf9g Nice patio but super turned off by the service. I made a comment about the potatoes in my dish being under cooked and my waitress gave me a weird look, said "ok"  and walked away. A simple acknowledgment or apology would had sufficed. Things like this make me not want to return to restaurants.
