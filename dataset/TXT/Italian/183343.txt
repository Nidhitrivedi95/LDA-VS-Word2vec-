ODlST50VSMzUMd0kmDpQgw Tonight, we had dinner at Buca di Beppo.  I don't think I've ever had better Italian food.  The tastes were simply amazing!  The service was very good too.

We called ahead to ensure we could get seated, but it turns out that the place was rather empty.  The interior of this restaurant is like no other.  The decorations are so complicated and they cover every inch of the place.  We were given a tour of the restaurant and the staff all greeted us, as did some of the guests.

We ordered Breschetta as an appetizer and it was stellar.  Definitely the best we've had.  It had fresh veggies and amazing flavor.  We ordered Chicken Carbonara and Shrimp Florentine for entrees.  The Chicken Carbonara was very rich - too rich for my taste.  But it was still of very good quality and the bacon was tasty.  The Shrimp Florentine was outta this world with fresh spinach, pasta, and shrimp.  I still have the garlic flavor of it in my mouth as I'm writing this review.  So good!

If I'm in the mood for Italian, this is where I'm going.
