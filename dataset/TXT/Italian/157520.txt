Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA Tuesday morning I wanted something to-go, so I hit up this smaller Il Fornaio take-out place.  Got a egg & ham & cheese croissant.  Service was fine even though it was busy, and they brought out my food quickly.  It was piping hot but not overly dried.  The croissant was buttery, flaky, light, and chewy... YUM.  Good amount of filling that kept me going all day until dinner.  I did like how they had a water dispenser with cups off to the side... I'm used to that in Colorado at these kinds of places.  Overall reasonable price ($6.85 for what I got).

They didn't put any napkins or any utensils in my to-go baggie, but I scored some elsewhere.  Didn't try the hot drinks (tea/coffee) as I just wanted to get in and get out.  Recommended if you're at NY NY and are looking for an on-the-go breakfast or coffee!
