ZVtjS8Hvq2a6SxHxlehPGg If I could give it no stars, I would.  Last night, my wife and I visited this restaurant to grab a drink at the bar before an event in Paradise Valley. There were stools but they were singles on the opposite sides of the bar. As we were standing there, the host approached us and asked if we were here for dinner.  We said no, just drinks and would only be there for about 15 or 20 minutes. As he surveyed the bar, he said why don't you take this table which was in the bar area.  We sat down and the server came over to take our order.  We explained to him that we were only going to be here for a very short time and we were just going to order drinks. As we discussed which wine to order, a man (who we later learned is the owner Greg) approached us from behind and was screaming, NO NO NO! You may not sit here. This is RESERVED.  At this point the host came back over and explained that he and seated us there and that we were only going to be there for a very short time, clearly indicating that we would be gone before the reservation. The man proceeded to say, ABSOLUTELY NOT! and gestured for us to leave this table immediately.  He made no attempt to offer us another location to have drinks and was less than professional.  We got up and left the restaurant.

We did not ask for this table!  We followed the lead of the host who offered it to us. Obviously they did not want our business last night. We spent our money elsewhere. We will never return, and we will tell as many people about this experience as possible.
