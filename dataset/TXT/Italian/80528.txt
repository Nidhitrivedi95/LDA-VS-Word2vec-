D6RDpCS1lfgZdPuLHlpsHA Got the Groupon, then read the reviews - oh no! But since we are open minded, pragmatic and able to form our own opinions we went ahead and checked this place out.

We had a very good experience. I'm still chuckling that one reviewer thought that it was cornbread that they serve with the rosemary olive oil and Parmesan... Sheesh people, come on!

My better half had the spinach ravioli, I had the veal parm. Very good food. A solid four stars. Looks like they have some killer specials too - we will be back to do the Monday any pasta & a salad for $9ish special!
