8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino underwent a complete renovation of their casino including many restaurants within the hotel. Market City Cafe which was located next to Dragon Noodle decided it was time for much more than a facelift...a name change too. DVino is a spin off from the Burbank,CA location and formerly at the Monte Carlo Las Vegas. The entrees have changed a bit and not for the better. The prices for my favorite at Market City-the Lasagna will run you $9 more in Vegas than it will in Burbank. The restaurant still has trouble luring in customers which would make you feel weary how much the food pushes. I don't think the Lasagna was worth $20 and a glass of wine will run you $13 minimum. One noticeable change was the elimination of the salad bar which was enticing to many guests. Would I go back? NO not at all. The food wasn't as good its predecessor and they should of just kept the Market City name. 70/100.I Duke it though but barely.
