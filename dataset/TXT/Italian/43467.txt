7zuWSun5F8Jv2N_IFD_ERg What a disappointment!  I went here tonight with my parents and partner to celebrate my mother's birthday and the meal went from bad to worse.  My partner's meal was the worst of the four: his tomato and goat cheese appetizer was horrid to behold and to taste, and his pasta main course had the consistency of glue.  Meats were smothered in brown sauce and paired with oversalted mashed potatoes.  My cheesecake was simply inedible -- I literally tasted it and could not manage another forkful.  And the waiter never even asked why it went untouched!  Service faltered considerably as the restaurant filled up and they even forgot to acknowledge my mother's birthday (we had asked when making the reservation for them to put a candle in her dessert).  The coffee order got messed up.  What happened the the days when one was offered a proper after dinner drink here?

I know they are closing in three weeks and are moving to Etobicoke. .  Had they performed well this evening, I would have definitely tried their new place. I will certainly not follow them there.  

So sad to think that this was such a good restaurant about 15 years ago.  

Enough said.
