f_R4-FMtQ2Dj6m8LNuse1w My and my boyfriend came here one night and noticed the place was really loud even in the dining area. We got the calamari appetizer first. I will say I have always been a big fan of calamari. But I was not a fan of this one. It was so bad we had to ask to take it back. The calamari was very soggy and the breading was seriously falling off of the calamari. It was not good. When we told the server, he must of told the manager and the manager came up to us and made a comment about how calamari isn't for everyone because they don't know it's squid. I had to let him know that I've tried calamari plenty of times and that I know it's squid and it wasn't the reason why we returned it, it was because it was soggy and the breading was wet. I've been back before ordering their pizzas to go and they are really good. Pizza sauce is so good. I highly recommend their pizzas!
