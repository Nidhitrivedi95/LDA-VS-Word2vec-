My husband I went there before a night downtown and it was the perfect place.  Not only did they have beer and wine, but a full bar.  Yes, please!  We have both worked in the service industry and, even though it was a busy Friday night, were greeted by a happy staff that didn't seem a bit flustered.  If you are downtown and are craving pizza or Italian..this is the place to go!
