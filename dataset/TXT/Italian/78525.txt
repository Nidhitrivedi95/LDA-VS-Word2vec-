D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA When Davanti Enoteca suddenly closed a couple years ago, I was very disappointed. A couple months ago, word spread that the former chef would be returning to Phoenix to take over EVO. I made it out to EVO the first chance I got, and the feeling of disappointment returned.

While Davanti was a classy space, EVO tries very hard to cater to the typical Scottsdale club set. C'mon, 1 cent Fireball shots?! Not surprisingly, the cocktails were lackluster.  

I went to EVO hoping that the foccaccia di recco, a famous dish from Davanti, would be available, but apparently, only people who know the chef are privy to that. I know this for a fact because I saw someone had posted about receiving the dish on another website the exact same night we were there. The evening's disappointments continued. My husband's pork belly was overcooked and the roasted cauliflower wasn't any better than what I can do at home, but the controne poppers were very good. Spicy, deep fried pizza dough is a winner in my book. Sadly, I think this was the highlight of the meal. My husband didn't like his underseasoned steak. My linguine was boring and didn't remind me at all of the cacio e pepe dishes I've had in Italy that it modeled after. My sister and friend said the squid ink chitarra was pretty good, but they didn't like it enough to finish the dish.

We sat out on the patio to enjoy the nice weather, but we also felt overlooked by the waitstaff. I still hear people raving about their great experiences at EVO, but we didn't enjoy our visit nearly as much.
