lgWB0yGXpZvupYREWxtV7g It's been awhile since I've been to Pane Bianco and I remembered tonight just how good it is.  Since the expansion, the new section is great...rustic and comfortable - I absolutely love most of the pieces in there.  The menu is simple but good, the service was quick and friendly and the food is delicious!
