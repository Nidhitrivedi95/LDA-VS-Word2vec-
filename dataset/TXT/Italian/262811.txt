wUqqq1nUFA8Fn-3vYYFyWQ Just got back from an anniversary dinner at Porta Bella and I have to stay I think this place is all right but not anything to write home about.
The staff was very friendly, and managed to walk the line between attentive and intrusive.
The wine selection is sort of meh, but the bottle we had was pretty decent for the price (Shannon Ridge sauvignon blanc).
The food is between decent and good (a little oily, but that's Midwestern Italian for ya), but more importantly, for its price it is a huge steal.
As for atmosphere: the place is cozy and intimate. Some of the tables' conversations traveled, but the small booths are very private. And comfortable.

Overall, I would recommend at least trying it out.

EDIT: One of us got a bit sick the morning after. I would suggest avoiding any of the butter-garlic sauces. They are extremely oily (beyond anything reasonable).
