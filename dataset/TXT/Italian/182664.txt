oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw In early July I selected this restaurant as the venue for a corporate event. We selected the Semi Private room that was supposed to seat 75 people for the dinner. After signing the contract I was notified the the room could in fact only seat 60 people because they had recently remodeled and now the chairs were bigger. This was definitely a problem as our RSVP list was growing. They could only accommodate  a larger group with an additional room which would increase the F&B minimum. On top of that, I was told that they could not do a standing reception and a dinner in the same area even though when I spoke to the banquet director initial I indicated that I wanted a cocktail reception prior to the dinner. The whole event was turning into a big mess as the F&B was going up and up. It was very frustrating working with the banquet team. 

However, when I got on site it was totally different experience. By that time our RSVP list had grown to 80+, way more than I had expected. Although we did expect a significant drop off, we could not count on it. I ended up meeting with the banquet sales manager and she was extremely helpful in solving the space problem. She provided me with several solutions without exceeding our budget too much. I am really glad I spoke to her before the event because everything turned out great. 

The staff was extremely helpful. After dinner one of the waiters even helped me carry something back to my room. My only comment would be on the food. Trattoria Del Lupo is a Wolf Gang Puck restaurant and I expected amazingness. All I got was typical. Nothing impressive. We were however, ordering from a fixed group menu so maybe I missed something. Their lemon drop martinis were great though.
