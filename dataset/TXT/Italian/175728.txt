NFHlMOEyVsbqY_VQNJFafQ We have been here a few times but it has been awhile.  NOW IT IS FANTASTIC!  The chef Alex is wonderful and will make anything you ask for!  We asked for a Caesar salad (not on menu) and he personally made us each one and brought it to us AND it was the best I have ever had. 
Pizza fantastic.  Wed night if you order a 16 inch then you get a 12 inch for free.

Our new favorite place.  Atmosphere is romantic and cozy.  Nice back patio too.
Ask to talk to the Chef.  He has such joy in his heart and is wonderful to talk to.   
Gilbert needs to try this place.  If you have tried it before....I rec going back.  Totally different experience and loved everything about it!
