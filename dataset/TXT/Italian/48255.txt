93FVxoipAIYG07gisMOQhw I have since been back 3 times and I don't understand why they can't make a decent pizza.  I do not like pizza's that come out soggy in the middle.  I have now ordered it twice and both times I asked for well done and it came out soggy.  On a positive note the 5.99 spaghetti and a meatball is super value for lunch or even at dinner on Monday and Tuesday.
