Maybe I was lucky? Maybe it was a Sunday?

I have quite a decent meal at Il Fornello and the service was terrific! 

Linguine di Mare ($19)
- too saucy and that made the pasta a little too soggy
- Seafood is plentiful and fresh: Mussels, Calamari, Shrimps and Scallops

Rigatoni Bolognese ($16)
- pasta cooked al dente with a good bit and texture
- meat sauce is rich and bold

Chocolate Souffle ($11)
- a little overpriced with the portion 
- More like a warm brownie with ice cream but really hit the spot! I am biased with warm chocolate everything

Service... Attentive and Cheerful... I love my waiter! He alone worth that extra 0.5 star!

Will try to come back on Tuesday for their $10 Pizza Special! Hopefully really soon!
