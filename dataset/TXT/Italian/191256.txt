PebX-Sf_h4FJGgsRAA5Fng Went here again with friends over the weekend, being their first time here. They were impressed to say the least! Had a great meal...service was exceptional as always. They had a seafood dish...of Salmon, Muscles,Clams & Shrimp in a marinara sauce, on a bed of pasta. The seafood was cooked perfectly, and the Salmon obviously very fresh. The specialty garlic bread costs extra, but more then worth it if your garlic lover. My wife had a Talapia dish that she said was excellent!  I just hope they maintain the consistency with the quality of their food!!!
