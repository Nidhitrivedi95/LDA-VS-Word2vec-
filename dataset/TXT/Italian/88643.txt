e_BiI4ej1CW1F0EyVLr-FQ This is an excellent restaurant. Everything was absolutely delicious. I really recommend it compared to everything else I have tried in east Scottsdale.

Well, I returned last night after a year's absence, and was greatly disappointed in the food, the service, and the cost. I had a glass of white wine ($11 and only one cheaper at $10); the pomodori salad ($11), which was very ordinary hot house tomatoes, too much dressing, and no mozzarella; and the penne with chicken ($22). The pasta was right out of a box, the chicken was actually tough, and the sauce was just average and too salty. The waiter stopped by once and asked if everything was ok. I said yes, just ok, but not what I expected. He offered to replace it with something else, but by that time I was almost finished with it and sorry that I had returned. When you pay $54 for a glass of wine, a small salad and a small serving of pasta, you expect all of it to be outstanding. It wasn't, by a long shot. I won't be back.
