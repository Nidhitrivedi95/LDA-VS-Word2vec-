Oxz7xIKw2iJhxU-V_jpX7A I like this place and tried it twice. I had a fantastic waiter the first time who made a great dry martini! I liked the pizza because the crust was perfect and they have many options for toppings. My one complaint would be hot peppers on the side when it's supposed to be ON the pizza... don't list it on the menu like that, then bring them on the side. It means I don't get that cooked in flavor they provide. 

I also tried one of their rolls! The Mexican I believe and it was pretty tasty! It is a share plate or a meal for one person. That day I ordered those and a pizza and the waiter tried to tell me it's to much food. I said "it's ok, I plan on taking the pizza home"... which I did. But when the food arrived, it was so much and people were laughing. I just said "this is how Americans eat" and we all laughed even harder... 

I also tried some wine, very nice... and a desert. The molten chocolate cake was very nice!  

I appreciated that they spoke English here and had an English menu!
