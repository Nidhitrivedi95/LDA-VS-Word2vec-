tshN5rYRrzanHu4ZiwCVrA I've been here a couple of times for table dining but I must shout out their to-go service. It's been consistently excellent. My office is mere minutes away from this location so if a pasta craving hits, I can be in and out thanks to placing my order online. The people who are behind the desk handling the to-go orders have been above and beyond friendly and always make sure everything is correct.

As for the food? Eh, it's an Olive Garden but I go here for their pasta e fagioli soup and breadsticks so not much can be messed with up my order. 

My personal tip: place your to-go order online via their website and check online for coupon codes...I saved 15% on my last to-go order!
