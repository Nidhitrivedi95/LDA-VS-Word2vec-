nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ My friend and I came here after a day of shopping, it was the first time for both of us. We had a wonderful server by the name of Ricki - we weren't sure what to order and she recommended the lobster ravioli which was what we both ordered and it was fantastic. We then had to have some dessert and our server Ricki recommended her favorite- tiramisu- well now it is my favorite!! So glad we decided to check out this place - will definitely be returning when Ricki is working and asking for her recommendations again!
