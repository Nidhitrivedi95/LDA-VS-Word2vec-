LqO_983CEmi1_X1En4mZow Wow. To see the reviews from this restaurant as anything less than phenomenal is surprising. Our party arrived early for our reservations but we were still seated and served immediately. The waiters, waitresses and even the manager were great to us. My husband received a free birthday dessert and the food was also good:) the best part was the concern the staff showed for my husband when he started choking and literally needed the Heimlich (it's only funny because he's ok and we have dark humor) They all made us feel very comfortable and the manager even sat and spoke with us for awhile to ensure my husband was ok. We all had a good laugh after and even stayed the rest of the night for drinks. This place has a great outdoor area with giant jenga, corn hole, ping pong and more (I think that part is considered the gastropub, but they are essentially connected to the steakhouse) Anyways, we had a fantastic formal dinner then partied all night after. Great fun!
