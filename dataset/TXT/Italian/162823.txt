Lu5hB_5YtX5Re2067Zf3cg As a huge fan of pizza in general, I have wanted to check out MezzaNotte for their brick oven pizza for a while and was excited when a friend suggested we meet for dinner this past week.

After arriving first I was seated in a booth by the door so my friend found me easily one he arrived.  After looking over the menu we decided to try the Calamari and Pepperoni Pizza, since the table next to us had one and it looked good.
The calamari was very small and nothing special.  It definitely isn't something I would order again and hate that the marinara was cold, need a warm dipping sauce.
As for the pizza I wasn't that impressed. The crust was good, but the cheese didn't taste that great and wasn't melted properly so there were chunks in areas that were very heavy and the pepperoni wasn't special, could have been a pre-brought brand.  Just a thought.
As for the service, the wait staff were great filling up water promptly, but we only saw our waiter when he took our order and dropped the check off.  I wanted a second glass of wine, but after realizing my waiter was only focused on talking with the hostess the whole time I put my glass on the end of the table to get his attention.  Definitely wish he would have checked on us after taking our order.

Overall, it was okay.  If I am in the area I would be interested in checking out some of the Italian entrees, but not sure I would go back for their pizza.
