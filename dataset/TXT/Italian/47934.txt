9_UHuIMHDjrxuh2qlHS-UA Wow!  What an unbelievable experience at this tiny strip mall Italian restaurant.  We actually went based on other Yelp reviews.

First off, the service was absolutely fantastic!  We were seated and waited on immediately.  Fresh warm bread with real chilled butter and a decent Cabernet to start.  They had so many specials - many of them seafood - pasta combinations.  The server made recommendations for my daughter who is a vegetarian.

My daughter opted for an eggplant special.  I ordered lasagna - had a craving for that!  My husband ordered a seafood pasta special.  Everything was piping hot with delicate noodles, flavorful sauces, and all was cooked perfectly!  The salads that came with the meal were fresh with a great Italian dressing!  And another basket of bread.....yum!  Finished the meal sharing a pistachio gelato....also delicious!

Usually Italian restaurants leave me feeling heavy.  This experience was not like that.  Everything was filling but not heavy and overdone!

Please go!  The place was not full on a Friday night.....and it should be!  We will be back again and again and again!  I can still smell that delicious aroma!
