SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg I am sitting at Herbs and Rye, dumbfounded by the spectacular service. 

It is my mom's birthday today and we figured we would try this place out. I heard my friends rave about the atmosphere and the food quality so we figured, why not? 

Seating was quick although unfortunately it was in front of the bar. It would usually be okay if I were out with friends but if you're coming for an intimate night, between family or your significant other, be sure to call for a reservation and ask for a table in the backroom area. It'll surely help save your voice :P. 

Back to the amazing service, we ordered the clams appetizer as a starter. It was a decent size but probably not good to share with more than 2 people. The sauce that came with it was WOW. 

For the main course we opted to get the King Kong steak, a gargantuan steak weighing in at 60 oz (that's 3.75 lbs!!!!!) along with a delicious side of mushrooms and Truffle Mac & Cheese (MUST HAVE). 

The steak came out cold at first so we asked the waitress if we could get it warmed up for a bit. Out steak was taken away and we were promised to get our steak back nice and warm but something more impressive occurred. The manager came over to our table and told us he felt it was unacceptable that our meat was cold so he told us they were in the process of making a steak that would come fresh out the grill and straight to us. When the steak came out it was better than the first bites we first took with our other steak and we were all pleased. 

The professionalism that the manager and the waitress demonstrated was beyond our expectations. 

Will we come back? HECK YES! Any restaurant that is committed to having customers leave happy is a restaurant worth revisiting. 

Tip: Come from 5 pm to 8 pm to enjoy half priced drinks and some STEAK (amazing, right?)
