5a2WPziZW2HoW10H1ovbpQ My friend said this place used to be called "Table 11", but obviously the place doesn't exist no more.  The place and menu look modern.  They have a lot of selections of teas and specialty drinks.  It's a good place to meet up with friends.  

As for the food, the meal portions is reasonable and descent, it's filling and it's not an overload.  At first I thought the potions looked small, but everyone walked out satisfied.  I had sloppy Joes and the rabbit meat was delicious and the little arugula salad went well with the meal.

Our server was very accommodating when splitting the check between five people. 

Overall great ambiance and place to socialize.
