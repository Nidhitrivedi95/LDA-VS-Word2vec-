Yo8ODT7aFMM2xKUd1yaBVw I really really wanted to love this place. The patio is incredible, they have an amazing happy hour food
Menu, and it's in a great location. 
First, the good which was definitely the food. I ordered the calamari and a Caesar salad. My husband had another salad and gnocchi. The food was great. The server forgot to put the pepperoni on my sons pizza and had to fix that, but overall the food was delicious. 
Now for the bad which unfortunately overshadowed the food. When we were sat, our waiter came out, took our drink order and we ordered waters and two kids apple juices. The juices were brought out immediately but were only 1/3 full.  The water never came.  We finally had to ask a busser for water. By that point the 1/3 apple juice were gone, waiter was nowhere around, and we had to give the kids our water. Not once during our meal did he refill our waters. We had to ask other waiters to do so each time.  He forgot our calamari and gnocchi which we then had to ask for.  My favorite part was he cleared the dishes and didn't ask if he could take mine, which still had calamari on it, and walked off.  Finally when we got the bill, we were charged for the 1/3 apple juice ($3 each) even though the meal was supposed to come with the drink. 

Honestly, if it were just the food, the location, and the bus staff, they would get 4 stars. But this one waiter was so inattentive and terrible that I don't know that I could go back.
