exz9aZqMqjpqzUOFBAl9Gg The service was attentive. That is one positive thing I can say. 
I find it offensive, however, when the waiter brings a tray of raw meat and seafood, to show the diner what it looks like before it is cooked. Are we infants?  We have all eaten before.
Four diners, four different dinners. Chicken breast was dry. The rack of lamb was so-so. The lasagna was pretty but short on meat and oomph. And the rib steak was terrible. Cooked as specified, but it was a mass of fat and sinew, very little meat that was edible.
Each of us got 4 vegetables, a floret of cauliflower, a small yellow pepper, half a carrot and one lonely asparagus.
This was so not worth the price. I guess we have eaten at Portovino twice last night, the first and the last time.
