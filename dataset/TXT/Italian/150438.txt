KKUfGvyBDVqdZXXqS3uDrw I was very satisfied with my experience here. My server was a very nice man that catered to my needs. 

The complimentary bread was alright, but the dip that accompanied it was so delicious. It was a roasted red pepper and bean dip. I had the prix-fix dinner special. To start, I had the Caesar salsad, which was alright. For the main course, I had the fettucine with gorgonzola sauce and bacon. It was very rich, creamy, and filling and I enjoyed it. For dessert, I had the creme brulee, but I didn't much care for it.

I enjoyed the pasta and the service was great.
