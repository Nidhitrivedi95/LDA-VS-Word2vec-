ppyUsjr_baAojLKyAAO1uw I was there Monday night this week, one of those beautiful evenings we've had lately, and finally stopped at the place I walk by each night on my way home from work.  The owner greeted me right away, letting me know they'd started offering sandwiches until 7pm; very smart move.  He made my delicious Donatella to order and poured me a beautiful clear glass of water right away - anticipated the need so I didn't have to ask. 'Ordered the BLT on focaccia which Casetta makes with heirloom tomatoes and fresh pesto; next time I'll skip the italian dressing because the pesto and mayo would have been just the right amount of savory against the salty bacon; mouth waters as I think back on it. We chatted about their new-each-week Prix Fixe Friday menu, which at $40/$65 with wine pairings, looks great. I wandered home very satisfied and looking forward to my next visit.
