Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA Federal Pizza is the best! The food is amazing and the staff is incredible! I was having a really bad day and got a pizza to perk up my day. Not only did they have the eggplant parm pizza (which is my favorite and a rare special) Amanda the manager went up and beyond turning my whole day around! I can't wait to go back!
