xrYcZxAHSfwO1BdtdxdVjw I love going to this wine bar when in old town Glendale, and not too many people have figured out it's there yet so it's not usually too busy. That's a good thing because it does not fit many people. The wine list doesn't change too often and the wine is pretty pricy without many specials ever going on, but it's one of the only places on this side of the valley to get a decent glass of wine. They also have a huge beer selection. The staff is very nice and always willing to let you taste. I have never tried their appetizers but it looks like they have yummy options. It's right next to Haus Murphy so I always drop by before or after dinner.
