5HjmnWOtBYAYW-jjdZ3aKA Have been to GV's a few times in the last year...thought I had reviewed...but none appear.  So here we go: Stopped in with a group from work that ventures here more often than I.  Service is good and friendly.  Refills came without asking.  Our meals came out in good time.  On my prior visit I had the Crab Sliders that were tasty and pretty good, not to much filler and came with some (I think homemade) chips that needed a little salt (my preference) and is a favorite of another in our group.  I remember having the Buffalo Chicken Wrap on a prior visit and really enjoyed it.  This visit I had a Stromboli where I selected a couple of my favorite items to be enclosed.  It was perfectly cooked and perfect for a somewhat chilly evening.  Should probably have a pizza since they have a brick oven, next time.  Someone had a salad and it was huge and looked to be fresh and left with enough for a second meal. 
We really had a good time, with some good service and a good meal.
