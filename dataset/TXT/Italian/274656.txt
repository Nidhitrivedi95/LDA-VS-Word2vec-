y769FA7VJOW4QQYdYlR62A No private parking lot. Paid parking on the streets.

Came here for some quick pasta. I ordered the carbonara. The service was slow. The pasta was hard and undercooked. The portion was good but i was unable to finish it because the pasta was too hard. It came with a lot of bacon though.

The price is ok if you just order the pasta alone, but if you add chicken or sausage or any other topping on it then its not worth it. You would get better food if you were to go to a restaurant for the same price.

Plus side, if you check in with yelp you get a free dessert
I got the panna cotta pudding, it did not match my tastebuds. It tasted like gingerbread cookies with a really sour berry topping. 

May comeback to try the pasta again, hoping that next time it wont be undercooked ! 

Price: Decent
Food: Not that great
Service: Slow
