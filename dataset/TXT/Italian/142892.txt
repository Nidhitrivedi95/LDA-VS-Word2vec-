js9rQZAlA5rr7oSBRRcCDw Food - 3.5/5  : Decent food with generous portion. Price is reasonable

Service - 1/5 : It is not surprising that many other yelpers have experienced the same problem. The server was very aggressive, abrupt, rushed, and unfriendly. Our server was the big guy. This waiter doesn't know the basics of serving. Shame on you, Dimmi bar for not training your waiters properly. Like I said, if you read the reviews here, you can see that I am not the only one who has felt this way. 

Atmosphere  - 3.3/5 : OK, nothing special, but can't really complain.

Not going back anytime soon due to the violent service.
