xAxdrUpIVOvxl0wjp45w6A Eccellente!!! A bona-fide family run Italliano ristorante that is a "MUST" for anyone in the east valley craving Italliano food. 

We ate here last night with my folks whom had been here previously and highly recommended it. The service was very good, but expect it to be a tad on the slow side. This is quite normal over in Italy, so expect it here as the owners are themselves from Italy, and enjoy the great aroma coming from the kitchen as you anticpate a delicious meal arriving at your table. Our server, Carmen was great, the food was absolutely amazing, and the owners even came by to chat us up exuding a great vibe and making us feel very welcome.

We can't wait to go back!
