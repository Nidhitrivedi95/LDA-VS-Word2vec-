7sh1qDlGo_80zpJfFrnb4Q I had no expectations for Giordano's . . . none at all. That's good thing because I hate being disappointed. I should try that approach with all restaurants. This lovely Italian Trattoria in a strip mall in Carefree is terrific. It is so totally unpretentious - a welcome break from so many of today's Italian restaurants - especially those that have displaced the little Mom and Pop shops. 

The service was not over the top either. Our waitress gave us plenty of time to chat with our friends without rushing us to order and just asked us to flag her down when we were ready. I was a little overwhelmed by the menu which had so many traditional Italian items. My eyes lit up when I saw two of my favorites - eggplant parmigiana and eggplant rollatini. I chose the rollatini and it was so delicious. The eggplant was perfectly cooked and the filling was so rich and creamy. The marinara was so tasty, I almost could have eaten it in a bowl by itself. All the main entrees come with a side of spaghetti or penne. My husband had the special of the day, veal rollatini. It was the best Italian dish he has had in ages. Our friends had the chicken Marsala and the veal parmigiana, both which they proclaimed were excellent. 

Hubby and I split a yummy chocolate dessert laced with a hint of orange which looked like it was bought at a bakery, not made in house. Nevertheless, it was divine. We would have been satisfied with our meal without it, but just had a hankering for something sweet. If the decision was up to me solely, I would have had the cannoli -- do you sense a them here -- that I like thinks that are rolled up and stuffed with cheese? I do. Next time, I'll have the cannoli, but it probably won't live up to my friend Jan's homemade. 

Since it is so close to home, we will be putting Giordano's on our "regular" list. Buon appetito!!
