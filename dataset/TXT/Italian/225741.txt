So132GP_uy3XbGs0KNyzyw Geez I so want to give these guys 5 stars but I just can't. Regardless of short comings, I do highly recommend this place. It pays homage to old Vegas in a very special way which makes it worth it. On the bad side, our limo to the restaurant had no AC, our waiter forgot about us after our entree was served and it was quite expensive for what it was BUT, the 2 man band made it totally worth while.
