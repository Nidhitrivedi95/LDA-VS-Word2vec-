O5_CKNQOmtRHY_CjOB6XYA The only reason I didn't give this place a 5th star is because of the service. It wasn't that it was bad, but it seemed a little disjointed. OK, so enough negativity...

We started with Caesar salad and calamari. Calamari was a little overcooked but was really, really tasty. Onto the mains...I had the fillet mignon (special). I was told I'd get 3 pieces of shrimp with it, but only 1 came (and I'm not sure if it was a big shrimp or a prawn, but my expectations were not met). Tasty stuff overall though. My date had beef-tip penne, which was also good. For drink we had a Reisling, which was excellent, and not too pricey. 

Overall, great value. I  would definitely go back.
