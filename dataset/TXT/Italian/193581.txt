pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg Came here during Happy Hour after a long treacherous walk on the Strip and needed a leg break. Came in by accident and never read the reviews. We sat in the bar for Happy Hours and the portions were more than enough for two hungry girls. The restaurant is family style serving and portions are big so make sure you order concisely.
+=Must try the mussels, listed as an App, which were very soft and melts in your mouth. The sauce was great for dipping bread as well. Portions at Happy Hour were still very generous even for just two people to split.  The appetizers of Calamari rings were also scrumptious!
-=hidden inside Caesar's Palace, quite a ways to walk to get there.
