6tFbsJuIarw6vawDOZ9GkA Ordered the personal hawaiian from this location. Meh.  I've had better at different locations.  The cheese-dough ratio was not upto par.

Ordered 8 boneless bites and I've never been so disappointed.  For $9 I expect it to, you know, taste good. But it didn't.  You could literally taste the flour that was mixed in the chicken part.  My advice to you would be to stick with the regular wings. When I order burnin' hot sauce for my wings, I still expect some sort of flavor too, is that really too much to ask?

Pizza hut use to be a much sought after, rare commodity in my life when I was a child.  My parents would never buy it cuz it was so expensive; and they were real estate agents. In 2007, I got a job and purchased a calzone/panzerotti from them, and it was garbage.  However, I discovered that the personal hawaiian was spectacular.   There was like, no sauce in the panzerotti; it was very inappropriate.  The cheese-sauce-dough ratio was not upto par. It fell short, and then fell into the garbage can.

Serve me right for going there after a workout.  I wasted $16 for this  foolishness.

3 stars!
