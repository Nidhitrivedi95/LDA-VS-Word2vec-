9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw We were recently at Cibo for our wedding rehearsal dinner and rented out the carriage room in the back. We were extremely pleased with the food and service we received and our guests raved about how good the food was. For anyone looking for a rehearsal dinner for a smaller group, we had around 20-25 guests, I would highly recommend dining at Cibo.
