6We2O5X62J_gduXU7jvf8w OK, having just arrived back from NYC, and having just experienced Lombardi's there (which is supposedly world famous), it is NOT as good as Spinato's.  This is my third or fourth taste of heaven, as we often order pizza for our office crew, and each time it has been fantastic!  Granted, I stick with the plain old pepperoni or sausage pizza, so others may not be as tasty.  Doesn't matter 'cause I LOVE it!
