G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Paid $45 for the Giada Brunch Tasting Menu that comes with an assortment of pastries (five for $15 or $4 for one, so that was a decent deal), an antipasti platter with eggs benedict deviled eggs, brussel sprouts crostini, and mini pizza di pasta. The only tasty selection was the deviled eggs. My friend, who was reason we went to Giada's in the first place, was really disappointed in the rest of the antipasti selection. I ordered the Baked Sausage & Eggplant Lasagna as my main entree. Considering Giada is italian, I expected her to have her pastas down, but I was also disappointment as this was a $29 plate. 

I got to taste my friend's entree, the Italian Chicken & Waffles with Cacciatore Sauce which was pretty good in comparison every thing else we had tasted. The cacciatore sauce was delicious, and the waffles had great texture. 

Giada's dining area is beautiful, but we were really expecting to enjoy more than just the ambiance, and a bite of egg and a sauce side considering a $130 meal for two.
