LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Yum Yum Yum pretty much sums up my Maggiano's experience. I went for a wedding reception which allowed me to sample many appetizers and entrees. I was not disappointed in any of them. The highlights were the breaded zucchini which was so crunchy and flavorful. There was a spinach salad that tasted like a party in my mouth, with bits of creamy cheese and pancetta bits. The entrees were equally gratifying, my faves were the salmon on a bed of spinach (cooked to absolute perfection) and the raviolis in a pesto cream sauce. The Chicken Parmesan was also a front runner, the chicken breasts were pounded so thin, yet still juicy and moist. 

I will definitely venture back to this gem in the mall!!!
