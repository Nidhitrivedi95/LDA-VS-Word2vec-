GmgAToSKHnnB3BUtp9eQzw Tried Tratto for the first time with some friends. Beautiful restaurant decorated in what I see as a Martha's Vineyard theme. Very cool.
Food portions were small but everything we had was excellent. Cucumber salad was mmmm. The Tratti pasta was amazing. Martinis were good. Tiramisu at the end was a nice touch. The service was very good from an enthusiastic staff. 
Will be back.
