bNNF6Z91L7Omfdi8QSo2_w Party of 7 had brunch here over the weekend, and thought it was excellent for the money.  You can choose between 3 courses for $35, extra $10 to add the buffet, or $25 for buffet only.  The former two include unlimited champagne!
There are plenty of choices if you opt for the 3 course: I started with the prosciutto & melon;  the standard cantaloupe was replaced with a large, thick slice of watermelon that had been soaked in a sort of balsamic sherry.  The color was so deep and beautiful it looked more like ahi tuna than fruit.  It was peppered with spicy arugula and tangy goat cheese, and I really enjoyed it.  Next up, the eggs benedict, an excellent execution of the standard, with extra-crispy sourdough muffins and well-balanced hollandaise.  I nibbled off a few of the other plates: the apple-wood smoked bacon was simply irresistible, ahi nicoise farro salad was unique & fresh, made to order omelet was simple perfection, and the butternut squash panzanella was delicious.  Others really enjoyed their spaghetti with veal meatballs and two people who got the huevos rancheros said it was some of the best they'd had.  The final course was a large tower of assorted pastries & cookies.  These really didn't wow me very much at all, but I seemed to be in the minority as others happily indulged.   Overall a superb brunch in a beautiful setting.
