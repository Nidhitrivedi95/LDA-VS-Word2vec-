S5bNE4Pmin8OQUMOFod8bQ I'm not a frequent Summerlicious diner but I thought I'd make an exception when a friend wanted to meet up for lunch at Ciao.

We were able to make very last minute reservations and were pleasantly surprised when offered a table for 2 on their sidewalk patio.  

First impressions - Ciao is sleek looking, definitely fits in with the rest of Yorkville restaurants.  Lots of seating available in the form of booths and tables.  Tasteful modern design.

Our server was quick to drop off menus and take drink orders.  I went with a limonada ($2.50).   From the Summerlicous menu, I chose the Caesar salad, the Capricciosa Pizza, and the tiramisu dessert. ($15 prix fixe menu).  My lunch date chose the same salad, the penne entree and the chocolate buddino.

We got a small loaf of warm bread and some spiced pitted olives, which were a really nice start.  Salads came quickly after...decent salad, nothing special though.  My pizza was massive and loaded with toppings (ham, mushrooms, artichokes, olives).  The portion size was massive...I had 3/4 of the pizza leftover for another meal.  

The penne, on the other hand, was a bit plain.  The description mentioned that it would have pancetta but we didn't see any in there.  It was just pasta in pink cream sauce.

With my large sized pizza, I barely had any room left for the tiramisu.  I had a few bites to try and it was good, as was the chocolate buddino.  I saw the third dessert option go by which was the vanilla panna cotta and it looked good as well.

Service was friendly and prompt.  We were in and out in about an hour which is good timing for a weekday lunch.

We had a really great lunch and Summerlicious experience which is a nice change.  It's nice to know that there is a good option in Yorkville if anyone should suggest meeting up in that area again and I would gladly come back for their regular menu.
