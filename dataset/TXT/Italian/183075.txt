OBG1j517k7aZRNC1HAL0TA Overall: had a great time in the atmosphere and the food was very good!

* Atmosphere - nicely decorated restaurant with patio (outdoor) seating as well. I went during the summer and sat outside which was very nice and more "exclusive".

* Price - for the brunch menu which ranges from around $15-22. I ordered the "lemon ricotta pancakes" for $18. Also tried the "margherita pizza" for the same price. 

* Taste - (pancakes) They were so good, very light and fluffy. The lemon was a hint with blueberry sauce. Came with a good portion. (Pizza) thin crust and baked well. Thought the flavour was just a little over average. 

* Experience - we had the seat outside which was less busy, and great for an afternoon chat. They had umbrellas too to block the sun. 

* Service - our waiter was extremely nice and friendly. Came to check on us frequently.

* Recommendations - I would get the pancakes or other brunch items over the pizza! 

* Other - shops at don mills area is a great place to walk around/ shop in afterwards!
