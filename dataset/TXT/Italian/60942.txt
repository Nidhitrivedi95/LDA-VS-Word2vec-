aY0Y058p2_iWxMAZron2mg We went there last night for dinner, it was a group of 8. We had made reservations,  two of the members from our group were running a bit late.  Before they arrive a big guy comes and says that we can only give you your table for another 1.5 hours and we should have you out of here. three minutes later someone comes back and says we need you guys out of here before your 8:15. 
Not the best way to start your evening. 
The rest of our party arrives and we order our meals right away.  3 people got the spaghetti and meatballs,  one person got the veal, one person got a Margarita pizza, one a garganzale pasta, one short ribs and I can't remember what the other got. We also had apps,  most of the party had beet salad, which they could barely see the beets, we also had the Paese green salad, which felt like a container of dole arugula mix from Loblaws. It was the biggest waist of money on $14 salad ever. 2 of the 3 people with spaghetti liked it, the garganzale pasta was crap, absolute garbage,  the big dude said it was made with cheese and marinated in a wine sauce and it was great. We'll it was crap, saw no cheese, the pasta cooked well, and as for the sauce it had wine poured over it.  Total sham.
We also had ordered beers and drinks, we asked the for a non alcoholic drink,  something fizzy. The big dude comes with juice and fiz, fine. We get the bill they charged us $15 for fruit juice. Total waste of money. Bad service,  mean intimidating looking hostess.
Will never come back.
