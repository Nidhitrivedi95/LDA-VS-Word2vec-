SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Ive been in vegas 28 years but this halloween season I was tricked @Herb & Rye's bait and switch restaurant. 
Their "happy hour" menu is carefully deceptive, thread thru it carefully least you be "Tricked"

Last night we had dinner and drinks @ Herbs & Rye our first visit

We were attracted to the supposed "happy hour" half price on drinks and dinners.

We told our waiter Jeremy that we were there for the first time and were told that only well drinks were included in the 2 for 1 so we ordered two bloody Mary's turns out that even though they were "well" drinks, they were considered "Specialty Cocktails" @ $13.00 a piece. 
And dont order a condiment, creamy Horse Radish with your steak will set you back an additional $3.75. 

The meal itself was average with a well done steak being dry, instead of the moistness of finer restaurants. The salmon, although tasty was in a sauce that was way too salty, especially since we requested no salt or little salt. 

They rely on a theme of a speakeasy to draw but if youre interested in a really good dinner at a "bargain" look not here, dinner drinks  1 dessert and expresso's for 2 set me back $150.00 plus tip.
