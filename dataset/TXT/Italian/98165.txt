eVv6cnwhabK8ig5Di2hXQQ We ate here for the first time this evening! The pizza had ok flavor but the crust was absolutely paper thin and horrible. We couldn't even lift the pizza with our hands to eat it. 
The environment was pleasant and the staff were very kind. 
We asked our waitress when she came back to the table if this was the way all of their crust was and she said "No, you can specify what kind of crust you like when you order". My concern was that she didn't ask us when we ordered our pizza, she assumed we wanted extra thin pan crust. 
If you like real crust (thicker than paper) do NOT eat here!!
