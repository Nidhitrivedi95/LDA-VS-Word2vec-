w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A It pains me to have to rate Metro a 2. I absolutely love the food at metro. Great pizza, wings, salads, and gelato. The HUGE issue I have with them is the take out service. 

The last few times I have ordered take out my experience has been atrocious from start to finish. 

First, when I call, I'm put on hold for EXTENDED periods of time (last order was 5 mins 37 seconds). When someone actually comes back to the line I can order me food. I order the same thing every time. Large cheese and pepperoni pizza, wings medium extra crispy, large dinner salad with house dressing (which is amazing dressing), and occasionally an order of garlic knots. The order time is usually 25-45 mins, depending on how busy they are. 

Now on to pick up, where another huge issue lies. When I get to the counter to give my name, the employee will tell me to wait while they take 3 more phone orders. I can usually see my order waiting for me. It takes me 10 minutes to actually get my food handed to me. All while there are at least 3 other employees standing around doing nothing. It's ridiculous. This happens ALL THE TIME. 

It's a shame bc we love the food, but the service it terrible. Even after I fill out my credit card receipt and include a tip. I live closer to a Rosatis's but choose to come here instead bc the food is better. I'm not sure the terrible pick up service is worth the drive anymore. 

*i honestly don't mind the service to dine in. It's the pick up that's AWFUL.*
