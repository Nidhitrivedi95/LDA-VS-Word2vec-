SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ After walking around the forum shops for awhile, we wanted to sit down with a couple drinks. We weren't hungry for lunch yet. We asked if we could sit next to the fountain, which they obliged, but once our server found out we weren't getting lunch, she seemed annoyed and kind of left our table alone, even when I was out of iced tea. Other servers seemed to be more attentive, so I won't condemn service more generally.

The view was nice, but we also ended up in a lot of people's pictures of the fountain.
