That was my experience at Carnevino.  Mediocre, mediocre, mediocre.  I couldn't believe the prices they charged for the food.  Mario Batali should be ashamed!!  I ordered a couple of appetizer sized portions of the pasta.  They were okay, but the worst part was that the pasta came out COLD.  I had to send it back to get them to reheat it so that I could at least attempt to eat it.  I can't even remember what I had for my main - it was obviously not memorable.  

Avoid this place and spend your dollars elsewhere - I personally love Bartolotta at the Wynn.
