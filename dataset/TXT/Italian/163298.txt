lwpQQflP1CGJPV7QLybzOg I am not sure why we returned to this place.  Our last visit, we up and walked out.  We thought this time we would give it a shot.  They have a great price on Happy Hour chicken wings.  Well, we walk in with our 13 year old and are told that we can ONLY get the happy hour price if we sit in the bar area, BUT it is 21 and over.  Being that we want to have wings at the happy hour price, we ask if we can just sit on the restaurant side.  Not allowed.  10 feet away in the bar, wings are one price, but in the restaurant they are FULL price.  Great way to drive away business.  We are sure to never visit this establishment again.    Horrible business plan
