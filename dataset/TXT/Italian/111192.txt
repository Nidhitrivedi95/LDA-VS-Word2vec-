g_x5lM7itVvWA9n34QVlFA This is a very small place.  Only a few tables/booths.  Yes there is a rest room but for patrons only.  Ihave been here before.  My firiend loves their spaghetti and meat sauce and the garlic knots.  This time I had their A Bomb sandwich which is genoa salami, black forest ham, provolone and balsamic dtessing.  The sandwich was delicious!  The roll reminded me of Costanza's back home (Buffalo) crispy on the outside, soft and flavorful on the inside!  I love the decor with the old standards music playing.  If I had anything negative to say it is a bit dark, maybe just a little more soft lighting?  Overall, very clean, very attentive waitpersons.
