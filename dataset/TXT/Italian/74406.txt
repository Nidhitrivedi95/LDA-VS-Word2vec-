cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q When I got here it was extremly busy and the wait was 30 min. Or I could just sit at the bar with no wait. I sat at the bar of course. The unlimited soup and breadsticks are awesome. Although the thing that had gotten to me was the service. There were two bartenders taking peoples orders/drink orders. One was very good and the other just dropped the ball on every level. You already know which one I had gotten. Thankfully the awesome bartender picked up the slack and I went with him for the rest of the night and it definitely saved the experience. 

Food was okay. It wasn't as good as I remembered. I got some eggplant pasta and it was meh. Nothing particularly stood out. Awesome bartender is awesome and just a chill dude in general that defnitely knew how to provide a good experience which bumped this up to 3 stars.
