XF4w6wG1JOvfKZlQcxiWgQ I love this place!! The pizza sizes are perfect for either a group or single. I like that I can choose as many toppings as I want and it's the same price. The crust isn't to thick or to paper thin. The staff is fast and friendly and at the end is a little gelato stand! 
They have about 5 or 6 beers to choose from and sodas. I haven't had salad but the toppings look fresh. Chris is great and really remembers the pizza you like or can give you suggestions. Great place for pizza!
