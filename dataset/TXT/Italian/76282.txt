CSaVK9wgqe2_tQuuCDINyQ Frankie's Pizza is in the same business district as I work, so I thought what the heck lets give them a try. 

I glanced at the menu and the pizza by the slice caught my eye. They give you a good amount of food, two slices of pizza with a side of garlic knots and a drink for $7. The pizza tastes delicious, it's cheesy, hot and crispy with hearty portions of pepperoni and sausage.
They also make meatball sliders on garlic knots which I never heard of but it's amazing, especially when it's dipped in marinara sauce. 

Frankie's Pizza is a family run business with a nice and courteous staff. I notice when people walk in they are pleased to stop by and that makes me feel it's a cool place to have to pizza. 
I'll definitely be back here.
