d5n5CsoJNu-tKEbfI6U3tA Nothing like the soup salad and breadsticks.
We never actually sat down and waited for a table because for some reason there is always away so we go straight to the bar since we know we're going to get faster service that way.
Yeah we are nondrinkers but still going to the bar is a Way faster service to get our favorite breadsticks lol
I absolutely love coming to this Olive Garden the staff at the bar are so attentive they're so funny also the managers always come over and talk to us.
We've never had a bad meal everything we have had so far tasty super yummy we always try new specials that they have. we're on the rewards program so we gets a little perks like a free appetizer or free dessert. Definitely can't beat that
