AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw We wanted something different, Okra delivered! The service was fantastic, the food really really good. Because of medication I'm taking, the mixologist came up with a NA Mocktail that was GREAT! Had two of 'em.
The place would have received 5 stars, but it was hot in there. July in Phoenix, go figure. The table top was sticky, a simple wipe wasn't going to fix that.
All 4 of us had something different, all 4 entrees were great. We had lotsa appitizers, all delicious. Just couldn't bring myself to sample more that a bite of the fried chicken skins. Good, but so is a deep fried twinkie (I imagine).
And then the donut. OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!
We will be back, just not in the summer. Great job. BTY, this is my 1st restaurant review ever.
