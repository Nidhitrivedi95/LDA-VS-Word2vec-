UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Came in for happy hour with one of my good friends. As I entered the hostess at the stand asked me the basic seating questions once I informed her I was coming in for Happy Hour she changed her tone informed me that Happy Hour seating is at the bar or by the fire pit. 

As I walked around LOST the employees just continued to watch me walk back and fourth. I was alone still waiting on my friend and you can clearly see it in my expression that I couldn't find a seat. I had to ask someone for help who then also told me to look on the other side where there is another fire pit. Ok I get it, it's Happy Hour and seating is first come first serve but what's the point of having guest walk in and out feeling lost when you can have some type of organization to it?

Finally when I sat down it took about 10 minutes for someone to ask me what I wanted to drink and I guess they don't give you menus until you ask for one? This is the 4th time I have came here. It was my first time for Happy Hour and everytime I can't help but feel as if the staff be littles their guest. I clearly come back for the food and not the service! 

Happy Hour was definitely worth it! Great prices, good portions so as far as the quality in their food it's great! They need to work on better customer service skills. I have had better service at fast food restaurants then I've had here. It obviously wasn't a bad day for them cause 4 out of 4 tries the service just keeps getting worse.
