YJS7cXGLAvWw9DUDXpw84Q The food was excellent, garlic artichoke roasted chicken with capers and lemon.  It's one of the chalkboard menu items where you pick your choice of side salad, entree and preparation method.  Mikala, our server, was very helpful and ensured we enjoyed our meal or needed anything during our dinner.  I'm so happy this isn't another national chain 'ragu in the bottle' type Italian restaurants.  We will be back soon.
