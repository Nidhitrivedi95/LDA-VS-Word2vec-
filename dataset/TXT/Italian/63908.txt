We went for dinner and honestly, we loved everything... and with this crowd, that is a tough feat. Almost impossible.
Try the meatballs- they are huge, but surprisingly, not dense or dry.
The pastas were all good, but our favorite was their summer pasta with fresh tomatoes, basil and a light butter sauce. 

The service was impeccable. We never waited on our courses or drinks, even if being a busy Friday night. Everyone was friendly, and the place just simply has a good vibe. 
Will definitely be returning soon.
