JogUSDKa1xyG3lLEmD4Xjg We were staying in the neighborhood and were lunching next door at Fran's when my dad said, look, an Italian restaurant! He doesn't get a lot of authentic Italian, but since I have been living in Boston for years, I do. It turned out to be a great balance -- amazing fresh pasta, perfect tender osso buco, tasty meat sauce. The bread and pesto for the table was a real highlight of our trip to Charlotte, and we both greatly enjoyed the creme brulee also. The service was very attentive (although made him nervous when my credit card disappeared for 10 minutes) and I really enjoyed everything about this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for an authentic and rich Italian experience in Charlotte.
