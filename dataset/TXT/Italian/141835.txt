JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A The most recent time I was in the city I went here twice in two days I originally found this on yelp and was looking for a place after dinner with my girlfriend.  I have outlined a couple of points and scores below....

    - The desserts are phenomenal : had the carrot cake and was amazed at how good it was.  Was voted best carrot cake in the city....great stuff 
   - Be aware that many couples will be here making out so be aware I was told that the the third floor is the place to be for couples and lovebirds
   - The lighting is dark so it might be difficult to read a book 
   - Bathrooms are not a pleasant experience very small ...think phone booth  :-)
   - Kahlua HOT CHOCOLATE IS GREAT TRY IT OUT.....TASTY AND SMOOTH.
   - Great after dinner date place......

Score : 
     Service : 4 ( great service although it wasn't WOW service friendly staff helpful)
    Food and Coffee :  4 for Food ( for the desserts it was great ) and Coffee was about 3.5
   Alcoholic Drinks : 4 (great mixes with the coffee's and alcohol)

My Girlfriend's Words about 7 West :  The carrot cake was mouth watering - mmmm - sensational feelings ran down my spine after having one piece.  East or West, 7 West's the best!

My only suggestion : Make more alcohol with coffee, tea and hot chocolate mixes....until than ill see u at 7 west with a slice of Carrot Cake......
