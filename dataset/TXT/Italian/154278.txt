kzbH1_l7VTSfFFcwTqY6vA For one, I liked the cozy atmosphere of this little Italian family-owned restaurant, but it is in need of some major renovation work. The ceiling is bowed from what looks like water damage, and it looks like they attempted to paint it, but didn't like the color, so they stopped after one row. Maybe that has some history or cute story, but as a first time customer, I wouldn't know. 

The service was ok...not too timely, but not neglectful. 

We ordered the special muscles appetizer - good. Too much salt, but good. No comparison to Il Pizzaiolo. 

The main dishes were also specials; I had the homemade cheese ravioli and my husband had the pasta svoglio with red clam sauce. The ravioli wasn't much to write home about. The pasta they use is really thick for ravioli. The sauce was ok. 
The pasta svoglio was better. Lots of seafood used in this dish, and I enjoyed the taste I stole. 

I don't think we'll return here before we try another Italian bistro, but it was worth a try.
