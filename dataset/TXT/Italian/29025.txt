5aRyuqJZSGp1fNXHQHMLjg Maybe we caught them on an off night. I was not impressed. We were choosing between Red Devil and Mamma Mia's, and Mamma Mia's delivers, so it won. We should have driven, but being new in the neighborhood, we didn't know better.

Pros: 
1)the delivery guy was prompt and friendly. 
2) the chicken wings were tasty.

Cons: 
1)The Veggie pizza has gobs of thawed, previously frozen chopped spinach. You know, the kind that comes in a frozen block at the grocery store that you're supposed to wring out before you use it.
2)The crust was beyond soggy...it was downright WET. Probably from the aforementioned icky spinach.
3)The wings come with a packet of blue cheese salad dressing, the kind you pick out of a basket at cafeteria salad bars. And it was really thin and watery. At least it matched the pizza...

There are too many decent pizza places to risk this place again.
