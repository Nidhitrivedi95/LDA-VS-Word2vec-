SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw This is really fine, handmade pizza.  There are the high end foo foo pizzas at many places and they can be interesting, but when you are craving an honest earnest pie this is the bomb.  My bar for this being from the east coast originally is Manco and Manco's pizza on the boardwalk in Ocean City, NJ.  Fresh dough that is hand stretched and homemade as is the sauce, flavorful but not overhwhelming oregano or other spices, and tasty toppings.  They have all that here and it is the closest to Manco and Manco's I have found so far in the west.  The pizza is cooked so the dough has a crisp edge but just the right amount of chewiness.  Great cheese and not so much as to be gloppy.  I wish we had opportunity to try more of their offerings, the kids weren't very adventurous and we only did a half pepperoni and half black olive.  Next trip I guess!  The chef and the staff was very attentive and seemed genuinely interested in providing a superior product and assuring a satisfied customer.  Location is in a strip mall, basic walk in pizzeria with some booths easy to find off the 215 freeway and the sign on the street just says Pizza.  We did miss the part that they are closed on Tuesday so had to make a second trip on Wednesday but very glad we did.  They don't serve alchohol but you are a fool if you pass up this pizza and the very nice people that make it over that.
