7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Wholeheartedly agree with the 3 1/2 stars.  I must admit, it was quite a disappointment and definitely not what I would expect from an "Iron Chef" restaurant.  Was not bad, but not great either.  We had the filet for two off the pre-fixed menu called "pre-theatre" or "post-theatre" menu.  The food was not horrible, but how badly can you screw up a filet?  Service was mediocre at best.  Our server forgot to order our drinks and they didn't come until after the appetizers arrived... and you know, no alcohol in Vegas is like spitting in your food!  So we finally get our bottle of wine during the 2nd course, which already screwed it up.  But once we complained to a staff member, we had like a team of servers swarm us like white on rice.  (Of course, less our server who we saw a twice the entire evening). The filet was prepared adequately, but presentation was not to be desired for. A big white porcelean plate with nothing but a slab of meat on it... no garnish... no little design with the sauce... no nothing.   Based on the service, I would really like to give it 1 1/2 stars, but I have faith in Mario's ability to deliver good food.  We will give it another try in the future with hopefully better results.
