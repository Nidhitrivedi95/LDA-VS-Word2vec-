9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw My family and I went here for my birthday last night. Last year we went to Pomo Pizzeria and I wanted to go to another gourmet pizzeria. One bite into my Rustica pizza and I nearly died. The crust...so thin and soft! The cheese...so meltyl! The proscuitto....so salty and perfect!! 6 of us split 2 pesto salads (delicious), and 3 pizzas: the Rustica, Salsiccia and Margherita. The Rustica was my favorite, followed by the Margherita then Salsiccia. The cheese was just so....authentic. The service was delightful. When we arrived, I told them we had 6 people, and I am obviously very pregnant, so the owner was incredibly polite in making sure I was comfortable with where we were sitting and I was cool enough and everything. My only disappointment was that I didn't get any acknowledgement that it was my birthday, but oh well. That's the worst of it. Overall, it was delightful...and I'm looking forward to having a leftover slice of pie right now!!
