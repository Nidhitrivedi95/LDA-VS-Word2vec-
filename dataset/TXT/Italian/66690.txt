BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg For Napoli pizza, as close to authentic as u can get.  Owners are two brothers and a buddy that travelled to Italy and decided to bring Napoli pizza to vegas.

I did not know prior to coming, but the Italian government has an agency called VPN that will certify that you conform to their standards when making Napoli pizza.  Settebello is certified.

Their brick oven is from Napoli and two trainers were flown in from Italy, per the server.  In addition, on the way out, I noticed a dozen bags of flour with a Napoli branding.  Wow, authenticity is a priority here!

The pizza's crust was very thin, soft, and moist.  As other yelpers have reported, the crust is too soft to eat with your hands.  Eat with a fork and knife!  I enjoyed the experience of eating their very traditional pizza.

Temper your expectations on flavor.  Authentic Italian is not over the top....

Come here on a quiet day and appreciate Settebello's strive to be authentic.  Chat with the staff for background info on the process and enjoy their pizza!
