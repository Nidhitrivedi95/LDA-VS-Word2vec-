hVzRXGGhRJfTXIasO3bq1w I really wasn't impressed with this place. You have to fill out your order on a paper menu (which could be confusing), I'm not really understanding why you can't just order verbally. There was a decent variety of soups, salads, and sandwiches to choose from. The sandwich wasn't all that bad, but the salad was disappointing. It was mostly iceberg lettuce with a few other toppings. I didn't even eat all of it. It's really cheap, so I suppose you get what you pay for. But I wouldn't really recommend it, I would rather pay a few dollars more and go to Panera and get a better meal.
