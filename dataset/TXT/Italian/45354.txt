8lZtLSeJVg28Gb75iklmmQ Oh no. Just. No. Ordered a veggie pizza tonight and I am shocked to say this pizza made me nauseous. 

Large gourmet veggie came to $23 something with tax. Had a bunch of raw veggies on top such as onion, green pepper, broccoli (not raw but broccoli??), black olives, raw large slices of tomatoes, minced garlic, mushrooms with minimum cheese. 

It was like eating a salad spread out on a wet limp crust. Oh God. Make it stop. Tried picking off the veggies but no luck. They were stuck to the (minimal hardish) cheese. 

Worst pizza I have ever eaten. Even the sauce isn't good.
