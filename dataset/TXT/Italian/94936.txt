eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg Along with the new pool, the new gaming floor, the updated rooms at the Golden Nugget, there has also been a major revamp of the eateries here. 
The Grotto is a decent, physically darker version of Olive Garden-type resto partially open to the casino floor.  The waitstaff was friendly and swift, but they did seem rushed as there always seemed to be a wait to get a table.  
The bread served before the meal is soft and doughy; comes with a chili-garlic olive oil for dipping.
The bruschetta was awesome - long buttery, crusty oblongs of bread lightly drizzled with balsamic, topped with a fresh garlicky tomato tapenade. The bf and I gobbled that shit up quick.
I ordered the rigatoni with meat sauce, very good with that comforting feel, and the bf had the chicken canneloni which he apparently loved (none left) and I thought was ok (one bite).
Prices weren't dirt cheap but so much less than eating at a comparable hotel eatery on the strip.
One day, Mario's, but on this day, Grotto fit the bill just fine.
