7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Dining would have been SOOO much better if the room weren't like a cafeteria.  I guess where Batali saved in decor he loaded up on the ginormous copper cow in the center of the room.  So unnecessary.  

Give me some booths, have some organization in your dining room & dammit I need AMBIANCE!!!

Okay, ranting DONE.  

Food: pretty darn spectacular.  

Check out the Lobster, you can have it broiled w/butter, or sashimi style, we chose the sashimi, HEAVEN!!!  

The carpaccio & the caesar were alright.  The carpaccio was on the saltier side and the portion was small.  

DO pasta, naturally, it's Batali afterall.  There are 1/2 orders available so you can sample a little bit of everything.  I LOVE that.  We tried the fettucine dyed with REAL black squid ink, yum, nice pop in flavor, but the Stracotto was AWESOME, duck liver ravioli, can't go wrong with that. 

The filet was pretty darn good, and at $39 for an 8oz steak, not bad, for Vegas.  

We finished off with a rice tart, it's a shortbread crust with a risotto-like filling, w/a nice lemon twist.  I thought it would be heavy, but it was quite light.  Delicious.  

Service was great, I just can't give this place five stars, b/c the room is really terribly planned.
