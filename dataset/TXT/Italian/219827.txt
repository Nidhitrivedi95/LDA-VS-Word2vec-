SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Yelp had this place categorized incorrectly as Italian and tapas. It's definitely not either. ITS AN EXPENSIVE STEAK HOUSE. Had the 18$ calamari and it wasn't even close to worth 18$. I was seated by the bar and it was VERY loud. They moved me no problem though. The waiter was great. The beef tartar was great but my friend @Annemarie H. Got the squirt stinkies almost immediately.  Oh yeah and the toilet had mold in it.
