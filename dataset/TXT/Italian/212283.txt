The service is good and the food's even better- so much better in fact, we went there yesterday and came back this evening. 

Things we have tried here in the 6 or 7 times we've been:

Turkey sandwich (The Central Park). Eggplant Parm. Sandwich. Eggplant Parm. Pizza (good, but not as good as the sandwich itself). White Pizza (not made in the true Jersey style I've always been used to, but we like it!). The IRT (another turkey sandwich). 

All items have been great with the only issue being the Eggplant Parmigiana sandwiches yesterday- they were kinda burnt. 

We only had one issue on a visit there with the iced tea tasting a lot like coffee (we thought they'd used the same pot thing to make it). We let them know and they fixed it right away, came over to make sure we got some new tea, and then made sure it tasted right afterwards.

We love this place! 
It might seem hard to find as it's kind of hidden behind other places, but seriously- it's a nice little place.
