dNHDXn2ot4mFc2YfIFBNhQ We ate in this place and was treated poorly after waiting for over an hour. This is a very disorganized place. Pls beware. Don't waste your time. The food is so so and manager of this place has a monster like attitude towards customers, very defensive, and not apologetic for their shortcomings. This place needs to be on the watch list of Better Business Bureau. :(
