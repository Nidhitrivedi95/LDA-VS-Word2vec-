v5YvCuj_b26JKAqDcnReFQ Spent the last several days in Vegas and had the opportunity to eat at several "fine" restaurants with some exorbitant prices. None of those meals came close to the quality and value we experienced tonight at Evans. Hope we have the opportunity to eat there again in the future.
