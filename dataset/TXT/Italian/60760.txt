AWJhMTYsIYzCIYAIUA-waA I cook better pasta than them, and I am not much of a cook.

The pasta I had (I believe it was a marinara dish with penne pasta) was awfully bland.
Sauce didn't mix well with the pasta either.
The texture of the pasta was funky, hanging out on its own.
If I wanted bland pasta I would buy a can of Presto and penne pasta, boil them together and add some water :p

The server was attentive enough to notice and brought me more sauce.

I did like the service and how they had the giant white piece of paper and crayons on the table so I could doodle while I waited.

The waitress was very attentive and friendly.

Appetizer: calamari was yummy.

I just wish they could kick it up a notch on the pasta with richer sauces, seasoning, texture, more tomato/meat/cheese and really blending it with their pasta.
 
But I guess that would raise costs/prices huh. :/
