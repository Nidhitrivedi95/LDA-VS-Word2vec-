0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw This is my second visit to Joe's Farm Grill. I had the Fried Shrimp plate, and let me tell you that the shrimp alone gets 5 stars out of me! So, the meal came with fries and cold slaw, but I substituted fried green beans and onion rings. The beading on the two sides was too hard fried for me, so I ended up peeling it off. Also, be aware that these two substitutions were $3 each.

But, let's talk about the shrimp! They were jumbo shrimp with a perfectly seasoned lift batter. As a Floridian, this is what I know Shrimp are supposed to be, NOT like that wannabe butterflied mess that Phoenix area seafood restaurants try to pass off.

The atmosphere here is one of casual elegance, and as usual, I was warmly greeted by the blonde beauty in charge of the place. Come eat at Joe's Farm Grill, you won't be disappointed!
