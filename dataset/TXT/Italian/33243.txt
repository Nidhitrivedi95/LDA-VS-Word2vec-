5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA We went here on a late Sat afternoon and as we approached the hostess area, she was just seating another couple and let's us know that she will be right with us. She goes to seat the couple in front of us and then DOES NOT RETURN FOR 10 minutes. Wth? Did she seat the couple and then go on break? Anyways she finally comes back and asks if we have a reservation. We let her know that we do not and she says that's it's ok and she can seat us. We decided to sit outside and she took us to our table which was a little dirty and unkept but whatever she said she will send someone over to clean up. She gives us the menus and said someone will be right over. Looking at the menu, this place is WAY OVERPRICED.....$21 dollars for gnocchi?? This is just some bar/restaurant behind a gas station and there prices are like a fine Italian restaurant at the Wynn....Anyways, 10 more minutes pass and no one has come over to take our drink order or "clean up" the table yet. So we end our misery and just get up and leave. This place needs a strong manager and if they have someone in charge, they need to replace that person.
