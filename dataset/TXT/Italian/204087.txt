qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg Another pleasant surprise from Las Vegas!

While cruising the strip, my girlfriend and I were becoming incredibly hungry. We walked into hotel after hotel, casino after casino, but couldn't find the right restaurant for us. That was, until, we stumbled upon Tintoretto in The Venetian. 

Bread bowls- check. Outdoor seating with a street performer- check. A live band- check. 

The food was actually really really good, too! I had pan seared chicken with artichoke and mushrooms which was amazing! The creamy sauce tasted awesome, and the potatoes it came with weren't bad either! My GF had the usual, chicken fettuccine- but it tasted great. It tasted like somebody in the kitchen actually put some effort into it and didn't just throw it together like they would at Olive Garden. 

I didn't get a chance to try the bakery, but for a Vegas restaurant- it was affordable and delicious.
