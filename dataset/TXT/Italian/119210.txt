H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich don't disappoint :) 
Stopped by for a quick early dinner after the show at Sands Convention Center and enjoyed the food, didn't have too much time to take in the experience. Wish we did... the appetizers and the wine list were so tempting! served on the wooden board... there is also a giant almost "monument to ham" in the middle of the bar - a display with their cured meats that they thinly slice, beautifully arrange on wooden boards, add a little bit of nuts, cheeses... did I really have to make it to my plane?  

Well, wasn't my first time at the spot (and won't be last either, I guess) but this time either I was paying more attention, or the food was much better. 
We each had a salad, one of the vegetables and a pizza to share. Grilled Radicchio with smoked mozzarella was super flavorful and absolutely delicious - dressed with good aged balsamic.  The arugula salad with parmesan cheese was also pretty good. And, of course, the classic - Margherita 'D.O.C.'. 

Now, may be I am being picky, but... wish there was always water in my glass and bread on the table... just sayin', good service would be nice, especially since they weren't too busy yet :)
