PxTKXsdYqoFHWAG2amz0XQ Delicious and beautiful atmosphere in downtown location. Appetizers were all delicious and pizzas particularly the funghi were sensational! The speed of service was perfect and relaxing but efficient as we were going to a comedy show after. My only small complaint were the tiny glasses of wine. I will absolutely return!
