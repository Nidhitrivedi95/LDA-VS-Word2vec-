SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg HERBS & RYE. One of my go-to places for steak. It is always so, so good. Whenever my boyfriend and I have out-of-town guests, we take them here for the half-off happy hour specials. The midnight to 3AM happy hour is usually pretty busy. We've eaten here on countless occasions and it is always almost fully packed. So, the music and atmosphere are pretty loud. But, it's fine because we're too busy devouring our steaks to talk all that much. 

We typically order the Filet Mignon. It is always perfect. If I am feeling it, I will order their sauces - either the chimichurri or brandy peppercorn sauce. Both are very good. The sides are for sharing. One side could probably be shared among 2-3 people. We usually order the mac-n-cheese, spinach, and asparagus. 

If we are really hungry, we order the Tomato Bisque and/or Farmer Flatbread along with our steaks. The flatbread is pretty good. The egg on it really makes all the difference. The tomato soup comes with grilled cheese and is actually enough for an entire meal. So, if you're not that hungry but still want to eat along with your friends, order the tomato soup. 

The drinks. My second favorite part. This place definitely does their drinks right. They have drinks featured from different time eras. The drinks are strong and presented very nicely. The beer selection is also pretty good. 

Service is always on-par. They are attentive and have never had a problem in the countless times we've been here. 

Overall, this place is awesome. I highly recommend. Will be back here again and again.
