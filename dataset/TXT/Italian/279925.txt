yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w The boyfriend and I vacationed in Vegas and this place was a must, since it was a usual spot he and his family would dine at while visiting. I couldn't have been more impressed with this place. It took me less than a minute to make reservations online, which came handy later because of their long wait for others once we got there. The atmosphere is great, with a really cool and cute interior. The food here is absolutely delicious, from their salads and garlic bread (best ever), to their entrees, and to their wine and homemade cappuccinos! I will definitely be coming here again.
