oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ I love everything about this place: the wine, food, service, and atmosphere are all great.

I've only been here for dinner but a few specific recommendations would be: 
- polenta fries with gorgonzola dip (quite possibly my favourite appetizer ever)
- gnocchi with gorgonzola cream sauce
- seafood linguine (solid amount of seafood)
- grilled octopus
- chocolate baci bombe 

I haven't tried the pizzas yet but I plan on it. And basically any pasta you get will be great because you can really taste its freshness. Great quality stuff! And the extensive list of wines always makes for a great excuse to try something new.

Service is good here from the servers. Attentive and really friendly.

The place is really big, too, it looks like it would be perfect for larger groups since there are a few private rooms/areas. Birthdays or staff party outings seemed to be in attendance. But also perfect for a romantic night for two.

Overall, great quality and always a good time.
