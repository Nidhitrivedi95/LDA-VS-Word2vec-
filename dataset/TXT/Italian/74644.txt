CqCWN9aBJf8YNJxyel7psg It pains me to give Glass Nickle a 3-star but this place has been slipped over the past few years. I used to love it but now it's a "meh" in my mind. I've only had delivery so maybe that has something to do with it but the last four times I've had it the pizza had been made wrong or over-cooked, REALLY late delivery or it just plain tasted bleh. And they are quite expensive so I do expect more from GN and lately they haven't delivered (figuratively speaking).
Don't even try to use the website to contact them about your concerns because they only give you an automated reply.  I'm giving it three stars just because I loved it so much once and hope that the recent experiences have been flukes. Worth a try though if you haven't had it before.
