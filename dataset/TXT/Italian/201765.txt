q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA Came here because of the cutest umbrella decor and it turned out to be just as exciting as we anticipated! Caffe Mona has both indoor and outdoor seating, but make sure you come on a sunny day to enjoy the outdoor back patio. The umbrellas do an amazing job at keeping it cool. As well, the location is not in a busy area, so despite being outside it is still extremely peaceful. Such a nice change up from similar restaurants in lawrenceville or southside. As for the food, it was so delicious! Service was fast and attentive. Overall, a very relaxed atmosphere. They have a very unique style with their restaurant that remains true to their business. They even bring the checks in a wooden box...such a cute touch! We will absolutely be back!
