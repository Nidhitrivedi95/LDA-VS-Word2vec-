h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ First visit was for a girls lunch. The ambiance was fantastic. Upscale Rustic Italian Vineyard?  Don't know how else to describe it. Not to bright, not too dark, just right.  Walls of wines that made me wish we were there for a drinking day.  Service was fast, friendly and just the right amount of attentive.  Food was exceptional. We each ordered from the lunch menu.  The hanger steak with frites was AWESOME. Tender, flavorful and perfect. The Chicken Parm was delicious. Tender, juicy, crispy.  Sauce was a nice, simple, marinara that didn't overwhelm.  We brought some to-gos (eggplant parm and caprese salad) back to the office and everyone raved. Would be perfect for a date-night.
