Eo4s6CmPpEcXCkfg9Zk_EA I was stunned at what this assembly line calls 'bacon.'  Stunned!

I ordered a pizza with double bacon (strips) - and the IDIOTS put the bacon on TOP of the cheese - so - of course - it burned!  BLACK!

And even worse - the bacon was BY FAR, the THINNEST bacon I've EVER seen - IN MY LIFE.

What they 'call' bacon was about as thin as a sheet of paper.  I mean - if it wasn't black - you could probably see through it.  It was THAT thin.  Like - I mean - 4 times thinner than the thinnest bacon I've ever seen.  Ever.

Now - if the bacon wasn't so shockingly thin, and it was with the other toppings - under the cheese, then, maybe - it might have been edible.

Sad.  Pathetic.
