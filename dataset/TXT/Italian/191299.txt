PebX-Sf_h4FJGgsRAA5Fng Went there last Friday night in lieu of all my normal restaurants were booked/crowded. Found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I was tentative of trying a Ristorante because most places are non-traditional and make more of "fusion" dishes.  This place is as authentic as it gets without going to an Italian community or Italy itself.  

The Chicken Amalfitano was honestly, "TO DIE FOR".  All ingredients were fresh, prepared perfectly, and the side of potatoes and green beans were matched well with the dish.  The demi glace tied the whole dish together.

Calimari was cooked perfectly as well.  Lightly breaded to highlight the squid.  You will not find Tartar sauce or Cocktail sauce in this restaurant!  They make a fresh tomato and garlic tip that I can almost eat by itself.

Dessert was just as good as the appetizer and main course.  I had a mascarpone gelato & a pistachio gelato.  

One thing I care more than good food is service.  Clara (I believe she is the co-owner), came by at least 3 times to check up on us.  The server and staff ensured that our drinks were always filled, our mouths were stuffed, and that we were always satisfied.  When you get great service with outstanding food, you get a 5-star rating.

Adding this restaurant on my top 5 list for Arizona.
