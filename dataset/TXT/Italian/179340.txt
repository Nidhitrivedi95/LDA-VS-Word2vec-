nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Amazing Dining Experience!!!
Came to Las Vegas for our 30th Anniversary.  Used Yelp to pick a good restaurant near a concert venue in the Venetian.  
The waiter, Giorgio, was incredible.  Recommended the couples special that consisted of two appetizers, two/ three main courses and a dessert tray.  
Apps- meatballs and a meat and cheese sampling was a meal onto itself.  
Main Courses- Beef tenderloin in a red wine reduction, over mashed potatoes. Wow!
Grilled Sea Bass and Rigatoni. Unbelievable!!!
Finally, a tray of pure delight!!
Cookie Dough Gelato, Molten Chocolate Cake, Canoli and Tiramisu!! 
This place is so good!!
Do yourself a favor and ask for Giorgio, he makes the experience complete!!
