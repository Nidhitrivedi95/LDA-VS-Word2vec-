FmraE2CWt65VRnEqCAqNEg After reading reviews about Harvey's American Public House we were hesitant to give it a try....but we went for dinner this evening and were not disappointed at all! We were seated immediately and after placing our order our beverages were served quickly and our glasses were never half-empty! Colton provided excellent service and recommended the onion rings....they were not greasy and were really good. We also ordered the French dip sandwich, the Cuban sandwich and the margarita flatbread pizza. Portions were good size and we took 3 boxes home. They offer a lot of different brews and have sports playing on several flat screen TV's. we really enjoyed the atmosphere, their delicious food and excellent service......definitely will go back again!
