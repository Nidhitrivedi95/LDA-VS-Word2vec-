N8ArHOgRDI8wOJIOZaEHyg Had dinner here the other night.  Suzanna is the best waitress ever! Not just because she was friendly and polite like a waitress is supposed to be,  because she went the little extra to make sure we were knowledgeable able our choices and enjoyed our meal.  Thank you! If I could hire her to sell for the company I work for, I would!
