0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw Stopped in for dinner tonight. The BF and I shared a burger and a chicken sandwich. The Bacon Blue burger was tasty. It comes with bacon, blue cheese dressing, onion rings and the bbq sauce they use for all their BBQ items. The pesto chicken sandwich was like a good chicken version of their fontina burger. Same condiments. Onion Rings were hot & crispy and the garlic fries were garlicky and flavorful. Yup, definitely get some hot breath after that. I also sampled some meat from the BBQ sampler plate the BF's sister ordered. I thought it tasted better than what you get at Joe's Real BBQ. Choosing between Joe's BBQ and Farm Grill, I'd drive the extra miles for Farm Grill.
