But I won't take my chances.

It really depend who's the server, and who's the chef.

Avoid the fat grumpy mean looking woman server with the broad face.
(brunette, pink-ish skin tone, very shaped eyebrows that look angry)
Holy *** the fat mean looking waitress with the blocky eyebrows will eat you alive, regurgitate, and chew you up and then spit you out.

Stay away.
She's brash, unattentive, and discriminates against certain customers.
She was continuously kissing @$$ to the customers next to us but treating my group of four with disrespect and contempt.
I doesn't feel great to be discriminated against.
As a customer, we're all spending money there, and I think we deserve the service we pay for.

~*~* aside from that one waitress... *~*~*
the other servers seem fine.
The greeters are friendly.

Food is either hit or miss.
50/50 chance of getting excellent food vs. bland food.
Over the years, the quality went down.

I really wouldn't risk it and rather go to the Chandler location if I could
