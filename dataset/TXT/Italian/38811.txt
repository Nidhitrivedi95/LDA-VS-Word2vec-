7CPGGNwHibzQtnERq7u2Hw Great Italian meal. Lovely atmosphere. It makes you feel like you are in the heart of Little italy somewhere. The service was great. Thought it was slightly odd that you walk through the kitchen to get to your seat, but acutally a great idea. I just was not expecting to see the kitchen. The House Chianti could have been better as well. All in all a great place for some comfort food. The fettucine alfredo is amazing.
