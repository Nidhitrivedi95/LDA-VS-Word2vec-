1WBVqmo7tgF0z0eGf4fPhQ Friends of my wife told us of this place so we decided to give it a try. When we got there it was not crowded so we grabbed a table. Looked at the menu and knew what we wanted. So we waited for someone to take our order. About a 10 to 15 minute wait. My wife said if no one comes in a few minutes we would leave. Finally the waitress came over and took our order. Two waters and two drinks. She left and came back with some bread ( three slices for two people ! ) it was not crisp but very soggy. She came back with the waters and one drink and had to go back for the other. While we were waiting for our food we watched what was going on. The waitress messed up the order on the table next to us, and the other person working there came over to our table with someone else's order. This happened a few more times with others orders. It was like they could not remember who got what. Got our food finally, wife got the  Bigoli noodles with meat sauce which she said noodles were a little chewy and sauce not tasty. I got the regular noodles with meat sauce and meat balls, noodles a little chewy and sauce seemed ok but different then the meat sauce my wife got. Meatballs were small and not very tasty. Food was not very hot when served to us.
So we tried it and will not got back because of service, taste and price. All items are al carte which adds up. 
We will stick going to Mezzo Bistro which is about same price or cheaper and the meatballs are the size of a baseball and has good service and larger tables.
