JjkwArNO6OnCkwBemZzyNA We finally got a chance to try this place and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised.  Despite several reviewers noting bad or slow service, we had very good service.  The server may have been new to the restaurant world because oddly, she asked what kind of dressing I wanted on my Caesar salad. Funny, I thought. 

I had the Chicken Favorita with a Caesar salad and a side of spaghetti.  All of which I found to be fresh and delicious. Portion sizes were quite generous.
