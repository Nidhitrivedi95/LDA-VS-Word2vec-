G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Oh Ms. Chef Giada, how I love the location you have picked for your fantastic restaurant. The gorgeous view that Las Vegas provides is key to having a delicious dinner with a love one! 
The minute you enter to the entrance of Giada resturant you are immediately greeted by a photographer that wants to snap some shot next to the icon signature of the restaurant. I guess the photo booth is no longer there (based on previous Yelp reviews). 

You go up an escalator and ARE NOT immediately greeted by the 5 young women standing around gossiping about what they did the night before. WHY, does it take 5 young women to even check you in?? Giada, please look into this because i'm sure you overhead expenses can be spent else where. 

After hearing the gossip of the 5 young women standing around, one of the woman noticed us standing there and asked if we had reservations, yes we did. 

We were asked to take a seat at the bar since our table was being set up. After a couple of minutes we were seated with a breathtaking view of the Bellagio dancing fountains. We were immediately greeted by our waitress, who was a great joy! In which I forgot about the 5 young women gossiping in front of the check in desk.  

The menu was descriptive and sounded delicious! I would recommend the Surf and Turf which was outstanding! Also, Giada signature cocktail was something I would order again and again, until I'm Vegas ready!
