4sPSNBZo2sLxEGDvUHGdbg Last minute decision to find this restaurant - we had been told they opened near Vaughan mills. Place is fun decor a good mix of classic and trendy . Food was excellent - pasta with rabbit very good . Pizza with prosciutto and honey delicious . We had some dietary issues and server Susannah very accommodating .  Highly recommend this spot - but please put biscotti on the menu !   Cheri
