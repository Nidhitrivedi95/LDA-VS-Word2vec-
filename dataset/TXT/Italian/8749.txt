0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ Novecento was recommended by a friend and to be honest, it is the closest to Italy pizza that I've had in Las Vegas. (Yes, I spent some years living in Italy and can speak to its pizza.) On my first visit, I think that I offended the pizza maker by saying, "Oh, it's like SUbway, but not." Really, it is the same concept, you pick your crust, add your toppings and they cook the pizza in 90 seconds. I am a BIG fan of the white pizza and margarita. 

I gave it four stars beacuse it is very self-serve, but that also saves you from potential bad service. I've always been satisfied with the service. I did order a glass of white wine once and it was awful. I am not sure if it was old, or what kind of white it was, but it was almost undrinkable.
