NVC1MFGTobWxYcuo_z7BGQ Was on "vacation" in Cleveland less than a month ago. Ordered the lobster ravioli, did not taste one bite of lobster. The calamari sauce was rather salty and over powering. Not the best Italian I was expecting. Staff was good though but not enough help for a busy night. Free dessert compliments of the chef was nice.
