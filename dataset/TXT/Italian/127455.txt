The menu changes with the seasons and includes a good range of dishes including traditional pastas and pizzas as well as meat and fish dishes, with a good range for vegetarians too. The restaurant is rather open plan and, if sitting downstairs, you can see the chefs hard at work with their huge pizza oven. The staff are friendly but the restaurant can lack atmosphere if there aren't too many diners. When it's busy the service can be slow, but this is perhaps only to be expected. Worth a visit for a tasty and reasonably priced Italian lunch or dinner if in the area.
