icFXoKY9_U15RxkNbyroPQ I use to go here all the time when I worked nearby.  Their Penne A La Vodka, Penne with grilled veggies are amazing.  The family owned restaurant gives you that personal welcome.  The chef always going out of his way to personalize my order.  

You cant go wrong with anything you order.

Also tried thier pizzas, shrimps, garlic bread, soup and chicken parmesian.
