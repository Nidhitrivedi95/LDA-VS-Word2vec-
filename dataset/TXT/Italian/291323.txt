I think when you go to a restaurant it should be food that's more elevated than what you could make at home. And it wasn't. The spaghetti sauce on my sons dinner tasted like it was out of a can. My husbands sandwich was so bland that panera would have been a better choice. I hope the owners look at the menu and try to make their dishes more interesting bc if not I don't see them being in business for very long.
