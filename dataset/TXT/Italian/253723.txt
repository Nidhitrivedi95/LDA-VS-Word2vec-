VtiHtLI2t0OjFjbrnR70lw Came here hungry. Left angry and unsatisfied.

I have been wanting to try this restaurant for the longest time ever since it opened a while ago. After all, it is helmed by a very well-known international celebrity chef inside one of Canada's greatest shopping malls: Square One Shopping Centre.

There are regular and high tables lined up along the railing of the restaurant looking in. After you walk past the wall, is a very large, open-concept dining area. You will be very impressed with the industrial décor of red and silver stainless steel lamps and exhaust ventilation that discreetly covers the high ceilings.  The long rows of banquette style seating make for enough patrons to dine with or without reservations. Walk around and watch staff working hard to prep appetizers and main courses on either side of restaurant is always great entertainment.

The Service
It wasn't very busy at all so I would have expected our dining experience to move along quickly. My wife and I were seated next to a wall at a very small table for two so I'm assuming the servers thought that we didn't need to be served. It took 1.5 hrs from the time were seated to the time it took to pay our bill. And all we had was a pizza and pasta to share.

The Food
Margherita Pizza ($14.95) Greasy. Can you see the shine and glossiness in my photo? When you lift up a slice, it goes limp. Probably the grease is weighing it down.
Famous Prawn Linguine ($20.95) Bland pasta. Even when we tried to add parmesan for more flavour to the small batch, it was beyond repair. Two prawns to share for $20.95. That was it. Two prawns. My battery died at this point. Sorry folks no more photos.

Stuck with the bill: Over $40.00
No wonder Gordon Ramsay thinks Jamie's cooking is a joke.
