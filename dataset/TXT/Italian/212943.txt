r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA Some days are just golden. Everything turns out perfectly.  Usually those days dont include touring a new city, getting lost, and then randomly seeing an italian deli and saying "oh, im hungry i'll just get a sandwich from there."  I didn't expect to get what I did.  I mean common, how many times do the food gods put you in the most amazing hole in the wall you ever discovered? 

Thats defalcos. Out of a dream (and literally, too. one of the workers there is a cuuuutttieee! Hey yelp, how about YELPDating.. For the Foodies in your heart).   

Listen, I lived in NYC for a good amount of time and the food can compare to little italy. 

Just go. Trust me.
