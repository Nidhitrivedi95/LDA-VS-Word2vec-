G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I was not overly impressed with Giada for lunch. I had the minestrone soup and lemon pesto grilled cheese sandwich with prosciutto. My boyfriend had the orzo meatballs and lasagna. Unfortunately, the minestrone soup was bland. I do not like to over salt my food, I grew up in a house with limited salt because my parents had high blood pressure, but the soup needed some salt and could have benefited from other spices as well. The first few bites of the lemon pesto grilled cheese sandwich were fairly bland. The prosciutto in the lemon pesto grilled cheese sandwich made the dish palatable. 

The best dish of the day for us were the orzo meatballs. 

Our hostess kept us waiting as she seated several people who arrived after us. Unknown to us, she was waiting for an opening on the terrace that has a view of the Bellagio fountains. Nice touch. However, I don't think the wait is worth it during the day because the fountains weren't running during our stay and we had to deal with sunlight in our faces. The shades went up and down several times during our meal, it seemed like the people on the terrace wanted the shades down while others in the restaurant wanted the shades up to see the view.
