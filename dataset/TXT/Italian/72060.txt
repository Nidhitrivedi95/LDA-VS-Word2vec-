CbI4IFtWCNm4rLvWr0veEw This is a nice little restaurant in Middleton. Since I was by myself I was seated at the bar; the bartender was cool, while it was slow he chatted with me and made my experience better.

For dinner I had the Mushroom Ravioli. This was good, not the best I had ever had but something I would get again. I didn't get a pizza since there was just me, but they looked good.

Overall, a nice spot to go to for a relaxed yet nice meal, but I would say make a reservation or get there early because they seem to fill up fast.
