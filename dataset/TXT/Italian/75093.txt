CrIWqmuO2uQWwl3z11K_BA I absolutely love this place.  They are pricey, but when the price is worth it, I will recommend it highly. I had a large gathering of twelve people and seven pizzas covered it perfectly.  They came out in waves, and people got to try different flavors.  

The idea is to have an Italian and locally sourced pizza that is delicious and wood-fired.  It is not your usual fare in the CU area, which thrills me.  

The owner appreciates the work in putting quality  food forth as well as the care for his customers AND employees.  Try to tip and you will find out how he cares for his employees.  He fully appreciated the small-town feel of CU and I hope that we show this place the same care.  

If you frequent Quality, they deliver there...but because of the way the pizza is made, yes...you will not want it delivered.
