w2b0ve7xpuCQkwYICFIUOg I loved the squid ink pasta with the saffron cream sauce! The pasta was so fresh. It is a cute little place and it's awesome when you check in there they give you a pound of fresh pasta. It seemed like a lot of customers were regulars there because the waitresses knew them by name.
