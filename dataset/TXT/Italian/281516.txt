YV2UPfovJZVKSEQjgTdbpA Perfect dinner for four business colleagues. 
We were attracted by food reviews and now we have one of our own. Very authentic and your sever was friendly, attentive, respectful to our business conversation and her menu suggestions were the best. We had fun and spent 3 great hours there. BTW, your zucchini appetizer was best I ever had. If you want good food, Mario's will not disappoint.
