MtvN8vMiKcLkkz_tCvBx3g In town for the Game of Thrones Live? The only logical place to eat before the show is Aria. 

But really, we obviously hit a local favorite. My date and I went in on a Thursday evening around 6 o'clock. The place wasn't packed, but all of the tables were reserved and the wait time was about an hour. Not enough time for that. The hostess informed us the bar was open seating so we jumped in while we could. 

The bar Staff was attentive, even though we only had one glass of wine between the two of us. Within 10 minutes of us sitting down, the place was FILLED. There were customers standing to eat, in the waiting area, all tables were full, etc. We arrived at the perfect time. 

We skipped on the appetizers since we saw some delicious sounding deserts. She ordered the salmon and I ordered the Kale salad and butternut squash Ravioli. 
The Salad was great, it was a lot bigger than I was expecting and was dressed really well.
 
Our entrées tasted really great too. The portions were pretty small though. My ravioli came with 7 or 8 pieces. The taste almost made up for it, it literally tasted like a holiday meal all in one plate. 

Her salmon was about half the size of most places, but she really enjoyed it. 

After our entrées we had to try the Tiramisu. It was pretty awesome. You could tell it was homemade. Thick mascapone with a heavy espresso kick with the lady fingers. Again, the serving size was really small, it's hard to get the full experience of the deserts if you are sharing them.

Overall, Arial was a good experience. The Staff was great, bathrooms were clean, and the food tasted good.

The negatives: To appear as a romantic restaurant, it gets really loud, even away from the bar area. The food portions are really small for the high prices.

For a salad, two entrées, desert, and a glass of wine I paid $73 after tip. Would I visit again? Maybe if I am in  Charlotte with a larger budget.
