qkDlRkNfrXE_4t2vMrTo0A Had two "pasta" dishes last night.  Shrimp pasta and cannoli.  After two full portions of the shrimp i found one tiny almost canned shrimp in the two gluey and disgusting servings,  The cannoli tasted like the inside of a bad Mexican burrito and the cheese seemed like it came out of a giant tube of Acme cheese product.  This is surpassed by any third grade cafeteria school "Italian" day.  Revolting.  How do they stay in business?!
