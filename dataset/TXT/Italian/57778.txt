aNYunG3j5zNJ4F0dQcZMyQ Having lived in the Valley for 15 years, we finally made it to Tomaso's, a restaurant I have heard about for years. It was not a special night, just a Saturday date night with my husband. We walked in at 7:30 pm with no reservation. That should have been a sign that we shouldn't eat here.

The food was way over priced, especially for what it was. I had the spaghetti cacio y Pepe and my husband had lemon shrimp. His was delicious, but mine tasted very basic. (Yes, it is an easy dish, but I have had carefully crafted ones at other restaurants and been blown away). 

The wine poor was generous. We went with the recommendations of the waiter, but was disappointed when he tried to pass off a stale glass of wine. When I asked him how long the bottle had been open, he made a scene to send over the bartender, tell me it was not stale and pour a new glass 'from the same bottle'... It was a completely different wine they poured us the second time. Tired, I didn't want to make a scene, we accepted it and let it sit on the table.

By the end, we just wanted to leave and our waiter was slow to bring the check. Other tables that he was serving were all eyeing one another as well, looking for sympathy.

It was a sad way to spend $100, I wish we would have gone to North or Hillstone, where the food is always good.
