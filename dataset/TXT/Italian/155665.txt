L2VXZ7_Ohzp7pr1otj7WoQ Coco is an excellent choice for a reasonably priced lunch.  I have never been there for dinner, as it feels more like a lunch kind of place.  But, I would go if I had a taste for pizza or pasta and did not want to spend a fortune. 

A sister restaurant of its more expensive neighbor, Luce, Coco has a wide variety of salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and pastas on their menu.  I am NOT a sandwich fan, but I absolutely love theirs - especially the capri (mozzarella, prosciutto and basil) and piadina (turkey, bacon, avocados, asiago) paninis!  

Service is fast and very efficient.  They need to be to move people through quickly, since the restaurant itself is very small!  I love their quick service because I'm almost guaranteed to be done within the hour (if I don't have to wait).  

All in all, Coco is a great place that I return to often for lunch.  I highly recommend them!
