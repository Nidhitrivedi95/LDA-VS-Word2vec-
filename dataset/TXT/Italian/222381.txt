I've noticed that they also treat young customers very poorly as if they do not want them in their restaurant. I'm 20 and went in with a small group of friends, was not helped after 15 minutes and had about 4 servers make eye contact with me and not respond when I tried to call them over. We walked out after not being helped after about 17 minutes and received some nice glares from the staff upon leaving, not one asked if there was a problem or said anything. I will not be going back.
