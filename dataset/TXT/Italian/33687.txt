60uVlCUiLJvq3xNo_3bhQQ I can't tell you how hard it is to find "New York" pizza that actually lives up to its name, and Carmine's has hit the mark! Excellent pizza that snaps when you fold it, great cheese and crust. The service was friendly,  bathrooms clean, dining area charming...definitely returning!
