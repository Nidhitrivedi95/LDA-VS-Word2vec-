Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw We found this place while wandering around the mess that they have turned the Venetian's Canal Shoppes into. We got here around 10pm. The bread was fresh, moist and delicious. We ordered the cheese ravioli which to me was reminiscent of butternut squash ravioli - It was delicious!! We also ordered the fruit crepe. The crepe itself wasn't the best, but they did customize it for us which they didn't have to. We were over all very pleased with out choice to eat here, and we had great service. Our water was always full, and they delivered the food as ordered.
