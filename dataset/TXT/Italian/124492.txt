Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ We have been here on two occasions, and if it were a little bit of a jaunt from our house - we would be here every week! The first visit we tried the Vegas Meets Italy, which was fantastic! Smoked provolone, pistachios, ricotta, prosciutto, date cream sauce - delicious! We also got the to-die-for garlic rosemary knots, and I got a salad with their delicious mascarpone ranch dressing. 

Most recently we couldn't decide what to order, (besides the garlic rosemary knots) and the gentleman taking orders suggested the Pork Reigns. I was hesitant, as it had salami and pork jowl, two things I have convinced myself I would hate. He assured me that it was delicious, his favorite, and that pork jowl wasn't where I thought it was located - it's a cut from the neck and shoulder, not what I refer to as my pork jowls when I grab my double chin. 

I am so glad I listened to him because the Pork Reigns certainly reigned supreme on our pallets!! The crust is perfectly chewy without being tough, and despite a plethora of pork bounty and cheese, the pizza was not the least big greasy. 


Our only dilemma here is what to order next time, and who gets the roasted cloves of garlic from the garlic knots?!
