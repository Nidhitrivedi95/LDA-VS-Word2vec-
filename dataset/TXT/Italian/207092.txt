qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA thankfully we had a brunch run with reserved seating, because this place was buuuusy! 

i had the farm house scramble. rarely does a scramble impress me, but the caramelized onions and roasted potatoes and Gruyere cheese holding it all together was divine. the small side salad of mixed summer greens was a nice flavor. it wasn't very big for 9 bucks. i could've eaten 2 portions (which is why we stopped by a taco shop on the way home). the brunch mimosa's were 5 bucks, and seemed heavier on the orange juice than the champagne. the bellinis are also 5 bucks and too sweet for me. 

i've never been to a postino's before but i was impressed with the farm scramble and the excellent service.
