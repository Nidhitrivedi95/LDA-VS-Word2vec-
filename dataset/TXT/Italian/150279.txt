KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ Italian place at Caesars which I would certainly recommend to others. Had a reservation for 3 for around 6:30pm on 2/12/13. I ordered the Chicken Scarpariello, and had the meatballs as well. Raos probably made the best meatballs I ever had, even though they were a bit on the pricy side for only two meatballs. The meatballs were pretty big, and very rich in flavor as well as very moist. The Chicken Scarpariello was on the bone, so I'm not the biggest fan, but very juicy and moist as well. Also had a bit of my friends pasta, which was cooked perfectly al-dente. Certainly a good experience to try something a bit different than Chicken Parmesan all the time.


PROS
*Service - Our waiter was fantastic, and very knowledgeable about everything in Las Vegas and was even telling us about how he used to be a professional poker player. Very casual dining experience and good pacing for bringing out our food.

*Atmosphere - Really cool place facing out to the pool. Our waiter told us that their was some sort of modeling event going on during that week, so you can get a great view if you come out during the day most likely. 

CONS
*Food Options - I didn't want my chicken on the bone, but that was the only option we had. Couldn't get grilled chicken added to a pasta or onto a salad, so that was a bit disappointing. Not to say the food was bad, because it wasn't, it's just that I wish Rao's could have had some more choices to eat from.
