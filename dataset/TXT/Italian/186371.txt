OpNrObgtHgYijZYOU0yF-Q My friend and I cruised in here after a long flight. It was about 11pm and the place was crowded. There were some specials going on. We got drinks, salads, garlic bread, and super delicious meals that included spaghetti. I was so happy we chose this place. It was great on the service, the food, and the atmosphere. I would come here again.
