GxbUl5s9IOS01-bV0yT7qQ This was a first visit so I had my mind wide open.  The atmosphere was great, comfortable, and no wait.  The server was attentive.  Now onto the food.  I had a salmon and crab cake that was tasty, but you only get two, so a little pricey at $10.  I then had the shrimp grits.  I eat this dish every where I go so I've had all types, some bad and some good.  The very best I've had was at Roosters near Southpark.  This one was number two and very good with nice plump shrimp, sausage and a creamy corn sauce.  It could use a little more heat, but overall very good.  A little pricey though.  No dessert tonight, maybe next time.  My wife tried a trout dish that she said was possibly the best fish dish she had ever had.  That says a lot because she eats fish about every day.  This place is very good, but damn, a meal for two, appetizer, entrees, no dessert, three glasses of wine, tip, cost $100!  The whole time I kept trying to convince myself I was in Belmont or Charlotte, not Gastonia.  To be fair, they pulled it off well.  I'll be back.  PS. Get rid of the paper tablecloth covers.  I don't want to spend $100 on a meal and eat on a paper tablecloth.
