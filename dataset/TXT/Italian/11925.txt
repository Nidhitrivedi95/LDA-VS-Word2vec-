0u47y3RqsQ_UpTSJGEpGrw I am with the few people that seem to dislike the Olive Press, the food is at best mediocre and in general poor, to me the food is the level of Italian that you would get when dining at someone's house rather than authentic Italian.

The location is 2 mins from where I live and I waited eagerly for it open a few years ago after a year or so of watching the place be built and have tried the place 8 or 9 times since...and it is consistently poor in both food and service.

The staff are generally friendly but there seems to be no proper organisation or training and so the service is on the whole slow and frustrating, on most occasions that I have been people who came in after me were served before.

I sit in the bar as the restaurant is simply so full of children that it makes McDonalds seem like a pensioners paradise but I have felt more personal service at the Tim Hortons at the airport, the bar is simply a transit area to the restaurant with people standing around waiting.

We still go when we can't be bothered cooking and usually if it's weeknight but the food and service are always the same...busy or not so at least it's consistent but if you are expecting a good night out with home cooked Italian food you will be disappointed.

Unless you have a rabble of kids, like a mountain of stodgy food on your plate and don't want to talk to the people your dining with, due to the noise then this isn't the place for you but it is cheap...I am always pleasantly surprised at how low the bill is when it comes.

But at weekends it is consistently busy with the huge car park full and cars lined down the road so there are a lot of people out there who will obviously disagree with me and think the place is great so i don't complain when I go as I don't think they will change.
