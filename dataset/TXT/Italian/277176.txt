yhT2iTPtvQttZxYS9cNF0A CLASS. ACTS. The people who work here are AWESOME. 

Just called in a takeout order that I needed to pay for over the phone (weird) and then called back to make it delivery... to another restaurant (double weird). They were 100% cool as ***k about it!!

Little did they know I'm trying to feed a friend who hasn't been able to afford to eat lately, and I had just called the Pizza hut down the road to try to do the same thing and they were HELLA RUDE to me about it. What a relief to then have the exact opposite experience when I called these classy classy pizza folks.  

LOVE YOU FRANKS. You made my night and reminded me how awesome real Pittsburghers are.
