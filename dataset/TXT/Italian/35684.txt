6okGKL2PA7kkc-GjZzNHnA I had asked a co-worker for a good steakhouse in the area and Johnny's was suggested highly.

Well, I was sorely disappointed with the food. The service was okay.
The drunkin steak was over cooked(asked for med-rare, got medium). The broccoli was slightly mushy. The best thing about the plate was the garlic sauce under the steak and it made the steak edible.

I will not suggest Johnny's to anyone.
