KuxDPl6UYNLxFChPm0_MNw Man, I was sort of disappointed.
Places like this are very hit or miss. Sure, the food may look good, but the flavour is always off.
Prices are pretty high and the wait time was long. Also, for a restaurant, they sure picked some kietche-ass decor. Doesn't blend with the overall feel of this place. Not only that but their specials are also expensive. Doesn't that defeat the purpose?
I don't think I want to go here again..
