Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw We came all the way from Phx, and it was worth it. We took home some thin cheese and parsley sausage which tasted just like home (LI). After we order like pigs and the food was served the own came over to se how everything was, simple perfect. Now I find out the he was the owner of the A&S pork store in Franklin Sq, I ate his sausage my whole life. We loved it and will be back again "just for the yoohoo"
