juu7S1nP5eirbeJ8-rfguw The place is beautiful, really well done decor, very nice and bright. The menu is good, not too big, but also not too small. 

The food is not out of this world, omg delicious, but it certainly is not bad. Had the mozerella fried ravioli and the lobster ravioli...clearly coz I love the ravioli. The appetizer was nothing real great, just about what you would think, no distinct reason to order it the next time. The lobster ravioli was good, the sauce it came in was delicate. But again nothing to write home about.

There was certainly nothing bad about the place, but nothing super awesome either apart from the decor
