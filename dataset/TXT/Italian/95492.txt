epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ My father and I got into Cleveland a day early for the Browns game and found a great place to eat at called Mia Bella. The service was excellent. We always had food being brought to us, our drinks were never empty, and the menu incite from our server was very helpful. I tried the Veal Braciole and thought it was pretty good. My father ordered the Mia Bella Especiale and he absolutely loved it. For desert, we had the Salted Caramel desert and the Raspberry desert. Both were excellent. The venue was charming and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience.
