First I wanna say I love the vibe, it's clean and dimly lit but with this hip kinda feel. Came in and the server was super friendly gave us a lot of info on the menu. The place has different kind of beers from different places, the server knew a lot about each beer so he was able to help us all pick out something different for us to try. Then the pizza, you can have a whole pizza or just some slices for a great price. I had the green ,which comes with the daily green veggie for the day, and the white, which is a cheese pizza but with a variety of cheeses. The pizzas came out in a timely manner and man were they fantastic. I'd for sure come back again.
