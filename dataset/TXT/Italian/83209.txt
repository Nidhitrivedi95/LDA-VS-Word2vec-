DhRJJ5aUUuBp3XR1JbLeuw I've been a long time frequenter of Sauce.  Two words: caprese bruschetta.  Oh my, divine.  I also love the chicken Caesar salad pizza.  This past week my son and I stopped in for a quick to go order and their pizza oven was down.  I was devastated and as luck would have it a Monsoon storm hit as we were ready to leave, so we waited it out.  While waiting the oven was fixed and the owner treated me to a pizza on the house.  It was a very serendipitous day indeed. I received both rain and pizza in one perfect afternoon.
