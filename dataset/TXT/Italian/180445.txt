nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A My wife and I wanted to see if Buddy V's cooking lived up to its hype, so instead of taking a trip to Jersey, we decided to stop in to his Vegas location. We went on a Sunday morning (the morning of the Route 91) massacre.  

We ordered the brunch buffet (about $35 per person, all you can eat, including pastries), which gave us a large variety of meats, salads, veggies, appetizers, pastas, soups, and of course, pastries. I can't say that this was the best Italian food I've ever had, nor can I say the pastries were phenomenal, but everything was authentic and tasted good. The meatballs definitely lived up to the hyped up reviews. I even enjoyed the "peel your own" shrimp. 

Price was decent, considering it was owned by the world famous Buddy V. There was also a live band that played in the bar area, creating a really nice atmosphere.
