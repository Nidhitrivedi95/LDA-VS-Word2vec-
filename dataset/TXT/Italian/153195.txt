KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg We had supper at Pizzeria Libretto Friday night.  We've heard excellent things about it and have been wanting to go ... hard to believe it's been five years since they been in our 'hood and we've never been!

It was busy when we got there and stayed that way all night.  There was a good vibe.

Pizzas bake in less than 90 seconds in a 900 degree wood burning oven, hand built by a third generation pizza oven maker in Naples

Shannon, our server, started us off with some bread and oil and it was delicious.

We shared a bottle of bubbly ... Sussura (VQA) by Hinterland, Prince Edward County, which is bottled exclusively for Pizzeria Libretto.  

Our friend, Steve, is a chef and took care of ordering appetizers ... plus he and Simone had been there before.

We also shared a bottle of red wine ... Nero D'avola 2012 IGT, Matto, Sicilia

We all ordered pizza.   I ordered a Nduja Sausage pizza with tomato, garlic, oregano, basil, mozzarella and stracciatell.  It was delicious and had a bit of a kick.  So much food and I took half my pizza home

Simone and Steve split an Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula pizza with garlic, tomato, oregano and shaved Grana Padano.

Gord had the feature pizza with mozzarella, truffle paste, mushrooms and berkshire ham.  He said it was fabulous.

We got dessert.  None of us had room for it but we managed to eat it all!  Yum!!  The ice cream is made in-house and was so good!  The donuts were warm.

Shannon, our server, took excellent care of us.  Pizzeria Libretto is a great spot and I'm glad we finally got there ... and we'll be back!
