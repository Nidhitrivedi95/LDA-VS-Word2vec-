We tried Centurion for brunch. I like the cozy atmosphere and how the kitchen was in the same room as the dining area so you can see the chef making his magic.

I was kinda disappointed they didn't have bloody mary's but they did have mimosas. The mimosa had freshly squeezed OJ and was quite refreshing.

My husband had the chorizo skillet which he said was awesome. I had the veggie breakfast sliders. They were kind enough to use scrambled eggs instead of fried, since I don't care for whole yolks on anything. Every component of the breakfast sliders was delicious and expertly prepared. The scones were fluffy and freshly made. The hollondaise sauce, which I am normally very picky about, was perfect. The pesto was bursting with flavor. My only complaint is I wasn't crazy about the combination of all the components together. I didn't dislike it... it just tasted a little odd. And everything except the eggs were cold like they came straight out of the refrigerator. I wish they would have heated the rest of the ingredients up.

Service was friendly, helpful, and laid back.

We are definitely coming back. The chef is very talented and  we met a regular who told us about all the other delicious items on the menu.
