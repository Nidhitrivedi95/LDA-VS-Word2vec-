There is a whole group of diners that believes quantity trumps quality and this chain is custom designed for them. Food is served family style; small orders usually feed 2+ average people and large up to 4. Many people feel you are getting a great value here, but personally I see lots of very CHEAP pasta being served and you are paying through the nose for it.

The pizza's are thin crust and rectangular and did not look very appetizing due to the toppings being slung on it haphazardly and one side was a little burnt, a frozen Frescheta is better than what we were served. The chicken carbonara is nothing like a regular Carbonara, it is served with Alfredo sauce instead the egg thickened cream sauce. 

I can go on and on, a lot of the entrees are pasta, red sauce and cheese, pretty common American Italian fare, nothing exciting. Now was the food inedible or bad - NO, but to be honest The Olive Garden which would get three stars if I ever choose to review it. Quite frankly Olive Garden, has better and more authentic (hard to believe but it's true) food.

Like I said earlier I can see this as a popular place with a certain crowd of diners, it serves it purpose and will continue to be successful, to be absolutely honest, I wanted to like it more than I did. It was a fun atmosphere and I like the concept, but I would much rather pay $14 for an entrée, finish it all and be wowed, than pay $16 for a mediocre pile of food and have mediocre leftovers for the next 2 days.
