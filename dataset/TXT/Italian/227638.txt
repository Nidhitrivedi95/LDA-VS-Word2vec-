stNlfaeBITkyGmHn8oRwvg Pizza took two hours to deliver. Ordered the 18" pizza with pepperoni and pineapple. $13.99 for pizza + $2 per topping, so $17.99. Also ordered onion rings for $4.99. The delivery charge was $3.00. Total was $27 and some change. The lady on the phone said the delivery man had a card reader, but did not mention the $2.50 fee to use it. 
Around an hour and a half later, I knew the pizza was going to be cold, so I was going to refuse the order, which put me and my girlfriend into a nasty fight about me always having to be a dick.... Either way i didn't want to continue the fight and the pizza actually came in two hours. The driver informed me of the $2.50 charge to use my visa so I just paid cash. I only had $35 and he didn't have change as I wanted to give a $5 tip because I'm NOT A DICK. I sat down to eat after he left. Pizza was cold as anticipated, but I did not anticipate that there would only be 7 pineapples and 12 pepperoni's. Also didn't anticipate that the $4.99 onion rings weren't there but were scandalously replaced with cold $2.99 French fries. I called and the lady who answered, Lisa I believe, said the driver was headed back with the rings. He never came... Also they then stopped answering calls from me.... Caller id I guess... I was robbed by this company and I believe that they should be brought up on criminal charges. Good luck everyone!!! I should have checked the Google and Yelp reviews before ordering.
