PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA We had been looking forward to visiting this place for weeks. We decided the Happy Hour menu looked more interesting than the lunch. Boy were we wrong. First of all their concept of HH is wrong. Charging a dollar or 2 less than the same dinner item is not a Happy Hour. Nor is charging $2 less for an inferior wine that doesn't even appear on the regular wine list! Thats just robbery.
When the waiter came over I pointed to 2 wines on the list and asked what they were...'wine' he said. i should have got up and left right then! 
And the food...as disappointing as the service. We ordered the Mussels in a savory tomato sauce. Half the Mussels were 'off' and the bread was a soggy, greasy fried lump. Where is a nice chunk of fresh italian artisan bread? Next was the $11 ribs. Obviously heated up from the night before they were tasteless, dry and overcooked. The coleslaw accompaniment however was simply heavenly.
The Bruschetta was not toasted but  'fried' on the griddle so the taste of the old grease permeated the bread. It was also burnt on the bottom.
I tried the fried pigs ears. Sounded interesting. But again, everything was covered in a greasy film of old, stale grease. Now I know a dish of FRIED pigs ears, and FRIED kale and FRIED egg has to be fried. But a good chef should be able to lightly fry a dish like that so the flavors shine....not drown in a sea of oil.
The only saving grace? After complaining to the waiter he did deduct 2 dishes from our bill.
Not somewhere i am in a hurry to visit again....there are way too many better options in town.
