J1qzIVBt3lGpiz-8UdjhXg Went to a movie nearby and stopped in here for a late supper.  Very glad we did.  Had been to other franchises in other places, but most of the ones we had been to have closed.  Our server Nathan was very attentive without being bothersome, even though we may have been his only table at this late hour.  We had the meals which included salads, and my wife had her usual ranch dressing and I had my usual honey mustard.  Salads were crunchy and fresh and we did not feel that they had been sitting for awhile and were fresh.  My wife had the angel hair pomodoro and loved it.  I was fairly hungry so I went for the meat lover's sauce over angel hair pasta.  Tasty and rich sauce.  We both had Widmer Hefeweizens to accompany our meals, and topped it off with complimentary spumoni  at the end.  A very pleasant and intimate late night treat!
