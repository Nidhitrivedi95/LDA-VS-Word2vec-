kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg I read the reviews and I knew what to expect. But I really did have high hopes for this place. I loved the feel of the place. It was a romantic setting. 

To start, there was a hour and half wait. Which really wasn't all that bad because you're in a mall! so actually went down to the Crave and had a few drinks at the bar. When we came back it was basically time to be seated. 

Took about 15 minutes just to get water. Once the waiter came we ordered right away because we were almost sure the food was going to take forever. It actually didn't. Food came out a reasonable amount of time. The thing that didn't was my friends cocktail she ordered. After 30 minutes in they finally told her they didn't have that particular drink. Then she wanted a beer which came AFTER we were already done with our food. 

I ordered the Filet Oscar. Got my meat medium rare. Nope, that was as well done as can be! The meat was sitting on mashed potatoes with crab on top of the meat, topped with asparagus which everything was swimming in a sauce. honestly, the whole dish was nothing special. For $38 I really hoped it would be Amazing. My dish came out with a Caesar salad which also was bland. I know it's just a salad but there was basically no dressing. 

The beau got the seared ahi tuna which he clearly enjoyed and devoured. And the dish looked real pretty! 

I probably will not come back to this location. I would probably try the other location because they have the wine flights over there but not at this one.
