The restaurant is pretty good. Nice atmosphere, if you sit outside or at least close to it, you have a really good view of the show that plays in front of Treasure Island. The food is good -the bread with the marinara dipping sauce is really great -and the price is a little pricey but actually not bad at all compared to other restaurants in Vegas. 

The nightclub is alright, its a bit small, and nothing really stands out about it. Girls drink free before a certain time and it can get pretty packed. Jamie Fox made an appearance one night I was here.
