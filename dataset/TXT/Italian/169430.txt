The decor is "homey" and cool. It does get noisy but totally tolerable. Seatings are spacious and comfortable, not to mention clean. Lighting is sufficient, always kept at a comfortable level.
I know plenty of people have mentioned it, but I can't not talk about their mozzarella. They are FRESHLY made IN HOUSE. They are made by their own chef, and you cannot go wrong with FRESH. Their pizzas are made to order from scratch, much like their pasta. Places that taste this good usually charge you both your arms and legs and then some.
It is definitely a place to go whether it is a party of two or a party of 10. Their servers will always make sure you have a good time with a very nice meal.
