XdcRr8R5H8psvf-QxtuLMg I previously compared Barros to Le Grand Orange and Pizzaria Bianco. I was wrong. Barros isn't even in the same league or even ballpark as LGO, Bianco or even Cibo!! 

Like I said though, I like Barros. It's a great everyday pizza. Kinda like a nice middle of the road bottle of wine. But LGO and Cibo are hand-tossed, fire-oven baked, thin, crispy yet chewy NYC yumminess!  

Enjoy!
