9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw We had a party of 10 and sat on the patio next to another big party.  When we arrived we agreed to sit on the patio because the misters were on so it was nice.  Half way through the meal they turned off the misters and it became very hot.  We brought it up and were told it leaked by another table so they were staying off.  So instead of moving one table they sacrificed the comfort of 2 large parties.  

The pizza was good, unfortunately service ruined the experience.
