Xra1TtWtf069Am5hHWs3Ug The best way to describe Peppers is that it has a family atmosphere/feel to it. I say this for 2 reasons: 1.) it doesn't have much more seating then your grandparents dining room. I'd say it's maximum seating capacity is 30. 2.) the staff is extremely friendly. During my last visit one of my friends playfully flirted w/ our elderly server & she played along, it was quite entertaining. 

The selection & quality (which is obviously the most important part of this review) of the food is excellent. To be honest I've only ever had 2 dishes, the baked ziti & pizza. 

The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because of the extremely limited seating. The first time I dined there I came w/ 7 other people which I not recommend. Thankfully a kind party of 3 volunteered to move to a booth so that we could be accommodated. It's a perfect type of place to take a date due to it's quiet & intimate atmosphere.
