7NucoWCjPzZyRPjsVR28xQ Ugh... was last choice but the lines were ridiculous every where else I looked.  Also wasn't going to pay $22+ a plate for the fresh asian fast food place next to it without a line (wonder why LOL).  I should have just sucked it up and stood in the line at Witchcraft and gotten a good sandwich to eat.

Positives
Pizza is made fresh there.

Negatives
Food quality sucks.
Way to expensive for the quality.

I had very low expectations and even then they couldn't meet them, in fact I got sick off my one slice of pizza.  I dont need my quality pool/drinking time interrupted by bathroom trips thank you!  Also I expect pizza to be greasy but my slice was so greasy the toppings all slid off and several puddles of grease formed on my plate while I attempted to keep it all together.    

Never again!!
