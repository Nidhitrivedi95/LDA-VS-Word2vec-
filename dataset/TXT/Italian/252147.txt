VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w We danced awhile on a packed dance floor to the latest in hip hop and electronica but I did notice the restaurant area was strangely empty nevertheless my bacardi and coke was strong. Since my wife and I wanted to experience the Las Vegas club life this seemed like the perfect place oh we had free passes there was a phalanx of security at the front door and none of those absurd rules like having the right shoes or color of your clothing to get you in the club. We were impressed with the sound and lighting system that pulsated to the music. Overall the people working here were friendly and helpful especially our bartender who had the patience of a saint.
