TIYnquDIPdYmVJK4GNeXSQ If you find a server that cares... you can have a great time... if not... ugh!

Lunch served by Josh was a fast, funny, and he suggested a to go cup for my iced tea... he cared about what we didn't want in our salad and rattled off the soup options and descriptions with ease.

We haven't found a dinner server... from  Thanksgiving to New Years it's almost impossible to get a table anyway... with all the shopping in the area this seems to be one of the favorite places of grumpy shoppers.

The food quality has been going down hill... our last dinner I ordered shrimp alfredo and was horrified at the few popcorn shrimp that managed to make it into the bowl... we stick with the salad and soup now.
