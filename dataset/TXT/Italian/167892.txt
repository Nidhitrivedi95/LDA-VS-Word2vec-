mJ_ucQ2_3hfTsmCcKb-hgw Gnocchi was not good. It was too oily and there was barely any gnocchi on the plate - there was more mushrooms and bacon than gnocchi. Especially for the price it was not good at all! The flatbread was okay - I would rate it 3 stars. Service was good, though. Also, they did not have butter for bread. I didn't know a restaurant could not have butter.
