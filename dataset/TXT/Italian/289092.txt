Zt4ljpwfmBufatNM1zPNcQ Heehee, few things make me happier than good GF pizza! Diagnosed Celiac two years ago, and coming from an Italian family has made the transition difficult. This Picazzo's is great! Atmosphere is cozy, yet elegant. Sometimes the service is great, sometimes just good, depends on the day :). 

I love the garlic and brie appetizer. Salads are always fresh and full of flavor, (Southwestern is a favorite for me and my mama). The pizza is great. Not the best I've had (BJs still wins that contest), but absolutely wonderful non the less! The chocolate chip pizza cookie is insanely good, but definitely one of those things that make you feel guilty for eating.

This restaurant definitely has the most options for GF eaters than any other I've been to, and takes into account cross-contamination, which is HUGE. I would love to give this place 4.5 stars, because it really is awesome, just not my number one :). Hmmm, now I want pizza.
