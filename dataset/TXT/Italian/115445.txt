Grr2wJ3nYD_7qUyespDglA Not sure what the hype is for this place. Had a chicken parm sandwich and it was two paper thin slices of chewy fried chicken with a sauce I could barely taste. Most of the reviews mention the owner and the service as positives which I can corroborate as the food was prepared quickly and everyone was friendly; however being a nice guy doesn't make the food taste any better.
