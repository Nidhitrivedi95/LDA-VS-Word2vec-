CElwRv4CtK56NljAuCwepw Great food and friendly service, atmosphere lacks an Italian feel.  I went here on Sunday evening.  Its not a large restaurant, its clean and well lit.  First though walking in was though it was modern and minimalist.  Didn't speak Italian to me, so I figured would wait for the food.  Our first round of drinks was a little watered down, but didn't mention anything as my blue mojito seemed removed from the world of Italy.  When they brought the food, though it spoke wonderful Italian.  We had the aspargus with parmesan and mushrooms to start.  I am no fan of mushrooms, but these were great.  Buttery, not too chewy, and just right.  My ex and I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  Portions were just right and the sauce was perfect, not too thick and perfect in its tomatoess.  Food was brought out fairly quickly.  I look forward to coming again, my only impression leaving was with the interior, it felt kind of like the Pei Wei of Italian, just lacking the red trademark Pei Wei lighting.  Maybe they can substitute yello or blue and make it trade mark Babbo.
