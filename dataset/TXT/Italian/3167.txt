_4n7K_UdRSEMw4vJdsU9jQ My coworkers and I have been going to this Ray's for over two years now.  The food is always great, wings are crispy and awesome.  I really like the pizza, the dough is chewy, crust is crispy, and toppings are really fresh/tastey.  We go there so many times the lady behind the counter (she's always there) already knows what we're gonna order as we walk through the door.  The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is that the place can get really "mucky" feeling in the summer time, kinda like they're using a swamp cooler, makes it a little uncomfortable while dining in.  But none the less, we keep going back because of the food, service and location.
