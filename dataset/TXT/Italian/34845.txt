So on a summer Saturday night I pull into the packed complex where this restaurant is located and surprisingly Trattoria Nakamura-Ya is the only restaurant in here without a line out front, red flag much? Anyways, we proceed and are seated immediately, the service is stellar. We start with some Italian Spring Rolls and Bruschetta, the spring rolls were nothing special and there were only 4 of them! The bruschetta had several flavors, some of which were fabulous, others not so much.Then came the famous uni pasta and well, maybe I built it up too much because, well, it tasted like pasta, there was an extremely subtle hint of uni, not the flavor adventure I had hoped for. Then came the mussels, tasty, but not awesome. Finally the beef dishes arrived and I was really appreciative of the meat quality, both the carpaccio and the kobe had that melt-in-your-mouth texture that we all crave, but they also had that yucky sushi torch gun taste! You know what I'm talking about, that burn flavor that sushi chefs create using that little torch gun, eww, can't stand it. So anyways, I was hoping for a culinary experience and got more of a decent meal at a decent price, but nothing to write home about.
