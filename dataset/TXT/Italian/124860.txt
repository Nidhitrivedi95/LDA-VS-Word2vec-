Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ If you are looking for a great pizza off the beaten path, this is your spot.  They start with a great sourdough crust and elevate with bomb tangy tomatoes and have every combination available including homemade sausage and smoked BBQ.  What, BBQ at a legit Italian pizza spot?  YES!!!   Don't worry, the classics aren't missed with the Margarita and others.
