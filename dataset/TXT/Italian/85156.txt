Dnq4w6ajMifZFFTIR5cGxw hands down the best sausage ive ever had. it could have sat on the fresh toasty bread all by itself and it would still be a winner!

i got the barbariccia's salsiccia and my fiancee got the belly of the beast. both were amazing.

we also got the olives and slice of pepperoni pizza. 

you won't regret coming here. great food at very reasonable prices.
