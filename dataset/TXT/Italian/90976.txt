EDa7_YfEB2HDOyxDMbipQA Love this place, never have had a bad experience at the location even when it is super packed. Pizza is always on point and so are the wings- both boneless and bone-in. The salad bar is not anything special, but does the job when you feel the need for some veggies with your pizza. 

This is my first choice for pizza in Phoenix.
