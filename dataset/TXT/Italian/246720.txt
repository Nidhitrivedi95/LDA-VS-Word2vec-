v2xh5qtrlRJSU3OnixJH2g This place is AMAZING!! I literally live on the whole other side of town and am here a few times a week. The food is on point. Everything I have ordered is delish and I am a very picky eater! A big plus for me is how clean the kitchen and dining room always are especially when it comes to them cooking my food! My kids also love that you can see them make everything and they watch the whole time. I will def be back numerous times!
