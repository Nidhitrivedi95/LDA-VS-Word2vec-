0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg Scarpetta fits well in the sophisticated Cosmopolitan Hotel. Tucked away into a corner, this restaurant is unassuming at first approach. The lights are dim and there are curvy booths on the right side facing a long bar. The walkway is narrow but keep the eye on the prize at the end because that's where the true "meat" of the restaurant is. Tables and booths are snugly placed in a modern yet cozy dining area. For our group of 10, the broad shouldered guys probably felt a little too close for comfort to make room for all of us to fit, but it wasn't a problem for the girls. 

Last Saturday, we were in a mad rush to eat and run because we were trying to catch a 9:30pm showing of KA at MGM. Our dinner reservation was 7:30pm so we cut it close. We asked the waiter to divide our check between 5 couples and to make things worse, we did not sit next to our significant others. We brushed off the sommelier by accident because we wanted to find our waiter just to order right away. In spite of our group being a nightmare, they made our plans happen and with time to boot! The food was amazing, our checks were split perfectly, and the waiter even offered detailed directions how to get to our show quicker. 

The duck fois gras ravioli and the short rib agnolotti were the two dishes my husband and I shared. We loved these dishes. The guys in our group ordered steaks which were all well prepared and the girls ordered appetizers and a couple dishes to share but I think Bry and I were the happiest out of the group with our choices, which is surprising because I always choose steak over anything. 

Looking back, I feel bad that we put the staff in a position where everything needed to be rushed but overall, our entire group was impressed with the food and service. Thanks Scarpetta for that!
