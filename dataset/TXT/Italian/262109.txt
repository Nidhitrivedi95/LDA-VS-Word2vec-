wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg This is by far one of my favorite spots in Arcadia, especially on Sunday's. They have a great happy hour and it's happy hour all day on Sunday. This is a perfect spot to have some wine and apps and catch up with your friends. You may have to wait for a seat but it's well worth the wait and the wait staff is always awesome!
