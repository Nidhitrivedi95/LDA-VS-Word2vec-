zcfmbmOEX83YL04f9_Y0BA I was having lunch at this location during the holidays  and I saw they were delivering dozens of large pizza pies. I figured people must like them. Last week I brought a couple of large pies to feed the men working at my house. 

Not only the guys loved it, but two of them asked permission to take the leftovers home! I've fed employees countless times over the years and this never happened to me before. 

As I mentioned it doesn't look or taste quite like a traditional pizza. The dough is some sort of deep dish, but nicely crispy. I think they use a fair amount of yest to make it rise and stay light. It's not Chi- style nor any of the pizza hut concoctions. also the tomato sauce is used sparingly which I like.  I asked the owner about it, he told me he's been making pizza for 30 years and everything was prepared in house, including the dough, sauces etc. 

My favorite still is the individual pie with mushrooms, well cooked onions ( I can't stand undercooked onions) a mild sausage more knockwurst than Italian and my twist: a fried egg on top, sunny side up.  No it's not pizza, a Tuscan style pie maybe. 

BTW the lunches are cheap, $6.95 for lasagna, ravioli etc. More to Charlotte's taste than to mine , but good in spite of being mild.
