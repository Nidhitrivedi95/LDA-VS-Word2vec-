2BZHdgZHa3QtiNFC5bzy1w Tuesday pizza for $12!   Great deal for good food and great service!   This is actually a good spot for business meetings too since it is quite quiet and private.  Service is great as well.   Obviously we had pizza since we came on Tuesday but we have been here many other times and ordered pasta etc and it was great.  The ambiance is very comfortable and the service here is top notch.
