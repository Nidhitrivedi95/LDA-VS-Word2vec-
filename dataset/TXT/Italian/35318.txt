6kD0vTLj3oZJm7kXRSvfKw We enjoy going to Sorrento's.  The marinara sauce is delicious.  We enjoy their pasta and is it very authentic.  Service is always great.   The also carry Italian drinks that you usually can't find anywhere else such as Campari and Fernet.  Their limoncello is very good.  I recommend going for a nice authentic Italian dinner.  Try the tiramisu.
