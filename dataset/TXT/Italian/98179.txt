eVv6cnwhabK8ig5Di2hXQQ My wife and I decided to try this place, as I love pizza anytime I can get it and it is close to home.  We showed up Friday at 5p, were sat on the patio which was nice.  And drinks came quickly. I ordered a Gladiator med pie and my wife ordered a Panini.  When the food arrived at the table, I requested pepper flakes and parmesan.  After 15mins of not seeing our waitress, I got up and took them from one of the many empty tables.  To the food that was ordered.  Lets start with the Panini, I wouldn't call a sandwich made with pizza crust a panini, the taste (according to my wife) wasn't anything to rave about.  Now to the pie, I am not sure where other people order pies from but here is my feedback: the crust, this was soft and part doughy didn't do well with the toppings on the pie.  The sauce, was not very flavorful at all, more like ketchup.  Overall very disappointing with the service, food and the cost.  Save your $$ and pickup a frozen pizza at a store.
