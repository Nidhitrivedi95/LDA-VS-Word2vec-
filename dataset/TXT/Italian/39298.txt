7EtiFdHnoWwvC-8m8ixC1g Looking for an A-MAZING vegan pizza (sans cheese)? 

Follow our formula at Barro's:
Order a veggie special pizza with no sauce and no cheese
Ask them to use the white pizza mix as the sauce (oil, herbs and garlic)
Add a side of marinara sauce for crust dippin if desired

Result = Stupidly awesome vegan pizza. We loved it.

WARNING: It seems the "white pizza mix" may have Parmesan cheese in it. Not sure if it varies by location or not, but we've been given different answers at different locations. I suggest speaking with a Manager at the location you are ordering from to confirm this. We've had to ask for just olive oil, garlic and herbs as the base on a few occasions (rather than the "white pizza mix").
