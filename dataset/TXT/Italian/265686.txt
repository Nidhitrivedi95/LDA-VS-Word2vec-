wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw Excellent date night spot and as of this writing you can't beat the Monday night 20$ bottle of wine and 4 brochettes of your choosing. Amazing ambiance at night and the location is in the middle of downtown Gilbert should you feel like walking over to the theaters and what not.
