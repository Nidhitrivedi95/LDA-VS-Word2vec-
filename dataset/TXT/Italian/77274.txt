cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA Update: The manager sent us a gift card to try out Giodano's again. Completely different experience tonight. The food and service were much better. The waiter wrote down our orders and they were mostly right. One pizza was missing jalapenos on half and the other pizza had mushrooms which were not requested. Either way, they tasted great. The cheese was melted and the crust was not soggy. The wait was not as bad as last time either (they were not as busy). The waiter checked on us regularly and refilled drinks when needed. After tonight's experience, I would be open to coming back. 

Hint for leftovers: Use a small amount of oil in a non-stick skillet and fry them for 2-3 minutes prior to putting them in the oven, it keeps the crust from getting hard and chewy!
