mQkVFNSDpD4frPUMycVoWw Had a great time dining here with my office colleagues after our sales enablement work day. 

Enjoyed the ensalata with fresh mozzarella cheese with sweet fig wrapped in Prosciutto. Sweet and salty just like heaven and earth! I just wished they had served this with virgin olive oil and freshly ground pepper it would have been a home run!

The Orata sea bass was perfectly seasoned and cooked  beautifully! So tender and lots of flavor. The house wine is also notable and quite enjoyable. I should have picked the white wine but just had to try the red. Our server was really polite, attentive and did a wonderful job throughout the evening.

Overall this was a fantastic dinning experience. Our new Boss is the total package -- she picked this place and man she is da bomb in my book!
