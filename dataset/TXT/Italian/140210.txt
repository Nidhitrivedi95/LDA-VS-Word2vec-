JK_DiDwbl7HX5OhCAh3h4g Stopped to eat here while visiting Toronto for a weekend. I'm a bit hesitant when eating out of town but the pizza was delicious. My husband and I really enjoyed it as well as the service which we received. Everything was superb. If we ever visit Toronto again I would definitely go back.
