D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg This place is amazingly good all around, the service, the food, the view, the drinks! Everything, everything is absolutely great. We went on Thursday night to celebrate my wife's birthday.

Let me start with the service. The service in this restaurant is WOW"! IMPECCABLE!!! Our Server Ernesto made my wife's night special from the second we sat at our table, he honestly did an amazing job. Nobo the other person that helped us at our table also did an amazing job, he even took the time to showed us the whole view of the top of the restaurant and took a few pictures of us. At the end of our meal even the manager Rodrigo stopped by the table to make sure our experience was great and to say Happy Birthday to my wife ( which I thought it was a nice touch) Overall the service here is TOP NOTCH! 

Now the Food, the food here is Absolutely Delicious. Ernesto reccomended the grilled octopus as an apperizer, we were planning on ordering the calamari but instead we took his reccomendation and wow! It's really really good, typically octopus its a lil chewy but this one is so tender and flavorfull. As our main courses my wife ordered the surf & turf and I ordered the bone in Ribeye with a side of sparagus (with a fried egg on top, wich was actually really good) The were both perfectly cooked and full of flavor, mine even had some serrano peppers. As our Dessert we had the bread pudding which is so freaking good, it was nice when they brought the dessert with a candle and chocolate happy birthday writing and even nicer they gave us a glass of champagne to go with it.

Bottom line is that this restaurant is a MUST GO, the food is amazing, the view and the atmosphere is great, and of course the service is impeccable!
