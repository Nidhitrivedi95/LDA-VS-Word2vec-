3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg FIVE STARS FOR FAKERS. Red carpet entrance and horribly silly and stupid revolving door set the tone for this ridiculous adventure.

#layout just makes no sense. it's like someone had a vision for a bar and then squished in all this other stuff wherever it could fit, including the tables.
#the singer is real, but his music accompaniments are all cheap karakoke tracks, akin to their casio bossanova-button-rythm and one-finger-bass section ancestors. think price-is-right canned tracks but where are the beauties?
#come on, they've got a baby grand up there. where's the live music like they have at EDDIE V'S across the way?
#shuffled up to the rooftop pool patio (enclosed) for table at pool's edge.
#ordering computer/POS/credit card terminal is on low shelf behind us. great spot to learn your servers' underwear brand preferences!
#check out the pics. steak served alone, plopped on a searing hot plate. except there's nothing to sear. i try to explain that the steak is still cooking on that hot plate, but server just ignores.

HEAD TO EDDIE V'S FOR THE BEST STEAKHOUSE EXPERIENCE IN THE AREA.
