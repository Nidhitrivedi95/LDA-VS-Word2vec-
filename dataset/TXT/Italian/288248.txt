ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw We went here after getting a recommendation from a bartender at our hotel. We felt it wasn't bad, but the spaghetti didn't have enough sauce, and the eggplant parmagiana had too much. Service was a little slow, we noticed people who came in later getting served before us. But I guess the flavor makes up for the negative.
