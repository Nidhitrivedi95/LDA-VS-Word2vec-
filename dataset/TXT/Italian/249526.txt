VjaHHmV-rSkFaOAnU3faxg Worth the wait it's been over a year since I last had pizza, but this place looked worth breaking my diet for! I love the focus on local foods! Total worth supporting! Well, I dove straight in and burned the roof of my mouth, but that did not even slow me down, haha one of the best pizzas I have ever had! The veggie one was my favorite!!
