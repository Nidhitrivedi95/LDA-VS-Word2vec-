21sGRVR7HEs_t6PdB9tGMw We've been ordering from Angelina's for years.  I would say we order at least once every three weeks if not more often.  We've tried different items on the menu and the food has always been delicious.  We normally order and pick up.  We had an issue on a delivery where we were double billed about a year ago and didn't order for a period of time but gave them another shot after 6 months. After last night's fiasco we are done and it's shame as we like to support local small businesses especially when they are so yummy.  Placed a to-go order for pick up.  Was told at the time of ordering 30-35 mins before ready.  When I arrived and paid (ahead of time and included a tip) I was told it would be a couple of minutes.  After a little wait another server told me he was checking on the food.  Soon he comes out and apologizes that the chef never received my order and he was just starting on the order.  This is at least 40 minutes after my initial call.  I am told it will be at least 20 mins and offers me a free dessert or free drink.  Ummm, how about comping the meal??  I continue to wait.  Finally the order comes out and it's almost 1hr 30mins since the initial call.  To make matters even worse, upon arriving home and getting the food out to eat we did not receive the salads that come along with our dinners nor the garlic bread that also accompanies the dinners.  Very, very disappointing.
