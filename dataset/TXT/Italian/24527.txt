4EfiNcKSsafogIhAjwv0gg I've been coming here for a year or so, mostly gotten delivery. Today I ordered a pickup instead because they said it would take a hour, I didn't want to wait. I was told the wait was 20 minutes for the pick up. When I got there, the girl who I was picking up from seemed to very confused and didn't know where my order was or that I had called in. After being told to wait a few minutes I have reason to believe she gave my pizza away to another customer and so I had to wait about 15 extra minutes like that was the reason I had come to pick up so I wouldn't have to wait any longer, the cheese pizza we ordered had clearly been sitting around and soggy compared to the other pizza and they weren't cut and I had to cut it myself at home. I feel like I don't want to come back here. I like the pizza it's tasty, but this was crappy...
