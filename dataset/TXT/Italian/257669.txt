w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A Now in the past the service has either been outstanding with friendly waiters or down right  WRONG and we had to walk out.  We sat once for 20 mins without anyone stopping to even get our drink order.  It was like we were invisible. 
  When you are seated they bring the bread pretty quick.  Our pet peeve is when the bread comes and no drink order yet. I think they are still working on that issue because the last time we only sat 3 minutes after the bread came before our waitress arrived.  
 Metro is improving on their service now since I only see one regular waitress from the past still working there and we haven't gotten the invisible treatment yet.  
  We usually have the house salad with their house dressing which is pretty good.  Cannot figure out why a pizza joint doesn't put mozzarella cheese on the salad.  You can ask for it but they charge more.  BBQ chicken pizza is good and ask for the garlic and oregano seasoning shakers to add more spice.
