YFqlMM1tFn0C4b9aHdzOgg I was craving Italian food after spending the day baking in the AZ sun at a Giants game. Good old Yelp hit it out of the park again!

We had the rice balls (I can't remember what they are called) to start and right away I knew this was going to be amazing as soon as I tasted the marinara that they were perched upon!

I had the carbonara pasta and it was so rich and decadent (in a good way, really good way). My hubby loved his lasagna which had some of that awesome red sauce on it. My daughter also loved her spaghetti with meat sauce.

This was probably some of the best Italian food I have eaten. EVER.
