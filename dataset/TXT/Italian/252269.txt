VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w I got invited by one of my besties to check out Lavo this past week and I am utterly in love with the restaurant, if a bit underwhelmed by the nightclub.

It was a Tuesday night and the entire place from the lounge, to the restaurant to the nightclub was packed.  We had martinis to start out and their absolutely delicious garlic bread with marinara was sent out.  Wisely we each only had a piece to save room for the food the chef was sending out to us.    We didn't actually order off the menu since we were just sent out a few small plates to taste.  Our waiter brought us a margeherita flat bread pizza, spicy egg plant and buffalo mozzarella pasta and garlic mashed potatoes.  All were melt in your mouth yummy, I couldn't stop eating the pasta (to the misfortune of my little cocktail dress) it had the tangy tomato fondue taste with buffalo mozzarella and then this divine after bite of spicy eggplant.  

We also had dessert, one of Lavo's specialties, deep friend oreos. Now this is not your typical carnival food.  This was a beignet wrapped around an oreo with a side of cookies and cream ice cream for dipping.  Heaven.

The restaurant had a live DJ and it was on the energetic side but the music was at the right volume to easily carry on a conversation.  Also, Neil, are server was great!  Very attentive, knowledgeable and funny.

We went up to the nightclub after and ehhh...I've been to alot better, most of Vegas in fact.  The vibe was alot of fun, they had a good DJ spinning house music but the club is too small and far too crowded for me.  I like to actually be able to dance more.
