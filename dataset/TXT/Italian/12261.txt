0VJ8tBxOpD2OxuioVjaAxA Visited this new establishment Friday evening, 7/19.  First...they do not have a liquor license yet so if you want a glass of wine with your meal you will need to bring a bottle and they will happily uncork it for you - no fee.  We started with the carpaccio and were very disappointed.  The beef was sliced paper thin, as it should be, and served on a bed of arugula but had no flavor at all.  None.  Between the 2 of us we had the grouper with pasta aglio olio and shrimp with pasta aglio olio.  The group and shrimp were very good.  The pasta was very bland...I could not find a single piece of garlic or seasoning.  We finished the meal with the tiramisu.  It was just ok...a bit dry.  The coffee; however, was very good (regular coffee...they do not offer espresso).  Overall...the meal was ok.  They have not officially had their grand opening and may still be working out the "bugs".  The service was very good...our waiter was very kind an attentive.  I think we will give it another try in 4-6 weeks and see if there is improvement.
