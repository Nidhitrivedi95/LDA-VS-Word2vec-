You know you'll have a great time and the evening is going to be perfect when you see Jeremy and Chris managing the floor. And my server Manny is just about the best server to serve ever. I honestly think he should teach a class on it. He gets to know everyone and he makes the atmosphere fun and enjoyable and the kid is hilarious. I've come here not happy with my day at all and just having him as my server changed it completely around. This is a five star restaurant with five star service and definitely worth the visit. I recommend this place to everyone come and you'll have a great time I know I do
