r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA My experience is this:

I heard the hype, wanted to taste the hype, could see the hype, didn't like the hype.

I ordered one of the two barometer sandwiches for an Italian deli; the meatball sub. The other is the Italian cold cut which I will try.

Price was OK, size was OK, bread was VERY good, meatballs were pretty good, sauce was MEH.

The real reason for the 2 star review, trust me I am not a hater, is that it came out cold. Not like NOT-steaming hot, not luke warm but actually cold. 

It was super packed and right at lunch time, just before noon so I would have expected it to be piping hot.

I will try the Italian cold cut and may update this review to a more favorable one. For now, color me unimpressed.
