a6SqJZTFMpSOR6Qb0STyFA Tonight was my first time at Arrivederci Trattoria.  I have driven by this restaurant many times but  have never stopped.  I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant several weeks ago and I am glad I did.

The service was great, and the restaurant had a very friendly atmosphere.

I started with the minestrone soup and for my main course I ordered the lobster ravioli with vodka cream sauce.  My 9-year-old also loved the minestrone soup (he ate most of mine) and he really liked the spaghetti and meatballs.   My significant other ordered a salad and the tortellini (both of which he enjoyed).

For desert we ordered the flourless chocolate cake (I cannot remember what it was called) and it was so yummy. 

The restaurant also gives out complimentary homemade lemoncello (though tonight it was raspberry cello) which was pretty good.

It was a bit pricey but I will be returning to try some of the other menu items.
