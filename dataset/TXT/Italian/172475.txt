N8ArHOgRDI8wOJIOZaEHyg Your typical Americanized Italian restaurant.. How can one go wrong..? 

We went during dinner tonight, and it sure was busy. I was told the wait for a table would be about 30 mins, however we were surprised the wait was only about 10 mins..!

Our server was super friendly and attentive. Refilled our drinks right away, brought out a larger portion of the salad, and split the entree in 2 dishes since we were sharing. We didn't have the 2 for $25. We ordered the calamari, chicken marsala (for my mom), and tried the shrimp scampi for the first time. Overall not bad, it hit the spot for what I was craving tonight. 

The only downside is the location. It's a bit out of the way from my side of town. I live in the southwest; this location is in green valley. 

Overall I would recommend this restaurant and will most likely make a repeat visit in the distant future.
