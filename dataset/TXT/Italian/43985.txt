84ezTxVxTCmI65_UeYRJcA I came for a coffee, had the focaccia as well, and then topped it all off with a medium cup of gelato.

Coffee: what coffee should, but so rarely does, taste like. Perfect balance between flavour and caffeine kick (sans punch in the face that can happen with chain coffee joints that shall remain nameless).

Focaccia: super fresh, portion was perfect, and I felt like the crust was dense enough to have substance but light and airy so as not to weigh you down.

And now for the piece de resistance:

Gelato: AMAZING! I had 2 flavours: chocolate-cherry, and salted caramel. I am not a fan of cherry/chocolate mix in general but this blew me away! The salted caramel was great. I also tried a bunch of other flavours before deciding on these two flavours, and I the consensus is that I need to go back and try other combos!
