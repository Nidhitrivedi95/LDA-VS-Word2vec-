C4sVRSWeWuXo0OtnXewsjQ Fusaro's is a hidden gem in the east and west Toronto. Their anti-pasto is fantasticly delicious. The prochutto, cacciatore and la Bamba sauce spice things up. Their uno Panini is also a spicy delight. We love that is it higher Italian, at an affordable price in a cozy location. Highly recommend it.
