LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA I've seen Maggianos in other cities, but this was my first time dining at one.  We decided to have our meal "family style" which was recommend by my brother and his fiancee.   

The food was pretty good, in particular we enjoyed the mussels and loved  the Tiramisu.  Our server was excellent.  They also have some reasonably priced wines available.

I've heard mixed things about this chain, but was pretty impressed with my visit.  Family style definitely seems to be the way to go when dining here.
