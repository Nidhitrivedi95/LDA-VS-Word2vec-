oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ More like a 3.5 

I like the decor and ambiance of the restaurant.
We had a big group of 8 and the service was pretty accommodating.

They have a wide variety of pizzas and pastas. I had the fettuccine with shrimp which I really liked. The sauce was super flavourful and I really liked their home made pasta. I also tried my friends seafood risotto, and found it pretty bland though. 

Overall it wasn't bad, but it's not something I would want regularly. 

( someone in my table loveddddd their bread though...and kept asking for more, if that helps..)
