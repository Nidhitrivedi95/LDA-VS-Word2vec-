_BnBjRMt5Ba-TAv07r3fyw I love to travel and find new restaurants. I am so happy to have found this gem in the great city of Montreal--a city with more good restaurants per square foot than most cities in the US--mind you,I love explore and try new places very much--But I look forward to my next visit to W&G's.  

It was a Friday evening and the music in the bar was extremely loud--The hostess seated us downstairs not far from the bar. We immediately said it was just too loud to eat, let alone talk at all. We got up to leave and told the water server why we were going. He said to wait, took us up front to the hostess and told her to give us Table 10--apparently a quieter spot. We were ushered upstairs and around a corner--The place is huge--and to a dining area from which the noise and music of the bar was distant and faint. Thank goodness--They almost lost us, and we wouldn't have had that wonderful meal!

As soon as we sat down, the waiter brought warm Italian bread with pesto snd olive oil for dipping. So so so good!  We are vegetarians, and my husband and I shared a bruschetta, which was very good, presented in an unorthodox fashion--all piled up high on the toasted bread. It was delicious. For entrees, he had cheese tortellini in a wine and cream sauce, which he loved, and I had a pasta dish with pesto, pine nuts and goat cheese. The plates have very wide rims and a deep bowl which isn't all that wide -- at first glance you think it's one of those tiny portions that some restaurants serve. But in reality, there was more food than we could eat, even as hungry as we were! The service was terrific and the prices extremely reasonable.

So, we will definitely return to W&G'S!
