6PqYwabO2g1r2ZB7eImOiw I had Olive Garden cater my latest dinner party.  We had the pasta station for 10 guests.  Edith delivered our food promptly at the time designated.  She was in her uniform and was very sweet and most importantly, very professional.  She had the whole thing set up (everything included, napkins, paper plates, cutlery and serving utensils) quickly and efficiently. I was tempted to ask her to stay, eat and clean up too...just kidding!  The food was very good and boy, there was lots of it, including after dinner mints. Plenty of leftovers all at a reasonable price. Kudos to Olive Garden and server, Edith.  We highly recommend it.
