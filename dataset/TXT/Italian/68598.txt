BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I was visiting my parents in Scottsdale over the weekend and my father made reservations at the Local Bistro for dinner.  Both my parents are older and my Mom, in particular, has difficulty hearing in crowded rooms so when my father called to make the reservation he specifically asked that we would like to be seated outside since the restaurant is loud and it is difficult to hear one another in the crowded, noisy dining room.  He talked to the manager when he made the reservation and was assured that everything would be fine.  When we got to the restaurant, we were informed by the hostess that they did not take reservations for the patio.  She quickly called the "manager".  The restaurant was crowded and horrifically noisy.  The manager came over, mentioned that he did remember talking to my father but denied ever having said the we could sit on the patio.  We were informed that the patio is first come/first serve.  Instead of apologizing or trying to figure out a way to seat us on the patio the manager very rudely said that the conversation never happened and basically we were out of luck,  We left.  I happen to be in the restaurant business and I was pretty shocked at the abrupt, brusque and rude way my parents were treated.  Needless to say, we will never go there again.  I should not have to remind you that when people are so shabbily treated they tend to tell all of their friends, their children and their families.
I can only say to you that you should enjoy the crowds right now, but every dog has their day.  I have every confidence that the rude behavior, snotty attitude and failure to try to observe the most basic rules of customer service will catch up to your establishment.  It is not like you are the only restaurant in Scottsdale, or even in your shopping center for that matter.
