5nZVVPO_cYH9aQeClTP9zA Food is fantastic... salads are amazing... pizza is tasty. Selection of wine is decent enough and not terribly overpriced. The seating is very cafeteria like - similar to Pei wei or Chipotle - you place your order and take your number and drinks to your seat... someone brings you your food and they clear your table of empty plates. 

The food has been very reliable and I love to eat here. 

I'm not a fan of the seating and atmosphere though - the menu should drop a buck or two here and there to reflect the ambiance. 

The place usually has a good amount of people in it and depending on the time of day, someone's brought their noisy kids in there. It's not as bad as peter piper pizza, but I think the rich parents shopping at fashion square or waterfront consider it as such when their kids start crying for pizza. It's also a hot spot apparently for teenage high school girls... much like Ra Sushi. 

If the food wasn't as good as it is, I'd never go there again.
