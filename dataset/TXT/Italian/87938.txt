dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg We were in Vegas and decided to try this place after seeing it on Mystery Diner on the Food Channel.  The food was great, especially the sandwiches and eggplant.  The service was outstanding and the atmosphere was very casual.  There were eleven of us and it was nice to eat family style on the couches and coffee tables in the middle of the restaurant.  Enjoy!
