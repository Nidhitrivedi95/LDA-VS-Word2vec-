93FVxoipAIYG07gisMOQhw Friends treated me to dinner here tonight. It was a delightful surprise. Coming from NJ, I have found most Italian food in the East Valley to fall short of my expectations. 

The menu is interesting. Tonight I chose the wild mushroom fettuccine which was delicious. The sauce was rich and flavorful, the pasta was freshly made on site and the bread added to the authenticity of the meal. The salad choices were Caesar or house. I chose the house which was garnished with olives and sun-dried tomatoes. 

I will be back. Soon!
