NrjzI_RhWLJBqWVustL2sQ Every time I am in Montreal, I go to Buono Notte.  The walk up Saint Laurent (vacant lots, empty buildings) leaves something to be deisered, but once you get to the top of the hill, there is a cluster of hip restaurants and shops.  Buono Notte has a sleek, dimly lit interior, very nice.  The food is fantastic and the wine is great too.  The service was great as well. If you are ever in Montreal, I do recommend it!
