aJvi4k0ndFlGBzSZzcbnTw Vinn cafe seems to have it all: Good coffee, excellent service and an interesting interior filled with all the stuff I want to buy to kit out my kitchen of the future. 
It's located on Multrees walk- the more upmarket shops are located here so people watching can be quite amusing. The cafe has an open glass front so even if it's chilli and the sun is out you can still enjoy the sun. Because it's part of the Vavona Crolla chain it also has a whole load of cool stuff for coffee and pasta making- a bit over priced of course but good quality.
