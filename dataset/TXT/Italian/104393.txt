FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Me and my girlfriend came for a little day date... she has been here before and liked it so I figured I would give it a try. I was very much impressed! Never had this style food before but I'm hooked. I had the "nine iron" sandwich and she had the bruschetta. Both were amazing! The staff was friendly and efficient. The atmosphere is laid back and very casual which I liked. Will definitely be coming back!!
