YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ YUMMY is all I have to say.  First time here and we will DEFINITELY be back  when we are on this side of town.

CANNOT A WAIT to try a new flavor. 

I had the Spinach Asperges Mac and Cheese

Hubby had the Truffle and added steak 

Our 12 year old daughter the Philly.. With no peppers. .

The 1 and ONLY complaint was there wasn't enough meat on her M&C.. Maybe 4 or 5  little pieces 

This place would do great in Eugene Or.

Staff was helpful and nice
