Iam7tYWhssw_rscSBkeRIQ Yum, Yum, Yum, this place is quite amazing!!!!  The thin crust and sweet sauce were a perfect combination for this pie.  We ordered cheese slices and they hit the spot for a bit of a hang over from the Steeler game the night before.  I will come back to this spot every time I am in town.  Very good customer service, hot fresh pizza slices, and extremely good prices.
