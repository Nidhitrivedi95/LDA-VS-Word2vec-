cbddL2q8uRA38RwycB0FJg I've biked past this place enough times, but finally made it in to eat.  We were able to sit outside, which was nice.  And our server was quite friendly.  But the food...

Our server suggested his favorite dish, which was an angel hair dish with spinach, chicken, and white wine sauce.  What I received reminded me of Mrs Grass soup.  The stuff that is a dried packet and you just add hot water to it.
