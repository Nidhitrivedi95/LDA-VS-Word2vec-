FhVYpbvE8IQeUHAcwPPIXg Well. : strikes and your out.   My 8 yr old loves singing with Moses the piano guy who is AWESOME. 
Took 45 months minutes to get our salad and bread.  Over hour 20 for a kids shrimp, a pizza and meatball parm.  Place pretty empty so not sure why.    Waiter and manager don't have answers. 
Bottom line come for a drink and listen to Moses on the piano otherwise 3 strikes your out.    Yes vid given them 3 chances
