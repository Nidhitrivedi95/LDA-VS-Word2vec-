NKRFdM_LW1Nyhit_lMq4pg I have continued to try new menu items and have to post an update. If you want a calzone or stromboli that focuses on ingredients and not a huge amount of bread - this is the place! Try the sicilian stromboli dor a wonderful flavor of sesame dough with just the right amount of ingredients. We love the custom calzones, again, not overwhelmed by dough but a perfect balance of ingredients to go with a great thin crust. Love it!
