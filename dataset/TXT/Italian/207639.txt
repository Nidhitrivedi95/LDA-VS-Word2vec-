qkDlRkNfrXE_4t2vMrTo0A We came in for drinks late in the evening on a Tuesday. The hostess had a major attitude about seating us outside if we weren't eating. She even slapped the menu down on the table and stormed off. Then the waiter came over and said that we were 'technically' not supposed to order drinks without food, but he would help us anyways. There were literally 20 table open outside. My sangria was fine, but I was so put off I didn't even enjoy it.
