The order was easy to make and it was ready at the agreed upon time.  However, every dish I ordered tasted the same, as if the descriptions of each entree were irrelevant to what they actually made.  I was disappointed.  Everything tasted good but what's the point of having several trays of food that all taste the same?  It was so boring!  I won't have Oregano's cater my food in the future.
