VA95qAV2PRH9gtTi2Vfv4Q This place lived up to the high expectations I had after hearing a friend of mine rave about it. She's been many times and this was a first time for me. I was a bit concerned that it might not be worth the prices they charge like other restaurants in Yorkville but I have to say, I can't think of a single real thing wrong with the whole experience. 

I ordered the mafalde ai funghi that my friend had been going on about and told me I had to try. She was right. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the sauce was rich and creamy with lots of mushrooms. When it got to the table, the scent of truffles was overwhelming in a good way. Really a spot on dish that I would highly recommend to have here. Although I could have eaten an entire pot of this stuff, the portion was just about right, not so much as to make you feel bloated afterwards. The drinks are quite pricey but hey, it's Yorkville and the ingredients in their cocktails do seem to be of good quality (nice fresh herbs and garnishes etc).

We got there around 8 pm on saturday and were nervous we wouldn't get a table but it was only about a 10 minute wait and the line was moving quite quickly. The waiter was super friendly and although we sat outside, it was a nice night out. Didn't see much of the interior but it looks quite nice from what I saw. I would definitely come back here to try more dishes. 

To put it over the edge, upon going to their instagram page, I found out that a dollar from every mafalde and kale salad goes to hurricane relief effort which I think is cool of them. Glad I supported that (even if it was unknowingly lol).
