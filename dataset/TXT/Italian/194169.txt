PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ We were driving back from the M and thought we would try eating here because of all the great reviews. My GF thought it was funny that it was a hole in the wall, in a strip mall, in the middle of nowhere.

 I'm glad we stopped. The service was great. The food was awesome. You can watch your food being prepared. I had the Caesar salad and Chicken Saltimbocca. She had the House Salad and Lobster Ravioli. We were both extremely impressed with every aspect of our meal.

 To top things off, our waiter who had been really great throughout the evening, brings a slice of Strawberry Cheesecake. It was rich, delicious and beautifully presented.

 This was the best deal we got in Vegas.
