AuIiqDeL65kczmiFSkAWrA I love this place! Whenever I go to Maggianos I forget that it is a chain. The waitstaff is always professional and nice. I went with a Maggiano virgin and the server came out with a sample of fried 4 cheese ravioli! OMG it was so good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because at time the food doesn't live up to the hype (sometimes). But any place where I order a classic dish and they automatically box another for me to go, that's what I'm about! And the peach bellini is a must!
