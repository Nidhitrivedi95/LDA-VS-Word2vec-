7S5iOI5Xb9cTUQLmBwCeXw I am quite surprised at the poor reviews this place got. Me and a friend accidentally discovered this place for lunch today ( we were actually on our way to Kona Grill) . We shared a salmon salad and the garden pizza. The salad was a little overdressed but the fish was cooked well. The thin crust pizza was very good. 
Continuing my quest for the best tiramisu in town , had to try some here too and must say i may have found a top contender. 
Must agree with the other reviewers though that the place was quite empty at lunch and even then service was a little slow. However, the server was friendly and warm. Sit outside in the patio if you can.
