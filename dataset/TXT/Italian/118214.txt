I had an assortment of cheese, and should have just went with my own judgement rather then my server's because only 2 out of 3 was good. We also had some Prosciutto Balls and I just wasnt feeling on the whole texure and taste of it.For entrees, I had the Crispy Duck w/ house raisins and black italian kale, honeslty I would much rather go to a Asian supermarket and buy a 15.99 peking bbq duck. My bf had the bucatini and the portion was so small it was like on a appetizor plate and was sooo SALTY that he couldnt even finish it! Me and my bf was pretty much dissapointed, because how can you go wrong on Italian food? Oh well, maybe we just ordered the wrong thing, but I will not be coming back because our whole lunch costed close to 100 bucks! =(
