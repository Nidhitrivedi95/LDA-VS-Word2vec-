B9pMUND3peh4fFtGmqA4LA I've been to Balsamico twice now and have really enjoyed it.  I love the atmosphere, nice cozy small venue.  I found the food to be absolutely delicious.  I eat at a lot of Italian restaurants and would definitely put it in the top 3 for best in Toronto.

My fav dish would have to be the Gorgonzola Gnocchi....sooooo yummy!! also the chicken breat with asparagus is amazing...the tiramisu was also delicious.

I've worked in the restaurant industry for almost 20 years now so I am extremely picky especially when it comes to service and both times I was there service was fantastic.

There are so many options in the Yonge and Eglinton area for Italian restaurants and I would pick this one over anyother.  Next time you're looking to try something new give this place a shot.  Also, found it reasonably priced.

Enjoy!
