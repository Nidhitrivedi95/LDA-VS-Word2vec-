nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Took my chic here last night for her birthday because she heard Buddy on 98.5 and asked if we could go, so off we went. I have been to the best places in Vegas and some are over hyped and some under hyped. I went into Buddy V's not really thinking anything was gonna be all that amazing but I was wrong on a few things.

One, The mussels they have are the best mussels I have ever eaten in my life. The mussels were so good I ordered another order after dessert.

Two, The surf and turf I ordered was cooked to perfection.

Three, The XL Lobster dessert is probably one of the most amazing things on this planet.

I love to watch new restaurants as they open just to see who really has their shit together and I think Buddy V's did a pretty good job on their opening. Staff was nervous and If I worked there I would be too. Not only is it opening day but the owner, owners business partners and the owners parents are all there. 

We were greeted by Adam Margolies who is the asst G.M. and it was really great to talk to a guy who is really into the property enough to where he had an answer for every question. I know to people reading this that may not seem like much but being from Vegas it is really hard to find knowledgeable people that know things even at the places were they work. We asked him how the XL lobster is made, where the cuts of beef were farmed from, if the scallops are flown in or driven, if the broccoli is organic, if the chocolate chips in the Gelato was made from scratch or store bought. 
We asked all these questions and he answered all of them with no hesitation. 

The decor is 10/10 for the type of restaurant it is and I think it will do well here in Las Vegas. I love eating at places that don't feel stuffy as I don't believe you should ever feel uncomfortable anywhere in Las Vegas.

Welcome to Vegas Buddy V!! Your gonna do great here and we are glad you chose Vegas to serve. Gonna get more mussels now !
