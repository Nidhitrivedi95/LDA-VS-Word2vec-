oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ This is a completely overrated restaurant. The clientele is completely trashy. Most importantly, for claiming to be an Italian restaurant, the food is completely terrible and dried out. My friends and I had various basic pasta dishes that any old nonna could crank out. All were dry, bland and tasteless. The value for this was extremely poor. When we complained to the manager, he could only reply with a smirk on his face. I wish this enterprise a swift death for the pollution they do to the fine Italian cuisine.
