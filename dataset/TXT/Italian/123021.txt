HiCNLB9cCWVHnbzHeN2daA This is some of the worst food I've had in a very long time. The salad on the salad bar was wilted and the pasta salad smelled terrible. The pizza was dry and tasteless with thin crust, hardly any toppings, and cut up into about 30 squares as if it were about to be served to a group of kindergarteners. The tortellini was gluey and dry. We also ordered wings which weren't half bad, but considering how rude the hostess was (you'll know her by the ten pounds of makeup she is wearing), I won't be coming back.
