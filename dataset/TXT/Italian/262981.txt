wVc3g-YfyDvkOLDecpr4DA Came here for winterlicious and tried their $25 fixed dinner menu. It's always a hit or miss with Winterlicious whether it be the menu items or the portion sizes. I went throught the long list of participating restaurants and finally decided to try this place based on their reviews.  And I can gladly say that I made the right decision! 
The restaurant is located on yonge so needless to say parking was a bit difficult to find. I came here at around 5 pm which is extremely early for dinner but had no choice since they were booked until after 9:30.  I'm not sure how busy they are on days outside of Winterlicious but I came on a Saturday night and surprisingly the place was packed by 6. 
The atmosphere of the restaurant was very relaxed and casual with antique elements which added a touch of elegance. The slanted lamp fixtures on the ceiling was probably the first thing that caught my eye along with the collage of magazine pages on each table as design. 
We were a party of three so we made sure to order different items. 

Appetizers:
- Roasted Beet Salad with Scallion Dressing and Toasted Pumpkin Seeds
- Baked Goats Cheese with Polenta, Sundried Tomato Paste and Pesto
- Crispy Pork Belly with Butternut Squash Mash, Carmelized Apples
My favourite was the pork belly, it was very tender and flavourful. And the sweet butternut squash mash went well with the pork belly. I'm not a big fan of goat cheese but ordered it anyways since the waiter recommended it. It was definitely very unique and quite rich. The mixed greens was a nice  compliment to even out the strong flavours from the goat cheese. I would recommend to those who like goat cheese but sadly I'm still not a fan. The beet salad was average but quite refreshing. And just to add we ordered bread to start with which was $1 per person. The bread was okay not too special so probably wouldn't order it again so I have more room for my meal. 

Mains:
- Pork Tenderloin with Maple Balsamic Glaze, Soft Polenta, Sweet Peas and Onions
- Braised Boneless Beef Short Ribs with Navy Beans and Root Vegetables
- Pumpkin Seed Crusted Salmon with Mango and Smoked Red Pepper Salad
My favourite, hands down, would have to be the salmon. It was perfectly seasoned and the texture/flakiness was just right. The roasted pumpkin seeds on top added a nice crunch and the mango salad just added another dimension to the dish. The mangos were ripe which always makes me happy and I loved the flavours of the smoked peppers. The presentation alone was impressive with the salmon served on a bed of bright colours from the greens and the mango salad. 
My second favourite would be the beef short ribs which was cooked thoroughly but not to the point where it becomes hard to chew. Personally I don't like my beef rare or anywhere close to that so I was quite happy not seeing a lot of pink. The vegetables were nicely cooked. Only thing lacking would be the presentation but it tastes great so not complaining too much. 
The pork tenderloin was not as tender as I would've liked it to be but I rather enjoyed the puréed polenta and sweet peas which I thought complimented the pork quite nicely.

Dessert:
- Flourless Chocolate Cake
- Creme Brûlée 
- Banana Chocolate Chip Bread
I liked the banana bread, it wasn't too sweet but I wouldn't say it's the best I've had. The chocolate cake was rich without being overpoweringly sweet and the blueberries on top was a nice touch. The Creme brûlée was served cold which I wasn't used to since I usually enjoy them warm. But the desserts  definitely helped to complete this very satisfying meal. 

Overall I had a lovely experience here and was glad I came across this place (thanks Winterlicious!). The waiter that served us was also very friendly and I was satisfied with the speed of service, allowing some time in between to digest. The portions are also reasonable and you will definitely leave feeling comfortably full. I will come back for sure to try their regular menu items!
