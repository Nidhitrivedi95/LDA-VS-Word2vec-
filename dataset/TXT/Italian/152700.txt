KuxDPl6UYNLxFChPm0_MNw Would I go again? Nope. 

Service: server was great but he felt harried and rushed.

Chipped water glass: not cool

Summerliciois menu
Food: spinach walnut Gorgonzola salad; nothing creative just all the above and berries thrown on a plate. Yummy by default
Main: lemon chicken. Truly delicious, flattened breast that wasn't dry and was flavorful throughout. Enjoyed the presentation as well
Dessert: we shared all 3: tiramisu tasted like it had sit in the fridge too long or just been defrosted; lady fingers dipped in coffee and called tiramisu.
Creme brûlée: nasty texture, not good at all
Chocolate mousse: had everyone forgotten how to set a mousse? It was runny and unappealing.
