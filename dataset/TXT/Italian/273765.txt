Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A The Bistro Buffet at the PALMS is Absloutly the WORST Buffet in Las Vegas! All food was processed, frozen low quality. Food was also old and dry. Prime Rib was like rubber and tasted like it was steamed instead of roasted. Salad bar had very few offerings. Deserts were very cheap looking and stale. For $24.99 you would expect much better. Many (if not all) employee cafeterias in Las Vegas serve better food for FREE! NEVER AGAIN!!!!
