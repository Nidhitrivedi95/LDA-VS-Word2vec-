FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Great place to grab a quick bite to eat! Az weather has been in the 100+.... but even then the patio seating was very cool and comfortable.

We ordered their choice of 4 bruschettas, Hannah Salad/veg sandwich, and a Roast Beef sandwich. The bruschettas were sooooo good! Roast beed was not that great (too much seasoning), the salad was okay (in the future I will order it with dressing on the side.)

If you are looking for a light, quick bit Postino's is your place!
