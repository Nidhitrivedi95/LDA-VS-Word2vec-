DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw Siena Italian Deli-This place is as authentic as it gets..

Fresh sliced REAL Italian meats and cheeses.Fresh made salads and stuffed vegetables and of course pizza,pasta and desserts served on site.

A nice outdoor patio to eat plus indoor seating.

This place gets busy so be patient it's a little pricy but worth it!!
