OMf69ePEdHXvaqAlCCI01A Cibo e Vino is tucked into the NW corner of a small shopping center that is anchored by an Albertsons Grocery store at the corner of N. Scottsdale Rd. and Carefree Hwy.  The atmosphere is OK, but the food is DELICIOUS.  The chef's Marinara sauce is the best I've ever tasted and the fried Calamari was crisp and not oily and also very tender since the chef only uses fresh squid and not frozen.  You can make a meal out of the ample assortment of appetizers during Happy Hour and that's just what we did.  The meatballs were huge and tasty and the pepperoni rolls were excellent.  We will be back for dinner soon.  This place may be hard to find, but it is worth the effort.
