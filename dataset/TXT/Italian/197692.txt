pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Best pizza in the US? Are you kidding? Not even close.

We went there for lunch and it's definitely a cute and very small place - maybe 15 tables? More outside seating when it's not 413289 degrees out. It's really cute - love the brick and open feeling to it. Bar area was really nice.

Very friendly service but they should ask if you've been there before and if not, tell you a little about the pizzas. It wasn't clear on the menu how big the pizzas were and what was on the pizzas without tomato sauce etc. One server told us the other pizzas had white sauce (which I think of as an alfredo-type sauce) on it but it was just olive oil and no tomato sauce.

Pizza was ok - a little burnt on the crust. Expensive for the size and toppings IMO. We had the Sonny Boy which was good but the olives overpowered the whole pizza. The other one we tried was the Wiseguy, which was good but no where near the best pizza I've ever had. I wish we had tried the salads - they looked delicious.
