We went on a Saturday and were dismayed by the very long Disney-esque lines at lunch, but we had driven so far...! My BF had the Chicken Caesar salad and I had a salad with ahi. We shared some fries. All of the food was done really well and there's no denying the produce is just-picked and wonderful. The outdoors seating is really nice if the weather's cooperating.
