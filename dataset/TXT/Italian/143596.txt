JT9krwpag1O4YRjJy_ZA6Q Received shockingly rude service here by some guy named Steve. Pizza was very late, and when I called in, was given attitude instead of an apology. I ended up canceling the order after waiting almost 2 hours.  People that rude should not be working in the service industry. Worst pizza hut ever.
