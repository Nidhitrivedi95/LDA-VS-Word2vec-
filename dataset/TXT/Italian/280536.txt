YOD9dXrnpu8HTRILpF0onw Ordered takeaway which included calamari, baked ziti, cheesesteak with peppers and onions with a side order of fries. Calamari for $13 tasted like frozen over cooked squid. The baked ziti which is pretty hard to screw up was beyond bland with not enough sauce and they used very cheap cheese because you can definitely taste the difference. The garlic bread that came with was horrible it didn't have that fresh out of the oven taste. My hubby's sub was very disappointing for him, it was very dry and the meat didn't have the juices dripping down like should happen with a steak sandwich. Now as for the FRIES which mind you are NOT INCLUDED WITH SANDWICHES are right out of the frozen aisle at your local grocery store. My hubby said nasty babe try one, I told him he no way in h@ll will I eat one of those!! $40 later & beyond dissatisfied will NEVER NEVER EVER BE BACK & would never suggest the restaurant to anyone!! Save your $$, you may have to drive out of the area for REAL ITALIAN DISHES but you'll be thankful that you did!!
