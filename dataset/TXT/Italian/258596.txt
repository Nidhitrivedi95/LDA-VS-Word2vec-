WCqcYtJ4rUxA4bIzjOfzqg When I first walked into Vapiano, I was so confused.  It looks like an upscale restaurant but there aren't any waiters. There were hostesses but they don't seat you. You get a little card instead of a menu.  You wait in line to order your food and find your own seat, but the atmosphere definitely doesn't look like a food court. 

Once you figure it out, it's not too bad.  Grab a menu and go wait in the line you're interested in. Order your food and put your card on the little scanner, and boom. You're on your way to a delicious lunch.  The pasta line seemed to be the longest.  The basil pesto with campanelle was tasty but a tad oily. The bread helped get rid of that greasy feeling though. The pasta itself was cooked to perfection, as my campanelle was chewy and soft.  Water cups are at the bar! 

Vapiano seems to reserve tables too so if you're thinking of stopping by with a large group during the lunch rush, try to call ahead of time.
