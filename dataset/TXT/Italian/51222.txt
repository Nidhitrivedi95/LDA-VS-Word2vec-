9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg Scaddabush is a fun, lively restaurant to go to with friends to socialize, eat and drink in a fun atmosphere. 
Though I've had to wait for tables multiple times, the end result is worth it. 

The fresh buffala mozzarella with truffle oil is the star of the show, hands down. I think about it all the time! So soft and gooey, and I'm a sucker for truffle oil. 
The bruschetta is nice to share, as well as the spinach dip and focaccia! The polenta bites were very decadent and a little heavy, but scrumptious. I think you could order it as a main instead! 

I've ordered spaghetti and the meatball, and enjoyed it; next time I will try my meatball stuffed! 
My boyfriend has gotten the chicken parm twice now and loved it both times. 
I've also been with family and friends who have sworn for the butternut squash ravioli and chicken parm bites. 
Next time I will try a pizza to share!
