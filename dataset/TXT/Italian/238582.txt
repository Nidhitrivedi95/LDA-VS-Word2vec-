u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog Oh I'm sorry but I cannot leave this a bad review at all when I came here to this particular location with my friends from New Jersey we happen to walk by right as they were opening the restaurant and what do you know it was like we hit the jackpot lottery
I swear to God it was crazy we were there first table and chef Martorano was there! 
He kept coming toward table and bringing us food that we didn't order
There were other tables in the restaurant that were two tops but it was so strange because I didn't think that we were the first actual people to be seated I think that maybe we were there first party of six
It was my girlfriend Sheridan's birthday that we were celebrating I didn't get the bill if there even was one but my friend had said that the chef had hoped it up somehow it was crazy I'm sorry but I thought the food was good and I will never forget how this big jumbo macho Italian guy with the muscles came up to us and were so friendly and was talking to us
I'm not sure that even realised it was Chef Martorano at that point until we had left
 I don't know about these other experiences but I had a nice time plus the booze always helps
