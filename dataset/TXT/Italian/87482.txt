DvxGK4R1_0LR9837DCOZXg Great pizza and wings! I get the pizza and wing special from them at least once a month because i love their wings! And my girlfriend always gets a salad because she thinks their ranch dressing is the best. I love getting the garlic knots too and dipping them in the wing sauce! They are very fast, i have never had to wait more then 10 to 15 minutes even during heavy times. All of the staff members are friendly too.
