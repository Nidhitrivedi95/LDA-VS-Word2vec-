this place was great from the ambiance to the food.

try this place for lunch and avoid the problem of getting a diner reservation, which could take weeks..

my wife and i really enjoyed the tapas angle the menu has to offer. we enjoyed a number of tasting's, including lasagna, olives, meatballs. pizza,  and parmesan cheese with fresh honey. we started with a drink at the bar and the service from the bar to the table was exemplary! 

a must go!
