d-wvSnFt6JAZBzqMiGpvyQ Our entire family was transiting from Mexico back to CA at PHX.  
We were hungry and tired.  
We made the wise choice by walking into this gourmet pizza place!

It was the BEST thin crust pizzas I ever had!  
The chicken sausage and poblano was my favorite.  I had to order a second one!  
We also had pepperoni & mushroom, sausage & pepperoni, and cheese pizza.  

We cleaned plates! Don't miss this place if you are in PHX!
