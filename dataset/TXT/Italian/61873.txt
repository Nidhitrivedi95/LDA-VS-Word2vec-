On a Friday night the place is generally packed. So you should make a reservation, but if couldn't they have an open bar to hang out. The upstairs is generally for large parties. It is a pasta place (Atkins may roll over) and they have a favorite dish called pasta trio- three different pasta, all you can eat. They change that pasta periodically so you may get  the same pasta second time you go there. The wine is also very good - excellent wine for the price. Great food, good service, good wine and great price!! The parking lot is just opposite to the restaurant.
