FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw We came here for a birthday dinner with a friend on a Friday night.  While I think it would be more lively on a Thursday night, we definitely had a wonderful time with attentive and knowledgeable service.  

Our meals were lovely - we had the lobster salad, ribeye, filet mignon and a pasta, and everything was quite wonderful...and I have to say the ribeye was spectacular. 

This is definitely the place to take someone for a special occasion but expect the price point to match that.
