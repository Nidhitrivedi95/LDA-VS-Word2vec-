kzbH1_l7VTSfFFcwTqY6vA My grandma and I went for dinner here recently and the food was delicious. I ordered the crab cakes; they were delightful. The dessert - moscato berry cake, was divine! The waitress couldn't describe it but I took a leap of faith and ordered it anyway. So glad I did. Huge chunks of berries baked into a vanilla cake with layers of wine flavored cream in between. I moaned with joy the entire time I ate it. 

The service was iffy, our waitress seemed stressed as soon as she had more than two tables. She rubbed me the wrong way when she refused to let me pack up my own leftovers. She didn't seem to have enough knowledge of the menu items. 

We will definitely be back though!
