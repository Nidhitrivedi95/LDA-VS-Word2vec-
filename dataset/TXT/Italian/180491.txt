nUyKmUId0900VyXUphsigg Meatballz is an excellent lunch place.  I would testify to their food - except I always have the same thing - the Meatball Parm Sandwhich (excellent!) - it's so good I can't bring myself to order anything else.  However, everyone I've been there with seem to thoroughly enjoy their orders.

The only disappointment I've had is when I had a hunger for their Meatball Parm and they were closed!!!  Subway just doesn't come close!!
