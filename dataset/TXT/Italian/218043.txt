rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ Small portion for the price. Must re-evaluate menu. Order lamb cho
ps for $ 23 received 2 small chops it was an appetizer portion . Are u kidding. Short ribs had 2 small pieces price $ 26 really $ 4.99 a pound had less then 1/4 pound. Cod order couldn't see it. Take note cause the food taste good, way too expensive for nothing.  Wake up. Will not come back and will let everyone know. I told the waitress and the chef nor the manager game out to inquire. So sad.
