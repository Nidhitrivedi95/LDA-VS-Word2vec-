x4aHNNo1osWNCB75q_PijQ Glad my son found this place on our last night in town and it would've been a mistake to miss it, very lively upbeat vibe even for Scottsdale. I had the NAPOLI Pizza, very simple fresh local ingredients, sauce was perfect and the crust done just right, I would've given this pizza a perfect 5 BUT I'm an anchovy fan that's why I ordered this particular pie and I think there were maybe one fillet on each piece, they were very tasty just like the rest of the pie, just not enough so mine gets a 4, #2 son orders the POMO Pizza which I have to say was perfect, surprised he let me have a slice it was so good! #1 Son ordered TAGLIOLINI AL SALMONE, an Alaskan Salmon in  cream sauce with homemade pasta and it was awfully tasty, a well done dish with hints of saffron and lots of flavor. All in all a great evening out with my boys made even better by our lovely hostess and our great waiter Denny. Will definitely be back the next time in town. *****
