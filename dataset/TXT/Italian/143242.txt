JsUprRhyzQyukZmAhcOg0A Very very very disappointed with this trip to Brio.  We had eaten here several times in the past and the food was pretty good though pricy.  A couple of weeks ago we saw that they had gotten 6 violations on the dirty dinning report but since we had good luck in the past we figured that they would prob be trying very hard to work past that issue.  We went into the bar for there happy hour and the first thing we came across was when the person across from us asked us if we where supposed to get bread while we wait??? She asked the bartender and was told that they had changed the policy that now you have to ask for bread if you want it.  The bread is usually a curtesy at most restaurants how do you have to ask for a curtesy either you give us the bread or not but to have to ask for curtesy bread is insulting.  We ordered some bread and where told it would be a while because they needed to bake some more??? So we ordered some appetizers we sat and waited and waited and waited from my seat I could see the kitchen and I saw what I thought must be our food sitting under the heat lamps where it sat and sat and sat finally the manager called over the server and sure enough it was our food which was of course getting cold and our burgers that where supposed to be medium where very WELL done.  All around it was a very lackluster performance at a time when they weren't even busy.  Our budget for eating out is not as flush as it used to be and the disappointment Of this visit is just irritating and kind of ruined our afternoon.  Don't think we will come back  if we are in the area there are a lot of other restaurants and I don't want to waste my time or money.
