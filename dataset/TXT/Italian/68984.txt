bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg I am in town for work and wanted somewhere to eat some good Italian food.  Not only is the food wonderful, but it is a nice place to go to solo.   Had the fettuccine Alfredo (I am very picky about the Alfredo sauce) the sauce was light and creamy and the fettuccine was fresh and handmade.  Received a tiramisu on the house and ate every bit of it even though I was full from my meal.
I will be in town for quit sometime and will defiantly be back and make sure my local co-workers know about this little gem in the suburbs.
