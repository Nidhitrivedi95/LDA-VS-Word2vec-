He came to out table, I kid you not, like 30 times throughout the entire dining experience (which was an hour long). He kept picking up crumbs, moving chairs, changing plates, asking questions....I don't know if he was trying to be friendly or whether he had nothing else to do with his time. Both times the restaurant was nearly empty. The second time we came there was another table and they left earlier then us. The waiter kept "hurrying" us out, by offering to bring us bill and gathering up our plates. When we noticed that he was hurrying us out, we asked if they are closing, and he said that they are closing at 3, and at that time it was 2:50pm. We just wanted to enjoy our coffees and desserts but his behaviour really turned us off. The food was decent but not authentic Italian.
