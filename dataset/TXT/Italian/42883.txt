7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw It's good times when you're sitting on the patio of North people watching on a gorgeous day, and it's even better when you're eating some delicious Italian cuisine. I have never had even a so-so experience at North . . . the service, the food, the ambiance have always been consistently above par, sometimes even excellent, depending upon the time of day dining. The food is always fresh, then menu always has something for every possible craving or desire . . . salads, sandwiches, pizzas, entrees. 

Two couples sitting across from us had two pizzas, and as they saw me perusing the menu, they held up a slice and exclaimed "you can't go wrong with the pizza!"  I am a huge fan of the thin-crust Neopolitan pizza, and North did not disappoint.  The crust was thin and crispy, the eggplant on top grilled to perfection, the onions caramelized but not soggy, and the portobello firm and tasty. My husband had the Angus burger, which was cooked medium rare to his specifications.  It was accompanied by a huge serving of pasta salad which rivaled the one I make at home that is his favorite (saddens me a bit, but nice to know that we can find a substitute when I'm not in the mood to mess up the kitchen . . .  )

You can always find a great class of wine by the glass, not too expensive either.  They pour a nice-sized glass.

When the weather permits, I always ask for patio seating. It is much more relaxed and quieter than sitting amongst the hubbub of the indoor dining areas.  The garden patio furniture along the far outside railing is prime seating, so comfortable that you could linger there for hours.

Hmm . . . today is another  ideal day . . . Look for us on the patio! :)
