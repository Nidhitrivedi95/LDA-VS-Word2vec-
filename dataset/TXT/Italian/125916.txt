HrR_2-HUE6cqnoz1zMN9AQ Went in because the area around smells divine. They dont have slices but their pizzas are small, 11inches.  Still too much food for me on the go so I had the italiano sándwich, which had soft firm bread, very good and was very tasty.  I had asked for the chips but there was a miscommunication and got the salad (which is fresh and good). But I really wanted chips and the manager said no problem and brought me chips.  And they were fast.  I will be back to taste rhe pizza.
