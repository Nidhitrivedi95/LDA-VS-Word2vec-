tWdp26XQEJqJGnRmFVJQxA Went last night as a group of 4. Pizza was pretty good, the mediterranea had great olives on it. But the real star of the show was the Commendatore pasta dish, one of the best I've had in a long while. The pistachios were the perfect finishing touch. I highly reccommend it! Atmosphere of the resto was great too; un-assuming, rustic, and warm. They've got a private curtained off area for dinner party sizes- will def book for my next group outing.
