2JYszoQKgJj6pPbaN7cLwQ We went for Mother's Day lunch.  The food was very good and reasonably priced- this is a great addition to the north shore!

I lowered my star rating because the service was really really slow. The restaurant was not very busy and our waiter made himself scarce after he realized we weren't drinking. We waited about 20 min for our check until a  different waiter (an older guy who was hustling his butt off) had to go get our waiter for us. It took us another 15-20 min to get moving.
