84ezTxVxTCmI65_UeYRJcA Absolutely fantastic service and the food is great too! We stopped for gelato yesterday and went back again today for pizza, soda and more gelato. They have so many delicious flavors!

The staff is very kind and the pizza was out to us very shortly after we ordered. I would definitely go back if we travel here again.
