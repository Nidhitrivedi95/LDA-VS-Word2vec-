O54jXbKjZte4qVYabYjGjg This was my first visit here. We stopped because of all the positive Yelp reviews. First, our server was very sweet and nice.  My boyfriend and I got the antipasti salad for two with the house dressing. It was enough salad for four!!  I'm sorry I didn't  take a picture of it, we just dug right in when it came. The bread that was brought to the table was warm and fresh and the size of a hamburger bun. We ordered chicken parm with homemade spaghetti and a small white pizza to share. Holy cow, it was a ton of food and it was all delicious. We had enough left over for a whole other meal.
