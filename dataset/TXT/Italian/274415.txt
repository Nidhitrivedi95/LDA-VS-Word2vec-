y1esDY2vFyaTMf1YlRT7ZA Authentic Italian food- everything we had was fantastic and fresh.  The drinks were excellent and the service was great.  You can tell they really care about the food and their business.  Will definitely make this a regular spot when in town sq.   Beautiful wood stove for the pizzas, nice atmosphere.  Highly recommend!
