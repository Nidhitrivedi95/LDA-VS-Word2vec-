JlkHGjgS3MJ5FqEDJdu8xQ Awful.  Even for a chain.

Went here on another Christmas gift card...seriously, I may just give these away.

Sat down, ordered wine.  It was delivered in a glass the size of a shot glass, and all at $7/glass.

The food was, blah.  I had a veal parm that was killed with garlic, an accompanying pasta that was so greasy and slimy it was disgusting.

Even their bread was bad.

Service was good.

Two thumbs down on Pepsi products.
