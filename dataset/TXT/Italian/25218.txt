4HEF6BuO_BBsTmvcMCbhhg Came in today for happy hour (3-6) 
I ordered the Ortaggio and two single bruschettas.  
Everything came out in a timely manner and tasted amazing.  Scottie (the bartender) was very attentive, not only to me but to guests walking in AND guests already seated.   
I'm a huge fan of Postino so I wasn't really sure what to expect.  
I'll definitely be back in, thanks again Scottie!
