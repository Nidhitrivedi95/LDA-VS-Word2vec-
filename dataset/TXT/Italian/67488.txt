bqDFZDfDPdCut0CbybDUrA Ordered chicken pram and it came with just a fried, soggy piece of chicken on a plate... Even had a bone left in it. Chicken was also pretty fatty so they evidently didn't trim anything. No pasta served with it.... Just the chicken.

My co-worker ordered a strip streak and it had quite a bit of fat on it as well. Approx 20% of his steak was fat.

Service was ok but they weren't that busy so I expected good service. I won't eat here again... Too many options to do this again. Way over priced in my opinion.
