29o-qEDIRpXmVmSPNsH4sA BEWARE: SERVING SIZES ARE GINORMOUS!

We did not know this^^ and over-ordered!! Next time the BF and I are splitting a plate of pasta! 
Calamari appetizer was SO inexpensive and SO much food! In fact I think all their dishes are underpriced for the quantity that you get. This was the most delicious app I have had--so flavorful and so FRESH! 
On top of the calamari we also got the sausage pasta and the seafood pasta. Both had heaping amounts of food and delicious in their own sense. We were seafood-ed out after the appetizer so we were devouring the sausage pasta. The sauce for the sausage pasta was amazing--we took the noodles from the seafood dish and dunked it in the other plate's sauce to drink it all up :)
