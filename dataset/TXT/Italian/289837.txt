zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA Gave this place a try for a nice quiet Valentine's Day lunch with my guy.  We sat on the patio which is lovely.  Very charming with lots of plants and corks for mulch.  Cute.  The garlic bread they bring out was amazing.  Very light and soft, but oh so good....and they just kept bringing more!  We had the fried ravioli, my personal fave, and it was delicious!  The BF had a stromboli which was recommended by our waitress.  He said it was really good, but it looked more like a calzone to me.  I thought a stromboli was a rolled up kind of pizza thing, but this was folded over like a calzone.  Either was he liked it.  I had the caprese sandwich which I though was really good.  It was on the same type of bread they make the garlic bread from, lightly toasted with tomatoes, mozzerella and pesto.  Upgraded from the chips to the fries on the recommendation of our server and they were quite tasty.  We're anxious to go back and try some different menu items, but we definitely enjoyed our lunch
