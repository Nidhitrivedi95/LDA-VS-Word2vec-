Tp07u-0AOFRfQhtNpAXaQA I raved about this place to my family and decided to bring them here when I was in Phoenix yesterday about 1pm.  I had been here about a month ago and thought the pizza was very good, and the slices were generous.   I ordered three slices of pizza and had them cut one in half to share with my mom, since I remember the slices were large.  I was surprised when I received my order that the slices were about two-thirds smaller.  We all laughed at how small they were and wondered how I could justify the $17 I had just spent.  I wondered if the slices were smaller on the weekends, and asked a waitress that looked very busy with only one table to attend to.  She quickly replied "No" to my question and as I continued to tell her why I was wondering, I realized that she was long gone, leaving me talking to myself.  Which again, gave me and my family another good laugh.  Over all the customers service was poor.  The cashier was rushed and appeared bothered by our ordering and asking questions.  My friends ordered salads that only had lettuce and dressing.  No additional veggies or croutons.  It took three requests for 3 cups to get water before we got them, and then we only got one cup.  I was frankly embarrassed that I had brought them there but luckily it will be my last time.  The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because the pizza was good.  I don't just want to complain, I would also like to offer some suggestions.
1. Smile and greet the customers 
2. Get items requested promptly 
3. When a customer asks a question, acknowledge them, try to find and answer
4. Keep the food portions consistent
