L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw Came for dinner with a group of about 15 work colleagues. The service was excellent but the food was so-so. A menu was pre-arranged - we had assorted apps served family-style, a few main entrees to select from, and then we could pick the dessert from the regular menu. 

The margherita pizza didn't have much flavour. 

The linguine pomodoro was decent - I had read complaints about the pasta not having enough sauce and didn't feel that way at all about the dish. 

For dessert I had the chocolate brownie with vanilla bean gelato & carmelized popcorn - delicious :)
