DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q should have thought it over a little bit more before I tried this place. it was busy so that was a good sign.  as I walked in there was a lady with a half eaten kale salad so I thought that would be a healthy lunch.  I pick up the kale salad that costs $11.  cashier wasn't friendly at all.  it looked tasty but it wasn't.  no taste and I didn't finish most of it.  I thought about the lady I saw with her half eaten kale salad and I think it was half eaten because she didn't like it either.   never again.
