7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA Patricia, the owner, contacted me the same the same day about my ordering difficulties.  It appears to have been an issue with a phone outage and Patricia wasn't contact by Yelp about it.  So I guess I need to give Yelp a 1 star review!!

Patricia has made me an offer for a free entree for my troubles and due to this I will change my review to 3 stars.  Once I order from the Bistro I will change the review again based on what looks like really good food.

Thank you, Patricia, for your prompt and friendly response!!!

Received my order today and it was DELICIOUS.  I love the chicken on the salad, very flavorful and moist!!!

Thanks again to Patricia and I will definitely be ordering again soon.
