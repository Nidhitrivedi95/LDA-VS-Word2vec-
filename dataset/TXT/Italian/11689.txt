0s1DqJlSSgR1Ftg9Q_HEOg Awful. Been here several times I have lived here for 16 years. This is the last time I'll come. Came in at 2:00pm and there was another couple across the room that was just served plated of salad. We sat down, the old man, I assume is the owner didn't even come to us, he yelled from the across the room and asked if we knew what we wanted and we were still deciding and he walked away. Yelled at us about our drink order. Gave it to us in styrofoam cups instead of glasses like the other couple that was there. Didn't even bring it to us. Our slices of pizza were ready and didn't even bring them to us, just left them at the counter and yelled how much our bill was. We came to sit down for lunch, not be treated like we were at a fast food establishment. To top it off, the old man was friendly to the couple that was here before we came in and went to there table to serve them. I'm so shocked this place is still open for business after all these years. These owners are so rude and the wait staff (if any) are also rude as well. Always act annoyed and never friendly. I would never come back ever.
