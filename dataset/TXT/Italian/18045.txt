2JYszoQKgJj6pPbaN7cLwQ Food: Haven't had a dish I don't like yet! But, do ask if you have issues with ingredients. I was told by one wait staff that the meatballs were all beef and told by another they were not. Get clear info if you have adversions. Love the eggplant dishes and the flatbread is outstanding!

Atmosphere: Lovely! Great outdoor seating. Spacious restaurant with 2 bars.

Reservations: Easy to work with.

Parking: Stinks. They don't have valet often. When they do, it's $7. You have to pay event rates to park close to the restaurant. It is not an easy walk from non-event parking areas. This is a big issue for us wanting to eat there when we are NOT going to an event; like the last 2 times we were there.
