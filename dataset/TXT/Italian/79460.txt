d1_Ko1DQ4QyB9BjnCFjVLw wow wow wow ...... wonderful food!!!

first time customer ......

today I ordered the build your own with spaghetti squash - olive oil / garlic - bacon - goat cheese 

- being gluten free (not by choice) this was a much healthier alternative to gluten free pasta 

my husband chose chicken piccata and he was very pleased with his choice 

we will be back!!
