n9BrA1zIwlbiP1hLAc24jg Went here for baptism party. We ate the: calamari, Caesar salad, romana salad, carbonara, bolognese, margherita pizza, brasato pizza. My favorite was the brasato pizza! The braised beef, sunny side egg and wild mushrooms in it was delicious! The crust tasted really good! I normally don't eat Italian food because I find not too many places get the sauces right. But this place got all the sauces right in all the right ways! Atmosphere was warm and inviting. Decor is casual but also modern and homey. I love the long tables. Feels like I'm having a family meal with an Italian family!
