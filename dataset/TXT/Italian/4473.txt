_mg5bYknpZgaWSfjQVmrJQ Husband and I decided to stop for some pizza and wings.
Thick pizza was OK but the wings were delicious! 

The restaurant has a nice fancy theme and the bar was beautiful. ( I only glanced)
The only thing that does not match is the employees!

For the restaurant looking very nice and elegant the hostess and servers were in jeans and running shoes?? One server even had a bandanna in her head!
It just didn't go together.
It made them look lazy and dirty.
