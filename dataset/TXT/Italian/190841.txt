PbyUiq4uk7ycJz0QujOQNQ My wife and I have gone to Lou's now for several years and still can't get over what a great value it is! Most meals include desert and beverage for a modest price. The best little secret in town is the Thursday night happy hour with half price drinks and appetizers. We also were impressed by the Thursday night entertainment. His sign said Eddy J and wow can he sing. We stayed and danced until closing. Don't miss this one!
