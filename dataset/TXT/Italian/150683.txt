klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw Had the filet sliders for breakfast and they were magnificent! Apparently they were featured on the food networks "best thing I ever ate" and I can see why! There are 2 sliders that have filet mignon, creamy spinach, and scrambled eggs. The "buns" are actually cheddar cheese biscuits. Delicious!
