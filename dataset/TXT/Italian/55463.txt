aidcfUzZLOjWgwlxfv3UlA Just moved to vegas from la. Thought I try this place across the street from where I live call Tony bigs pizza n pasta. This was one of the best pizzas I've had in a long long time. I asked from something special and they brought me a thin crust pepperoni and jalapeño with NO SAUCE and WOW. This pizza is freaking awesome. Like I said one of the best I've had. Definitely referred and place and to try their pizza. I'm am happy and will be ordering and eating from here many more times to come. Thanks Tony Bigs. Made my vegas move worth it so far.
