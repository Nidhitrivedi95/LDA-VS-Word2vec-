oX7lSVsg4j7-SrSZVGWVnA This restaurant is great!  On our last day in Glendale we wanted to find somewhere different to eat.  We heard about this place by word of mouth (Cleats Sports).  We are so glad they let us know about Bobbo!  The bread and oil dip served complimentarily was a great start.  We also ordered the garlic cheese crostini which was delicious.  For the main course I ordered the Parmesan Chicken Pasta which was plenty for 2 meals.  The chicken was amazing as well as the pasta and sauce.  My husband ordered Amy's Lasagna.  It was the best lasagna he has ever had.  The cheese just oozes out and the flavoring was out of this world.  Needless to say, the entrees left no room for dessert.  Last but not least, our waiter, Dominic--- did a great job.  He was very attentive and had a great personality.  We would absolutely recommend this restaurant and hope to stop back next time we are in the area.
