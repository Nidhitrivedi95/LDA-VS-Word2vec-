T7yKffTuhiIZclsgjfgowA This place is fantastic! My girlfriend and I dropped by here to pick up a pizza. The guy who greeted us was super friendly, and talked with us while we waited for our pizza. He had a great story - came to Toronto from Italy five years ago - and really made us feel welcomed in the city.

The pizza itself was awesome! We didn't have to wait long for it (10 min). It had a great thin crust. All of the toppings were high quality. I grew up in Chicago, so I know my pizza - this is up there with some of the best I've ever had.

Would definitely return. Great food, and nice staff. All the employees - including the chefs - waved to us and thanked us as we left!
