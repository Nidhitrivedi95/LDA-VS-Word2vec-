eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg Food delicious, staff has issues.  The barmaid and wait staff bickering in front of us at bar.  After being seated our waitress was absent minded and kept forgetting what we ordered. Asked for a water refill took her 20 minutes after she walked by twice and I asked again.  Recommend staff service training.  But the food was good.
