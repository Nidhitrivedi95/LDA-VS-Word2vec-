eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg We've been here twice now during a regular trip to Vegas for business.  This last time I had the Spinach & Pear Salad.  Amazing!!! (Baby spinach, Bosc pears, tomatoes, caramelized pecans, Gorgonzola and balsamic vinaigrette)  Then I finished it off with their gorgeous thin crust Margherita pizza fired up in the brick oven behind the bar.  Normally at an Italian place I would go for a nice pasta dish but this hit the spot PERFECT.  That salad was amazing!  We ended the night with a leisurely stroll for the downtown Fremont Experience that only this off the strip location can offer.  SO worth the short drive off the strip!  I only wish I had room for their ginormous desserts.  Next time...
