_ecuzP8HBsuQfYy7IR8Jyg This place is amazing. The wine list will not disappoint and I recommend the sexton Zinfandel. At $10/glass it's a bargain of a full bodied wine with an everlasting finish... Then came the crab cake (singular, yes) but very worth the flaky delicate real lump crab you get to enjoy. For dinner, the truffle sacchetti pasta will blow you away. I have to say, it is one of the best 10 meals I've ever had. The sacchetti are handmade pillows of flaky cheesy goodness served up in a truffle sauce that swims with sautéed mushrooms, tiny potatoes, and sun dried tomatoes. If I'm waxing eloquent it's because the decadence of this meal can stand for nothing less. To tone it down a bit, my fiancé had the margarita pizza and, as this is definitely not a pizza place, it didn't blow our minds. However, I certainly wouldn't rate this place based on their pizza. Rate it on their wine, their crab cakes, their delicate pillowy pastas--that's what I did. Five stars baby. Oh, and the service was great, too. We sent our compliments to the chef and he came out to thank us. That's how you win repeat customers.
