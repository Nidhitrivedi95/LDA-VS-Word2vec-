GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ Royale burger is big, greasy, cheesey, oniony and perfect in almost every way after a couple of long nights in Vegas (or probably before a couple of long nights in Vegas for that matter too!). 

Better than average beer selection and plenty of seating make this a cool spot.  

I had the fries and they were only ok.  Everyone on here seems to like the onion rings so I will try those next time.
