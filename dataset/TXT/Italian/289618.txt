ZtJ6sTq7-5rL9ORUtQJHAQ Wonderful dinner.  Gaettano is amazing.  He basically ordered for us.  Great apps with prosciutto and figs as well as the beet ravioli.   Wines were great and the prawn risotto was on tonight.  The chicken Marsala was great too.  The Marsala wine sauce was the best I have ever tasted.  My friend went with the tried and true chicken Parmesan  and was not disappointed.   We ended with the famous coffee after dinner drink that will surprise everyone that gives it a try.   Do not miss it.
