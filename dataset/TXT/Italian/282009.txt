YXvXE2p6xeg6a11SMIjQ3w Went for the first time this past Tuesday 8/18/15. Had never been to the other locations. First of all, the decor is very aesthetically pleasing (it's beautiful inside) or waitress Alexis was super attentive and informative. We had the little Jon 20 inch thin crust pizza  (there was only 2 of us) they gave us half the pizza and kept the other half warm in the back (amazing!) We also split the spinach salad, the raspberry vinegarette(sp?) Was amazing,  I usually hate the sweet dressing, but this was so wonderfully balanced I loved it. Great addition to downtown!
