FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA I had dinner with my girls on a Monday for the $20 bruschetta and wine. The ambiance speaks for itself, the food is absolutely delicious. But. Let me just say this, Michael Rhodes is amazing! The two times I've been to this location, I've been blessed to get this awesome spirit both times to wait on me. He was well versed in his wines, recommended great selections from the menu, and wore a smile like no other. Thank you for your great service and food!
