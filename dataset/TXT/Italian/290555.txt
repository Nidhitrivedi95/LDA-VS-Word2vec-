ZvtELJTUOh0yRrPxyyiakQ We had to wait to be seated. Wait time for a party of more than 10 was around 45 minutes. I read the reviews before and anticipated the wait. Sat at a table with the high/bar chairs which are uncomfortable for me but seems to be the newest décor in most restaurants. Had the Boom Dip and The Sproccoli with Sausage. The Boom Dip was very good and impressed the other in our party. Asked for extra chips and made for a good appetizer. The wait time for the appetizer was approx. 30 minutes. Would have this again when visiting. 

The pizza was very good and freshly made. I would like to think that the reason why it takes so long for your order is because everything is prepared after you order, but I am not sure. In any event, as the previous reviews indicate, you will have to wait before having a meal. Wait times for all of the meals was different. Perhaps a light snack or even a Snickers before going? Also not sure if they take reservations but the food is tasty and good portions. Floridino's, Spinato's, and Nello's are good competitors.
