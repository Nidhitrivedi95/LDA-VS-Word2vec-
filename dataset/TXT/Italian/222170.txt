SgSVJWgMwFteYyz4OlHu9Q When I walked in the woman was on her cell phone texting and it took about a minute before she noticed me. She was nice once she saw me but then the phone rang, another worker answered and it was a personal call. So while chit chatting on the phone she proceeds to slowly grab my pizza out of the oven. It was rather annoying but lets get to the food. Medium Supreme. I loved the dough. It had a sweetness to it but not a ton of cheese. Also had an order of medium wings. YUUUMMMYYY. Ill return maybe try a Stromboli next time.
