UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ Calzones are huge and delicious. Love the deluxe/meat calzone and the white/spinach. Bread/dough is really good and their red sauce is really tasty too. Hubby's favorite is the pizza muffins (which are more like pizza rolls rather than muffins). He makes happy food noises as he eats them. :)

We typically pick up food to go, but  have eaten there several times too. Your typical family restaurant. They have a few TVs up and I think are trying to catch the happy hour/sports fans. Servers are friendly.
