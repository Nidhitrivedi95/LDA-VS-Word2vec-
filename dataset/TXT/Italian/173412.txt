N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg Ok think it's time for a review after dining at Lou's for 4 times. Yes 4 times because I loved the pizza so much!  Heck even went two times in a week. Why do I keep coming back, well the pizza of course. I find myself craving Chicago deep dish pizza more than any other pizzas. I'm so glad that we are finally getting real Chicago pizza here in the valley. I just read that more authentic Chicago pizza joints are coming here. I really think they waited to see how much success Lou's is having and by the packed house every night they having much success!

Now on to my experiences. First I was leery of the long waits I've read about. But it's really not that bad. You can check in at the host stand then you can put your pizza order. So if the wait is long, by the time you actually sit down the wait for the pizza is not long at all. This is a great idea! I've been to a local pizza restaurant here in the valley and had to wait an hour for a seat..the. 45 mins for pizza. This way of ordering is much more efficient and enjoyable. 

Now for the pizza, we seem to order the classic with extra sauce each time. Recently we ordered a pepperoni with the butter crust and that was amazing! So much pepperoni! Probably not the most healthy but wow who cares. I'll just spend an extra hour at the gym the next day. 

Overall it's a great restaurant. I've even been here with my "Chicago Friend" and he gives it a thumbs up.lol.
