aqrTv6QiU0J9Sxm_T--c5g My wife and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary dinner at La Torretta Ristorante. It was an outstanding experience!! The ambiance was charming. The food (we are vegetarians) as well as the wine selections were excellent. The service was great - Darius served our table and was knowledgeable, attentive and funny! There is so much pride in service and in how the food is prepared and served. We highly recommend La Torretta Ristorante for special occasions, as well as anytime you feel like having good Italian food with outstanding service.
