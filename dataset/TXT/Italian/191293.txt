PebX-Sf_h4FJGgsRAA5Fng I've been to La Calabria numerous times. For me, I enjoy stopping by later in the evening on a Friday, around 8:30 or so. The service is always good and I typically ask Giovanni what he recommends that day. I've never been disappointed and will continue to go back and support this local restaurant.
