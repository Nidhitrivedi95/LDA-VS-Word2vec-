Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA Tried this place out tonight since we were at the Linq playing tourist. The hostess really didn't want to be there and wasn't at all nice, but she wasn't rude. The server was really nice and friendly though. We ordered 2 pizzas, 2 beers and 2 kids drinks.  The pizzas were about 12" size but where really good! Delicious. But each pizza was around $16.50-$17.50! For a 12" pie! Yes, I know we are in the strip. It's like Disney land. I get it. But our bill came out to $56 + $12 tip= $68!  For 2 small pizzas and 4 drinks!  Wouldn't be complaining if they put size of pizza on their menus. We sat down ordered drinks and then found out the size. If you're a local try them out on Tuesdays when locals get 15% off. Definitely a tourist trap.  3 stars for the server being great and tasty expensive pizza. -2 for not placing size of pizza on menu with those crazy prices.
