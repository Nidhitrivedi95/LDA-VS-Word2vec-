TcWlYyRE_qggTBAutEfSoQ What a hidden gem.  Food quality is incredible. This is not a "high end" dinning place but the food and the service make it feel that way.  To the person that commented that a place where the entrees cost $25.00 dollars should have more than 10 different wines in stock, really??? $25.00? Have you ever been to a "fine dinning" place? In fact, they have 60 different kinds of wine. One of the staff, Leon, is as anal as I am. He makes sure all the labels on the wine bottles are placed on the racks so that they are the right side up and all the same level. The prime rib burger is one of the best I have ever had. I haven't been disappointed in the other menu items either. That have Confit Chicken Wings, done in duck fat and all!!!  I normally sit at the bar, but if I'm in with my girlfriend, then the booths give me the right amount of intimacy. I don't need to see what others are doing around me, I'm there with my girlfriend and need to pay attention to her. Give this place a try and you will not be disappointed. What a difference from when it was "The Bull and Finch" back in the early 2000s.
