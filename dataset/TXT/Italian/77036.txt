cXgXRqB40CGHEMKQgxLDTg Guy cooking the  pizzas wasn't required to wear gloves,he was picking at his eyes, rubbing his beard and arms, I complained,they asked him to go wash and stop doing that,but argued that he didn't actually touch the pizzas. I waited in a long line and noticed he touched each pizza, then a phone call to the business and he burnt about 11 pizzas four of them were mine, they offered to cut off the burnt crust, omg. So when I got home with these pizzas my family called to complain and they said they canceled the transaction and I wouldn't see the debit on my account, but sure enough it's there. Would love to hear from the owners how they can spin this
I have been there other times and the pizza was good, but they claim they can't hear you over the divider so the pizzas don't get home with toppings I request.
