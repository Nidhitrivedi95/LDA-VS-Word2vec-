rtYKSdUHpQO2Nyqy1-uAsQ Great place with excellent service every time. Food can take a bit longer to prepare when it's busy but is definitely worth the wait. Large and tasty veal and chicken cutlet sandwiches. Only downside is that certain toppings have an extra charge but the quality is definitely present. Burger combos are a good value as well. Will continue to visit!
