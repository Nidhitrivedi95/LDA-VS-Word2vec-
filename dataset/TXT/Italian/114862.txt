GnODIDJz09LecpudDoynCg I grew up with an Italian mother and a wide assortment of great family-owned Italian restaurants in my hometown. I was thrilled to find a place in Madison that reminds me of home. 

We shared the imported antipasto platter (delicious), and I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs for the entree. The sauce? Perfect. The meatballs? Tender and flavorful. And thank god for a restaurant that doesn't cook its pasta to death. 

Even though I was entirely too full by the time I finished dinner, I am so glad I saved room for cannoli. Hands down, this was the best cannoli I ever had. The shell was perfectly crisp, and the filling had a ton of flavor. 

And hey...the house cocktails were fantastic, and our waiter was attentive and genuinely pleasant. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
