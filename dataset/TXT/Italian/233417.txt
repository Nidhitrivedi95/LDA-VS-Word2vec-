TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q I just visited their new location at 7th Street and Missouri.  The baked spaghetti calzone (with meatballs and ricotta cheese) put me into a wonderful afternoon food coma.  The personal size is more than enough for a filling lunch, but you need to get the regular size if you want to take some leftovers home.  They have such amazing food and they have a beautiful new building now too!
