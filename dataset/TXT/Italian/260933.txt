Wppq3ceZDMNCr24X4i-kfw So excited to see something a little different in the neighbourhood but was a touch disappointed. Service was great. Arugula salad was lovely but I found the deep fried pizza tasted a little like the oil had been sitting there awhile. A little off putting. And not enough of anything on the margherita pizza. Wine was ridiculously overpriced.  Kind of turned me off. No urge to go back. Too many great pizza places in Toronto to put up with that.
