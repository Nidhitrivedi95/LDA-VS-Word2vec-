ewEDv_q-K0fV0FepkHB8sA This is my Go-To downtown Madison fine dining establishment. The main dining room is so unexpectedly Northwoods Cabin feeling! It's like dining in a log cabin with no windows.....but in a good way!

Went on a Sunday evening, when the daily special is herb chicken with dressing, potatoes, & green beans. It comes with bread, veggie/olive relish tray (in a glass) plus your choice of soup or salad. That's a huge amount of delicious food for a very reasonable price! After devouring a huge wedge salad, I could barely eat my chicken dinner. On the plus side: they neatly pack up your leftovers. 

My dining mate tried the pork tenderloin with cherry sauce. He said it was decent but not exciting.  He started with the soup of the day: cream of wild mushroom with blue cheese...he enjoyed it.
We were a little surprised both the soup & salads AND the two main meals took a bit too long to arrive. But the servers were very attentive and apologetic for the  delays.
