WCqcYtJ4rUxA4bIzjOfzqg Was funny. It took me some time to understand what's going on here. The place is right for dates, not for romantic dinners. The way they works is for me a little strange, but the food is really good. The bar is a little far and you need to go there anyway if you want something to drink. The wine menu is rich and you can buy even the bottle!!! And them go back to your table. So, the way you pay at the en is more than strange, you pay drinks on the bar and pay for food on reception (((( I don't know who is idea was but it's bad.
