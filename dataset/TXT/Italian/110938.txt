G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Phenomenal!!!  Words cannot quite convey the excellence of our meals.  We had a reservation, but it took about 15 minutes to get seated.  The only negative. 
Reisling...excellent!!  My husband had the destroyer and he liked it.  Pineapple juice for our son.
Starters...orzo meatballs and lobster ravioli.  Amazing!!  Some of our favorites of the meal.  
Bread...soooo good!  Breadsticks, rosem
ary focassia, and cheesey crackers.  
Surf & Turf...yummy!  The prawns, filet, asparagus, and gorgonzola mashed potatoes were all cooked perfectly.  A great choice!
Lamb...my husband loved it.
For the boys...they specially made them spaghetti with red sauce with a side of orzo meatballs.   They liked it and ate every bite.
Highly recommended!!!
