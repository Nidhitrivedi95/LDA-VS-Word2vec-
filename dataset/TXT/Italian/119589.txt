The pizzas we got (Margherita and especially the Funghi Misti) were pretty good... but the Rigatoni... it was served raw in my opinion.  It was crunchy in the middle.  We tried telling our server but he made it sound like it was meant to be undercooked because that's how the real Italian makes it.  He then took the pasta back and made it sound like he was doing us a favor by cooking it a bit longer.  What a snob?!?! I know some people undercook the pasta just a bit for better texture.  But what we got was not undercooked a bit... it was undercooked a whole LOT.
