knyRhFaM4Bwa8AldEbOiqw Two people, two small pizzas & two beers.  And here I thought we were an "easy" table...

My pizza was brought to our table after a short, but reasonable wait.  My dining pal's?  NEVER CAME.  After waiting 15 minutes longer (and my pizza getting pathetically cold), he went to the counter and asked here the grub was.  Unapologetically, we were told the "ticket got lost" and that a new one would be out in 5 minutes.  For it to be "lost", it sure is curious how the cashier knew exactly what he had ordered.

Ugh... so finally the second pizza came out, again without any apologies or concessions.  By this time, my pizza was straight-up cold.  Boo.

If your order doesn't fall into the abyss, you can expect delicious, heavily-topped (like I like it) pizza in a very clean, but familiy-friendly setting.  They serve beer and wine by the bottle and individual-serving wine bottle, respectively.

I haven't tried them out for lunch, but the deals are smokin' - I think less than $3 for a slice + a soda.
