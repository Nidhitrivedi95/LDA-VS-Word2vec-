Pt4rt1u_5KuS_NSMqerG_Q OK, where did I start? I logged onto their web site where they have a menu and pricing. The family and I made our choices and I placed the call. Ironically the$34 worth of food I choose wound up coming to $52? When questioned I was told the pricing on the web site was wrong. Nice, the $18 over charge wasn't worth fighting the family on new restaurant. I keep getting conflicting pricing when on the phone, so when the food came I asked for an itemized receipt which the delivery guy didn't have. Now lets get to the food.We ordered 20 wings which were flavor less and rubbery. We ordered a taco pizza which was like a cheap frozen pizza with stale nachos on top? Greek salads were with little toppings, but the lettuce was fresh. The meal was finished off with baklava and the not so free Ice cream the website promised. To sum this up this was honestly the worst food I've ever had from a pizza place, and I was clearly overcharged by any standards. Stay away, and don't be bamboozled like I was.
