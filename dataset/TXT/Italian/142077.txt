JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A In the 90s, I was all about 7 West after a solid night at some second rate martini night at a deep-house club. Then I got back into my metal roots in the 00's and it became all about the Shanghai cause that was next to The Bovine, where I boozed away my early twenties. In high school, I used to work on papers and study on their tiny third floor patio that was semi-covered in the winter and always a smoking area, even though it was covered.

Essentially it's three narrow floors of a café, with a nicer restaurant on the bottom floor. But what's really good is that it's open 24-7 which is nice when you need a café style sandwich at 4am. The crowd for the late night is usually a mix of drag queens, club drunks and just those late night people who love things like internet cafes and seem to just hang out all the damn time; chatting and drinking tea in oversized cups. My top pick is their tuna melt. That's the jam right there for sure.
