qcDMMcAYuGRT5iyic1pIbw The last three orders from this Pizza Hut delivery have been incorrect. The first they forgot my 2 liter. 2nd was pizza not well done as requested. Then 3rd Was Tonight, forgot an order of breadsticks, I ordered two. The first order was a half of order. I also did not receive the sauce with the breadsticks. 
When I called and complained that this was the third time they screwed up my order, the manager was able to send a free food item this time when I asked. It took an hour for both breadsticks and free item to be delivered because they were down again to one driver.
Overall food tastes like normal Pizza Hut. Make sure you check your orders.
