M1hEQVMiND1rbiT8mo2j0g I've been in Vegas many many times but exploring new restaurant like this was gonna make me feel happy on my last day in Vegas. What brought me was my friend has a groupon to this place. I ordered a eggplant parmesan and waitress comes back and said they were out. What kind of restaurant runs outta food and its dead in there. I ordered chicken parmesan instead, that chicken was so rough and there were so little spaghetti, its like they buy chickens from Safeway and smeared marinara to call it a day. I kept asking for garlic breads 3x with 2 different people and never came. As a outta towner, dont ever come in here. Major disappointment. I have way better experience elsewhere. Should've follow my instinct and go to Holsteins in the Cosmopolitan, like I always do.
