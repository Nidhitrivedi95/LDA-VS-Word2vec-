cOWXtCz7F9GQhPIks8gm6Q Very cool place. I absolutely enjoyed everything about this place, from the salad to the service I received. I actually bought a $20 groupon that was worth $40. I ordered a simple salad, a margherita pizza, and a flat iron steak that comes with potatoes and mushrooms. Excellent choices! The ingredients were fresh and made the plates very savory. I would recommend this place for anyone. Absolutely fantastic! And to top it off, when you check in with yelp, you even get a free dessert. I was a little disappointed that they ran out of tiramisu, but was able to order three flavors of gelato which was pretty good.
5 out 5!
