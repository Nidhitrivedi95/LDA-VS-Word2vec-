Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA I got into my hotel after a whole day of traveling and having nothing to eat, so I was starving. I basically went onto yelp and chose the pizza place that had the best deal/reviews/veggie options that delivered. Joes came up (out of a good 10+ other pizza joints in the area!), so I went with them. I called them, made my order, and it was done. I was kind of suspicious that they didnt mention what the price was going to be, but I figured that a two topping veggie pizza couldnt be that expensive.

The delivery boy showed up to my hotel room pretty promptly, but the bill was for over $25! I couldn't believe it, thats more than twice what I regularly pay back home (in Los Angeles mind you, where nothing is cheap!), so I was very disappointed there. The pizza was pretty good though, but I dont think I would ever pay that much for a pizza again if I can avoid it! Next time I'll just walk around the corner to the other pizza place and give them a try.
