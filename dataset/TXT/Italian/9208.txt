On my second visit we went with another couple that had an Entertainment Book coupon. The staff wouldn't allow us to sit together and use both coupons. (Only one coupon per table, they said, although that wasn't specified on the coupon.) So our friends had to sit at a table next to us and we shouted at each other to have a conversation. Ridiculous.

Plus their highly touted banana bread reeks of artificial banana flavoring, not fresh bananas; and their special potatoes (served instead of standard hash browns) are like thick, hard, and slightly greasy potato chips.

I don't get the couple of enthusiastic reviews here. Perhaps they have a storied past, but for a Vegas newcomer (two months) this isn't even up to a Denny's standard.
