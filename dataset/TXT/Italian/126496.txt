hSU3MbB9Yu8MlybxfmABeg Maxi's is a good choice if your trying to decide which restaurant to go to in Cleveland's Little Italy. Food and service was great. We went off a previous Yelp review regarding the Calamari appetizer and we are glad we did... VERY GOOD! My boyfriend had the Chicken Picatta, which was delicious and I ordered the Ravioli w/ goat cheese..also delicious. My only complaint about the restaurant is we sat in the back where they had the TV on which didn't meld so well with the music playing overhead.
