0aw3HbxkZ4G7pkPYt10fhA I really like Olive Garden but when you are spending $50 dollars on a simple dinner for two.... I expect the service to match the price point.... How does the server not know the specials.... Try to refill a drink they never served... Check in only once... Hesitant in bringing more salad....  The food was acceptable but why did I get FAST FOOD SERVICE at a upscale price point restaurant!
