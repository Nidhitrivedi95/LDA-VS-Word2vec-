H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g This is one of my family's favorite restaurants in Vegas!  I don't each much pasta, but I love the homestyle pastas and handmade thin pizzas here. The food is always satisfying without being too trendy or showy. I may be in the minority, but I'd eat at Otto over Bouchon any day. 

Otto is pretty packed all the time and the servers area always running around, but they are knowledgeable of the menu, what ingredients are in the dishes and if you ask, they will recommend wines to pair with entrees. I like that they don't try to upsell you on items.  Some stand out dishes are the seafood diavola, osso bucco and the margherita pizza. A nice touch is the special pastas and bruchettas they serve daily and those are listed on the back of the main menu.   On Sunday, they had a ricotta bruchetta with pesto and almonds.  I had never had the combination before and it was a wonderful starter.  The pesto was super garlicky which I love and with the housemade ricotta the flavors were strong and balanced.  Desserts here are amazing. Try them all!  I liked the strawberry shortcake best.  Though a year ago, they had a fig or date shake that no one liked but me. LOL.  

It is also nice that there is tons of people watching to be done from the outdoor area.  Great food and entertainment, too. Win-win!
