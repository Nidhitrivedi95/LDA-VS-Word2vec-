UP7ejOl-PQyWZ9iFRQD8Xw My daughter and I wanted the menu selection of the Queen Street Il Fornello, and that has recently closed, so we tried out the Danforth location. The choices are significantly greater. Kelly had a lovely Margherita pizza with fresh basil and buffalo mozzarella. She saved some to take home to her boyfriend because it was so tasty. The waitress could not tell me if the sea bass was from a sustainable source. I opted to have it as I felt that if there is demand, awareness will continue and we will harvest the fish responsibly. I hope this is not naiive. The fish was cooked to perfection but the cut was meagre. The escarole assemblage was delightful and old school, like Nana used to make. The place had a noisy end-of-the-week vibe, with lots of multi-generation groups. Eating from marble topped tables with the intimacy of incandescent filament bulbs and a generous number of atypical booth seating enhanced our experience. I had a glass of the Malbec which was an enjoyable accompaniment to the fish.
