Since we had to eat before everything closed, we decided the best way was to have our concierge find us a place in the Palms and to get us table service at a club in the hotel.

Anyway, when I was told about this place, I was expecting it to be overpriced (although worthwhile for the convenience) mediocre food.  Admittedly I was a bit surprised.  The restaurant is high up on one of the towers of the Palms, and has great views of the Strip and the city, so that was a good start.  The food was all pretty good.  I had ravioli, but I tried items that my friends ordered, including tortelini, sea bass, and bone-in fillet steak.  Everything was really tasty here, and so my mediocre expectation was shattered.  It was still a bit overpriced, with dishes running from $25-45, but I was satisfied with the meal.  It's worth it for the atmosphere here, if you're looking to splurge a bit.
