oryS4vX0xkKC4tOekgowDQ We really love the Spaghetti Factory but we're disappointed with our most recent experience.  First the positives - our waitress was quite attentive and friendly with the kids, which we appreciate.  She also got the bill right which sounds basic but more often than not is an issue.  The opportunities - the kitchen was not on its game, unfortunately.  The broccoli with mizithra was cold in places. Disappointing.  And the pasta with mizithra had very little browned butter sauce. Equally disappointing.
