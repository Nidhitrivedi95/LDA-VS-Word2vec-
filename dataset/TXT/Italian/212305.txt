r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA I'm in love! We ordered The "Centurion" pizza and lasagna - brought it all home, cracked open a bottle of Italian wine and oh.my.goodness.  The pizza was FANTASTIC and the lasagna wasn't too shabby either!  The store itself carries some unique items - imports - that I haven't seen at other specialty stores in the area.  Defalco's is absolutely worth a stop - check it out!
