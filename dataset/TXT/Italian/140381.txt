JknT98CaJAfBPg6cxBn3iw Pretty cool, 90 seconds to cook your pizza at 900 degrees... Unfortunately it's also about 900 degrees inside (air conditioning a necessity for longevity..). 
The oro pizza was excellent, be really nice not to be hounded for TIPS on everything nowadays.. Expensive enough as it is to eat out, felt since 'tude for not tipping. Sorry $20 for a medium sized pizza is a lot of money. One time visit at these prices, if it was $10-12 we'd definitely go back.  Great to see this and Tich (next door), these area totally blows, dumpy and ugly. They could bulldoze most of Lake shore around here.
