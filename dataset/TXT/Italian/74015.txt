cOWXtCz7F9GQhPIks8gm6Q While planning an MLK Day viewing of "Selma" at the AMC Esplanade, prior Yelp reviews & an OpenTable reservation guided a friend & me to Solo Trattoria. We were both quite pleased with the dining & service experience. Starting with the Stracciatella soup (a new culinary excursion for me) & the two of us each having the Prosciutto & Peas pasta, the food was quite flavorful & abundant, and 'Drew (aka Neal McDonough) was extremely attentive & helpful. I returned after to the film to decompress & enjoy a glass of wine (with the intent to return to Old Town Scottsdale & Hula's Modern Tiki). Five hours & several glasses of fantastic vino later, I finally made my escape. Jon, 'Drew, & Eli are all three vino knowledgeable, and Solo Trattoria's wine list is designed with great complexity & character. Looking forward to returning on Wine Wednesday to further explore their vino offerings.
