G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q What a wonderful surprise breakfast! We were looking for something delectable and close by when we stumbled across this gem. Our server Stephanie was bright and cheery, she took phenomenal care of us. I ordered the caprese fritata, it was perfectly cooked with ripe tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. I desperately wanted to finish it all but was stuffed after sneaking a few too many zucchini straws from my hubby's plate. We can't wait to try Giada again, maybe for brunch next time!
