21sGRVR7HEs_t6PdB9tGMw Wonderful service and comparable prices to other pizzeria's in the area. Used to order from La Familia pizzeria on Durango, until the service I received over the phone was unacceptable. The opposite is true for Angelina's, phone service is A+, delivery fee is kind of high but it's because of my far location I assume. Great food and desserts. I would r ecommend :)
