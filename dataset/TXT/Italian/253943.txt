vUDqNV3RhI3FmZRwS7039g Ok, based on my first experience at Bobby's, I was not overly enthusiastic to come back.  However, last weekend some friends and I decided to hit it up for happy hour, and I will admit that this visit was decidedly better than the first one.  In fact, if I were rating on this visit alone, I'd be giving it a 4 star review.  However with the previous memory in mind, I'll meet in the middle and call it a solid 3.  Our server was charming and was right on top of our orders, appearing just when the drinks were low enough to order more.  She even stopped by right before the happy hour cutoff to make sure we didn't need anything else before the prices jumped.  The live music was good, if not a little loud.  The food was pretty good, although nothing overly exciting to write about.  I had the mozzarella and marinara (which I thought would be in the form of mozarella sticks) but was in fact a large square of breaded mozarella that needed to be cut into bite sized pieces, and was a little too light on the marinara topping in my opinion.  Overall, the experience was much more pleasant, the service excellent, and the food tasty, and the drinks delicious (I am a FAN of their dirty martini).  I'll definitely come back again and see if we can't boost it up another notch after #3.
