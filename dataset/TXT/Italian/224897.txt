sN0EFTle0pW77DUgl8i-Rw This restaurant is a unique Italian restaurant even for north of Toronto.  The owners and menu is from the Amalfi Coast of Italy, so not the same old Italian menu.

The place is fairly small and packed most weekends.  Not the greatest place for kids because of the small confines.  The staff are sophisticated and knowledgeable.  One time I was here my wife asked to have shrimp to one of the dishes. The owner came out and suggested that we don't do that because they cannot promise that this will taste as good after being modified.   He appeared to be somewhat insulted by the request. Some might be put off by such service, but this is exactly what I expect from an authentic Italian restaurant and I was quite impressed.

Food is superb quality.
