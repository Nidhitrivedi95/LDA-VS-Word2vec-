wV6Nle04jS8I40tUHPUiiQ Went for dinner at Humble Pie at 39th Avenue and Happy Valley Road today with my family for Father's Day.   What a disappointment.  The service was poor and those of us that ordered hamburgers had to wait until everyone was half way through dinner before we got our food.  And we ordered before everyone else! On top of that our hamburgers were overcooked, the buns were dried out, and the orders were all wrong.  Even the appetizers came out late.  If we wanted anything we had to ask for it multiple times.  Definitely would not return or recommend this place.
