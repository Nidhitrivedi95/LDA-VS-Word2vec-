drn7B6q9_LsUfUbgpgxh2A I am a big fan of Pizza and for me this particular pizza brings back memories from when I was a kid and my parents bought Pizza Pizza for dinner. The smell of the pizza is what triggers those memories. 

I like the staff here they are super friendly and always welcome you with a smile, especially the young lady that works the cash register. The service is what really brings me back. I am on a first name basis with the staff.
