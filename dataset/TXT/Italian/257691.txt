w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A Im a frequent customer of metro pizza horizon ridge however the 1st time i have an issue they do nothing to resolve it and for that they lose my business. I called to order a pizza and a girl takes my order clearly she is new and tries to charge me $10 more than it is. i had to call her out and she gave me the correct number after placing me on hold. Then it took her 5 mins to input my cc number. She kept having me repeat it and putting it in wrong saying that the numbers were wrong. After 7 mins of being on the phone with his girl i asked for a mgr. an alleged manager gets on the phone doest say hi doesn't ask the issue just says whats your cc number. I give it to him and shocking it was correct he then said ok. I said is that it he said yes and  hung up. No apology no im sorry for your inconvenience nothing. Horrible customer service! No matter how good your food is if you dont have good customer service  i wish i could give this less than a star horrible and disappointing
