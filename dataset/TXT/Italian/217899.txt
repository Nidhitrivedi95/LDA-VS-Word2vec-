RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q Ahh...Spinato's, Spinato's, I love you.

I've only been here a few times and every time our waitress has been Maria.  (I'm embarrassed if this is not her name because this is what I've called her).  This waitress ROCKS!  She makes you feel like you are part of the family and yes, she actually has a personality.  She makes you want to return just so you can be waited on by her!  - Aside from the very enthusiastic and bubbly Maria, the food is wonderful!  My niece and nephew pretty much only like Italian right now, so I eat at a lot of Italian places.  The kids, including me, very much enjoy the food and service.  (yes, I mentioned the service again because it's worth mentioning!)  My favorite here is the Marguerite Pizza.  Yum Yum!  Also, if you can, try the canola.  It's not the best I ever had, but it's still pretty good.

Oh, and there's outdoor seating as well.  It's good for a small group get together, but nothing too large.
