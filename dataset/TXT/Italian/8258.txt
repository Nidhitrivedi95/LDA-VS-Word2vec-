0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw I adore this place!

Never even heard of Agritopia or Joe's Farm Grill, I was taken to this sweet, little hideaway on a sunny Saturday afternoon. The drive out is fun because you see lots of farmland, which is a nice scene away from the desert landscape. Tucked away on some very rich farmland, Joe's building is so futuristic and well-built into this ocmmunity that I could not stop just admiring the structure itself.

A pretty popular place for families on a Saturday afternoon, the line to roder was a bit long but worth it. Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives visited a few years back, and all of Guy's favs are highlighted on the menu. Flatscreens and projectors have slides of all the best foods to roder while you're waiting. The also sell YooWoo, so naturally I give this place 5 stars. 

I orded the BBQ Pork Sandich and my friends ordered a pizza and the onion rings.

THE ONIION RINGS ARE CAPITOL K KRUNCHY. And you must order them. With everything grown locally, basically a stone's throw away from Joe's, the food was so fresh and well made. A tad pricey but worth it. 

I cannot wait to go back.
