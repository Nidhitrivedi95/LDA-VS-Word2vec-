D1lAVtlav4atQTJnIvtcpw I've been here two times so far, and counting! The last time I was here was with some of my boo's many family members for a weekend lunch. We were lucky it wasn't very busy and we got a corner window table.

We decided to order a bunch of dishes to share - beet salad, calamari, a couple of pizzas, pasta carbonara, lamb, and of course, a bottle of Chianti (afternoon drinking FTW - there's a reason we all get along so well). Everything was pretty good! We all enjoyed the food and had a good time. I think my favourites were the calamari and the pasta.

The other time I was here was on a double date and again, we had lots of fun and enjoyed our meals. Consistently good times here so far!
