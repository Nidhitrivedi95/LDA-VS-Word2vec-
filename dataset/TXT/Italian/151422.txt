kp-FRmyPxjsAoEK1-21rSQ Had not been to Riccio's in many years my wife had never been and wanted to try it.Server was very attentive and friendly. Food was ok but not the best Italian I've ever had. The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste.My wife and I are both Italian and have eaten Italian food all over Charlotte and in Italy. The big surprise was the cost. For 3 people, one having the nightly special, one having pasta and the other having chicken, one appetizer and no alcohol was over $70! You don't even get a side salad with the dinner at that price! Very disappointed and won't be going back.....
