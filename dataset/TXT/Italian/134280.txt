iqntlaqSCB4hkzTzlPlEmQ I've visited this place a few times and decided to finally get around to writing a review. I didn't even know of the Bravo restaurant chain until I came to this one in Henderson.  If I had to sum up this place, I would say that it is a classy looking restaurant with a casual and friendly atmosphere.

The few times that I have been here, one of the managers - Adam would always come around and check on us a couple times throughout the meal to make sure everything was going well. He's got to be one of the friendliest people I've ever met. You can tell that he's a very family oriented person - he was very accommodating of our two sons and even went as far as helping us pack our leftover meals to go himself because we had our hands full. 

The menu is a 1 pager, but in my opinion - the best restaurant perfect the items on their limited menus! Their pizza is a hit with the kids, and their lobster bisque has got to be some of the best I've ever had. It's thick and has actual chunks of lobster in it, you can't beat it. 

I've had their Chicken Parmesan (which is a huge portion) and their carbonara with sunny side egg cracked on top (my favorite). I've never left this place hungry. 

They even give out pieces of dough for the kids to play with - they can create their own shapes and they'll bake it for you!

Great food, great service, great price. I'm giving this place a 5. Keep up the good work Adam!
