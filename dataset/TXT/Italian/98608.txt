ewEDv_q-K0fV0FepkHB8sA All Wisconsin steak houses R not created equal. Went w hi expectations and was disappointed.. Jamie our server was great. The bread, salad, veg were all first rate.  The hash browns were greasy and the t-bone had good flavor but was chewy. Walleye was good but overall not up to standards. Smokey in Madison and Schwartz's in New Holstein R far superior choices. I can't imagine trying it again
