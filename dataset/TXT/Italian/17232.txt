2alo9GzeOsbg4jeKYFQmxQ Danielle chose to have Santo's for her birthday dinner last night. it was my second time there. for some reason she just wanted pizza for her birthday. hey, her birthday - her choice. 
this time i had the Rigatoni with vodka sauce and sausage. it was really good, though i do tire of Italian sausage quickly if it's not in a hoagie bun w/ peppers and onions. the vodka sauce was delicious. i also had a cup of wedding soup.
Danielle got a pizza w/ pepperoni and banana peppers. also good. she got a salad w/ house Italian dressing and we shared some calamari. the calamari dipping sauce (marinara) was delicious and i was sopping it up with bread. 
our server was prompt though, not unfriendly, was sort of curt (is i guess how i'd describe her). nothing wrong with that. she wasn't mean or unfriendly. 
we've had good food each time we go and we'll definitely be back for more.
