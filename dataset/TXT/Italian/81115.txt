dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw Walked into MGM Grand's "The District" area (which I believe used to be called Studio Walk) on a Thursday evening with two coworkers. We had decided to just eyeball a few menus and see if we could get seated somewhere without reservations. After looking at the Craftsteak menu and deciding that, with coworkers, spending $120 per person just wouldn't be worth it, we opted for the more "business-friendly" Fiamma's. 

I'm glad we did. A very kind hostess greeted us and not only said she could seat us right away (again, without reservations), but gave us a couple choices of seating options. We're off to a great start. 

We were seated in a very comfortable table for four (even though we were only three) and had THE best view of Studio Walk [er, um, I mean The District]. This is significant because it's the absolute BEST people watching spot in the entire building. 

Professional service throughout. I ordered some ravioli with a side of parmessean asparagus. It was good and just filling enough. Almost went for one of the fine looking desserts, but by now it was getting late and my body clock was way ahead of the hour. So the appetite was fast disappearing. Next time...

The decor in this place is magnificent. Dark, intimate, and not too noisy. Some decent pop music playing in the background (think Ke$ha). It just has a very nice vibe. For me, the main draw of the place is the vibe and location. The food is good too, though. You cold do a lot worse. I'd certainly come back and bring my girl here. I think she'd like it. And I think you will too.
