UYJLWDj_jytplZEkjPe6sg I have gone to Olive garden for more years than most people have been alive. There salad has been A1 from day one. TONIGHT'S experience would be enough for me to NEVER EVER EVER NEVER go back there again. We had a gift card that we could have used at any of 4 different locations. We chose Olive Garden due to their PREVIOUS consistency of good food and great service. Tonight if I had not seen the sign I would have thought I was in a cafeteria at a roadside stop in the middle of nowhere. I had to BUS my own table after waiting 20 minutes and the server passed by us at least 4 times. When I put all the dirty dishes on the empty table next to where I had been standing waiting for 20 minutes she proceeded to bus that table. She had no name tag so I don't know her name. Finally someone came to wipe the table down. The server that waited on us offered us no drink refills, no salad but he was very generous with his I don't give a crap attitude. We used a $50 gift card that was truly wasted. If you have a Darden Company gift card, select any restaurant but Olive Garden and whatever you do, if you do go there, DO NOT SIT IN THE BAR area for food. . .unless you like bussing your own table and getting the worse service EVER. Bon apetit! Why is there no option for 0 ***
