We started with the cheese plate. You can choose between 3 or 5 cheeses. When the cheese plate arrives, you will notice the small portions..but they are rich, flavorful cheeses and the serving sizes are indeed appropriate. 

We both ordered the soup special, Minestrone. It was NOT minestrone. It was basically a few potatoes floating in pureed squash and pretty much void of flavor. We used the toasted bread from our cheese plate to dip in to the soup for some added flavor and texture. 

We also shared the mushroom ravioli with sautéed mushrooms and truffle butter sauce. It was delicious! It made up for the soup definitely. 

There is an extensive wine list...24 pages to be honest. There are also plenty of cocktails to chose from as well.
