bXbCGFk3ZjLcTdQQB-xPyQ I was visiting Charlotte and was not disappointed with their food. The calamari friti was easily some of the best I've ever had, they fry bell peppers with the calamari to give it an amazing flavor. Then for dinner I had their signature eggplant parmesan and let me tell you, THE BEST! It's better than my family's receive and the eggplant and pasta were cooked PERFECTLY. The tiramisu for dessert was to die for as well. I can't wait to come back here. My husband and father ordered their brick oven homemade pizzas, they both said it was some of the best pizza they've had.
