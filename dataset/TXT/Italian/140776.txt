JlMTixvNQ5bUGSxF12TLdw We were given a 1.75 hour delivery wait and we're about a mile away. So, decided to go pick it up. Not what you want to do on a hot day when you just arrived from driving a moving truck across the county, but that's another saga.
Other than that, the food was fine. Nothing spectacular. It'll do. The only reason we chose it was for delivery and that didn't work out.
