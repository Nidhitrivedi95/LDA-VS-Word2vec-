duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ While at Mandalay Bay to indulge in free shark reef tickets I thought this one would be worth it since the Yelp rating was high and the pictures of the patio tables did create quite the mood so why not right? I admit the flies buzzing around the outdoor area as we ate got annoying, but didn't factor that into the plan of the meal..Haha

Well the wife and I went for the American breakfast vs. the buffet..Note to one of the reviews I saw, the breakfast buffet is different on Saturday and Sunday because Sunday has the build your own omelette and Saturday does not..If that's a make or break then go on the right date!

So yeah I decided upon carrot juice which I was bummed didn't seem to be all you can drink, but it was definitely good none the less..I had scrambled eggs, bacon, and hash browns for the main attraction..I mean yeah nothing special to gawk  over, but at least it wasn't over or under cooked and it seemed like they are pro health so who am I to diss that?
