u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Great location and the bruschetta is amazing. If you can go for happy hour the wine and bruschetta combo for $20 is as good as it can get.  May I recommend the Malbec. The only downside to this location is the the music is louder inside so an intimate conversation would be difficult unless your on the patio. However I will continue to come back over and over again!
