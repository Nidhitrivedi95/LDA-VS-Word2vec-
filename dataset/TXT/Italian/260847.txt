wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g Service moves pretty slowly here, so I was hungry by the time our food arrived and was ready to dig into my big plate of gnocchi with lamb ragu. Imagine my surprise when, instead of settling on the table in front of me, the gnocchi went sailing to the floor, splattering the back of my cream colored shirt with red sauce along the way.

These things happen and I understand that. But I would have expected a real apology and some form of make good from our huffy waiter, who acted genuinely upset with me for being in the way of my falling food. So I waited for a new plate of gnocchi to arrive and enjoyed the group's company. After we paid our $1500 bill, I walked over to my waiter and quietly asked if there was anything he could do for my shirt.  Here I'm thinking maybe $80 towards a new shirt, a comped bottle of their mediocre house red or even $10 to get the shirt cleaned properly. Guess what I got? A towel with some soda water and a little more attitude.

This incident notwithstanding, we had a fine meal Canaletto. But overall I'd agree wholeheartedly with previous reviewers: the ambiance here is pretty good, the food here is fine, the service poor and overall the prices are about 3x what they should be for this experience. If you're going to drop $100 or more per person for dinner, there are dozens of great options to choose from in Vegas... and I just can't see putting this place on the list.
