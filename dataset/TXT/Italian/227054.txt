SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ This place is well positioned coming out of the Caesars casino onto the mall, but all else is average.
Appetizers were small and two of them barely stemmed hunger for a party of five. The food was really average for what you might expect. I had the lasagna and it seemed like it had been re-warmed and sitting on the plate for a while. Obviously microwaved at the last minute.
All other meals were just OK.
I expected better for the price. Keep walking.
