7S5iOI5Xb9cTUQLmBwCeXw Went there last night for the first time. A super busy Friday night at CityNorth; this place was almost empty, so I should have known better. The patio was almost empty, so I requested an outside table. The guy standing there said, and I'm not kidding, "We're expecting more people so I don't think there's room  out there." What?? And then he disappeared, leaving us standing at a table inside. The waitress looked like she wanted to be somewhere else and was quite abrupt. When she brought us our food, she plunked it down in front of us without one word, then left. No, do you need anything else? Or, how about some fresh cheese? Don't ask for fresh cheese, because this Italian restaurant just carries the fake stuff. And don't bother with bread. A table next to us had it, but our waitress couldn't be bothered to bring it, even after we asked. The food was very bland. I ordered linguini with clams and it came very creamy, which was odd. My friend had the pesto pizza, which looked great, but had surprisingly little flavor. I also had to flag down my waitress to get another glass of wine and a refill on water. Skip this place for sure!
