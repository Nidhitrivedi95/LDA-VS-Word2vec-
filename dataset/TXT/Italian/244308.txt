USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Amazing!! The decor was very cute and intimate in a repurposed house. The service was excellent - attentive without being intrusive and waiter gave great recommendations. We started with the scallops which were so good we had to order a second one. I had a lobster bisque which was good but I always think they have less lobster than I want and finally had the pork chops which was well seasoned and cooked. Wine selection was great but I went while I was pregnant so didn't actually try any. It is an upper scale restaurant so expect to pay around 100$ per person for appetizer, entree and drink. If that's not something you do day to day, it is still a great place to go for a special occasion. Loved it!
