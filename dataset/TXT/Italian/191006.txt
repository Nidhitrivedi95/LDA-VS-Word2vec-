pCWg4B0R5gauQR4SJ9VDmw driving down northern we saw this place and decided to give it a shot. the place is VERY small inside but luckily the weather was nice so we were able to eat at a table outside.   The sauce was really good and so was the cheese,  the pepperoni was really good also.  the pizza was cooked just perfect, not soggy, not too crunchy, i wish it was closer.
