j54J0Ky4ruVbN_NTJ3daFg Girasole is a great Italian restaurant in shadyside. Make a reservation. . . it gets crowded and hectic on Friday and Staurday nights. It's small on space but big on atmosphere from the neghborhood to the patio seating to the decor!  The gnocchi is fantastic. They have a pretty broad italian wine list and great deserts. Not too terible on the wallet. Only gripe is the small real estate inside which tends to lead to slightly cramped seating.
