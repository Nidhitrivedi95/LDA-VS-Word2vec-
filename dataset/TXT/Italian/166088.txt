They provided many menu options, and allowed for changes to suit our group's needs. The night of the event was beyond our expectations. Every detail was handled by their team, and we were able to enjoy our night. The food, the atmosphere, and the service were exceptional. We had a set menu that included mixed appetizers, salad, main course, and dessert. Every course was delicious, and the tiramisu was perfection. One of the best meals I've had in the West Island.

Every one of my colleagues commented on what a great night they had. I would definitely recommend La Verita if you are looking for somewhere to hold an event. I will surely be returning here with friends and family.
