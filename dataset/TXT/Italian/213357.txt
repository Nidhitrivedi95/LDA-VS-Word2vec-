R5SvHm0lJf3hlI9R-TTyAQ Went for dinner for 2 on a Tuesday night and was pleasantly satisfied.  The wine list is fairly large, with nice selections of wine by the glass if your partner would rather beer.  I have a hard time going anywhere and not ordering a cheese plate if offered (it must be my time living in Wisco) so, we started with the cheese and antipasto plate.  It was really good, with yummy meats and cheeses, accompanied with fig sauce and relished onions.  But the best part was the bread.   All together yummy and would make for a great stop after work downtown.

For dinner, I had the linguini in red clam sauce and my friend had the stuffed banana peppers.  As others have commented on, the portion size was smaller than typically expected, but frankly it was the right amount for anyone of a normal size (ie less than 250lbs) to get your fill.  The stuffed banana peppers were quite spicy, in a really good way, and the linguini was good, maybe not spectacular, but a staple.    

We did go on a Tuesday night fairly late (~8p), so I wasn't surprised there were only a couple of other tables there.  However, it did make for excellent service.  Our waitress was attentive and nice.
