pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw On my cab ride from the airport to the hotel, my cab driver told me this place was the best for pizza and that the founder was a James Beard awarded chef. When I first arrived I was told there was about a 30 minute wait, no problem since I knew it was worth waiting for. I couldn't have been waiting for more than 5 minutes when they called my name though! I can't remember the name of the pizza I ordered but it was a white pizza with caramelized onions and fennel sausage and it was pure heaven.
