u9R0_pvEkl7QGPJYH3j1sg 4.9 / 5. One of the best pizzas in Phoenix. Got the New York special and it was excellent. You have to eat it with a fork because the crust is very thin and can't support the weight of the toppings. The cheese is creamier than most. Toppings were very fresh and meat quality very very good. Not sure what they could do better. Definitely going back.
