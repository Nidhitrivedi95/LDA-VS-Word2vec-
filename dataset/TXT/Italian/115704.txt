gtfLQysuCBEAQk3wwWxwTg Viva Napoli does the best Neapolitan pizza in Toronto. period. No comparison to Libretto or Terroni, which have become too trendy. Sure, on a busy night, you have to wait a while, but it's worth the wait and the service isn't that bad. If authenticity and good pizza is what you're after (and really isn't that the point of eating, not picking on service?), then skip the imitators and go here.
