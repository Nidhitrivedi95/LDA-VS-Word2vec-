u9R0_pvEkl7QGPJYH3j1sg Im always looking for something outside the chain of restaurants . I placed a to go order on my way home from Costco and had the Pasta Carbanara. THe pasta has peas , panchetta , onions and a creamy sauce . It was so sinful but amazing. I will keep Times Square in mind for my next italian craving .
