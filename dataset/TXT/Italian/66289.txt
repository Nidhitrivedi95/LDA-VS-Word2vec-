bNO_c8Gka2Rkwaub3qVAMQ I went to Microtime for dinner on their first day of opening and boy I was impressed with the decor, service and food. The foods were delicious and exceeded my expectation. They were simple, fresh and delicious. 

My favourite was the seafood mix. The calamari fries and coconut shrimps served with lemon garlic aioli and chilli plum sauce were so damn good! The sauces complimented the shrimp and calamari perfectly. I'd rate this dish a 10/10! 

As for dessert, I had the lemon tiramisu. It was house made and recommended by one of the managers/owners. The tiramisu was an OMG. I was a little disappointed that it's called "lemon tiramisu" because I can hardly taste any lemon in it but it was still a good-solid-rich-and-creamy-but-light-at-the-same-time tiramisu. I ate the cream on its own and it was too much for me but when I ate everything together, it was yum! I'd rate it 9/10. 

I'd definitely recommend this place and I will be back for more! Keep up the good work Microtime Cafe!
