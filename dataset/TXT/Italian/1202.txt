-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q I'm sad to announce that after recently returning one two different occasions after a long absence, that and I have no idea what happened to this place.

First of all, the pizzas have gradually been shrinking for some time now, but now it's just not funny any longer. Sure, I had a good chuckle the first time, a slight smirk and a giggle the second time, the third time I may have grinned a little, but many times later.. now I'm just frowning. And who likes to frown?

And the quality seems to be inconsistent now. Don't get me wrong, I love a good char on my pizza, but there is a point where one receives too much char. The last order I received (during one of the few times they actually still accept and grace the plebes with pick-up orders), one pie was slightly undercooked and the other had an almost solid blackened crust on the bottom, which masked the taste of the toppings. Maybe if I had dined in and they were assured a tip, I would have received better a product? The slightly undercooked pizza was still very good and reminded me of how I once loved La Piazz', but both seemed to have skimped on ingredients from what I last remember.

I'll probably be back, though. Some day. Despite this escalated spousal abuse.
