CJvN2k3gjR7JspTx21icTQ Crust's new location opened recently (now on the main drag as opposed to a side street) and they've made some major improvements. Some new appetizers adorn the menu, and they have a full bar. Their pizza selection is the same as it's always been; interesting uses of goat cheese, truffle oil, and other non-standard toppings.

Their seating is greatly improved, too--place comfortably seats about 50 not including the bar.

It's just as good as Edison's, but for different reasons. You are doing yourself a disservice by not coming here.
