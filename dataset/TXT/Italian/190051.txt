P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw Best pizza on earth.  I usually hit the one on Paradise on the way to the airport but Arville is inside one of the best dive bars on earth.   See the reviews of Moon doggies for more info.  

This pizza is crazy good.  I live in Oakland California and we have good pizza but I always pine for Naked City.  The crust the cheese the farging sauce oh the sauce!   For some reason these cats make it to perfection and I can't get that anywhere else.  

Get to naked city pizza and get a sheet of cheese and sit at the bar with a big glass of beer and eat that pizza pie before I do!   Life is short, eat that pizza!

They deliver via postmates which freaking rules, but you should still go there in person and smell it while you wait for it.  Have a beer.  Talk to people.  And when it's ready have a slice or two at the bar and make people jealous!
