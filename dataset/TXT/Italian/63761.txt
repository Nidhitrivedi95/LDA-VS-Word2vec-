BaVtTt9pBoI8rrN35tsj_g The only reason I gave this location a star was because I had to. Called to make reservations for 8. Was told by the recording that for any reservations to go to their website to be added to the waitlist. Once we went to the website it stated that for any parties over 6 you needed to contact the restaurant via phone. When we called the restaurant they told us that they could not accommodate a party of 8 on Sunday nights. Called another location and they told us to come right down it was no problem at all. Called this location again and spoke to a manager who said she would get us a table but it would be an hour and a half wait. But we had already been on the phone back and forth for a half an hour. With all that being said that's pretty confusing right? My thoughts exactly. Clearly we ended up going to another location 10 minutes away that was able to seed us almost immediately.
