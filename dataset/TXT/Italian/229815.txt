TAoN9nsibXOxsOnnG7Kd_g I used to be a regular at Riazzi's years ago when I lived in Tempe.  I'm back in Tempe now and I was looking forward to being close to one of my favorite restaurants.  My, how things have changed.  

The food is still ok, but things are a bit dated.  The wine list is so-so, and the stemware is thick and horrible banquet quality.  Don't dare ask for a teaspoon, they don't exist here for some reason.  The servers I've had seem competent and the hostess is always a treat, but the bussers are useless and the manager struts around like he thinks he's Burt Reynolds.  All I've ever seen him do is sit at the bar, watch TV, and BS with the bartender.  Speaking of the bartender, if you sit down at the bar expect to be ignored unless you're a regular.  Also expect to see the bartender BS with all the male servers but berate the female servers and bussers for anything and every thing, in front of patrons.

Speaking of "in front of patrons," I was at lunch there recently when two employees had an altercation in the bar.  My whole table actually witnessed a male employee punch the wall next to a female employee after screaming at her!  I am NOT making this up...

I used to be close with the old owners (no idea who owns the place now), and this breaks my heart.
