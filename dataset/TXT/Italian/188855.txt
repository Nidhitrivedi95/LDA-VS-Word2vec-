OXrFWgoz533T8tMRemkiww Best pizza in Pittsburgh! Soo good ! It got to the point where my buddy and I were eating here a few times a week (that gets expensive). Sooo we came up with a plan to replicate their pizza ourselves! We bought a pizza stone and even asked the manager? At pizzaiolo how to make the pizza. Well he took pity on us gave us tips and even gave us dough! 
 We rushed home energetically made our pizza!  We were so motivated, excited, pumped! .......Well ours was edible but no match. So with deflated egos back to il pizzaiolo we go. Empty pockets, full stomachs!
