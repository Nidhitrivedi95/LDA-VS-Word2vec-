dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg We hadn't been to an Oregano's in 10+ years, so decided to give it a try again for dinner this past weekend.  We got there early, so we wouldn't encounter a wait and were luckily seated right away.  I ordered a mango strawberry lemonade and absolutely loved it!  We shared a side of the meatballs and a Julius Caesar salad...honestly, I was already full after all of that!  I ordered the big rig pasta and my husband ordered the El Diablo shrimp pasta...the portions were huge, so I ended up taking home well over half of my entree.  Good place to stop in for reasonably priced food in a comfortable setting both indoors or outdoors with friendly service albeit a little bit slow.
