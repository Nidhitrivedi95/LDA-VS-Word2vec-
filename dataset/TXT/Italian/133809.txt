ioEdisf6TTCoUbfQDnUCjA Food was very good and moderately priced.  I was with 3 other people and we all had different desires for dinner (seafood, italian, thai, basic) and all our cravings were satisfied.  The wine we had with the meal was also very good.  It wasn't an upscale place but it was still classy.  When we were there during the 2008 Christmas holidays, there was a table of suits full of merryment and song.  Another with young girls sitting around talking.  Lots of other tables filled with couples and larger groups so it isn't a quite place, but definitely a friendly environment.
