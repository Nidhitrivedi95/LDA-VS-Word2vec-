q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Capo's is amazing!  All aspects...food, atmosphere, service, etc.  I had the salmon picatta with mushroom risotto and ceasar salad.  Seriously, the BEST I have ever had.  My husband had the bacon wrapped filet and said it was so good, he did not want the flavor to leave his mouth!  Coming from 2 serious Sicilians.... Capo's is the BEST and my new favorite Italian spot.  However, I did try a bite of the ravioli and I was not impressed but everything else was nothing less than amazing.
