pOhX1XjbBdPoO2Fyy8RGJg I saw this place on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives; so my girlfriend and I decided to try it out.  The customer service is friendly and the place is cozy and clean.  The menu had plenty of options and the food was fresh.  However, the food lacked depth of flavor.  Though the food is definitely cooked with love, it just misses that bite of food that gets you to want to come back.  However, I packed my food in a doggy bag and it actually tasted better the next day.  I don't know that that means, but I guess that just means that maybe I would ask them for food from yesterday night's service.
