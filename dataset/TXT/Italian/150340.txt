KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ I had no idea about the history of the original Rao's when I came here with a group of people for dinner, though one in our party - the one who had tried fruitlessly for years to eat at the original one - was kind enough to tell us about the famed sauce and meatballs. 

Since he was the one with all the expectations, seeing him finally eat the meatballs and the enormous veal parmesan and not be underwhelmed was nice, as high expectations can ruin that dream meal.  The special seasonal pasta - purses with blue cheese, pears and cranberries in a sage butter sauce - was tasty, though the lemon chicken my friend ordered seemed to be *the* dish.  Our waiter was one of those old school guys, who'd been working at the high end restaurants in Vegas since the days of Frank and Sammy, and he certainly added to the ambiance, since the schizophrenic music selection (Christmas, Motown and a bit of Italian thrown in for measure) didn't do much.

And outside a small misunderstanding on the wine order where the sommelier gal opened up a bottle about 4x the price of the one we ordered, it was enjoyable, if a bit overpriced for the food and ambiance.  But hey, it's Vegas, right?
