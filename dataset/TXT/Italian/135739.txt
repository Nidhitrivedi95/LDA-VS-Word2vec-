iwzVhM5CirzkNS5wTxwZeA Came here for dinner on Saturday night with a few friends. Our waiter, James, was terrible. He was rude unhelpful. He rarely came to check and see if we needed anything, and if we did ask him for anything, we would never receive it. I asked for a glass of water 3 times, and still never received it. Our table was never given bread, until we asked another server to grab it for us. I would not suggest this restaurant, unless average food and bad service is your forte.
