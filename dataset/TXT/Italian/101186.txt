fbZKVUec4oNGmPRXzWGpxQ was looking for a place close to my hotel on a rainy monday night. there were a few choices nearby and yelp reviewers seemed to like this place.

some of the reviewers here called it cramped, but I think cozy is a better word. tables are close together, but it didn't seem overcrowded. the service was attentive and pleasant. not overly friendly, maybe gruff but in a professional and courteous way. we interacted with a couple of waiters/servers and all were fine.

big complaint: forget the appetizers, at least the calamari and caesar salad. both were horrible. the caesar was iceberg lettuce and some kind of terrible dressing. the calamari could have been from a frozen package. we only had one dessert, vanilla ice cream with peaches, but the peaches were canned and there was way too much whipped cream. it was not good. and they had no tiramisu! how can an Italian restaurant be out of tiramisu?!!??!!

the pasta was good. tasted fresh. I had a rigatoni carbonara-style and my friend's order was the wrong thing but she ate it anyway and it was good. we had a $18 bottle of table wine that was ok.

so...forget the apps and dessert. have the pasta and wine. don't set your expectations too high. two stars seem low and three seem too high. it was decent for what it was, but unless it's cold and rainy and you don't want to go too far from your hotel, you can probably find a better place
