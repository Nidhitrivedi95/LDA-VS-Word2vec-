M49CwslHLTt9verCZhWxrg Me and my husband used the Groupon deal for Storm's. The deal couldn't get any better, $21 with a $7 discount for an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. The food was divine! We started off with the delicious brushetta and zucchini appetizer. I ordered the Penne Scalo, which was a penne pasta with a spicy creamy tomato sauce and tender pieces of sausage with sauteed mushrooms. The sauce was so good I was tempted to even save the rest in a to-go box. My husband ordered the chicken picatta, which was just as good with vegetables. Our meals came with a side so I decided on a salad and my husband choose the beef barley soup. Plus, our waitress gave us some french bread and an oil to dip the bread in with our meal. By the time we finished our meal, we were stuffed to the brim and had to take our tiramisu in a to-go box. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who craves a place with superb Italian-American crusine.
