umxki_So2--o08q9bkXK6Q What a great place!!!  Organic, fairly healthy, lots of good tasty options, including a rice and tapioca pizza dough that was just outstanding.  The salads are outstanding, fresh, and cleverly put together.  The service is also quite good.  Try the pasta dishes too, as both the chicken piccata and lasagna were Fantastic!!!!
