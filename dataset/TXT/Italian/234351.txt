TQqhfjlPVEz41K_wAogQSQ Tried Luigi's for the first time last night. Pleasantly surprised to be seated almost immediately - at 6:30 pm on NY Eve! Good thing - there's no place to stand while waiting where you don't feel like you are hovering over someone's table. (This seems to be a characteristic of Food Fight establishments - but I digress.) Friends ordered Marghareta Pizza, I had the Sequoya on gluten-free crust.  We all thought the crusts could have been crispier - a little too doughy for thin crust. Sequoya pizza had TOO MUCH CHEESE and not enough of anything else. The described pesto sauce, olives, feta, red peppers, and artichokes were almost non-existent, and completely overwhelmed by a solid layer of gluey and not particularly flavorful mozzarella. ICK. Friends' Marghareta looked much more cheese-proportional and they pronounced it good.  Service was slow (to be fair, though,  they seemed short-staffed), not particularly friendly, and we had to ask for water, plates, and silverware after the pizzas arrived. I want to like Luigi's - it's walking distance from my house and a welcome addition to my neighborhood - but it did not make a good first impression. I'll try again, hoping  it was just an off night.
