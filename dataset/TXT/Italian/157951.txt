ldGnkfXjRNAxRP9cizgr0Q I've been wanting to try this inconspicuous little café is for a while now. It's located across from the old Joseph Horne Building on Stanwix Street. They have breakfast items, crapes, salads, sandwiches, wraps, espresso drinks and more.  I'm assuming that most of the business is generated from takeout and delivery judging from the modest décor with only a few tables for dine in. There is some unassuming art on the walls, a counter for ordering and country music videos are playing on a TV on one of the walls. 
 
I was kind of in the mood for a hoagie so I ordered the Italian sandwich. The gentleman behind the counter courteously took my order and the sandwich was in front of me in about five minutes. On a real plate; not a disposable paper plate as I would have expected. The hoagie was generously portioned with Genoa salami, ham, capicola, melted mozzarella & provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato and a light sprinkle of dressing on a slightly toasted fresh bun. Delicious, but it was more food than I could eat.
 
There's a lot of competition in the downtown lunch market and Gio's seems to understand this. They offer a good sandwich for a competitive price... a solid 4 stars in my book. My total came to $8.55 plus tip.
