JAG74bLF4M_7y_WMGpmKQg We live just down the road and I drive by this place every day on my way to/from work. So, we decided to call in an order and go and pick it up. We checked out their menu online and called in the order- the woman on the phone was nice and let us know our order would be ready in about 20 minutes. 

We headed in and our food was ready on time as promised. We ordered spaghetti & meatballs (which came with garlic bread), a meatball sandwich, and a single antipasta salad. The spaghetti was good but I felt like the garlic bread was lacking; it was more like a toasted pita with garlic spread on it. 

The meatball sandwich was good... fries were a bit soggy. The biggest disappointment however was the fact that the antipasta salad came without black olives (I did double check the menu which said that it was supposed to). Black olives are the whole reason that I love the anitpasta salad. *sigh*
