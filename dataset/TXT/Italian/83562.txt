djKTruHtS4n_vlfOknxjRw This a great pasta place not far from my home but it is very expensive. It also gets very cold in the winter time the way the cold in blows in and the seating area is tiny. My favourite dish is the Sweet Potato Ravioli. Parking can be difficult on Bloor Street and you often have to wait a long time to sit.
