dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg Words cannot describe how truly majestic the food here is.  The most wonderful flavors and textures I have ever experienced.  This isn't only my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, but my favorite restaurant of all time.  Chef Marc, is to me, a culinary god.  I feel so honored by his humility, because I think he could be a head chef at the worlds most finest restaurants, cooking for the most exclusive clientele.  But instead, he allows common people to experience the finest in food and drink.  Thank you Chef Marc.  

I highly recommend the chef's table.   Four courses with or without wine pairings. It is a bit more pricey than most can afford for a casual dinner, but if you want to impress a date, this will truly be a winner.  I took the g/f there for her birthday and it was a life changing experience....  No really....  Life changing!  Chef Marc creates a custom four course meal just for you.  Our custom menu included char grilled octopus with apple, carrot and celery.  At first we though it would be chewy, but it surprisingly was not at all.  It had the texture of a moist piece of chicken breast.  Delicious!!!  Next up was the gnocchi bolognese.  The gnocchi was incredible and the bolognese was amazing.  Our third corse was a dry aged rib eye, done el-chico style.  If I had to choose the final meal of my life, this would be it.  It was as they say in Hawaii, "broke da mouth" good.  Without question, the finest entree I have ever had...  That is no exaggeration.  The final course was a three parter, with rum cake, tiramisu  and cannoli.  I was so full, but I could not stop eating until all the food was gone.  

Thanks again Chef Marc.  I would also like to thank our server Tracy. He has always been so exceptionally kind to us whenever we go.  He is the type of server that would bend over backwards just to make sure we have the most enjoyable experience one could have.
