rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ I like a place where you can sit and eat at the bar, chat up the bartenders, and have a great dinner.  Elements is quite lovely in that the food is prepared differently.  For example, their soups that should have cream are thickened with potato puree instead, which is a nice change of pace.  The food is presented beautifully, all very tasty, and the drinks are no exception.  

Everything is made in-house, from dessert to drinks.  I like the fact that the chef cares what goes in to the food he makes, trying to use other alternatives than the usual fatty requirements for cooking.  Just the fact that it's made there instead of boxed up and reheated in a microwave says volumes.  

I would definitely return for some delicious food, to try their daily specials and their decadent desserts.
