KyzPvdGPb2ubVlXJrS2QPA Really good! Ordered a pizza from here around 9 pm. Luckily they are open. I was surprised that a lot of places in the Las Vegas area weren't open past 9. They had a variety of toppings to choose from and the pizza was delicious. I got the eggplant. (It was breaded which I love) the people on the phone were very nice. Prices we're fair.

Only giving this place 4 stars because delivery was supposed to be 45 min to an joe and it took an hour and 15 min. 

I would definetly order from here again tho.
