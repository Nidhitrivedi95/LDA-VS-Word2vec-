tngl2VZ4VGpK3qFpmU0NMw We stopped by here in a whim and were pleasantly surprised. The location is great, and the outdoor patio is big and nicely decorated. The menu is as expected for an Italian joint with items such as Pasta, Pizza and other dishes. We stopped by for a few appetizers and drinks and ordered the meatball and the bruschetta with goat cheese and avocado. The food came out quickly and tasted great. The meatball was especially delicious and something that this restaurant prides itself on as well. For drinks we had the aged Negroni (This restaurant prides on aging their Negroni for 2 weeks and it pays off) and the Peach Bellini which were delicious. The service was great, the waiter was prompt, attentive and checked in on us several times which was a pleasant surprise given how busy the location was that day. For a place that we walked in with little to no expectations we were surprised and would definitely recommend this place.
