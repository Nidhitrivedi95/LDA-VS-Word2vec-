FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A My office occasionally gets delivery from Mac Shark via Post Mates. Being a health conscious person, there are few options to choose from. That alone would not make for a poor rating as every restaurant has it's specialty and I understand that theirs is comfort pasta. I do my best by ordering a salad and soup.

The problem is what I receive for my salad. Slimy wilted mixed greens and brown cucumber are not my idea of something worth paying for no matter what your specialty. I normally don't do a write up about a single negative experience because I know that everywhere has their off days but this was the second time in a row. If you don't sell enough salads to serve them fresh, then take it off your menu. 

Unfortunately, I will be recommending that we no longer order lunches from Mac Shack. I hope they can shape up but they've lost me and my coworkers.
