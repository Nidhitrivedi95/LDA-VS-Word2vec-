N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg My family and I have eaten at this restaurant four times. The experiences have been so varied that it is hard to review the restaurant. The things that have been consistent are long wait, bland pizza, and some sort of mistake made by the staff that is rectified by free appetizers.

There are a number of stories I could tell about this restaurant and are different experiences. I've been there by myself, I went with my family twice, and I went with a big group once. I would not recommend ever going to this restaurant with a big group. Yes they are busy and that's a good thing. But they have yet to figure out how to manage large groups. For the most part they should simply say they don't seat groups of that size. For instance, we were a group of 14 and waited two hours for a table.  Again, not a problem if they tell you up front and ultimately seat you at an appropriate table but that has not been my experience.  

The pizza seems like it is going to be great but in a town with Pizzeria Bianco you gotta bring your A game.  I've been to Chicago a number of times and these pizzas are a far cry from the wonderful flavors of that City.  

The staff always tries to make up for shortcomings.  They are attentive and pretty friendly.  They seem to be trying hard to make up for bad situations but at some point only so much can be done.
