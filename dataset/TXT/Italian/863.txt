-8Oaw94x2pYJCVP8ZtuTTw Carrabba's has rarely disappointed me, and this visit was no different (4/1/17 ~730pm EST).  We were sat without a wait.  Natalie our server was terrific, she always checked on us, cleared any empty plates, never had to ask for a water/drink refill.  She was tipped cash, and well over 22%.  

I had the Chicken Bryan - excellent. 

To any servers/waiters/waitresses:  This is only my opinion, but the service I get is just as important, if not more, than the food I've ordered.  I expect to be checked on every ten minutes or so, or even just eye contact from your perch/wait station.  Personally, every time I have look up, or ask for something again when I've already asked for it - your 20% tip decreases by a point.  I always start at 20% - giving you the benefit of the doubt.  You are in the service industry - if you treat every patron/table with the same attitude and greeting you get at  Rik-Phil-A, I guarantee your tip margin will increase.  Not having to ask for something b/c you the server anticipated it - I add points to the tip, which is why Natalie got a +22% tip.
