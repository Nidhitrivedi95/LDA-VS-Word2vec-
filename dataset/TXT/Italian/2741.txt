-SUammmS2p6c5GuuGA-kmw I've been to the Buon Giorno Cafe dozens of times and unfortunately they've just hit rock bottom with me. While it used to be a nice cafe serving a variety of Italian and nouvelle dishes done to perfection at reasonable prices by pretty waitresses, it has become a place that slaps food together indifferently with little concern for taste or even whether or not the food has been adequately cooked. I ordered the "Pasta de la Sandra" and the sausage pieces were still cold inside... apparently the cook grabbed a handful from the refrigerator and tossed them in, then instantly dumped it on the pasta. The cheese sprinkled on top hadn't even started to melt, there wasn't enough heat in the dish to do so. And of course given that it was slapped together, the flavors didn't blend... This was a pale imitation of the Buon Giorno I first visited several years ago that was reminicent of the food in many a Trastevere (Rome) trattoria. Sorry folks, I'm not coming back unless i hear you're under new management, and I've taken the time to write this only to spare others the unpleasant experience that I had.
