4gXdyihRiytmXEAfqLNMBw This review is specifically for the bartender Danielle on a Wednesday night. 5 star bartender! She went above and beyond to make my first trip here wonderful. She was personable, attentive and made every customer smile.

Now for the restaurant...the food was ok. I got their kale salad but it didn't hit the spot like I hoped it would. Their brussel sprouts were bomb.com tho!! Yummo. Everyone at the bar raved about their food so I'll definitely be back to explore the menu. 3.75 stars for food based on this solo experience. 

As for booze, I got their red blend wine and it was delish. Highly recommend it! This place is definitely worth checking out. (I was surprised at the number of upper-aged folks for what that's worth.)
