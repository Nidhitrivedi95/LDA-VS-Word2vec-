nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg A small group went there for dinner yesterday.The place is cute, really well located and the food was really good.
 I ordered the gnocchi and it was delicious. Foe dessert I had the chocolate souffle - one of the best I ever had.
I am not giving it a five star because the service could have been better. The waitress took her time to come and take our orders, I had to specifically ask her to take our bread basket and appetizer plates away when the main course arrived. My friend ordered half portion of gnocchi with her entree and she had a strange reaction - as if she "disagreed" with the order. Oh well...maybe next time she will be in a better mood.
