AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw I want to give this place 10 stars for saving our 5-year anniversary. We went to a steakhouse earlier in the evening and had absolutely horrendous service (I was in tears because the disappointment my brain felt was leaking out of my eye sockets). 

My amazing husband did not want to end on a low note and brought me (mentally kicking and screaming) to OKRA because he had met some guys from OKRA earlier in the day while he was out and about. 

First off, I needed to fix my running mascara and a drink.... I am awful at ordering drinks in general. I don't really know what I like and generally stick with things I've heard ordered at other times in my life (vodka tonic, cuba libre, jack & coke, appletini...). In my frazzled state, I shared this tidbit of info with the barkeep (he is from the Detroit area but I forgot his name) and he suggested he could create something for me. Yay! A decision I don't have to make!! 

From that moment on, they proceeded to spoil us. The cooks, the chef, the barkeep...the whole restaurant seemed to be conspiring to brighten our moods. 

My drink was a mixture of muddled strawberries, Hendrick's gin, mint, basil, lemon juice and orange juice...I could have drank 2 gallons of it, it was soooooooooo perfect!  

They then brought us dessert...a Canned Biscuit Doughnut topped with salted caramel and homemade buttermilk ice cream (OMG it was heavenly) and a slice of Buttermilk Pie (also very good!) 

We were also allowed to try their pickled green beans (just because) and I loved that too. They are so good, I would like to have a big jar of them to put on salads. 

I'm a fan...and quite possibly a devotee.
