HadzjG0pPrqH-t7Yv1MEKA This is a very nice, historic restaurant in Painesville. It's full of history and character. The food was good and prices were not bad. We especially liked their spaghetti sauce... It was on the sweet side and full of flavor. 

I'm a big bread fan but their bread service was average. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our time here. Service was great. People were friendly. I'm sure we'll be back!
