Apparently, one-word reviews are FROWNED UPON in this institution, so let me elaborate.  DISCLOSURE: The reviews seemed evenly split between likers and haters, so I came in with an open mind.  

I hereby officially declare myself a HATER. Sugar-filled pizza sauce. Underdone (and very bland) crust.  I could go on....but I have better things to do.

Slow service never helps either.
