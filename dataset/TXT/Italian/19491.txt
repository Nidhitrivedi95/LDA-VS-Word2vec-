The ambience was inviting, and the service was excellent! We ordered brewed coffee, house special latte (with cinnamon and honey) and a Mediterranean omelette that came with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. Their servings are huge! Omelette was soft, and had the right amount of cheese and spinach paired with slices of crisp baguette, cottage cheese, tuna salad, olives and cream cheese on the side. The cucumber salad was also refreshing. The coffee and latte were equally amazing. 

Carpe the diem and visit Cafe Leone!
