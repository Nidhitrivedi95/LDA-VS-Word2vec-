Happy Hour runs every day from open until 5 with $5 glasses of wine and draft beer pitchers. The bruscettas are awesome and clearly their best seller (you have to try the fig, apple and brie - devine).  Their pretzel board is also scrumptious.  The beer and wine list is diverse enough to have something for everyone.
