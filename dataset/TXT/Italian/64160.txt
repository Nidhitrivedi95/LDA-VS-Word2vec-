bCrMHwCLZzyKsAUOiAL0OA I am from Brooklyn, and Went there for dinner one day and usually, the food, & the Pizza is ok, not like NYC-and this recent visit the owner very rude, especially when I asked for a special request. It was like asking for a million dollars, they said no and it's an inconvenience to the kitchen, but, not the ones paying their bills I guess, I was a little shocked, being from NYC I shouldn't be. In my business I go out of my way to accommodate my customers within reason. I don't need to eat there when  people have horrible attitudes. I feel they are too big for there Britches. Gone to their heads. This is the honest truth.
