8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA did a group thing here last night - about 40 people sharing in some chicago style pizza then we're off to a ny place next week.  

I have to preface my review with the comment that i really don't like chicago style pizza - as in the pie-style, i actually like their thin-crust pizzas.  

we try some bread, salads, rigatoni with sauce, sausage w/peppers and onions  pizza - both thick and thin.  the highlights - the sausage pepper and onions and the thin crust meatlovers.  i thought the thick was kinda thin ( and yes, i've eaten at 3 different  places in chi-town, including uno ) - my one pet peeve , i thought their sauce was too sweet.

overall, it ain't a bad place and i can see myself dropping by to get some sausage, peppers and onions to go.  As to the chicago motif - except for a poster of an early 90's oprah, no one from the 21st century - about time they make space for our newest President !
