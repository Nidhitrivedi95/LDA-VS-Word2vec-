vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw Decided to come by right when it opened and was surprised that nearly all of the tables were filled! We were seated in Renee's section and were quickly greeted with a warm smile. After taking our drink order, Renee asked if we were in the mood for a starter. We inquired about the stuffed mushrooms and she said they were a great choice. Once they arrived, my boyfriend and I throughly agreed. Since she had done such a great job with the app, we asked her advice on lunch. She knocked that one out of the park as well! Thank you Renee for making our visit awesome.
