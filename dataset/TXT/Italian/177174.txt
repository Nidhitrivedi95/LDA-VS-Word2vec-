nK7JeIqdBli3umEhBIh33g We decided to try this place because their was a good deal on groupon for it, otherwise we would have never stepped into this place since it is hidden. The first time we came here for lunch and the place was still closed even though they said they would be open at 1130 and it was already noon, so that was not a good first impression. We decided to give it another chance and we had dinner there, keep in mind, only 1 groupon per table. At first the waiter seemed kind of rude, I think he was annoyed that we had a groupon and we had thought we could use two of them, or maybe it is just an Italian thing, he just kind of gave us a negative vibe at first, but you know am not one to make this experience a bad one so I gave him a second chance as well. He did get a lot nicer as the meal progressed. Upon his recommendations, we had the spaghetti & meatballs as well as the homemade finger pasta with Italian sausage. The pasta was delicious and still al dente, but if i were to pay full price for it, uhmmm i would have second thoughts. The other yelpers were raving about the tiramisu so I tried it, it did NOT IMPRESS me though, I thought it was plain and the Tiramisu you can buy at Smith's tasted better. I guess this is supposed to be a fine dining restaurant, but I think the ambience is not that upscale. If you are planning to celebrate a special occasion here, I would not recommend it if you are wanting it to be fancy and special, but if you just wanna try their pasta I would say go for it. Overall an ok experience, delicious pasta, would I go back? Maybe...if I could get a good deal again :)
