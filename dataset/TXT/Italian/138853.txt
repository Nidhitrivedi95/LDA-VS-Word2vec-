JCiglfoF09JqfR_gn6XYcA This pizza is wonderful!
My mom lives near here and when I visit her, my daughter & I always have to order a pizza! I am pregnant and have bad reflux, and this is the ONLY pizza in town that tastes great and doesn't make me feel sick after :-)
Crust not super thick, not too much sauce or cheese! Perfect
