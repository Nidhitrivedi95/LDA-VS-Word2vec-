qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA Won't go back again! VERY disappointed

Made a business dinner reservation for 4 at 7pm during CES.
Not unlike many airlines, they clearly over-booked, because we didn't get a table until 8:40pm (while watching many much larger parties get seated before us), and only after much complaining, and then for me to actually walk upstairs to find an open table, and then to tell the door staff about it!

In the meantime, one of my key business contacts LEFT. That's right, the wait as SO long that they had to leave!! 
I was LIVID, but the girl at the front door didn't seem to empathize with me, or the many others who were as pissed as i was.

When the remainder of our party finally got seated, service was slow.
The 3 of us ordered the Sea Bass with the Lobster. Mediocre at best! :(
Sea Bass was over-cooked, and everything was slathered in a rose tomato sauce tht would have been better suited on a linguine dish. It just seemed cheap for the $40 pricetag.

I will caveat this by saying the Lounge (bar) staff were very gracious, and tried to make amends for the misfortune. But I was already too jaded & upset for it to matter.

Again, I will NOT go here again !!!
