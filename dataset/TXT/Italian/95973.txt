eQCYur0033RkZdh5VjbF8A We came here with a group for some after work drinks. Unfortunately the DJ was too loud and we were seated at a very long table, so couldn't have much of a conversation.  The service was slow - we had been seated for about 15 minutes before they took our drink order. The food was pretty good. I had pasta and the zucchini chips. My colleagues had the pizza and an array of other apps. I would definitely recommend this place on a much slower night.
