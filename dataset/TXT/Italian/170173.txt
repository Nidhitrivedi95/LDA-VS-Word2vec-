MuGSFckqsMI7mSZwTvsHhg We stopped in the other night with our family for some pizza and appetizers.  It was wonderful.  We ate the Bosco cheese filled breadsticks for an appetizer. We tried a few of their pizzas as our dinner.  The waitress was nice enough to allow us to do half and half so we can try more kinds being it was our first visit to thier resturant. We tried the Pepino on half and theTrapino on the other half.  This was hand tossed crust.  ( My favorite) Then on another pizza we did bbq on half and the other half brueschetta which was my wife's favorite pizza.  This was thinking crust.  Both crust good and cooked perfect.  They offer beers or wine with dinner if you would like.

We thought the service was very friendly.  The resturant was smaller, but very cozy and comfortable for a small town Italian place.  Not a long wait for food.  The waitress brought our daughter a small ball of pizza dough to keep her entertained, which we thought was clever and a fun idea for kids. Got a chance to meet the owner (Joe) as we were leaving.  Seemed like a nice young man.  This is one of those places you need to try if in the area or order out if you live close because they deliver.  Very nice food for the small town of Windsor.  We will be back to try the pasta and lasagna.  Then once we try the pasta maybe we will change review to 5 star if it is as good as the pizza was.
