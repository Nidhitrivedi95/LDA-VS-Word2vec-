zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g Love that this place serves vegan (Daiya) cheese (not on the menu...must ask for it), but it's a very loud, male-focused sports bar-type restaurant. Nowhere to wait while they prepare a table, but it's never a long wait. 

Also guilty of Vegas restaurant service syndrome: server disappeared after entrees served. Ran out of water, waited 10 minutes for check and box (never offered water). 

Food is very good and reasonably priced (especially since I make it last two additional meals as leftovers).
