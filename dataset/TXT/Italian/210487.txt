qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ This place is really incredible. From the time you walk in until the time you leave, you can count on a great experience. The owner greets you and remembers your name. He makes sure everything in his restaurant is always in order and the food has to be perfect or he won't let it be brought out. I had two different pizza's and they were both some of the best pies I have ever had. If you are in town, Casanova is a hands down must stop!
