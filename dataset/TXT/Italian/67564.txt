BQqwIYQuo2W94smjrBjy5g My husband and I ate here last night. We had heard great things and wanted to try it out. We love Ventano's and I heard the former chef opened this place up! I just finished my leftovers for lunch and had to sing its praises!! I had the Lynn Pear tortellini with rock shrimp. Fabulous!! Seriously, one of the best Italian dishes I've had in a long time. Homemade tortellini, yum. Slightly sweet kicked with a mild cheese makes for a smooth delicious dish. Shrimp was a nice flavor added and it had yummy cheeses and spinach in a vodka sauce. I highly recommend this dish!
