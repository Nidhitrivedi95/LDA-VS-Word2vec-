r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA I'm still loving Defalco's, maybe now more than before.  

Cheese steak is still great, I even chop it up and freeze it now and it reheats really well which is most bonus if you don't live close to Defalco's. Eggplant parm freezes well too.  The Il Purista is packed with tons of prosciutto and it is delicious. Their gnocchi is really good, mac and cheese is really good, and the garlic toast is tasty.  They give you a decent side salad with your pasta entrees too which is nice considering how many restaurants don't throw in any extras.  Saving the best advice for last, you MUST try their sausage. 

I wish they would open a Defalco's in North Scottsdale.....
