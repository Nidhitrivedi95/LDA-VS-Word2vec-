NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ Ordered take out here for a quick meal for the husband and I.  This seemed more of a homey type place, and I liked it.  

Got the following:
1 small pepperoni, 1 small montesano's house special, 1 garlic knots.

These were very good, they seemed more of a rustic type pizza.  My only complaint was that they wouldn't let me do substitutions on the house special.

The garlic knots were weird.  They were deep fried, something I have never seen before.  

Will definitely be going here again.  They deliver but they don't want to unless they have to and talked me into picking up my order by offering a 10% discount, which was cool.
