wxzG81ZyWpBje_mU4aFLaw I can actually say I'm surprised to know that there are more than one location of this place. I was sadly disappointed after trying this place. The pizza was unimpressive, it was actually burnt and bland. I was excited about the fact that we got there in time for the "Happy Hour" which is 3-6p. We tried the chicken drumettes which were just okay. We also ordered the fries that we were told 'were amazing' and sadly...they were not. We did rather enjoy the calamari. So if you do choose to go there: I guess get the calamari. 
(p.s the server was this amazing college kid. I forget his name, but it was something biblical. GIVE HIM A RAISE).
