bXbCGFk3ZjLcTdQQB-xPyQ Stopped in for a visit after landing at Charlotte airport. Great experience sitting at the bar. Delicious caesar salad, sautéed garlic spinach, and the shrimp fra diavolo. Will definitely return the next time I'm in Charlotte. Loved the sundried tomato sauce served with the fresh bread. Seems like it would be a fun, hip place to visit on the weekends.
