6kD0vTLj3oZJm7kXRSvfKw The alleged chef from Vegas needs a one way ticket home.  

Specifically requested a dinner portion for my two take outs. Got lunch portions and paid extra for iceberg lettuce salads ($2.25 each).  Asked for extra marinara sauce in advance. Good thing because there was hardly any on the pasta. The bad news?  Got my extra sauce in one if those little dressing-type containers. 

My eggplant parm consisted of two greezy pieces of eggplant re-heated in oil, I'm sure.  No pasta with that. I guess I was suppose to steal some from the spaghetti order.  The bread was almost stale. I think it was from the Orlando bread roll bag x's two days. WiFi?  I guess they have it. When I couldn't log in, I got this:  "It's working on my computer. We've been having problems, so I don't know".  

They'll probably last as long as the restaurant previously occupying that same space.
