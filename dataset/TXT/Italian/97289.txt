EtLmuDIMsBCmqdgpysz60Q We went on a Monday evening, in which the place was slow.  Our server, Jud was excellent! The basil pesto pasta is very authentic and a must-have upon ordering. I had the garlic and basil aoli shrimp pasta special which wasn't short on the shrimp quantity! He had the Monaco Chicken off the menu, which was perfectly pan fried with very light breading. All were very very fresh and delicious. Can't wait to go back!
