yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w One of my favorite Italian spots in Vegas!  My husband and I try to go whenever we are in town.  I love the location right behind the Flamingo and The Cromwell. They have never disappointed us and we try to get something different each time.  Never had a bad experiencel there.  We always recommend it to any friends going to Vegas.  There is an older gentleman that plays the accordian and serenades.  The cappuccino at the end of the meal is the absolute best!  I highly recommend this amazing place!
