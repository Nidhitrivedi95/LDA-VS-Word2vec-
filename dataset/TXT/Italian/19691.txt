2WhAe8nUUl6TkX9mY8EKzQ Great food, great service. Only thing that is sad to see is how they are an italian restaurant but have the front doors to the restaurant painted as the italian flag- but backwards. They painted it red, white and green when the flag is green white then red. Very small mistake that makes a big difference and is slightly distasteful for my (and perhaps their) culture.
