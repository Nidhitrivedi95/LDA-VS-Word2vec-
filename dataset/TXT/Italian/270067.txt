Cons- unorganized/slow service in the beginning we waited for almost 5+ minutes before anyone offered us drinks, Italian dressing was unappetizing (too much oil or something), sort of pricy though you get large portions, restaurant seems stuffy and depressed - just kind of dark and dirty feeling. 

Overall, food was pretty good, restaurant needs to freshen up its decor so it feels more comfortable and inviting, staff was friendly, but service was spotty in the beginning.
