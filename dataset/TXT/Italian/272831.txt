XxmziAeRqMKwsDjyyjVgeg Had dinner there last night and was terribly disappointed.  The wine that was recommended was terrible and we had to ask for water twice.   The waiter was the owner's son and the owner and his wife were at the table beside us.    Appetizer took 45 minutes (Bruschetta) and seemed to have canned mushrooms on it.   You could taste the brine.    Finally asked for bread and a salad from a passing waitress who ended up being the one to bring it to us.   Our waiter had disappeared.   He reappeared 30 minutes later to bring our entrees.    My date had something with chicken and pasta with marinara and I had the scallops and marinara.   The sauce was terrible and seemed more like a paste than a traditional marinara.   Not fresh at all.   The scallops were chewy and had no flavor.   2.5 hours and $120 later and I will NEVER return.   Absolutely awful.  Oh yeah, the salad consisted of nothing but lettuce and one beet and the dressing was terrible.
