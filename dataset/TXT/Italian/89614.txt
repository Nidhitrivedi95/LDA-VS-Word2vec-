E0YuuRpK_4RpaUF7JK3mhg Okay...we tried Bratalian for the first time last night. The service from Walter was quite slow as it appeared he was the host and waiter. We split a salad and had Lasagna and Veal Saltimbocca for entrees. I found the food edible but not memorable like it is at Rao's. The Moretti beer and cannoli for dessert were probably the highlights of our dining experience. There is allot of competition just within a few mile radius so I am not sure how this restaurant will fare at their price point.
