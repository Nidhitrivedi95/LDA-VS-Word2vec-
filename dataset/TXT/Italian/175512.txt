What is there to say about pizza pizza that everyone doesn't already know. They make pretty good pizza. It isn't gourmet, but it's alright. Loads of topping options. Usually well cooked too. Quality is pretty consistent. 

It's good for some late night greasy food. It's the popular choice to call for when friends are staying the night. Everyone likes pizza, it's just an easy choice. 

Call pizza pizza if you want some delivery, or have a group of friends over and you're all hungry, and don't want to spend much cash.
