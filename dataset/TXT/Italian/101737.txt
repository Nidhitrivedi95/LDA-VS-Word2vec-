fdX_eu-dCaKsDaK_itNIzQ The pasta had a good bite.  The bread was fresh, but the guy spilled olive oil on the table (and one of us).  We were not offered parmesan,  but most people were from what I saw.  All and all I think it's probably better than this first experience showed.   I'll try it again.
