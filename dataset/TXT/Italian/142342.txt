jP7zIbDXor7fQ8phrU6LQQ Ordered online, received confirmation that my order was placed, and had an estimated delivery time of an hour and a half. Almost the full hour and a half later (after 9 pm) someone named Matt called to inform me that my order had been cancelled because my home was out of the delivery range. After asking why no one had notified me earlier - when I had originally ordered the pizza - Matt gave no explanation for why it took so long to inform me, offered no apology or resolution to the problem. 

It is unacceptable that an order can be placed and confirmed only to find out at the end of the delivery time that it was cancelled. Will never order from here again.
