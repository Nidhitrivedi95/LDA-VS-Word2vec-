YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg This is one of my favorite restaurants. Vincenzo goes out of his way to make us feel like a VIP every time we come in. Everyone is always so friendly and professional.

The other night I tried the braised beef short ribs. They were absolutely amazing. I've been dreaming about them every since. Boneless and completely melt in your mouth deliciousness.  Served with blue cheese mashed potatoes. $31

My roommate had the lemon chicken and of course I had to try a bite Very moist and tender, really good. $29 he also often orders the risotto $28-$30.

The huge standout was the Caprese Martini, yes I said that right. CAPRESE MARTINI. Holy goodness it was good. It's only a seasonal drink, but I'm hoping that it sticks around for a little while. It's a little steep at $11 but oh so worth it.

In the past I've had the Blackend Chicken  Rigatoni $28 and a super yummy Shrimp and Scallop Ravioli $27. Everything is always amazing. 

They also have an excellent Happy Hour from 4pm to 7pm
Drinks are half price in the bar!!! There's also a special HH Food menu. 

This is a great place for date night or taking a group of friends for a nice dinner. A huge wall of windows, shows off  a nice view of the LV skyline There's also pretty large private dining room and a nice chef's table. 

I can't say enough about how much I love this place!!
