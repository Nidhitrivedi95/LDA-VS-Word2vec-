1RROh1rSDB4ASIZ-kwxT2w The two worst meals of my life were at this restaurant.  Tomato "soup" so thick and sticky my spoon nearly stood up in it, salad without dressing which I asked for when I could find anyone on the wait staff and they never brought--repeatedly.  Overcooked rubbery eggs for breakfast with cold potatoes and toast.  Nope.  Fool me twice.  Won't be going back.
