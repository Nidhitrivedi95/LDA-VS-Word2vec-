aIBvcOjkAURJJ-UH0G-s0g Bittondo's is legit. Everything is cheap and overall good value. They sell pizza, panzerotti, pasta, and sandwiches. I have tried them all and have not yet been disappointed. If you're in the mood for consuming a million calories in the form of deep fried dough and cheese, have a panzerotti because they are so good. The service is always friendly and fast. One of the best take out places!
