SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg I can honestly say, I don't have a reason to ever go to another steakhouse. Everything about this classic steakhouse was on point. The service, ambience, price, drinks and food were all exceptional. 

I highly recommend the double chop. This cut of pork was the best I've ever had. The steak was good but nothing in comparison to the chop. The sides were tasty and the table bread was perfect. 

Looking forward to trying the pasta and desserts next visit. This place hands down has the best happy hour in the entire state. Half off prime cuts, am I dreaming? lol
