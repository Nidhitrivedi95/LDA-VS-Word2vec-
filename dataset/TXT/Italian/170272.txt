mULK9fWh8kU4_vQYkd9ntA New favorite place... pizza hero with meatball salami and pepperoni is awesome.  Cheese steak was good.  Rolls are good they don't sog thru like most rolls.. not sure if they are amoroso.  I am from Philadelphia and miss wawa meatball sandwiches. . This hopefully will fill that gap.  Haven't tried the pizza yet.  
Tonight they messed up our order and we got someone else's slightly toasted plain roll instead of a cheesesteak (hope the person that got our cheesesteak enjoys it) but they are making us another.  We will just make sure to check the order next time.  Hope to be a long time customer as long as the food stays good.
