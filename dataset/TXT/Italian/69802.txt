bXbCGFk3ZjLcTdQQB-xPyQ Went to Luciano's last night and was reminded why we had not been there in a while. Drinks, ambience, service were all great but my eggplant parm was awful. When the manager asked if I wanted it wrapped up and I told him I did not care for it, he offered nothing for my disappointment, inspite of the fact that I was picking up the bill for the table. So unless you are looking for tasteless chunks of eggplant with sauce and cheese on top, don't order the eggplant parm. Their inconsistency makes it too risky to want to go back.
