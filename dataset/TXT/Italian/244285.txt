USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg I love the uniqueness, yet classic approach to this restaurant.  It is set in a beautiful, historic house.  It is a great place for a date.  The dishes were approachable, without feeling pretentious.  The foie gras I had was my first experience and it was awesome.  We had great service - all around, one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.
