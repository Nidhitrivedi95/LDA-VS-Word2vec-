4gXdyihRiytmXEAfqLNMBw Met a friend for dinner at Babbo last night. Word to the wise: Mondays are busy-- it's cheap spaghetti and meatball night! This place was crawling with snowbirds!  I was told the wait for two would be 15 minutes, not a big deal at all, I don't mind waiting. Towards the end of our wait, we did notice there were many empty tables-- turns out the kitchen was a bit behind due to all of the business they were getting. Once again, this did no bother me-- we were seated probably 20 minutes after I checked in (it did take a while to get silverware, I think this is why they were not seating). The bread and dipping oil was delicious, and the food did not take long. I had the garlic shrimp linguini- it was spicy which I was not expecting but did not mind. Service was good for a busy place. I thought that the prices were good and liked my dish, so I am sure I will be back with my husband, but maybe not on a Monday!
