Whats not to love about making your own, completely customizable pizza with unlimited toppings for 10 bucks with a drink???

My personal fave is a mix of bbq and buffalo sauce as the base with mozzarella, bacon, ham, chicken, and pineapple. Its bomb. 

And props to the owner. I spent some time talking to him one evening when i ran into him at this location. He and his partner have a great pizza business backround, and it shows.  Theyve been super successful opening close to 20 locations in just a couple years. 

How someone could not like this place is beyond me. If you dont like fired pie, then you must not like pizza--in which case... why did you even come here?

Oh, and they have salads. And theyre good too if youre into that thing. I mean, i ate one, and thats sayin somethin considering the only other salad i'll eat is olive gardens. (Is lettuce with pep, bacon, salami, croutons, and italian dressing a salad or green pizza?)

The only down side to fired pie is that youve got to eat it while its hot. Since the dough is thin, it doesnt retain much heat.
