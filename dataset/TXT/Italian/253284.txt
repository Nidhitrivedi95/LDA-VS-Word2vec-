VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w I am rating the restaurant only.  

The food is expensive and not worth it at all.  I tried the grilled octopus appetizer and that was yummy.  If I were to go again, I'd get that only.  I had the Eggplant pasta with mozzarella and tomato.  It had way too many tomatoes and barely any eggplant.  The description made it sound like the Eggplant would be the highlight of the meal but with it barely present, I couldn't taste it at all.  I tried some other dishes that my friends got and none of them were impressive.  I'd prefer a place like Olive Garden than Lavo Italian Restaurant.
