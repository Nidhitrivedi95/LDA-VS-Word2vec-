OIdOJaNS8M624F58XGV3PQ Great service. Soggy pizza. Wet pizza, in fact. Gross. I sent it back and ordered a different pizza and it was soggy too. I think the problem is putting the pizza on the plate straight out of the oven- they need some sort of  specialty pizza serving plate (with holes) so that the moisture can escape-most pizza places don't serve you pizza on a plate straight out of the oven (and most don't serve you wet pizza- maybe there's a correlation?)
Big problem for a restaurant that sells itself on their pizza, imho.
Pluses: great space. Friendly, efficient service.
