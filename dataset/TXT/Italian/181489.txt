O5_CKNQOmtRHY_CjOB6XYA This is a great place to take your family and friends!  The breakfast is yummy, I like the eggs benedict with fried tomatoes, salad, fruit and home fries!   You can get seafood omelets on special days.  I took my friend for dinner there who was visiting from the west coast of Canada.  She loved it as they served these huge scallops and she couldn't them on the west coast, I felt good I took her there.   Great place and I highly recommend it!
