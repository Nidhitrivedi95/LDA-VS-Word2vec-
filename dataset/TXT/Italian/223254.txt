SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw There are not very many options for lunch in this area so I accidently found this lil spot, great customer service! Meatball sliders  and small pizza were yummy and you can't beat the lunch prices.  
Will definitely return to try other menu stuff
*check in for free garlic knots
