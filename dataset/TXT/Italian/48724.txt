Inzio treats pizzamaking like a craft to be savored, not a product to be churned out for the masses. So while you'll pay more for a pie here than at most other local restaurants, you won't regret the modest upcharge. My family shared the 18' Margharita pizza, which was delivered to our table in less than 10 minutes fresh from an oven that looked like it had been delivered straight from Italy. Even my picky six-year-old was devouring the warm, crispy slices, and for once, we didn't need a take-home box for leftovers.

In addition to the pizza, my wife and I also shared a wonderful Caesar salad, and the gelato and cannolis were the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. There's also a great selection of wines by the glass and 4 - 5 craft beers on tap, including some great local brews like Olde Meck Copper and Birdsong's Higher Ground. My only complaint is that the restaurant wasn't yet serving personal pies when we visited, although the owner assured me they were only a couple weeks away from adding them to the menu. 

Inzio comes as close as anything to replicating Antico, an Atlanta pizzeria that sets the standard for authentic craft pies in the South. Charlotte is lucky to have it, and my family and I will definitely be back for more of their delicious pizza.
