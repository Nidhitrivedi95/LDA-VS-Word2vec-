qeJnMI5RmyJ2TZvkqvjn6Q This is not a bad place.  Big menu tries to be all things to all people.  Servings are large, some compensation for the fact that the food is good, but not great.  Additionally, the place can get very crowded and noisy.  It's a nice space, but I wish they would invest in some acoustical treatment - basically it's wood all around, and that gets loud!  I do think the prices are fair, and generally the service is pretty good.  This is a decent choice for people not looking to spend a fortune, with people who like a wide variety of items.
