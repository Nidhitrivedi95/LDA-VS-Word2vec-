SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog Rigatony's is a staple in my family. Since they have moved locations it has been busier and little longer wait..but it is definitly worth it!! At their old location it was so hard to park and in the middle of downtown Chandler which I personally hate driving through..so when when we found out they were moving we were pelased. In Danielle T's review she said it was a chain and it definitly is not..it is a family owned restuarant here in AZ. Anyways...they bring out Amazzzzzzzzing bread and salad to start! Just the way we like to start our meal :) I always get the Veal with Lemon and Artichokes which is just TO DIE FOR! I always want to venture out but can't ever manage to make myself do so. The husband always orders the Baked Rigatony w/Sausage and he loves it also! The house Chianti is also delicious according to the husband...I dont know though since I dont like red wine. I dont know how anyone could ever say this place is lower quality than Olive Garden? I really feel like she had no place or point of view to be writing that. Rigatony's is AWESOME and we will keep going back :) :)
