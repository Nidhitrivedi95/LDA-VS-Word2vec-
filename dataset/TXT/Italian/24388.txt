497iuIdzSZqEVZ_iTnp-Jg Awesome spot. I've visited for drinks and pool a few times in the past, but dined there for the first time this weekend. I expected standard bar food and was super impressed by the homemade quality of everything we ordered.

After 8pm, they have a special low-price menu with $4 appetizers,$5 sandwiches and burgers, and a great wing and pitcher special. We ordered both appetizers to share amongst the group. The provolone wheel was literally a round of provolone breaded, fried, and topped with sauce. Best eaten by just digging in with a fork, it is melty cheesy goodness. The tomato sauce was spot on as well, just sweet enough to cut through the richness of all the cheese. The fried zucchini was the real surprise - amazingly light, crispy breading with a mild seasoning. I've never really liked fried zucchini because it tends to get soggy and limp. I don't know what their secret is, but I would order this fried zucchini every time!

For my meal I enjoyed the burger with american cheese. It was juicy with a nice chargrilled flavor (reminded me of a good quality Burger King patty haha, I mean that as a compliment!) and the toppings were fresh. A solid burger. My hubby quickly devoured the meatball sub so I didn't get a chance to try it, but he was impressed. We both enjoyed the homemade fries that accompanied the sandwiches - spice blend game strong.

The bartender that's usually working is super sweet and makes sure that nobody waits too long for a drink. The owner is an awesome guy as well. Always comes out to say hi to the regulars and introduces himself to anyone that he doesn't recognize. Overall, a really great local bar/restaurant.
