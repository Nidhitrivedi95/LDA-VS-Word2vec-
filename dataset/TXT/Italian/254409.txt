vWnCZVeggUGMd_cXlBohwQ Doubt I will be back. We've gone here for years but lately haven't been as we got a little tired of it. Ordered pizza tonight and was looking forward to some Rosati's again: a large, thick crust with pepperoni and green bell peppers and then asked for the free cheese pizza w/thin crust. We got both as thick crust and with the sauce ON TOP of the pizza. Not only did it look wholly unappealing, it was rather disgusting. Had to pretty much peel off all the cheese as it was WAY too thick. Left with crust which I then pieced back together with half the cheese...but without sauce (it's hard to smear that back on)...let's just say the result was not too pretty. They obviously forgot to put the sauce on BOTH of our pizzas and decided to throw it on at the end. With plenty of other options, I will go elsewhere from here on out.
