1RgX-EAQrGoPMvy9ntEXsw a large group of us (about 15 people) went to eat here to celebrate my husband's and my recent marriage a few days after xmas. we brought our own wine and ordered cheesy garlic bread, cheese fries, two pizzas and a few pasta dishes. the fries and cheesy bread came out pretty fast and tasted good. after that, we waited and waited. we had finished our wine. after an hour and a half of waiting, one couple had to leave without having eaten because it was their baby's bedtime. the waitress told us at that point that there was only one pizza cook and that they'd run out of regular bread so they had to make us garlic bread. she also told us one of our pizzas would be ready in two minutes. she came out with the pizza twenty minutes later, cold and erratically sliced. she gave us all plastic cartoon kiddie pizza slice plates, saying all the real plates were dirty. the gnocchi came out at the same time. it was terribly greasy with hard bits on the inside and we didn't even eat most of it. the garlic bread was really garlicky and soggy. the second pizza came out about ten minutes after the first. three pasta dishes were still not served. everyone was getting angry. my husband and I left at that point, and had upset stomachs for the rest of the night. I will never eat there again.
