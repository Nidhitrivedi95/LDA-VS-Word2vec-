l2Gfm3CA20iCBCBt_GNdDA "Hidden" is almost accurate, it's more...unexpected, location wise! But who cares! This is one of my fave Italian places right now. Mainly because of the food! I've been a handful of times so far, the service is not terrific but usually predictably decent and friendly.But the food has been consistently great! I've had the shrimp scampi a couple of times, the Italian sausage with the spicy Vodka sauce-Fuhgeddabawtit!! Amazing! My guy usually sticks with the classics like spaghetti and meatballs or lasagna, but I've tried both. Yum! Wine of course is average supermarket wine but it complements their food well enough. Bread came out cold one time, but hey, I need to eat less of that anyway! Bar seems to be fun and friendly but there are plenty of TVs throughout. It's always busy when I have gone but you don't have to wait an HOUR like at Oreganos up the street and I promise the food is just as good or better!
