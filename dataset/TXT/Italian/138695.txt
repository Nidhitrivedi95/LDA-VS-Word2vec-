jcasci3gjbsSuTEVzvDQKg Once again I had an amazing experience at Mama Ricottas. I made a reservation on open table via the restaurants website and it was so easy and convenient.

We started off with the Goat cheese and marscapone dip because - of course! It's so amazing, I always order it. My main entree was the Pollo Bianco, a delicious chicken breast dish served with melted mozzarella, prosciutto, and a mushroom cream sauce. It was served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and steamed squash and zucchini. This meal was melt in your mouth delicious. My friends loved their dishes as well, one of which was the same Pollo Bianco and the other was the Pollo Carifoci. Not sure if I spelled that right but she loved it. This dish was chicken with artichokes, capers and a lemon butter sauce - their version of chicken piccata. 

Dessert was great, however I did get it to go because I was stuffed! Chocolate cannoli cake. Absolutely amazing. 

Our server Abbi was attentive and extremely welcoming and did an amazing job. 

We will be back as soon as possible!
