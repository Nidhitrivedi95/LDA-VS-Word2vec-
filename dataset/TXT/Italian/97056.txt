esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA I'm not really a seafood kinda girl but the bf loves oysters so it was decided.  We trekked what seemed like miles to Harrah's and hunted down this oyster bar.  It is in the most awkward area for a restaurant.

Ordered the lobster bisque - yummy and creamy! And I also had the salmon which was DELICIOUS! The portion was surprisingly generous. The salmon was nicely seasoned and the glaze was really tasty. It's served with white rice which was kind of awkward.

The bf ordered jumbo shrimp cocktail and half dozen half shells.  I assume he enjoyed it because he didn't leave any crumbs behind.

I wasn't that impressed with the service or the place.  "meh"
