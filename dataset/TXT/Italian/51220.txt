9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg I've been pretty picky about Italian but have to say that the food here was great! I got the Arabbiatta...not oily, nicely spicy, didn't leave me with a heavy, what did I just eat feeling. Our waitress was really nice as well & the place was surprisingly busy for a Sunday night. 

I did not like the mojito at all though. ...more like a heavily diluted drink with a sad looking mint leaf inside. 

All in all, good experience!
