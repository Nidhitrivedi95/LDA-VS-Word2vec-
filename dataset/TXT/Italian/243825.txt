usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA We had our (smallish) wedding in the upstairs party room. Nealey was amazing and really helpful as we planned the wedding. Our servers were rock-stars, the space was gorgeous, and the menu was delicious and huge. The owner's mother made our wedding cake. It was one of the best cakes we have ever had and it was giant. The servers handed out monster-sized pieces and everyone took some home too. We will definitely be back!
