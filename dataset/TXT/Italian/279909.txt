yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w THIS IS A TOURIST TRAP! Don't bother with this hole in the wall. We live in Vegas and there are so many delicious Italian restaurants to go to, specially so close to the Strip. I had a Groupon and figured we would give this place a try. It wasn't worth the $100+ (before groupon was applied) for a party of 4 and a baby. 

The unlimited wine was absolutely nasty, the red as well as the white. The garlic bread was greasy and don't get me started on the cappuccino that was just a water down sugary instant coffee mix of some sort...

Now for the main dish. I had the veal parmigiano. It was really big but a bit soggy and the breading was thicker than the meat itself. The side dish of pasta marinara was so small my 21 month old son ended eating all of it as well my husband's and still wanted more. At least he enjoyed it, but I couldn't tell you how they were cooked since I didn't have not one bite, that's how small it was...

I'm very disappointed and would not go back there again! Spend your money on the Strip or even at Buca di Beppo right down the street. I would give this place a big fat 0 star if I could... just sad food
