-L88B-PrtzwujhLuYc2k_g Came here on a Friday night for dinner. This place is very large but was not busy on this particular night.

What I liked:
- gluten free options
- food was delicious and portions were just right
- steaks were prepared to the right temperature and cooked to the right tenderness (our table ordered steaks ranging from raw to medium rare)
- service was prompt and courteous
- it wasn't noisy and the atmosphere was great
