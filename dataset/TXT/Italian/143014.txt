JSnEUK2skTyYVaAQBqIJPw Simple simple simple. Local Italian Erie Servicing businesses and the local area. Pizza Pasta and some meat entrees with a limited menu.  Everything seems to be made fresh daily with very limited seasoning and or flavor.  Excellent service with tentative wait staff.

Portions are nice. Pizza and pastas are large.  Meat entrees are there. Sandwiches  are fresh  and look amazing  with typical choices of toppings including hot peppers onions mushrooms.  Excellent coffee with homemade Italian sugar cookies.

Atmosphere has been updated with a cool and new trendy look not typical for the local Italian Diner in the area. 

Some of the items were priced fairly and we're good value for lunch and some items I felt were overpriced. I definitely will give this place another shot, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.

Reasonably simple wine selection starting from $20 and up for both red and white.
