CqCWN9aBJf8YNJxyel7psg We've ordered from here a number of times while I'm visiting Madison. Glass Nickel has consistently snappy delivery.

The "Fetalicious" is a really good pizza. As others have mentioned, the crust is where Glass Nickel kind of falls down. Overall though, I appreciate fast, tasty pizza, and that's what they deliver on.
