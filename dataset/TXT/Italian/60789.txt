AWJhMTYsIYzCIYAIUA-waA I really don't want to spend too much time writing a review on this chain restaurant because well, most people who dine here are probably aren't reading reviews before they dine here.

I actually was invited to go to this restaurant to celebrate a birthday so I couldn't say "no" or show that I'm such a food snob. At first, our server was friendly and attentive but as the night continued, he was hard to find and he would forget to deliver items (a glass of wine, my tea, an entree, etc). We had to remind him a few times. 

We ordered the fried mac and cheese and portobello fries for the table. The portobello fries were hard and dry and the Mac and cheese was okay. Hubby and I ordered the Mama's trio: lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo, and something else. Do I remember? Hell no - because i tried one bite of all three and I only liked the fettuccine alfredo. When I say "I only liked", I mean "I only would eat".

Overall, meh. I wouldn't come back.
