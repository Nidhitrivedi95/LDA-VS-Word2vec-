0s1DqJlSSgR1Ftg9Q_HEOg I have to lower the rating on this place. While the service and food are pretty good, I can't STAND being charged extra money for condiments that should come with your food when you're eating in the restaurant. 

I'm sorry, but I don't enjoy being nickel and dimed 60 cents for some frigging ranch. It costs you less than $2 per bottle, and for a table of two you're making $30ish after drinks and whatnot.
