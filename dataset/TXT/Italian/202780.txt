q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ My wife and I ate here last night. Had to be the best Italian food we have ever had. Our waitress was the best I've had too she made experience even better. I had lasagna and my wife had spaghetti and a half pound meatball. Their cheese bread we were told was their most popular appetizer, she was right about that. The atmosphere of the place is perfect for an Italian restaurant, the Sinatra style singer was the caper for it. Love this place can't wait to go back.
