_e3rChyednoh47n2cjGv2w We went here for a Sunday day night at around 7:30 and it wasn't busy at all. The bread is absolutely amazing. The Caesar salad was perfect. And we had the gnocchi ala vodka which was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The service was amazing and we were in and out within 40 minutes. Highly recommend
