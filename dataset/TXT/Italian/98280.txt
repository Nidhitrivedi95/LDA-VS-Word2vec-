eVv6cnwhabK8ig5Di2hXQQ Love this place! The food is always good and the service is wonderful. The ONLY thing that could use a bit of a refresh is the restaurant itself. It's a bit outdated and old feeling but that alone certainly won't keep us from coming. The calzones are massive, so prepare for leftovers or to share one. Love that they have local beers on tap.
