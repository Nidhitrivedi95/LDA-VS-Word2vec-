MM5Fdfqf87QpTkHIKZNVdg Ok so at first I had mixed feelings about this place.  I mean how often do you see asian food mixed with italian food.  Of course the foodie that I am I will try anything with an open mind.  Leave aside the fact that its all you can eat the food and selection was incredible.  All the food was tasty and the selections was huge.  You can order anything from Caprese Salad right down to lamb chops.  Of course the portions are very small but order as many as you please.  They joys of all you can eat.  Being Italian I was a bit worried on how tha pasta would be but let me tell you it was great.  The meat balls are da bomb lol.  This place is a MUST.  Just please go hungry
