The music was a bit too loud but that was part of the fun- it was not so loud we couldn't hear each other. The food was good- all 4 in our party were pleased- and better then expected.  Those of us who ordered chicken entrees the portions were perfect.  Those who ordered pasta needed take home boxes.  A bit over the top for an every night stop- but a great choice for a fun special night out.
