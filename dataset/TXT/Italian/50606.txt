9Boahjn3QxlZnP2Aw_V1Rg One of our top places for Italian food in Toronto. We specifically frequent Sotto for the variety of sea food. The freshness of the fish and cocking is by far one of the best. The waiters are attentive and the atmosphere is great. This is a smaller place and we have been disappointed in the past when we try to be impulsive and show up without a reservation. So make sure you reserve and hope you enjoy the place as much as we do.
