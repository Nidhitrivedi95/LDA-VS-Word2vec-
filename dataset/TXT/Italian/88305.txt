DZfFFSVFVJVxs3vfFVVf0w We ate here 20 years ago and then moved away. Just came back for a visit and it's still delicious.  The service is very friendly and the pizza is amazing. The crust is the perfect balance of crispy and chewy.  The sliced sausage topping is my favorite. Pizza slice with sausage and pepperoni, dipped in ranch dressing.. Yum!
