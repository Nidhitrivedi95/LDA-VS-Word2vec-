30TxDt2V8G7FWXsKaEKA9A Very bad experience!!! Placed an online order for delivery at 9:40pm (they are open until 11pm), the estimated delivery time provided was 35 minutes. I received a confirmation email and my credit card was charged for the order. Over an hour later, at 10:40pm there was still no delivery. I called the store, they advised me they had no record of my order and that they couldn't do anything because there was no manager there. So...I was left hungry with my credit card charged and no solution. This was my first attempt to try Marco's pizza, guess it wasn't meant to be. Seems that if they truly didn't get my online order, their systems are not to be trusted, maybe call the order in instead. If they did receive my order and just failed to process it, then they should've admitted to the truth and handled the situation in a more professional manner. Terrible customer service.
