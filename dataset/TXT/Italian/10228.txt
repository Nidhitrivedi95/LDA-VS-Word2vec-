0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg What a GEM! I am in L O V E. 

I'm gonna give you the play by play... but really all you need to know is to JUST GO.

Appetizer:
Heirloom tomato and burrata salad. Sounds typical, and honestly not terrifically unique, but it was done well. Perfectly ripe tomatoes with the creamiest burrata. Microgreens on top added just the right balance of herby bite.

Pastas:
SPAGHETTI. HOLY MOLY. Who knew that some plain spaghetti could have such nuanced and delicious flavors. I looked up the recipe online as soon as I got back to my hotel because you know this is making an appearance ASAP at home.

Pici with pesto and lobster. Very solid. I don't think this is an attempt-at-home pasta. It was excellent though.

Short rib agnolotti. Solid choice. Very flavorful.

For all the pastas, they were cooked PERFECTLY. Spaghetti really stole the show though.

Entree:
I had the fennel dusted cod. Honestly I was already getting pretty full by then... so I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I would have without the pasta binge. However, it was cooked perfectly and the first few bites were delectable. I actually couldn't finish because after our shared app and pastas, I was already getting full. The accompanying veg were also expertly cooked and paired well with the fatty fish.

Everyone else opted for the duck, veal, and filet. Meat eaters I guess.

Desserts:
PANNA COTTA. This was the second recipe I researched as soon as I got home. I am SO EXCITED to make this. Hawaii is my favorite place on earth and this is just hawaii in your mouth. Silky, smooth, and perfect.  Coconut, guava... so so tasty.

Chocolate souffle. I'm not the biggest souffle fan, but even I can appreciate the technical skill and mastery that went into the baking of our souffle. It came with a spiced choco sauce and cookie dough bites and fancy buncha crunch. It was delicious, just not my favorite.

I also had a perfectly crafted cappuccino. 

In short.... can't wait to try the bev hills location.
