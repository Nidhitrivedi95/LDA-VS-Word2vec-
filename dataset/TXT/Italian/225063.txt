The short story:
I was in Vegas last week and went here for dinner with a group.  When I told the cabby where we were going, he said "Are you sure you want to go to that neighborhood?"  I was wondering if we were making a mistake but reminded myself that most hole-in-the-wall restaurants that I love are in neighborhoods that others would describe as being shady.  The restaurant was about 5 minutes from the strip and when I walked in, it seemed a little like one of the restaurants on Good Fellas.  I was half way expecting to see some guy sitting at the table cutting garlic with a razor blade...which if we're being honest, made me a little excited.

The restaurant had a good mix of steak, pasta and fish dishes.  We had calamari and bruschetta for appetizers--everyone loved them.  They also serve warm bread which was excelente.  My Caesar salad had anchovie dressing...so needless to say it was a little fishy.  For dinner, I ordered the grilled salmon and it was perfectly cooked.   

I'm not sure I would go back next time I'm in Vegas....but not for lack of good food or service.  Simply because there are so many places to try in Vegas that I would rarely eat at the same place twice.
