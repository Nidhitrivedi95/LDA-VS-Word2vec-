DWPAFq8HdzGzo2vhKixDJA Very nice!  Got the cajun catfish fillets-- could have been a bit spicier, but otherwise were cooked to perfection with great batter.  Greens and yams were awesome.  Service and atmosphere was friendly.  Pretty small place so might be tough for a larger group to get a table together.  Sides are "fixed" if you get the dinners (fries and slaw I think) so if you want other sides you have to order everything ala carte (which is not a problem, but "pick your own sides" is better!)  The serving sizes for the sides (I got "small") was generous.  This place will give Melly Mel's some competition (which I hope is not bad for either, since they are both great).  JB's is definitely easier to get to than Melly Mel's, but MM's has more seating available.
