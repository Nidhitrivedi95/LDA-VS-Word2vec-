-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw Food was good not great. Service was good but not great. Restaurant is beautiful but far too open and noisy. All in all adequate but not a memorable experience. Server did her best to make it a good dining experience. If I was to spend my time and money dining out, I would look elsewhere. Great for drinks on the patio though!!
