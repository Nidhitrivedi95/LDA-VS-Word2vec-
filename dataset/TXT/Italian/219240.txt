sa1ZAswk7kEQfg9Mb6iQwQ I have been to L'Unita on multiple occasions and have always been blown away by their food and customer service. Because of this, I decided to host my birthday dinner at  L'Unita. I had about 16 people attending and we were perfectly taken care of by the staff. The food that is produced from their kitchen is just mouth watering. Everything is so fresh and the quality is outstanding. I am looking forward to my next L'unita visit!
