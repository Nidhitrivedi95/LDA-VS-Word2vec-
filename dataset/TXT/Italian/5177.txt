_OAtYMzu_oOf2-HGVhrHVQ After rushing my staging company to have a house ready for a quick listing, I felt compelled to take them to diner.  So we picked Brother's Pizza, it was close and everyone thought it would be a good idea.  Probably the most impressive part of the visit was the waitress.  She took the time to make sure everyone's needs were taken care of, including my 1 year old daughter who typically eats off of my plate got her own special noodles and butter.

Surprisingly, no one really wanted pizza, instead everyone opted for pasta and I made the worst choice of all.  I picked the baked ziti, which was rather bland and boring.  I did get to sample the other dishes at the table and found the baked Lasagna was probably the best (I sensed they used sausage for the meat instead of beef).  Followed by the Manicotti, then  Fettucini Alfredo.  Next time I return, I will have to try the pizza, since that is their specialty.
