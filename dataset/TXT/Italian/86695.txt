dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg Horrible experience with the manager PHIL. We had a large group of 20, went there right after Volleyball tournament. We were laughing having a great time out on the patio, when Phil came and told us we were cut off from any more drinks. Mind you we had been there an hour and only had a drink a piece. This is unfortunate because we had just had a Great experience at the Oregano's in Tempe. Drive the extra few miles to Tempe, better service!!!
