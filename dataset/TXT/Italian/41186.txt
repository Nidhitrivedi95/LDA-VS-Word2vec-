7JWWeXqil03Ua_wV9KN8ZQ Loved the setting, came out to Lake Las Vegas for a race and arrived late Friday and they were still open. There was live music playing at the Lake which killed the mood a tad but wasn't so bad. 

Checked the menu posted out front, walked in, took a few minutes to be helped. Everyone working seemed to be appalled I showed up on my own. Oops?

ordered the PENNE AL POLLO E POMODORO, didn't get bread until my food came out. Bread was great, pasta was average. Left right away. Don't know if I'd come back to this restaurant again in particular but just enjoy the area.
