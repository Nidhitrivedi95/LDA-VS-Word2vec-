nqcpabHusqPmCoel5U6SPg I am a huge pizza connoisseur,and  Frank's is definitely up there as some of the best pizza in Pittsburgh. If you're in the mood for a cheese or pepperoni pizza, I wouldn't recommend Frank's. It's fine pizza, but it's nothing like a slice from Benny Fiero's or Mineo's.

 BUT, if you like Buffalo Chicken Pizza, this is the PLACE TO BE. It's absolutely the best Buffalo Chicken Pizza in town. The homemade ranch sauce that they give you is out of this world good too. The pizza isn't very saucy and runny like some other BC pizza that I've had around the area. A must try for BC lovers.
