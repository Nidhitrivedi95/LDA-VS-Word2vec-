41LxL4cESUpvenFmcdwm0w Ate at Angelo's 2 for the first time in almost 10 years or so tonight with a friend of mine; good food but just 1 waitress on duty; so you might have to wait for a bit after you eat for them to bring your check. I got the ravioli and it was good; I want to try the cheese ravioli next time (not like I haven't had it elsewhere though of course).
 I can't really give more than 3 stars since it wasn't delicious, if you want delicious you'll have to pay  a little more, since their pricing is very reasonable here ($8 for my ravioli, dinner roll and side salad!)
