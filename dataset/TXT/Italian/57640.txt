Last time I was there I went with my father. And, like always, as I was looking over the menu I couldn't believe how low some of the prices were for the quality of the food I knew they had. We started with the Fillet Mignon Carpaccio, with I could've eaten ten of. We ordered the Osso Bucco for the main course, which was $22. It was out of this world! It literally falls off the bone it's so tender - to the point I was wondering how they got it on the plate without it falling apart. 

Everything was wonderful. The only knock I really had was the price of our after dinner Limoncello's. Our Negroni's during the meal were the typical $10 which is perfectly normal. But when we got the 1.25 oz Limoncello's they were $10 a piece as well. A price I was taken back by but perfectly willing to pay for the quality of the meal we had. 

I highly suggest you check out this world class gem! Tomaso has been there every time I've dined there, and even though I'm not a regular, he always stops by to talk and ask how things are. A very nice man. This place will continue to be my suggestion for when people ask me where to get good Italian food. It's also one of the best "date night" restaurants I've ever seen - very romantic.
