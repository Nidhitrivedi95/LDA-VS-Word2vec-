NOKaVqvi4hI8RgGjFCFIAg They advertise being a pizza place however rarely seem to have pizza anymore and when they do it is only pepperoni. They used to offer cheese & veggie slices as well which was great since Bitondos across the street only sells pepperoni slices.

I like to support local places instead of going up to college to get a pizza slice from large chains so it's a shame they have gone the route of Bitondos and aren't offering any pizza options for vegetarians.
