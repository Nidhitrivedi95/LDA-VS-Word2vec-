0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw Decided to try this place based on the food network raves.  Ordered various items, including BBQ pizza, BBQ pork plate, portabella mushroom sandwich.  Also did the Peanut butter bananna split just to say we tried it.  Nothing really jumped out as being above average.  Pork was average, sandwich average and pizza was as well.  The pb&bananna split was not good AT ALL.  It was mostly the thick texas toast, and very greasy.  (we got it to split for dessert)  The only thing that was really better than average was the fried zuchinni.  The breading was light and flavorful and they were not at all greasy.  
The parking was bad, but the atmosphere was kind of cute.  Different than any place I'd been before.  
All in all, if you don't live in that part of town, I wouldn't make a special trip.
