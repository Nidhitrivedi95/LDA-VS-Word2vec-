xmARZ_MuSfrQCXP4e8RQjg Snowbird living in Tempe area for 3 months ....so many restaurants to choose from that it becomes difficult. Thus we appreciate Yelp; have mostly been happy with the reviews. We are "clean" eaters, so that is even more difficult to find. But back to Nello's ; their pizza is prepared with fresh ingredients and makes for a delicious piece of pie.
