lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ For a chain restaurant, the inconsistency in the food and service is appalling. Buca makes you sign a contract for a large party prior to making a reservation, which is fine, but they failed to uphold their own terms of the contract. We were due to be seated at 7:30 pm, but they were not prepared for our party and we had to wait an hour. The bread and salads were okay, nothing special. They only gave 4 butters for 3 loaves per basket. The food, fettuccine Alfredo, a sausage ziti and chicken limon. The fettuccine was over peppered, cold noodles and the sauce made me feel like I was licking a chalkboard. The sausage ziti wasn't too bad, not nearly as good as other Buca's I have been to. The chicken was cold and had to be returned because it was not safe to serve. We had 2 members of the party with celiac, and had notified, in the contract that we would need gluten free food for them. The service staff, and who I assume was the manager forgot, and then became combative and defensive when we pointed out that they had not received their meals 20 minutes after our entrees were served. There are plenty of other places to eat in Vegas, please don't waste a dime here. Please also note that the servers Jenny and PJ were awesome, attentive, and handled the situations well. The rest of the staff in fact, did not.
