 We eat here at least once a week. We enjoy their pizza and brunch. Specific items only, as this place can be over priced. There is a server named Tom who is severely lacking the "service industry" bone... He is by far the worst server there. He has ruined several of our experiences. To the point that we specifically request to not be seated in his area. When we complained about him we were told that he is apart of the owners family. Despite the many complaints he is still in the front of the house. So sad. His communication skills are more suited for the computer world.
Today is mother's day and I brought my family there to eat. The food was cold and we were surrounded by flies inside of the restaurant. Horrible first time experience for my family. We keep trying to give cibo the benefit of the doubt but we are running low on chances as of now. 
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer. The service and quality of food is not consistent.
