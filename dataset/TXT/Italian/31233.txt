5OV1bavavdsYyfeBRNiOeA This place has amazing food! I would highly suggest the pizza or pasta. I would recommend their salads as well. Their meatballs are HUGE. This place has true Italian and their presentation is perfect! Everyone needs to come eat here! PS: Sorry for the seemingly empty pictures, went late at night on a Thursday.
