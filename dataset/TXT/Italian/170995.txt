MYCrFbGo2-ZiEYqpwiKsrw So I've been here twice and the first time we went the food was amazing but unfortunately the second time around we were very unimpressed. The food took over an hour to arrive, we had all ordered oven made pizzas. Understandably the restaurant was very busy but really the wait was too long for any pizzeria. Then to top it off there was a piece of hair wedged into the toppings of my pizza, when I told the waiter he took it away then within 2 minutes brought it back to me again asking me to point out the hair... it was as if he didn't really believe me. Through out the service he wasn't particularly friendly, quite cold to be honest so that comment didn't really help either. Thankfully he brought a new pizza to me pretty quickly, and the pizza was cooked deliciously apart from being slightly burnt around the edges. It's just a shame that the service isn't spectacular, the wait is far too long and there was a piece of hair in it too...
