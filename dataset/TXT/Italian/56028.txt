aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw I wanted to love this restaurant but was extremely disappointed. The service was good as expected. We decided on the lobster and, at the recommendation of our waiter, chose the home-made spaghetti to go with it. Both the lobster and spaghetti were unremarkable and average at best. The wine, the gelato dessert, and the special chocolates the waiter brought over as we were finishing up were the high points of the dinner.

Restaurant was great in contacting me to review the issues and resolve :)
