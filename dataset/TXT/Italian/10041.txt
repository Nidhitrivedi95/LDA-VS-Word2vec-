I ordered their ubiquitous spaghetti, but I also got to try their daily special, pasta cooked with peaches and lobster, and their duck ravioli with foie gras. All dishes were excellent, but my favorite was the spaghetti with basil--simple and just different enough to distinguish itself as the best spaghetti I've had. 

The pasta and lobster special was light but the duck ravioili tasted rich, probably better shared, IMO.
