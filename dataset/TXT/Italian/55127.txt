aFBCmJUYrPeol_P75QX7Jw Overpriced, horrible service, cold food. I will probably never return. 

Came as part of a large party. 
 Ordered an array of food and only the lobster pizza was passable. Even though it was cold. 

Steak was overcooked. 
We had demonstrated that we didn't know much about wine and we discovered our waiter gave us a wine that wasn't even listed on their wine list. . 
A chicken pizza came WITHOUT chicken on it. 
Wine was never repoured. Water, only when asked. 

FLIES!
A waiter that addressed us as "buddy", reached over people too often to save himself from walking. 

He gave us a birthday canoli, even we had brought our own cake. And he brought them out separately. 

No offer of dessert, coffee or tea. And no refills of water after the tables were cleared. 

Pleasantly surprised that our party was not charged a service charge. 

Value: 0/5
Taste:  0-2/5
satisfaction upon leaving: 1/5
