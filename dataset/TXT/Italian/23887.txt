3YrySY6jiAJO1N7LbjsI_Q Our party of four had an excellent dinner at Bianca's tonight, and also enjoyed the live music (The PopTarts).  Prices were reasonable, food was great, our server Renèe was attentive.  Good value and enjoyable dining experience.  The restaurant doesn't stand out (just off of Rt 42/Pearl Rd, entrance on Beverly Hills Dr.), but it's worth finding.
