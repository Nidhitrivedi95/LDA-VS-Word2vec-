xYy54Y2VTBAG5k7WJcaH4A The Bottom Line: Of the finest meals that I have ever had in Charlotte. I can't even bring myself to hold the broken cappuccino machine against them.

We were a party of four that included a meat lovers, a part-time vegetarian and someone who only eats chicken.... Not an easy crowd to please but every course, irrespective of what we ate, was perfection. Quality, flavor, portion size, service - superb.

Um, yes, I'll be back.
