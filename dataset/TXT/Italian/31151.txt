5nZVVPO_cYH9aQeClTP9zA It's the chipotle of pizza places. Quick, good but a little on the pricey side of things. It's no Grimaldis or Spinatos but for lunch it's pretty darn good. I'm a fan of salads so the Chicken, gorgonzola and pine nuts is always a nice change up in the week. The Paninis are also tasty and nicely size and the pizza - like I said pricey but good. I like thin crust - that's probably the biggest thing. Fresh, light and not too much for lunch.
