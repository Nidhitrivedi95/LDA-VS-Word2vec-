jOseCpGmgbQWEfX2Wn_TGQ My Wife and I just had a great Dinner and drinks at the most Authentic Italian restaurant we've been to in a long time. I had a Veal Piccata while my wife had the Pasta Trio. Both were the best we've ever had! 

In addition the atmosphere was enhanced by the beautiful piano music being played in the bar area. All of the wait staff were friendly and helpful making the evening one to remember! Angelo the owner was onsite greeting all the diners and made us feel like we were having dinner with long time friends.

If you're looking for a fabulous Italian meal this is the place to be!
