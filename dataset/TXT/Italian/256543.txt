w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q Pretty over priced for what you get.  They're getting 2 stars strictly by comparison.  There are just too many better restaurants to eat at around here to justify wasting a meal in Vegas here.  The service was ok. Took way too long to get drinks but food came at a reasonable pace.
