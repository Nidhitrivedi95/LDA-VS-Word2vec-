zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA Lived across the street from here for almost 10 years and never thought to stop in. Well, last night i visited for the 1st time with a group of Girl Scout moms. WOW! I've been missing out!
Lets start with the atmosphere. It felt cozy, decor was gorgeous, and everyone was so friendly.
Now the food/drinks. We were able to sample the salads, ziti, meatballs, and several different pizzas. This was original italian food. All of it was amazing. The selection of wine was gigantic!
Our group was over 20 people and I didn't hear 1 complaint. 
I will definitely be going back.
