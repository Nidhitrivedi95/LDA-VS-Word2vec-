cpkBJhBujpBFZ0rOItE-4g Don't let the strip mall location fool you.  The food is excellent, best lasagna I've ever had.  Garlic bread was only disappointment, would be better with fresh sour dough.  Excellent fish entrees and desserts.  Creme brulé is terrific.  Good wine selection.  Great neighborhood place.
