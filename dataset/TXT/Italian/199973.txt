PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA I guess I am liking this place.  I have been there 3 times in 2 weeks.  This place is on the modern side of italian fare.  It was a little funny after reading some reviews, when my father in law asked "where are the spaghetti and meatballs". I had to laugh.  We suggested he try the orecchiette with the sausage, rapine and chilies.  That is my favorite pasta.   The first time I had it, I noticed that the pasta is handmade, bonus points.  I have also had the gnocchi, they are good, but I think I will stick with the orecchiette.  I really want to try the polenta next time, sounds so yummy.   For dessert, I am obsessed with the Chocolate Budino, I keep telling my hubby to get his own dessert, although every time I order it, I cannot finish it.  The creamy chocolate pudding, topped with crushed biscotti and a meringue/marshmallow cream on top, DOUBLE YUM, so rich.  Service my second time visiting for a full dinner with my in-laws was a little slow, but this is a new restaurant so I will look the other way, because after all I enjoyed the company and don't mind spending extra time at a restaurant.  One thing I would beg them to fix is the A/C temperature, I always bring a sweater now.   My hubby loves the Margaritas Trent makes, I guess I have to call next time to make sure he is there.
