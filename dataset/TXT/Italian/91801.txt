EGIJ7sfXa5ha89fBxJsTuQ The menu is limited, and that's fine, because I understand it's an Italian coffee shop. And the drink is good and well made, I believe the staff to be trained well. However, our one time experience took the impression that the boys behind the counter didn't care about customers other than to fill their cup well. I'm kind to roughness, but there's a difference between gruff and indifference for the well-being of patrons. The atmosphere isn't all-encompassing enough to be the essence, and neither is the coffee. The space is so open and sharing that the essence should be the people that inhabit it. The kids running the show had some negative vibes running through them that day. Maybe it was just one bad day, but if that's the case then they shouldn't be offended by one negative review.
