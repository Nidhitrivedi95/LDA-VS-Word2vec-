F4zvnOsgjEV9aVbKqBYRng Such a fun place!
One of my girlfriends frequents this place for karaoke- she loves to sing and has the talent to do so (2 for 2!). So when it came time for her birthday, she wanted to celebrate here naturally with karaoke. It's a fairly small spot along prime Mill real estate with both outdoor and indoor seating. Outdoor seating includes speakers so all the world can hear ya when you sing! 

The indoor setup includes a full bar, food menu (mostly pizza), and a very attractive karaoke DJ with an extensive playlist of songs! I even pulled out of my hat some of the most random songs I know back from high school (to keep it TBT)- and he had them! 

A few of our friends got food and loved it. I didn't order anything except for drinks, I wasn't hungry. They pour the drinks well for the price! Maybe since I don't drink much anymore they tasted strong haha.

Call me a fan of 4one4, and know that I definitely will return.
