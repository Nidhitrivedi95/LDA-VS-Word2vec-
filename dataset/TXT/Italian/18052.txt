2K-uV7mmRdGjii5G5eKF6A Horrible! I've been here twice as I normally go to Longos (local and much better across the street) or papa johns (also across the street). I ordered online both times which went well until I got to the store. First time I tried to use the drive thru and was asked to go park and they would bring the food out in a bit. I was annoyed because I had already waited the amount of time the online ordering said to wait before coming. Then when I came inside I found out they had literally JUST put my pizza in the oven. So then I got to sit there another 15 minutes and watch what was probably the worst run business I have ever seen. No sign of manager level employees (I think one was there she was just horrible at managing) and no communication. Eerily quiet environment which is annoying when you're waiting on food. Then I get home and... wrong crust which is an exciting development. ANYWAYS the second time was equally horrible. I waited the predetermined amount of time as shown online (they control this in the store!!!) and came in to see the same "manager" turn around and tell them to PUT MY PIZZA IN THE OVEN! Are you serious?!? Twice they're that incompetent? So again I sit and wait. Damn you Pizza Hut for having delish pizza and garbage employees.
