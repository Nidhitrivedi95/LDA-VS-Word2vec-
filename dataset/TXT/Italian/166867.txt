MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg Plantone's is the newest business to hit the south west side- small market, pizza bar, and a massive selection of sandwiches. From the minute you walk in, service is on point! There's a greeter stationed at the entrance to walk you through the menu and make suggestions, along with multiple staff attending to the dining room and checking on customers.

Pizza is available whole or by the slice- and slices are huge! The Paulie's Pesto Chicken was a great choice, with a thin stretched crust and a robust sauce. The Quattro Formaggio was even better for this cheese lover.  Tried the Italian Pork sandwich with broccolini and sharp provolone, and it was hearty and flavorful. Heads up that the au jus makes it a poor choice for takeout, so come try it when you can stick around.

Prices are pretty reasonable for the product and portion. There is patio seating that looks like it'll nearly double their available seating space in warmer months. This was already a busy plaza before they opened, so I imagine parking is only going to get more hectic. Coming back for the Angry Sicilian soon!
