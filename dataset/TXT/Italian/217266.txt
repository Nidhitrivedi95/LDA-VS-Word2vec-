RXyM7VrCiEFthJxQ4bGmBg The atmosphere is nice and the service was okay.

I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. The meatballs looked and tasted like frozen President's Choice meatballs, they definitely were not made in the restaurant and the sauce tasted like jarred spaghetti sauce. For the price, I definitely expected more. 

Really was not impressed.
