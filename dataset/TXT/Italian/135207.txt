ITUhsKjJYcVupAccQ1ADXQ I went here last Thursday for lunch because i thought it looked so adorable from the outside. I ordered the Piadina panini and my boyfriend ordered the asparagi milanese and gnocchi di ricotta. My bf's dishes were incredibly delicious . . .very light and flavorful. My panini was not very good and I didn't care to finish. It was very salty and dry - not a good combination. I gave Venti three stars because I thought the lunch menu was expensive. The pasta, for $15, was not very big and the salad was 3 spears of asparagus and a fried egg for $10. Also, the service did not do the restaurant justice. Our waiter seemed to be just going through the motions. The lunch menu says "dinner menu also available", so we asked for it and made our original selections from that menu. When we ordered, the waiter said we could not order from the dinner menu. very odd . . . why did he give us the dinner menu then? I believe we were the only patrons there during lunch hour. Either no one knows about Venti or they know something that I don't. Anyway, I think this place has great potential and when I visit Montreal again, I may give it another shot. But my first experience was definitely a 3.
