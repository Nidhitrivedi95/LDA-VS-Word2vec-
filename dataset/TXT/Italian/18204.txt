2LOTz08OPRyA0ibJImJRbQ Best lunch we had in Montreal.  Fresh ingredients, friendly service, and very  tasty food.  The salmon fillet was cooked  and seasoned perfectly. The vegetable salad was as pleasing to the eyes as it was to the palate.  Being very near the large market in Little Italy it was clear where they had gotten their ingredients.  This place serves awesome food, the service is very friendly and attentive, and the open kitchen adds another dimension to an already nice ambiance.  Bon Appetite!
