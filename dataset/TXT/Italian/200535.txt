pvCcrHFAGCml492qoQBsQg Ricci's is a huge Italian restaurant at the Langstaff Centre. When you walk in, the first thing you notice is how red everything is -- the lamp shades, the chairs, the sauce. I came here on a weekday around 1pm and the place was packed. It was difficult to find a place to sit, which only proves how popular this place is, but is a good indication that the food is also good.

After reading the other review, I had to order the baked panzerotti, which is essentially a giant calzone. I ordered the panzerotti with pepperoni and a small side of sauce. Once you place your order, you'll receive a pager and the staff will bring over your food when your pager goes off. Since it was busy here, it took a long time to receive my food, but the wait was worth it.

Growing up in the Bronx, I frequently purchased calzones at the local pizza shop, but it was definitely not the same as what I received at Ricci's. The panzerotti was huge! I was worried that I would not be able to finish eating it, but it was so delicious that the worry went away quickly. The panzerotti was amazing right out of the oven. The mozzarella cheese was perfectly melted and the sauce and pepperoni were tasty. The bread was perfectly soft. It's essentially a heart-attack wrapped inside beautifully soft bread.

The side sauce was unnecessary. The panzerotti by itself was tasty and moist enough. But if you do end up getting a side sauce, the small is sufficient.
