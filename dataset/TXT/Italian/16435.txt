1WBVqmo7tgF0z0eGf4fPhQ I am very picky when it comes to Italian food. Being Italian myself, I thought I couldn't get any better than my moms cooking. After being forced to come here by my parents, I couldn't believe how good it was. I had the butternut squash filled ravioli and it was amazing. I was shocked when I found out that the owners were from Italy and made their own pasta. It really shows in their cooking. This is the only Italian food I actually enjoy eating out. I really hope they get a bigger location in the future! I'll keep coming back regardless.
