1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ Terrible dining experience. It took almost three hours to get our food and it came out cold and coagulated. First the appetizer was very late "because it was burned" and needed to be remade. We watched numerous tables come and go, with our food never arriving. It was so hot upstairs, we sweat through our clothes. Nothing was done to cool the section off.

When the manager arrived, they tried to make things right, but the screwed up remaking our order, gave us the wrong to go dessert, and two people in our group went home with some other table's half eaten left overs! Disgusting. 

I used to think highly of Maggianos, but their service and quality have fallen apart. Never going back.
