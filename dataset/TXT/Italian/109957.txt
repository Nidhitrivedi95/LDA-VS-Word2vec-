G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I am writing this review for the fact the food is small, bland and expensive. It was my husbands birthday and we were excited for a delicious dinner. We opted for the tasting dinner so we could try more things. Antipasti was small plate with a few little bites. Family style to share? Bread plate was good with tiny amount of butter and pesto. Then pasta appetizer was lemon spaghetti which was al dente, bland and dry. My husband had fregolotto which was mushy but he ate it. Main course showed up and looked nice. Lamb was good but sides were mushy and unrecognizable too. He had tenderloin with gnocchi and carrots. Not impressive. No waitress in sight ever checked on us. She kept walking by and finally we asked for manager. He was shocked we didn't like our dinner. Really? Dessert was good but save your money.
