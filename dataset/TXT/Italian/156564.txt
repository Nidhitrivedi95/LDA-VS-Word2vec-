L8W83-wPFLMs457cAu60Eg My husband and I ate here last night and it was just fabulous. I called ahead of time to find out if there were vegetarian options, which there were and then managed to get a reservation for 8.30 (definitely need reservations as it is a small place). We had the roasted cauliflower salad as so many reviews said it was great, and it was amazing. I don't even like cauliflower, it was really just that good. We also had the country toasts, spaghetti bolognese and gnocchi (made veggie). The wine was great as well, and we had some sort of caramel sea salt pudding thing. Everything was excellent, and as we live close by I'm sure we'll be back again! Only thing I'd wish I'd known was that it's cash or debit only.
