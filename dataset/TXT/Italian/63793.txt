bBGTy0iw4vXxq28zpTjsnA Read all the reviews here and was really looking forward to having a wonderful dinner - but it didn't happen. The best part of the meal was the great server. She really took good care of us.
Could have had the same kind of food for much less at any food court...

Overall the price was okay (4 adults including bottle of wine was $150 + tip). We all had a dinner special with appetizer, pasta, and main.

Stracciatella was bland and too salty.
Chicken parmigiana was only okay.
Lasagna was many layers of pasta without much meat.
Gnocchi was doughy and heavy.

Best dish was the very traditional tiramisu.

Did not live up to the hype. What happened Yelpers?
