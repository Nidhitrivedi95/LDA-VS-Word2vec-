c-l4nDPZcEwapEiV-Xf08w I got to say that this place is the best!
First chef Jorge and is staff are the best regarding there consistency to always provide request for anything !! Great job
The service is always from the young jay to Eric the newest manager and veteran like Shane the manager and of course David Daza , let's not forget about the man behind this restaurant Stratos Lambos and Angelo Kaltsounis and frank of course (he's the best pastry chef in Charlotte) , job well done !!
