IsN0qEzgAXBjbT3qn6lokA It was a struggle for me to choose between 2 stars or 3.Its more of a 2.5 but do I want to give them the extra edge?

NO

Anyway I got a regular cheese pizza and for 10 bucks it ended up being 

1)Sour Dough crust WTF, who doesn't metion the crust taste like the most sour sourdough ever?

2) it actually tasted similar to Peter Piper Pizza

3).........................(dots equal drum roll) It was the size of large burger. Seriously it was about equal to 2  and a half normal slices. 

This pizza tasted like shit and for 10 dollars I can go to grimaldis and get an awesome pizza triple the size and quadruple the quality. 

P.S. The waiters uniform makes them look like tools. Like they work in a country club. You know what I'm talking about if you been there.
