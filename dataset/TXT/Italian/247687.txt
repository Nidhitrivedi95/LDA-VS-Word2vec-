VcGyezSNtkNBr2HidcaM1A This place is "ok". I'm in town from California visiting my brother here in Mesa and we wanted some pizza and pasta. After reading the reviews we decided to give this place a try. We ordered an extra large BBQ pizza (#7) and half of it was the #13 (veggie style).  I also ordered the cheese stuffed ravioli with the meat sauce.  Everything we ordered was Ok.  I definitely would go to Pizza Hut over this place on any other occasion.  It's a cute restaurant inside with a great home style feel but the food just lacks flavor and home made quality.  I was hoping the quality would reflect from the 4 star rating.  I'm giving this place a 3 because it wasn't terrible. But it also wasn't anything special.  If you really want Italian style pizza, I'd look somewhere else first.
