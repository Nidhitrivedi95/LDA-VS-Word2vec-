miUmZ27vC-gHoyEmUQMYuQ Solid Italian place. Very nice atmosphere and its on the second floor!

Ordered the rigatoni $18 and it was so good! Creamy and rich, with lots of mushroom ... Delish! My friends ordered the seafood linguine $24 and the momma Rosetta pizza $18 ... Everyone said their food was on point. Good job! Would definitely pay the price for this quality Italian food.

The only drawback is the manager seemed to be on every person on staff. Kept pointing them to do rounds and stuff. I mean, good that youre making sure the guests are being attended to but can't you do this behind the scenes? Bit awkward. You could tell who was new too. 

Either way, I'd come back for the food.
