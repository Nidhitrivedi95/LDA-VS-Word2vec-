wkZ6P5fDw0G_iFRU-hzBhQ Extremely impressive beer selection on tap and the bartenders are not greedy about letting you have a couple tastes before making your selection.  The pizza was excellent and service was speedy.  We ordered a specialty pizza called "One Veggie" - Red Sauce, Mozzarella, Roasted Garlic, Mushrooms, Goat Cheese, Artichokes, Pesto.  I would highly recommend it to anyone!  Besides the specialty pizza selections you can also create your own and they offer 8" and 16" sizes.  

Also, good news to people with small children, this place is incredibly family friendly!  Along with the impressive beer selection, they also had an impressive selection of flavored milk!!  It seemed like more milk was being served than beer when we were there.  

If you are not looking for a kid friendly environment, just show up later around 7:30 or 8pm.  I think we arrived at family happy hour (around 6:30), but all the children started to disappear around 7:30...bedtime! :)

So I would highly recommend for pizza and beer lovers with children or without children!  Just pay attention to what time you decide to show up!
