k4Vhhh4h4cNCQmnxWiy79Q really bad. ordered pizza and wings - were surprised at how quickly it arrived on a Friday evening, but the food was just not good. everything was clearly packaged, pre-made food. the wings seemed to be frozen and then fried and the sauce had little flavor.  pizza had little flavor and toppings were clearly not fresh - the sausage was uniform, frozen, flavorless balls of "meat"
we're always happy to support a local business, but this just didn't do it for us. 
2 stars for delivery speed.
