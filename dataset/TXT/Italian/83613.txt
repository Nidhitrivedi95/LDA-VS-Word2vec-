DjvpsmdtEvnyMk2vXxpc-w Ordered take-away for dinner. I arrived at the time they said it would be ready but had to wait another 20 minutes for it. Salmon looked like it was pre-packaged, thawed fish that comes in those vacuum seal bags and it was way overcooked. Also ordered bruschetta and it was on toasted white bread. The two meals and tip were not worth the experience. I would not try them again.
