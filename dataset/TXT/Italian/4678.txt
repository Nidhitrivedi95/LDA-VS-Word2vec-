_mg5bYknpZgaWSfjQVmrJQ I've tasted amazing pizza from here before, but I was a little disappointed with their service tonight. I tried to order online for a pickup and it said they were closed. So I had to call them and order over the phone and ordered the Gorgonzola salad with strawberries and a side of chicken and a brownie. There was a bit of a line with the pickup, but I was able to get my order without a problem. Just a bit disappointed that I paid for the chicken with my salad and didn't get any. The salad and the brownie were both amazing. As soon as they get the kinks worked out with their online ordering and work on those those small details, I have no doubt, I will be able to give a 5 star review!
