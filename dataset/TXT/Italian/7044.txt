0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw I live in the neighborhood next to JFG, so I've been here a handful of times. First, be prepared for a long line, any day of the week.  I've had the ahi tuna salad, but if u want an ahi tuna salad go to a sushi restaurant, I don't really recommend that from JFG.  I'm a big fan of the hot dogs, recommend them. Strange tho, that they dont serve a chili dog, or have any chili for that matter. But be warned - they always seem to send me immediately straight for a bathroom, if you know what I mean.... Or maybe it's just me. The BBQ pizza flatbread was a little on the bland side. The date shake was okay, the shakes in the middle of nowhere Dateland, AZ are better. The pumpkin pie shake, however, is delish - recommend highly.

The food is decent, but pretty expensive for just "decent" food, and really long lines. At some point I'm sure I'll go back, since I live right next to it and people who visit always want to try it and see what it's all about because they saw it on Triple D. Rumor has it, that they have good breakfast, which I've never tried, and somewhat interested in.
