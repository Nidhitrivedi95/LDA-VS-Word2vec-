You get what you pay for and this was one of the best dinners I have had in my life.  Luca the server was so attentive and gracious and just a pleasure.  We were seated outside on a beautiful February night.  It was just fantastic.  Everything was perfect the pasta was just sublime.  I have to say that the only complaint is that we didn't have more time to enjoy more off the menu.

Cheers and happy Eats!
