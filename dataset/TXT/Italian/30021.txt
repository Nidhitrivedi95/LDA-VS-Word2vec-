5gl2GLgimBz1-Q-uXji_Rw I used yelp to order lunch. Allowed for the time given for pickup. Drove ten minutes to pickup and when I got to restaurant I was asked "what order ". The woman found my order on her fax machine and said "oh, I didn't see that ". It will be another 15 minutes for us to make now. Hello!!! I am on lunch from work. That is why I used yelp! The lady didn't offer anything for my troubles. Went through Burger King drive through and ten minutes late on lunch getting back. Milano' calls yelp and tells them I cancelled order. What??!! Yelp calls me. I explain what happened and they said they would email a gift certificate. That was last Wednesday. Didn't receive anything. Very disappointed with entire experience
