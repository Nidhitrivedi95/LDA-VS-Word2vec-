5mmF-H_4emxvultbneKFWQ Nice overall pizza and Italian fare.  Went there with my kid (age 12) who was not particularly thrilled with the Frank Sinatra radio being played.  So I had to explain to him that "The Chairman of the Board" is required listening when eating Italian food.  I'm pretty sure he would have preferred Coldplay. 

We got a salad, garlic knots and a barbecue chicken pizza.  I know, I know... a barbecue chicken pizza is utterly un-Italian.  But let me explain our situation.  At our house we eat a lot of pizza.  A LOT of pizza.  We have two pizza stones, several dough recipes, a fridge full of cheese and about a half dozen local pizza parlors on speed dial.  So sometimes we need "pizza variety" and this was one of those nights.  

Now I fully understand if you're leery of this review because how can you trust a "pizza-review" for an "Italian-joint" when the reviewer goes and orders a BBQ Chicken pizza. You must think I'm a real tool.  But with this amazingly detailed disclosure and warning, I will say that the pizza was really good.  It had nice chunks of tomatoes, onions and the chicken was cooked spot on.  Also (and this is a big bonus) the BBQ sauce was NOT KC Masterpiece or some other routine stuff I often recognize when dining out at lazy restaurants.  The salad was perfect and the garlic knots were good... I would have liked real garlic chunks on them as opposed to just being sprinkled with garlic powder.  The service was great and the owner (I think she was the owner) reminded me of J-Lo! Nice job.
