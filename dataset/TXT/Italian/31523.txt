5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ I'm a NY'er and long time Joe's fan as it is the only place in town with a decent slice.  I must say that lately the quality has been declining.  Not enough sauce on the pies, bad tomatoes in the salad and even some bad entrees lately.  I just hope that someone over there reads these reviews and gets things back to how they used to be as this place has great potential.
