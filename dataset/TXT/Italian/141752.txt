JogUSDKa1xyG3lLEmD4Xjg Will definitely be returning to Fiamma.  This was the best Italian I've had since I've come to Charlotte.  

When first arriving, it was early 630ish on a Friday night.  The parking lot was pretty empty & the outside is unassuming.  My partner was skeptical about even staying when we walked in & only 4 tables had patrons. 

We stayed enjoying a fantastic veal chop, gnocchi, & for my less adventurous partner a carbonara.  Truly delicious all around & didn't necessarily taste like Italian I could copy easily in the kitchen myself.

Definitely will be returning for very authentic Italian cuisine.
