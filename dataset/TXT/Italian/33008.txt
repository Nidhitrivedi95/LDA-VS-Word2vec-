5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA I understand that 4th of July weekend is a busy weekend for the food industry and service might be slow, but the service was HORRIBLE!!!!

We had a party of 4, on 7/4. We're seated in a "okay" matter of time, but the couple in front of us seemed like they were waiting for a while and was getting really mad... We got a window seat to see the fireworks on the strip and the neighboring casinos.

There seemed like 3 waitress & waiters, with 10 bus-boys running around. Our waters and soda never went dry but we waited over 30minutes to get our desserts and another 15 to get the bill. Honestly I can't remember my meal because I was so annoyed with how poor the service was.

I gave one star because the Tiramisu was pretty good. Otherwise I will not be going there again.... If my bf can play a game on my iPhone and win his highest scoring game, there is a BIG issue with the service... :(
