gPa_C5oQRvoiwQU6DuWS8A After our horrible experience across the street @ Urban 7 (ie: NOT reccommended!) our little eyes spot this very cute & cozy spot as we walk out and over to our car.  Hmmmm, this place has been here before, hasn't it?  It seemed familar yet different.

A romantic and cozy patio, complete with white tableclothes, and little lights.  We walk into the salon, (which had really cool products and gifts for purchase as you walk in), and we were promplty greeted by a girl behind the salon counter.  We wanted to inquire about the menu & wine tasting. We were nicely pointed in the direction of 2 very hard working and busy chefs.


We were informed by the 2 chefs, who promptly stopped their prepping to eargerly talk to us, that wednesday evenings were wine tasting nights, and yes, they had a representative from a Cali Winery in attendance, as well as providing a little buffet of appies.  

Now, this place is extremely inviting, warm & friendly, (we needed to so get over the nastiness from 7 we just came from - this was NICE - "hey 7, did you hear that?  be NICE")

I am awaiting their email invites for what they are excitedly putting toegether, as they have only been open just over 1 mth.  I did not partake of this wine event, but i certainly can't wait to see what other offereings they might have in the future!

(did i mention how nice and attentive everyone was here??? Hellllooo!)
