9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg We went here because I Googled low carb pizza and they came up. It started off great, we were quickly seated and served. They brought  a basket of bread it was just OK. Not worth the calories. I ordered wine, chicken wings and a pizza. Husband ordered a pizza. He said his was good but not enough sauce or cheese. The wings were not crispy and not spicy at all. Then my pizza came so much after my husbands he had finished his by the time mine arrived. I also wanted a second glass of wine and had to call someone over to order it. If I were a server I would be all over the wine. It is the fastest way to up the bill and increase the tip. It seems this happens frequently that they keep the soft drinks full but never ask about wine. Anyway it was just OK here. May go back for the low carb pizza which we didn't end up getting.
