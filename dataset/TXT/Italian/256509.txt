w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q I dined here for lunch while picking up tickets to a show at the box office. I have always heard of The Palm, but never experienced it before. I always see their products at home goods lol. I started with the lobster bisque. The waitress poured it table side on top of a pile of lobster meat. DELISH! We both ordered a $22 lunch deal that included a steak, side and a salad. I was definitely a good deal for the food included. I ate the skirt steak that tasted like more of a Latin preparation with onions and peppers than an American steakhouse.  It came with an avocado which felt like an odd combination, but it worked. I enjoyed it. We chose the Brussels sprouts and half and half potatoes as our sides. The vegetables were great, but the potatoes looked like fried potato scraps and chips. Nothing special or appetizing about it. The restaurant definitely has an old school feel. The service was good, but slow. I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here, but if you're in the area or shopping at the Forums, it seems like a reliable choice.
