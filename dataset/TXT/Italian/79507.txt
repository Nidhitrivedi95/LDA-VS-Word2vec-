d1_Ko1DQ4QyB9BjnCFjVLw I've been enjoying Cucina Tagliani for about 15 years since I've lived in the neighborhood, it's my favorite restaurant, with my favorite server Tanya :)  I also hosted a 30th wedding anniversary party in a private dining room there a few years ago.  So, when we were thinking of where to have our wedding reception it was a natural choice.  We reserved the entire patio for 50 guests, and hired the musician that is there on some Fridays, Bill Hranek.  He played at our church wedding (sounded beautiful!!!) and then moved on to the reception - played acoustic guitar and sang during dinner, then turned into a DJ and cranked things up after dinner!!!  It was absolutely perfect - the 5 entree choice menu (YUM!), the service, we decorated the patio with balloons, flowers, wedding cake table and colorful gift bags and Tagliani's set the tables with table cloths and votive candles.  Our guests had soooo much fun they didn't want to leave! I got tons of compliments, people are still talking about how much they enjoyed our wedding and reception. The waitresses even danced with some of our guests.  It was truly a magical evening made even better by the wonderful service and food at Tagliani.  Thank you Rhonda, Kelly, Tanya, Crystal, Kristy, Bill Hranek, Chef Danny and everyone else for our beautiful reception!  I hope you enjoy your visit to Tagliani as much as I have for all these years.  Try my favorite dish, Spinach Manicotti with Marinara and Alfredo sauces.  You might want to buy a gift card while they are having their Holiday special - you get a free $20 for each $100 you spend.  I paid for our reception in advance, so now I have free money on my card to use for dinners with my new hubby :):):)
