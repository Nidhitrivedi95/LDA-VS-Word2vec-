XT25YpQoNDuzAZHur-HZ8g It's a little off the track for a Saturday night dinner place, but this is a good thing as we were able to snag a table right away. 

The décor is chic with high ceilings and a relatively minimalistic look. There's another similar Italian restaurant close by that specializes in pizza and it's so cluttered that space is limited. It was nice to not (literally) rub shoulders with random people and be able to chat with dining companions at a regular voice volume. This location is well staffed with a number of staff visiting tables and seeing how we're doing. 

Now to the food; all our menu choices were winners and can't wait to have it again!
- Caprese Salad w/ Beets: an interesting twist on a classic; I'll have to prepare this at home.
- Arancini: it was good, but not that great that you HAVE to order it.
- Salami Pizza: super flavourful with generous portions of crunchy salami
- Eggplant Pizza: again, super flavourful with a hint of spice (meatless)
- Tiramisu: presentation of it (mason jar) was super cute, but it was just okay (use up these calories for wine instead)

Can't wait to return!

Good for: pizza, quiet night out
