G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q In Vegas for my wife's birthday and we wanted this to be a great night of food and a view of the strip. We told them this when we made a reservation and when we arrived.  They didn't seem to care. No one even mentioned the birthday and our seats had zero view. 

Unfortunately, this attitude permeated through the whole staff. The service was terrible. We were there on a quiet Wednesday night and the restaurant wasn't crowded and it still took 40 minutes until we even got a drink!  That's with a reservation. 

The only reason this gets 3 stars is the food is excellent. The bacon wrapped dates as an appetizer were the best we ever had. (I can't remember our other app).  We both had pasta as a main, the spaghetti and fregolotto and both were very tasty but the portions were small - appetizer size. 

It then took another 20 minutes to get the check and get out of there - because we didn't want to hang around for coffee with no view and bad service. 

So to sum up - tasty food, smallish portions and terrible service.
