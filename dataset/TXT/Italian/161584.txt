llCxryWr8j1S39tusYCWxg We came back because the first visit was so good.  This time I tried the gyro -- OMG!!! The best I have ever had. They make their own tzitziki,  and grill the meat for a perfect taste. ..WOW!! Hubby had the lasagna,  which we figured would be wonderful based on the white pizza we had on first visit. But, we were not prepared for the DYNAMITE flavor of that marinara sauce with the light noodles, meat combo. The marinara is so fresh, light on flavor without any heavy herbs drowning out that wonderful fresh tomatoes taste. Love this place!!!
