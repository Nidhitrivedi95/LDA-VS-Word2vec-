H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g I loved how the menu was set up with lots of small plates and many vegetable options.  The portions were small and perfect for sharing.  The spicy broccoli, eggplant Milanese and grilled radicchio were very tasty. My spicy bucatini pasta was outstanding and the perfect size.  We left full but not stuffed.  Nice decor and great for people watching. I did not care for how the wine list wad set up and some of the prices were ridiculous even for Vegas.  Food prices were in line with quality.  Recommend.
