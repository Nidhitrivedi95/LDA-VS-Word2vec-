SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg My friend coordinated a girl's brunch during the holiday weekend.

Some Pros and Cons are listed below:

PROS
-Great view of the fountain
-tasty entrees, tried the salmon salad, my friends were a fan of the mushrooms and pasta
-the Lago cocktail was very pretty and elaborate with the ice ball that had a flower in the ice

CONS
-We get it, super busy restaurant, not very attentive
-place opened at 1130 but my girls wanted to set up a little with regards to the party favors but they wouldn't let them in a little earlier to set up, cutting it close they said even though the place was empty and there was already staff moving about
