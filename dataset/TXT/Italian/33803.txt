64o_nYvzIKwHFOSYSEm-qw We were on the way to the airport and were a bit early, so we decided to get a quick bite. I had seen their ad on Facebook and said, let's try it. We got a couple of slices, It was a warmed up slices, but seriously was great tasting pizza. The crust had that crunch and the sauce had that great taste of oregano with a lasting taste of pretty close to perfection. I'm a NYC boy, Italian and I make my own dough. Try it, you'll love it
