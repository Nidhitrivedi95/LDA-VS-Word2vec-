Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ After ordering from Nathan's for 3 years (carryout), I called this evening and was told they would not deliver bc they were too busy. I offered to pay over the phone with my cc like I do each time and have my partner pick up the pizza after seeing his last patient at the hospital. Bc I couldn't bring my i.d. to the location I was told Marco the owner said no, they would not sell me my order. 

After 3 years of ordering pizza 2-3 times per month this is how the owner treats a regular customer. It's apparent you don't need my business. I will no longer use your restaurant, and look to another pizza place for my orders, party and office orders. I'm sure Rocco's, etc will be happy to serve me. FAIL
