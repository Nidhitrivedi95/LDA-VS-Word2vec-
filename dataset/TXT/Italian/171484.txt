N_cCvYUP0dQeLKflgoUrXQ Should be a zero star. This place ran out of ice and said to the customers, they aren't going to fill it. Great, how about you tell me BEFORE I've paid for my drink? Don't list your toppings, if more than half of them are unavailable. Tell me before I start ordering that the most popular toppings are out! Complete idiots that work here. Who's in charge of inventory? How do you run out of toppings? Don't eat here. You're better off eating a handful of dirt. 

Terrible. Several other customers complained that they waited an hour and a half for their pizza bc they forgot to make it. Clowns that work here. It's a circus.
