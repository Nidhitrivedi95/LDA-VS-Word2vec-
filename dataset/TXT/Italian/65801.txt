bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw I came here on a Wednesday night and wow...it was glorious! You step into the building and you no longer feel like you're in Charlotte! The decor is fantastic and the service was spot on. I ordered the soup of the day which was a delicious cauliflower and broccoli purée with cream and prosciutto. Omg! I could have eaten just that, however, I also had the parpadelle bolognese. I ordered the appetizer portion and it was still pretty massive. I only managed to eat half of it, but the goat cheese on top made it divine! My friends enjoyed their pizza and steak as well. Oh, and the calamari was pretty good as well. It could have used some lemon for acidity but it was yummy nonetheless. I will absolutely return!
