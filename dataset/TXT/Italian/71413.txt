C6jKwYmzHztO7OCex9j-YQ This was our first time ordering from here.  Our son will be a freshman at Pitt in the Fall and we wanted something that we could just order in to the hotel.   The front desk gave us several menus and we chose Mia's.  I was sorry to see so many bad reviews but I can safely say we were very happy with our choices.  We come from suburban Philadelphia where there is a pizza place on every corner and too many of them are those puffy crusted Greek pizzas which I can't stand.  Mia's was excellent.  Not too much crust for the pizza and well seasoned.  We also had burgers which were good and pasta which was really tasty.  We also got dessert  which was okay,  but the baklava was homemade and really good.  Prices were comparable to home and delivery was fast to the hotel. I highly recommend for visiting families or anyone else in town.  We will use again.
