jz4jg_OTw32IMr_sXFwj9Q Yesterday, my family and I ordered pick up for 8 people. We got pizza, side salads, a fish sandwich, shrimp pasta, and a appetizer. 

I called in around 530p (last minute dinner decision) 

With a Lent Friday in Pittsburgh eateries with no meat options get pretty busy! I was prepared for a long wait but I have to say I was proven wrong.   
The order was complete and picked up in under an hour. Not one item was missing and everything tastes great! 

The parking lot was super busy and there was a line of people waiting to be seated but the staff was great and had everything packed up and ready to go about a minute after I paid. 

Thank you.
