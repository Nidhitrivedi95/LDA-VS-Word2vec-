Ms17VRbhM5Et6OEZnAUyxg We picked up pizza from here last night. First time trying. Very delicious pizza's! Perfectly made dough/crust, wasn't overly thick or heavy. Good tasty crunch! We got the "Satullo" pizza and a "Build your own" pizza. Had good fresh veggie toppings and fresh tasty sauce! They had a large variety on their menu, will definitely try other items!
