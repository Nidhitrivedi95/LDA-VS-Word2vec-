Zr2rgAuH88K2Hlp_Uo0BEw Awesome time at the Med Grill! At least, the venue and music were fantastic, not sure about the menu. 

Perhaps it's just me being my jovial and social self, but why am I the only one dancing? 

Different from the other bars in St. Laurent Street where house music is prevalent. Med Grill is the one of the places that plays a good mix of hip hop music. Although I love house music, Med Grill provided a welcome change for something different.

Rating Med Grill as a social hang out, Med offers drinks are stiff and cheap, a definite plus. The space is trendy with modern style decor and furniture. The lighting is a little dim like other clubs in St. Laurent but the place is small enough that you can make out the entire setup of establishment without reverting to a map and flashlight.  Another great feature is its location, it sits right on the corner of St. Laurent where all nightclubbers and bar hoppers funnel through, so the outdoor patio makes for great people watching.

Inside, I observe pretentious-looking patrons holding their drinks making casual conversation, some wanting to gyrate to the music, other content continuing on their isolated discussions in the corner. They watch me having a good time. 

Phuc it! I'm going to have fun and show these lookers that I don't care what they think. I'm on vacation!
