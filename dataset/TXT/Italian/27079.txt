4qQVf2lt-47VcQ4v54PEXQ My boyfriend and I dropped in for lunch. We were seated immediately. Placed order soon after. We waited minimum of 45 min for a medium size pizza, and although food was prepared from scratch 45 minutes is a long time to wait. After the food was delivered no one came out to refill our waters or check on how everything was going. We had to go inside and look for someone to close out our tab. Overall not the lunch we expected. We live in the neighborhood and if we consider returning to dine at this restaurant once again we hope to have a better experience.
