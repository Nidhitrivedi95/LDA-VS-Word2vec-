FevycwulBfHEZt77dv2EyA I came here because its very close to my work, and I had heard an ad for it on the radio claiming, "grandmothers Italian cooking," or something along the lines of that.  When I pulled up I remember thinking to myself, "Geez, I hope this isn't incredibly over-priced crappy bar food."

It was.

Walking inside all I could hear was the announcements of a horse race, and a commercial for Prostate disorder...yumm!!

After seating us, our waiter introduced himself as Alfredo.

Immediately I looked on the menu for Fettuccine Alfredo, his name made me crave it, lol.  Was it on there? Nope. I went in hoping to get some kind of yummy Italian dish, but after looking at the menu I could tell it wasn't going to happen. 

My dear friend and I decided that nothing really caught our eye, and decided to just split the vegetarian pizza.  It was bland, and the artichoke hearts tasted horrible, I gagged on a bite of them. I gagged on a $10.00 individual pizza. For the service and the quality of the food, $10.00 should have been the price for 2 meals. Ugh, I will not be returning.

Heres what it comes down to: crappy decor, crappy atmosphere, (unless you like to watch and listen to nothing but sports, which is understandable since it is a bar) crappy service, crappy pizza, crappy prices. Crappy lunch. :/.
