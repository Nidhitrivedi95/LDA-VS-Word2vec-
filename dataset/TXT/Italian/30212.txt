5HjmnWOtBYAYW-jjdZ3aKA Owner is an absolute terror. Yelling at servers across the dining area and raucously partying with friends/family while my family is trying to enjoy a meal. I was shocked when I complained and the server told me the seemingly intoxicated bafoon was the owner. Food was mediocre at best (think below Olive Garden and way below Pasta too) and atmosphere stinks.
