vExvdgUbU377-Fry2uuv_w Despite the so-so reviews for this pub, I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 for my one-time visit on a Sunday night, no less. 
I used to live in London (Jolly Old, not Ontario) and love pubs that remind me of some of the haunts I used to frequent across the pond. They have weekly night specials, Sundays happen to be martinis, and I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, clientelle and staff alike. I also ordered a pizza which was absolutely rocking! I'd even go back just to try a few other pizzas out, actually. 
Anyways because this place is so close to home for me, this is going to become a regular of mine.
