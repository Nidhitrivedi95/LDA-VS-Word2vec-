klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw I had the eggs Benedict and it was perfect! But extremely pricey for breakfast. We spent over $60.00 on breakfast. Two entree, two coffee and one orange juice is much. The service was okay, they weren't really welcoming for a high end breakfast place. I doubt I will come back. But if money isn't an issue, definitely recommend this place.
