hTsZSiftorNUFb1VaHCHHg Nook saved my husband and I one evening where we attended a party where neither of us could eat more than tortilla chips due to our dietary restrictions (me-veg, him- no dairy, no gluten). 

Nook had been on my bookmarks list for awhile for the gluten free pizza, but my husband wasn't down with eating a cheeseless pizza so he went for the short ribs instead. He absolutely loved them! He raved about them with every bite, and he was equally happy with the sides. My pizza was just ok. It reminded me of pizza that I can make at home, and I was hoping for something with a little more wow.

What was more impressive was the cocktails. Not a long list, but the two we got were both very good. Service was impeccable. Both the manager and our waiter really made us feel welcome and at home. We will definitely be back.
