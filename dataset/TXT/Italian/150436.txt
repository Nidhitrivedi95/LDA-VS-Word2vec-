KkRUprt06Jg8ANLIQLPijQ I was sent to La Cascina by my Yelp Friend! 

Happy Hour: drinks for $10 with complimentary Italian appetizer! 

Rustic Abruzzo food: meat and seafood based since Abruzzo is located in South Central Italy with mountain and by the coast. 

Nothing rustic about La Cascina decor! Love the dark wooden and blue theme. The decor is quite chic and I was welcomed with open arms. The restaurant is small, cosy and the services are attentive and friendly.

Bar stools are cushioned with padding and are quite comfy as I enjoying my aperitivo by sipping my white wine and enjoying my snacks. 

The little plate includes cheese, beans, peas, sausages and rice ball. After the savoury item, my friendly waitress presented me with Salame di Cioccolato which is a traditional Italian holiday treat. The lady that made the sweet was sitting right next to me and I have to tell her that it was the best part of my Happy Hour!! 

I really like the concept of having a daily menu as it is depends on what kind of fresh meat/veggie/fish they get from their suppliers. Some of their ingredients are shipped directly from Italy too! Price point wise a main is around $20 which is reasonably priced. 

I can't wait to go back and try out some of their home made Italian comfort food...... Hopefully soon!!
