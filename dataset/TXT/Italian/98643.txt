ewEDv_q-K0fV0FepkHB8sA As a visitor, I was NOT impressed by the State St. bar scene. Way too college-y for me. Then, my brother and I stumbled upon the Tornado, which was near my hotel and it was awesome!

Inventive cocktails, great service and super-duper ambience! We also shared a salad, which was too heavy on the dressing, but yummy nonetheless. 

If I lived in Madison, this would be my go-to bar/lounge/hangout.
