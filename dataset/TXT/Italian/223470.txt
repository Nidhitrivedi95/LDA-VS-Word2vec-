SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw Had lunch here with family on Monday afternoon. I had the Tuscan Chicken.  OMG it was so delicious!  And they have freshly baked garlic knots (bread) they are hot, fresh, and delicious! Chef/ Owner Tyler always creates "Top Notch" Italian food! I always eat here when I am in town visiting family. Great Italian food, large portions, fair prices.

Clean dinning room, clean restrooms, friendly service.

Family friendly, eat in or take it to go, either way you are in for a treat! 

Keep up the good work Chef Tyler!
