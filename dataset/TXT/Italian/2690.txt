-RIWE3MU3GCHM5KIW7PLww Would give 4 1/2 stars if I could.  Everything was authentic to Northern Italy cuisine.  Pasta with seafood, pasta with vegetables, and an entree salad were ordered.  Each had good flavor and seemed fresh.
if you check in using Yelp, there was a free mini-cannoli offer.

Ordered a pizza to go.  They did not have a standard Margherita, so got the Fresco.  Good flavor, but priced too high for the size.  $8.99 for the bare-bones Fresco pizza might be a good "hook" to get people into the restaurant.

There was an entertaining piano man playing when we entered (might have been Co-owner).  Nice touch.
If my place, I would extend the red paint, on the lower half of the wall, all the way up.  Thus would provide a warmer atmosphere and remove the stripmall feel.

overall good and worth the money when the piano man is playing....
