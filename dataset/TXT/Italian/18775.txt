2QBD8wYCrwgOGRfHKvS23w Have had real good slices of pizza on previous visits..  That being said, tonight's experience has turned me away from this place for good!!   I didn't see the previous reviews about the calzone and ordered one with Meatballs..  Just awful.... Was made earlier in the day, cut open and toppings stuffed in and reheated.  My son got kids chicken tenders and fries.   Fries came and were way over cooked, greasy and seemed like they were not fresh.  I went up to ask for some new fries and the owner, of all people, sat there and argued with me.   He kept saying his fries were fresh and there is no way they are not good etc.  etc.   Mind you we have had much better fries in the past.  He made a real scene about it and I couldn't believe it!  Very rude!!!!   He brings the new fries out, which were done correctly this time, and I expressed I had never had an experience such as this especially from an owner of a business......   Steer clear of this rude business owner!!!
