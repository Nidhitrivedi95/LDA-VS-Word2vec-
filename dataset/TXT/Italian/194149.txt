PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ Food was good, drinks were good, service was great. If I had to make a complaint it would be that the atmosphere wasn't what I was expecting, more of a sports bar feel than a restaurant. Not that it was bad atmosphere but just not what I was expecting after looking at the menu online. We will most definitely return.
