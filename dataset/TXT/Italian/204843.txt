QDJBn7I1EdtP9w4nYT24Pw Horrible; this place deserves negative stars. I ordered orange and lemon chicken, fried rice, white rice, lo mein, fried wontons, and crab puffs. With each thing I tried it all just got worse and worse. Everything was incredibly bland. The breading on the chicken was soggy. The fried rice was literally rice and soy sauce (I was expecting things like egg, peas, carrots, etc. to be in it). The noodles were cooked fine, just boring. The fried wontons   unexpectedly had no filling. Eating the crab puffs was like opening a Lay's potato chip bag: more air inside than filling. The delivery only took about 25 minutes, but I'd honestly rather wait a little bit longer for better food.  This was such a waste of money. I should have just gone to Panda Express; I would have spent the same amount of money and had much better food.
