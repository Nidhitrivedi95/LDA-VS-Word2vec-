UzjCvrNuK4crxi0IS9Jp5A Terrible place! I ordered a Large 18" pizza and they accidentally brought out the biggest Monster size pizza 26" and we already wanted so long so the waiter said just keep it she will take care of it so we did ,when brought the check they charged us for the pizza we did not fucking order which was an extra 18$!!! Manager didn't want to help but it was the waiters fault and she admitted it and still made us pay for something the waiter fucked up on!
