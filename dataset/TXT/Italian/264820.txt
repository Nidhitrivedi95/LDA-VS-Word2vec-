wyKd4F1fAfDCA1rTxSoT_A I went here when they first opened and I thought it was a great hip place. The Italian, tapas style food was amazing, especially the mini pizzas. 

Unfortunately, when I decided to return to the restaurant recently with my parents and sister, I encountered some rude waitstaff and will never return again.

We had made a reservation for Friday at 6:30pm. When we arrived they gave us the smallest table for my family and I. This would've been fine if the place was already crowded or if we're only there for drinks. The female waitstaff informed us that all the other tables were reserved before us, however when I checked the seating arrangement chart they didn't have any reservations for those tables until 8! 

I have no clue how they expect a family to eat at such a small table. They seemed indifferent to my concerns. No apology, nothing. Very disappointed.
