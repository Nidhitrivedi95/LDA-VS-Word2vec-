yc_5xqXkGTRKlFzN7o2CQQ A lively, vibrant place with a mixed clientele. I immediately liked it when I walked in. (I sat downstairs.) Unfortunately, the food is unremarkable. My tomato soup tasted as though it had come out of a can. The beet salad with chèvre sounded promising, but the taste was elusive (and very small). And everything came very slowly. A disappointing experience, especially at the price.
