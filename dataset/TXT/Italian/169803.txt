mT28BMqq4HK-E6Bxr6o1PQ I love everything about Vicentina...

The Whole Roasted Porchetta

The Stainless Steel and Wooden Interior

The Simple and Straight Forward Menu
- Step One: pick the bun
- Step Two: pick the meat
- Step Three: pick the topping
- Step Four: Wait for your number be call!

CP 24 (Watch that while waiting for my quickie lunch date)

Hidden Gem: Off the Beat location only the locals knows

Quick Cheap Delicious Food

Bring Home Some if you want more! As It is also a Grocery, Meat, Prepared Food Store

Porchetta on Pancetta ($5.50)
- Surprising moist and flavoured, pork fat rules!

Grilled Steak on Panini ($5.25)
- Peppery and though cooked medium well is quite tender
- One of the better steak sandwich I had.. and I prefer this to the Porchetta

Free Toppings: Onion, Mushroom 

Super friendly Staffs

Lines during peak lunch hour but the wait is short

I will be back to Vicentina for a quickie lunch anytime!
