7jAkIb39KKKvbAo5dc6ZgA I was really excited to try San Lorenzo, because a great Italian restaurant in Lawrenceville would be very convenient for me.  While this restaurant was okay, it's far from great. Making reservations was tedious and when we got there the restaurant was half empty. By 7:30, all of the specials on the menu were sold out (which was confusing because the restaurant was half empty). Most of the food on the menu is super heavy.  There are only two fish dishes available the night we ate there and neither was particularly memorable.  I definitely wouldn't dine here again.
