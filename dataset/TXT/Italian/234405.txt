tR4VVIdzcJCQus4GUFq3IA When we arrived at this restaurant at 4:30 on a Wednesday afternoon we were greeted by Jennifer a transplant from New Yawk!!!! Jennifer was our introduction to an evening of delicious food along with her great service. She treated us like we had arrived into her own dining room! The way she described each dish had our mouths watering! The 6 of us chose different dishes along with 4 appetizers and we all shared a cannoli. We were told to stay at the table as long as we wanted. She was gracious and kind and even shook our hands and hugged us as we left! If we lived in Scottsdale we would come here often! You should too!
