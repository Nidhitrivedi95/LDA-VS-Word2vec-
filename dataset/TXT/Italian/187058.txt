oryS4vX0xkKC4tOekgowDQ You go for the themed resturant, after picking up my daughter from girl scout camp, I wanted to take her someplace she would enjoy, there is plenty to see here and my daughter enjoys spaghetti so it was a good combination.  I wouldn't recommend this place for the food, it's more about the fun you have with the teme.
