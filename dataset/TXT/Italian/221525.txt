SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg Dear Chef Serrano,

Congratulations and thank you for what you have contributed to Las Vegas and to countless of food lovers.

Your dishes continues to be true to form.  Based of time proven classic cuisine and delivered with flair.

On behalf of all those you have trained during the years I say than you as well.

My meal was spectacular.  The service was spectacular.  The view, pretty much speaks for itself.

My only regret is San Francisco loosing you to Las Vegas.

Still nice to know I can always come and visit and ALWAYS have a spectacular meal as long as you are at the helm.

Of all the superstar chefs of Las Vegas I know of no one more dedicated that is there in person night after night to let nothing less than perfection leave the kitchen.

BRAVO and again thank you for what you have given,

MFH
