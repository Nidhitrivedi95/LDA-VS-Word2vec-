ZKklfxHUlL8_xReUyZfSUQ Came here on a Sunday night. Randomly selected this place for a date night while we were walking on Bloor. We were definitely satisfied with the environment, atmosphere, service & food quality. I mean this spot hit every aspect we were looking for. 

We ordered the salumi board for the starter and we loved it. For the Mains we ordered the Rabbit & the Full Rack of Lamb. Both of these dishes were jaw dropping good even the mashed potatoes and veggies had a great taste. Once we ordered the food it did take a little while to come out, but definitely worth the wait as everything is made fresh to order. For dessert we ordered the creme brule and the sorbet & gelato. The dessert was amazing and I loved the smoothness of the creme brule and the creaminess of the sorbet and gelato. 

We will definitely be back. This place is a little pricey, but for a date night it was worth every penny.
