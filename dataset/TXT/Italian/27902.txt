4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ I must say very surprising!! Very nice atmosphere and the food was delicious!! Let me start by saying Alex was great at making recommendations and prompt in most cases !! 

The decor was very nice , small but perfect and the lighting was elegant!! 

I had the Carbonara sauce with Linguine and chicken and had a very nice smokey flavor !! My wife had pomodoro sauce with Spaghetti and it was also amazing !! 

Very good !!! We will be back !!
