9xdVIIzHp12Zrox5aFaaHA I have happily eaten here several times now but most recently was for a birthday. When we arrived, our reservation a) existed (which is sadly rarer than you would think & b) was sat immediately. Also a plus as it was quite busy. Thanks to the wood burning over the place smells legit. On top of the great service, and a pleasant pop-in on our meal from the owner, their beer vendor was in house giving away samples. Free samples. Pint size free samples. :D  Not too shabby! I recall having a crispy brussel sprouts, and the diavola pizza, which was nice and spicy. It would have rivaled for best birthday ever if they managed to squeeze in a chucky cheese size ball room but hey, nobodies perfect. 

Highly recommended!
