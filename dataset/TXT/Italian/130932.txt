iEEiRQjRct417O--f6QqZg my huband and i went in for dinner tonight and it was pretty slow. 2 guys were at the bar and just one other couple having dinner. I was initially shocked at how dirty everything was. lots of dirty tables and the floors were filthy. Service was not great. Needless to say I just wasnt empressed. The cooks were good though food was hot and yummy!
