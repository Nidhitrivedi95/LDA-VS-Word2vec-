FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q I wanted to try out oodle noodle next door but they had a wait and I was feeling impatient. I checked yelp to see if pasta mia would be good and I have to say yelp let me down big time. Not sure how people love this place or find it "amazing". The food and service are equally mediocre. 
It's also a really weird ambiance. The tables look fancy and the wait staff are all dressed like it's an upscale Italian restaurant but the food tastes like Olive Garden. Except it's more expensive than Olive Garden and you don't get unlimited salad and bread sticks. There was no music playing so all I could hear were customers next to us complaining about the food and the server yelling to the line cooks that she needed her orders for table whatever..
The calamari was tough and tasted like they never change the oil in the fryer. The chicken piccata was ok. Nothing to write home about. 
Overall it's pretty overpriced and the ambiance is terrible. The two stars are for the garlic bread and the server who was nice despite the negative feedback from customers.
