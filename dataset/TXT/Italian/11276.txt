0pWGYVBxkufNn8MDCcA7cA I came here with Christina R and another coworker to celebrate a belated birthday. The service we received was friendly and genuine & our food came out promptly as we were the only ones there! The three of us ordered the mussels, and I had the chicken, beet and goat cheese salad. I have to say, the salad was kind of blah. It was just boring! I think it was the chicken because it was served a bit on the cooler side without much flavour. The cheese was also crumbled up a touch too small for me as I prefer larger chunks. BUT that is my preference so I won't hinder their rating.

You may ask yourself why I'm giving them a 4 if I've started my review off somewhat sour? That's because they say the reader usually takes the last bit of knowledge and runs with it. So with that being said, the mussels were fantastic. The waitress said there's usually 12-15 mussels per bowl. I think ours had 20-25, to be honest. If you're into seafood and are craving some mussels, head to Alice Fazooli's on a Thursday and get their $7 special. I could have (and did...) drink the broth like soup. So. Good. 

I shall leave it there, my friends.
