WiU6fACNR6uUAC_6X5z-SQ What happened to this place????

First time was fab. Not this time.

Yak, tak. Yak. That's the sound the waitress makes to the hostess as my appetizer is sitting under a light getting luke warm.  

Then comes the pizza.  Crust can be described as follows:  flour, water, salt.  It reminds me of a bread that foreign prisoners might be served.  Sauce is a low end generic from Sysco.  And was that cheese on my pizza or melted white chewy stuff? 

My advice to the guests next door at the hotel is to cross the street and shop for a meal at the gas station.
