On the second floor we chose the charcuterie and cheese board, the beef pasta and the pork and pistachio pizza, all very good. We loved the option of a three ounce pour of wine, gave us the chance to pick multiple wines throughout dinner. The chocolate dessert was one of my favorites in pittsburgh, major kudos to the pasty chef on flavor and presentation. Our waitress was attentive, the atmosphere was nice also. Didn't make it to the meatball floor, it was buzzing with what seemed to be a more family oriented crowd. All and all, we had a wonderful date night, thanks y'all!
