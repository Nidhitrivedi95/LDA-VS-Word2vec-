Ya9FMj-MWMkeMcog06N5bQ Decent appetizers but the outside bar staff (especially the dude with the tattoo on his arm) is just, um, well, a dick.  Especially to other guys.  A guy walked up to the bar, asked for the drink list, and the bartender just laughed at him.  Another guy went to place his drink order and the bartender just looked at him and said he'd be with him in a second and turned around and walked away.  Total jackass.  The pretzel sticks are good and it's nice to sit outside but it would be great if they could find a bartender with a bit more of a pleasing personality.
