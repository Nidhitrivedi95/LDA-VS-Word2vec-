oX7lSVsg4j7-SrSZVGWVnA We love Babbo! In fact, this is the restaurant that we have designated as the tie-breaker restaurant. 
If we can't agree on where to go to dinner, we go to Babbo.
There is something for everyone in our picky family. We always end up with a variety from the menu. I LOVE the creamy pesto pasta and the kids always get pizza and eat all of it.
The bread they bring before the meal is worthy of mention as well. It's what hooked us in the first place. 
Definitely check it out. You won't be disappointed.
