tuYk6HQgY3eYliiOUgNFqg Great service and great food! My wife is sensitive to everything especially gluten. They're so transparent with ingredients and careful with handling gluten free items to ensure no cross contamination. A company who cares that much about their customers with needs deserves 5 stars! Thanks Sardella's and team.
