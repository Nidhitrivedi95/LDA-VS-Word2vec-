G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q We came here for dinner and managed to get a reservation for 10 pm in he evening on a Saturday in mid-October. I imagine that wouldn't happen during busier times of the year.

The service was admittedly meh. Who cares?

The food was scrumptious. All of it. The camponata and pea pesto - oh mmm! We were warned that pasta dishes are smaller than expected by our waiter ("tasting size") and then ordered too much food. The pasta portions were a good size - the fregolotto was the only really small portion. We couldn't finish our meats. The minestrone was wonderful and the risotto with scallops was also wonderful. 

The cocktail menu was available on iPad. It was more trouble than it was worth - please just give all the guests a regular menu.

Ambiance: beautiful. We had a seat at the window where we could watch the Bellagio fountains. It felt more cozy with the lamps and unique glassware - like a nicely prepared dinner at a friends' place.

If you watch Giada on Food network, some of her favorite dishes will appear here. She does make variations in some of the same things and they are just right. I was delighted!
