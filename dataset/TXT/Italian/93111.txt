Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag We came in because we had a bogo from myvegas. It was a Tuesday evening and we were the only people there. I was kind of hoping for pizza because they looked really good on the pictures i stalked on yelp. However, the bogo was for the meals. I ended up with the burratta raviolis and bf had the chicken piccatta. We really liked the attention to detail. At one point, our waiter came by and said he had the kitchen redo my bf chicken because it was overcooked. It seem a bit strange since the kitchen was not busy but i did like that our waiter didn't wait for us to complain about it. My raviolis were really good but I think the sauce could have been better. Our waiter did a great job recommending wine. I normally don't like merlot but he recommended one. Since I mentioned i dont usually drink merlot, he asked if i would like to try a couple. He gave me a blind taste of a few, and lo and behold, I liked the merlot best.
