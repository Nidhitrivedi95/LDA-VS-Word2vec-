zFnPRtP7LGvr3sfxvy_dfg Service is at a snail's pace. The fried pickles came out on time but we are waiting for burgers for a long time. The question is where is the food. Thank goodness they have good 70s music that kept me entertained for such a long wait. The pickles were pretty typical for fried pickles nothing to write home about.  And for that enormous long wait time the food came to the table under whelming. The bun was cold. My daughter had the chicken sandwich and didn't finish it. The bacon on the chicken sandwich was raw only the edges were cooked. This place was a total disappointment I will not be spending my money here again. I only wish the food was as good as the music.
