sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg BALLS! Hahahaha! The rooftop is the real gem!

I've been here several time while in town for convention center events and lunch dates with friends. I love the inventive menu and monthly meatball selection. They really break the mold with recipes. 
I think the craziest item I have had was in March, corned beef meatball and it was so delicious and different. 
I have been back on good weather nights to hit the roof top bar and it is a lovely view and kinda romantic sans hundreds of yinzers milling about!

Disappointments include Matzo Ball Soup and hit and miss poutine combos. 

The location is facing new and stiff taco competition right around the corner now! Be bold and keep us interested!
