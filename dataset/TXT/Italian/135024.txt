IT0IODInyhKbG4a_ka71MQ I have been going to Oreganos for 17 years and look forward to dinner when visiting Az.  I dined at this location tonight and felt that something was off with the food.  The penne pesto did not taste the same and the pizza was on the burnt side.  I have eaten at every location from Chandler to Flagstaff and NEVER had a bad experience, but this particular location missed the mark.  Almost turned me off to Oreganos entirely.

I think corporate management needs to investigate.
