LXheNwqZPoXuXNNeP1sNew Service is TERRIBLE!  We arrived around 6 pm.  They were not very busy yet.  Ordered everything at once.  Appetizers came out quickly but our pizza took almost an hour!  Our waiter was bartending as well.  Asked for our Fig, prosciutto & goat cheese pizza to have 1/2 with carmelized onions and even the server that brought it could not tell us what 1/2 had them.  Why??  Because there were none!  Waaaaay overpriced.  Never again.
