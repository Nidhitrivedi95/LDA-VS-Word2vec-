EIol8eFrS4WtRUhGbOUUgA Sorry to give a 3. We drove by not realizing you had moved.  Got excited as we loved the old place and the warm family atmosphere.  Hate to say you lost that loving feeling.  We only observed one waitress for all tables. Her warm customer service skills were lacking or she was stressed not getting help. We are served warm ice tea,  had to ask for ice,  our salad showed at the same time as the pizza.  The wait was long not offered anything while waiting.  Not that busy.  Pizza was 'eh'....I agree with other posts,  it lacked flavor. I use to love your pizza.  Our tablecloth was dirty and no one bused our dirty dishes. When you move to a bigger place and raise your prices,  as customers we now expect more from you.  A higher level of service. 
We want you to succeed. .... pls listen.
