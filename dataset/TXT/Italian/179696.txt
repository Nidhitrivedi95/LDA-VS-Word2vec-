nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Great meal here last night. Salads were top notch, bacon Mac n Cheese excellent, and each of our three entrees was superb (the lasagna was exceptional). Not a ton of cutting edge dishes here; just classic Italian fare done right! The dessert menu is inventive and excellent- the hot Nutella cake is a winner!
