LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g I deliberately have waited a couple of weeks hoping that I could say something nice about them!  I cannot. We had a Groupon and a friend had recommended them. When you go to a restaurant in a hotel on the strip in Las Vegas on Saturday night and there are maybe 20 people in a room that holds maybe 10 times that many, BEWARE! They definitely should NOT be a part of Groupon. First of all the absolute worst pasta fazioli that I have ever tried to eat! I so remember Minnie's at the Baron Café! Salad NOT chilled! Now comes he exciting part. Not everything on the menu is included in their Groupon so you have to ask about every item, What a hassle! I had veal parm and it was way below par! Ended a terrible mean with crème boulet that the custard was gritty and lumpy and decaf coffee that was made days before! Finally I received a check that included a $21.00 gratuity! Talk about nerve! One high light, the Bus Boy (40s) made things almost bearable otherwise bad food and terrible service!
