SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Food is ok. Portions ok. Cold creme brûlée. Who wants cold creme brûlée? I suppose it can be served either way, but I've never had it served cold. I actually gagged. I am a chef and would never serve it cold. It's my favorite dessert and they ruined it. Our waiter filled our drinks once and then I actually had to hunt him down to order my dessert. I asked him why he wasn't coming around and he got irritated (place was not busy at all). We asked for extra bread and he acted like we were moochy. I have had bad service here before, but out of desperation we gave it another chance and it is no shocker that it sucked. We will go hungry before giving them another chance. I called the manager (Chris) he did nothing, said they don't refund. Never again Trevi!
