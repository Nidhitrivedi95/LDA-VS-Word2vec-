U3O8l_wmzdeckbhHpuRWCg Not a huge fan of this chain but this particular location has a lot going for it! First, the service is always very good- they are extra friendly here. Second, we visit for lunch, and my Wife works at Chase bank nearby, so we are always sort of in a hurry. They are really cool about processing the check during the meal so we don't have to wait for it until we are finished. Clean, friendly, lots of parking, fast, friendly, good stuff!
