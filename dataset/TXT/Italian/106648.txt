FTVDICd-uxoEGYh4pU0pcw The place is supposed to open at 11am, so says their website. My 3 year old is a very picky eater and will only eat cheese pizza when out and about. I read online that they offer "pizza by the slice". Perfect! So I went out of my way, and we waited nearby for an hour for the place to open. We arrived at 11:20am. 

The place was still not open at 11:20am. I opened the door and chairs were scattered about and a guy was busily trying to get things ready. He told me, "late start, we will be open in another 15-20". 15-20 minutes with a hungry 3 year old 'ain't easy, especially after already waiting an hour. I decided to wait. 

We went for a little walk, and a few minutes later the NY pizza place sounded very NY. Two guys right out front (they both seemed to work there as one of 'em was the guy I talked to inside) were having some sort of heated discussion, throwing F bombs left and right in earshot of me and my three year old, in front of the place as they set up tables. We left. Not the place for a three year old. 

Needless to say, we didn't get to try the pizza. Probably never will.
