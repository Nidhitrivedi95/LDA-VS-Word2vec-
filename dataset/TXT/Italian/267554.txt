XdcRr8R5H8psvf-QxtuLMg Again my husband and I decided to go to Barro's for lunch. We ordered and dined in. This time I received my spaghetti promptly but we had to wait over 20 minutes for my husband's meatball sub. I was finished with my spaghetti and even had to check on his order. The manager really needs to address problems like this. The young girls working said oh, sorry. It should be out soon. That's it. I really like the spaghetti, pizza wings and sandwiches but their service is ridiculous.
