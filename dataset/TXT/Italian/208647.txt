QReGruZEFxovIm9FJVa1kw Eat here often, good price on speggetti and meatballs and house salad.  However, last time I had it, the meatballs had slipped in quality .. would prefer one that was high quality rather than two of average quality.  The salad remains good, and house dressing is good.  Portions large enough you take home for another meal (for many of the entree's).  Very family friendly, nice enough atmosphere, although the most recent time the booth was under repair and not comfortable. I would say it was better a year ago, but that's subjective. Hope it survives and thrives, as it is a nice family alternative Italian chain operations.  They tend to separate the families with kids from the others, they have two dining spaces.  That's good.  The salad wedge is wonderful, try that if you haven't. Not cheap, however.
