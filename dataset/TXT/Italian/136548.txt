j00iBr6uYnwgFs_J5y9f0w Shake my head, the service was awful.  I wasn't expecting an over the top greeting.  I was expecting the typical NY attitude,  "What can I get you today?".  Instead we heard, "What do you want?" with this miserable look on his face with the worst attitude. :[  I guess I shouldn't of assumed anything great for service.

I thought for the price of the pizza, the fact it's NY style pizza this would be a hit out of the ball park. WRONG!  I was very disappointed with the overall taste and consistency of the pizza sauce. It was BLAND, WATERY, and not what I expected since I lived in New England 22 years and never had a problem with screwing up pizza.  

  I ordered a Philly steak with prov and it was YOU GUESSED IT, WRONG.  It was was gross looking, never mind the taste.  The pizza had more flavor but not by much.  Overall very upset how much we spent, and the quality of food was piss poor.  

I know better than to butt heads with people that don't care about their job so I ate it and left pissed off and disappointed as usual.

I guess the next time I'm on the east coast I will remember to fill up on the Quahogs and NY STYLE PIZZA.
