jG1jcAeDw0pZTHCNC5kw_w I'm from San Francisco and I'm really picky about food. I'm used to great restaurants with great flavor and freshness. This is the best lasagna I've had since I can remember. The cheese noodles meat sauce everything was a +. Can't wait to take my hundred percent Italian father here when he comes out to Scottsdale. My friend's eggplant Parmesan was amazing and so tasty.
