kYZJ94hdzbhZIIXhIZU5Dw I will start by saying I liked the food and I will return again. My husband and I eat out a lot so this may become our regular place for dinner.

Strada is not pretentious and their staff are friendly.
The food was pretty yummy. 
We ordered Bread and Olive, Pizza Rita, Spaghetti All'amatriciana and Chocolate Semifreddo.
Bread and Olive was not your usual. The olives come warm. They were cooked/warmed with vinegared carrots and onions in olive oil based dressing. Not sure if everyone would enjoy this dish, but we both like olives so it worked well for us. I would order again.
The Pizza was not too thin or thick. Just thick enough if you need to pickup the last few bits with your hand. Good amount of sauce and cheese. The flavour was good.
Spaghetti was al dente. It was perfectly cooked. The sauce was very tasty.
Chocolate Semifreddo was an ice cream in a jar with a small fudge and a chocolate meringue. I liked it and would order it from time to time. But other reviewers seemed to enjoy it much more than I did.

I have one small negative comment.
I think it was one of the Rubino brothers that was there attending to the floor. It was nice to see the owners there, but it looked like he didn't care to be there.....
It was nice to see him clear our table, but he would drag the plates and would drop or almost drop the utensil from the plates. No apologies. His face was expressionless.
