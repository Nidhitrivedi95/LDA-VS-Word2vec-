LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Came with a big group of 20 and enjoyed lunch very much. Everyone liked it. 

They put bread on the table with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The bread was very good...crispy outside and soft center. 

I ordered the Lobster Carbonara. The pasta was cooked al dente, as it should be.  The sauce was creamy and tasty. It has pea pods instead of single peas, which I liked better anyway. There was plenty of big chunks of lobster throughout, and only a few pieces were the opposite salty, bitter side of the claw.  Too many restaraunt slip those pieces in instead of the sweet delicious side of the claw. Not this place....plenty of real sweet lobster. Yum!

A little pricey, but the portions are huge, atmosphere elegant, and wait staff superb. So worth it!
