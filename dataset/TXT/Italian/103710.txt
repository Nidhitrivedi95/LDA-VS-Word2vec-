FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Totally love this place. Visited it on a Friday after work with my parents, brother, and boyfriend. We were greeted warmly and quickly, put on the wait list and escorted to the outdoor patio which was busy. As we waited, my Mom, bro and myself shared a delicious and refreshing bottle of a white blend wine. I'm not a huge fan of whites but on a hot afternoon, it was fantastic. We weren't even finished with our first glasses and we were seated at a nice little table near the front windows. Although it was a little tight for 5 people, a bottle (and ice tub) of wine, and then tons of food to follow; our waitress made it comfortable and kept us all happy! It was great!

To start we shared the pub board and a plate of some of the delicious bruschetta; brie with apples and fig spread, warm artichoke spread, white bean and chopped tomato, and the fresh mozzarella,tomato and basil. The pretzels were mouth watering, buttery and salty. A Sierra Nevada mustard came along with and was just spicy enough. All of the bruschetta was delicious but the apple and fig, as well as the white bean and tomato both stood out. Different ideas and tasty unique flavors together. Great combinations!

For our main course, we shared some sandwiches; my brother and Mother had the Tuna, while my boyfriend and I had the prosciutto with brie. This also had the fig on it and I couldn't get enough of it! My Pops had the raspberry chicken salad, which was also delicious. 

We didn't have dessert but we did have a bottle of the wine on tap. It was a white (once again, not a huge drinker of white, so I'm not sure what kind) that was again, delicious. It was very crisp, had some bubble to it and wasn't too heavy on the honey flavor; what I deam my theory on white wines (they all taste a bit like honey).

Although I've never visited the original in Arcadia, I will definitely head back here in the future (especially because I work south of Camelback on Central!!! Thanks Postinos!
