xSIkiqB2tuiyJwFmPyNR5Q In the way of chains, it's actually not bad!  The house wine was ok, nothing special but pretty darn special considering this is a chain.  The bread and olive oil was my favorite part of the meal, well really the olive oil.  I honestly don't remember much about my entree except that it was salty, greasy food you would expect from a chain restaurant, but in a good way!  For the price, it was great.  We are not talking a knock your socks off meal but that's not what you came here for, is it?  Good option for a quick lunch before, after or in between shopping.  Decent kid options too.
