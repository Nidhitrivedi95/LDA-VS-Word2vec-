Orgm9nmcClxnAUva4nOKyA My fiancé and I decided to try this place on a whim. The restaurant is huge, and the decor is a little bit dated to my taste. However, the pasta was amazing. I had the Sicilian Gnocchi, and it was one of the best gnocchi dishes I've had! The price point is mid to higher range, but you do get a lot for the dinner portion.
