qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA Sorta disappointed after all the good reviews.  I'm hoping they only had an "off" night but the service seemed disorganized and slow.  In fact the tables being seating next to us noticed our discomfort and asked if they should leave or stay.  The food was decent so I recommended they stay, although I don't think it was anywhere worth the large bill.  Doubt I'll return next time I'm in Vegas.  

I will say that the hostess and waiter were very friendly, but it seemed they were short staffed or suffering from problems in the kitchen.  But they never explained or apologized, just acted like everything was okay.  A bit of honesty with their situation would have made me feel a lot more sympathetic.  Hopefully others have a better experience.
