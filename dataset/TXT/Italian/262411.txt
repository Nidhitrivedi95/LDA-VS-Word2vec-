wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg My favorite restaurant! The atmosphere is so cute. Fun fixtures and cool lighting. The food is superb every time. The staff are so friendly. I recommend making a reservation for a future date, especially if going on a weekend. My boyfriend and I love going here for special occasions; birthdays, anniversaries, and graduations. We are planning to go for another anniversary in March. Would recommend to EVERYONE! I'm sad that there are not more locations in San Diego (where I'm moving to soon). Keep it up and expand!!
