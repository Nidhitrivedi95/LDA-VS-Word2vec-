v9jNkOIBfP4aW2ru50Rn-A On a cold brisk day, my wife and I stopped into soup for a bowl of tomato soup. Within minutes, the soup was prepared. The bartender was a brassy brunette with an eye for review....
We talked about the queen and even had some local pizza pie...

Oh what a time...
This soup is no ordinary soup...
It's caramelized in a metropolitan flavor perfect for a night to remember.
I don't often review a spot for their soup... But this place Zoup is page out of a fast television show like friends....
