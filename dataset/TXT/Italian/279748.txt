Literally, a bus or two will come through every evening as far as I can tell. (I am a 36 year resident of Las Vegas.)

2. First, the food. Olive Garden is at least two levels better in quality. My wife and I believe the sauce is simply canned, nothing more or less. The lasagna, again, normal. Any degree of spice or uniquity is simply altogether missing. Strangely enough, the garlic bread was good and so was the expresso - small victories for a higher, mid-level priced dinner.

3. I think the 'never-ending' free wine basically makes many customers happy in lieu of good food. It's normal.

4. The wait was was long - 30 minutes, because of the tour bus. The bar drink we had while waiting was experience.

5. With all due respect, the accordion player with the disability, was playing off of peoples emotions. He would play a few seconds literally, say the same thing to most of the tables in the room - most of it was geared towards how beautiful the female was, everyone would give him money,and then 30 minutes later, the same routine, and same peddling for money. It's not right. We felt pressured to do as the other tables did and give him a few bucks each time.

6. Of all the Italian places to eat in Las Vegas, I would never suggest this place to eat. Fast-food or sit-down are all superior to this. 

7. As I read in another review, it is true that the decor is somewhat interesting with vintage Las Vegas pictures. But does this overcome the shortcomings? No. I am torn between 1 and 2 stars.
