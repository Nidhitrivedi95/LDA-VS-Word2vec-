hmfAdo6LuVOvBLiu75C8ZA Wow! I was blown away with the food from here. The bread (cheat day) was so soft and fresh! I had the beat salad which was phenomenal! The pistachios were a joyful addition. The main course was the lobster ravioli and they were extremely generous with the portions and lobster. Great views and good service!
