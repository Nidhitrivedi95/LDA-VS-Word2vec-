pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Was in vegas (woohoo) and went here for dinner with my bffs fam. With a reservation it was about an hour wait... :/ but we were finally able to sit down and eat! I ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo. It was good. no complaints I just enjoy the sauce to be a little thicker.
