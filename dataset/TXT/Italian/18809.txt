2QBD8wYCrwgOGRfHKvS23w I'm giving this place 4 stars Because I know the man who owns it is very proud of his business and when he is there the place has a light atmosphere and everyone is happy and the food is excellent. I have gone 3 times when he wasn't there and there is a woman there that is in charge that is very miserable with herself. She doesn't smile she has an attitude and I have witnessed her screaming at the staff. The WHOLE staff is very nice except for her. Someone took my order tonight and I guess there was a slight miscommunication and they gave me a grilled cutlet instead of a fried cutlet.. this lady brought it to us and instead of appologizing and telling the cook to make it again she made some noise with her mouth and stomped away and then started screaming at the people in the back. This made me feel very sorry for them. It ruined my meal because the whole atmosphere was very tense after that. The poor workers were tiptoeing around. Then the lady in back of us tried to ask her a question and she pursed her lips and shakes her head...whomever this person is she needs to find another job because she is going to kill this man's business. I would also like to add that she was sweeping and kicking up dust while we were trying to eat and I find that very rude. It was nowhere near closing time. It was about 9pm.
