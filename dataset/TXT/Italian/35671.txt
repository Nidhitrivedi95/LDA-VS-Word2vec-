I'm staying at the Fairfield Mariott for a business trip, and I ordered delivery. I completely goofed and accidentally gave Johnny's the wrong room number and wrong name (I forgot my room was booked under my associate's name). They tried to deliver my food and were unsuccessful. When I realized what had happened I called the restaurant to try and retrieve my meal.  Johnny's said they'd have to charge me for both dinners if they came back out for a second delivery, and I declined.  Shortly after the manager called my room and said he understood things happen, and he'd deliver my exact order no charge! He even personally delivered my meal and would not accept a tip. Oh, and threw in some free soup :D
