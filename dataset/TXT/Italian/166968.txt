MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg Plantone's is good- but I would recommend for lunch or a casual night dinner spot. We live across the street and decided to try it out. Apparently it was the grand opening night so there was a DJ and lots of Italian balloons so we went on a good night. I was hoping that it was a sit-down Italian spot because it was a Friday night and I wanted to relax after a long week. However, Plantone's is more of a quick-order deli where you place your order at the counter, take a number and grab a seat. We had to sit at a bar top because it was so busy- good sign of what was to come, but like I said-I wanted a more relaxing atmosphere!

Another pet peeve is that the wine is served in plain glasses. I know that serving wine in water glasses is the authentic Italian way, but when I spend $8 on a glass on wine- I prefer it to be in a nicer glass. We ordered the eggplant parm sandwich and a Quattro formaggio pizza. Both were tasty- especially the pizza. Thin crust and fresh out of the oven. I could tell that the pizza was made with the freshest ingredients. I also enjoyed the sandwich, but my only suggestion would be to toast the bread-it needed a little crunch.

Overall this place is A-Ok for lunch or if I am looking for a casual week night for some quick and yummy food. Looked like they had a nice outdoor area that I can see myself enjoying during the summer months. 

We met the manager/owner and he was great. I hope this place does well!
