If you're unsure of what to order, you can't go wrong with a bruschetta board. You get to pick four different types for one board. Get are great for sharing and you can't beat the price. Their raspberry chicken salad is incredible. It has a lot of flavor and isn't drove in mayonnaise. There are a number of sandwiches and salads that you can mix and match during lunchtime. 

If you're looking for a beer or glass of wine, you can get one for only $5 before 5 p.m.  It's a great spot to meet friends and they have a nice outdoor patio that is great most of the year. Just remember it can get a bit noisy.
