wkZ6P5fDw0G_iFRU-hzBhQ I've been twice. First time was so packed it was a 20 minute wait with no where to wait... The second time was much better. Got a table within 10 minutes and served by one of the funniest servers I have ever met. The BBQ Chicken Pizza is quite amazing. I would recommend trying it out. Their selection of beer is also impressive. The bartenders are a bit slow though. But overall, I will be visiting each month.
