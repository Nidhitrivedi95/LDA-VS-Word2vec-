tKi4OvAlckcVzeP92InsOQ I have been to the Recline and Dine about three times now for movies.  I must say, most comfortable place to see a move EVER.  The 2nd time my husband and I went, we watched a movie all by ourselves, it was like a private screening, I hope business picks up so they stay in business, great concept.  This last time there were some glitches in service, we got our tickets, ordered a pizza, a large popcorn and an ICEE.  When we went and sat down, husband looked at popcorn and said, that can't be a large, so I took it back out to lobby and the manager stated it was indeed a medium and had them give me a large popcorn.  Movie started and the pizza never showed up, had to leave the movie and go down the pizza which was sitting at the takeout window, getting cold.  Apparently someone popped head in but never attempted to find us, we were in the correct seats.  That is nice about this place, you get to pick your seats.  Anyway, we watched our movie and as it ended, the manager came in and announced the movie experience was not up to their standards and so he was going to give everyone a free $10.00 gift card to make it up to us.  We had to ask him what was wrong with the movie, cause  we didn't even notice an issue with the "quality" of the movie, just problems with food orders.  Manager stated there was a black border line at the top of the screen that should not have been there and some fluctuations in lighting...either way, we will be back and will continue to enjoy putting our feet up for first run movie.  We haven't tried the bowling experience yet, but prices seem reasonable with a package deal for bowling, pizza and shoe rental all included for less that $70 for 4 people, I believe.  In regards to food, I tried one of the salads, which was delicious and people with me have ordered the pizza and said they are good, so give them a try!
