j_PL_u4SWW1LoEd2dCu0Iw I've been to Bambini's about 6 or 7 times now and here are my observations.  The Italian food is great, in particular the Chicken Parm heroes and the Stromboli.  The garlic knots are to die for. The pizza is good but not the best in town, but still miles ahead of 99% of the other local joints.  The service staff is very friendly, but they get overwhelmed from time to time, thus I've waited for food longer than I should have once in a while.  I would never bother to order oddball items like the rotisserie chicken or Greek salad.  Why in the world would anyone go there to order stuff you can get anywhere else?  Go there and enjoy the awesome atmosphere and the great Italian food.
