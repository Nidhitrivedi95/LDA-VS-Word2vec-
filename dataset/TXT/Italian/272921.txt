XxXJat55Oep1BMzQ9yJJhQ I'm trying to convince my sister to move to Toronto.  Every time she comes for a visit, I take her on a whirlwind tour of my favourite places to try convince her to sublet some student's dump of a bedroom for July & August.  She loves Negroni and Neil (our favourite waiter) may have sealed the (moving) deal with her last week.

The good:
- I love panini.  I usually get the porcetta with BBQ sauce and add the slow roasted onions (note: this sandwich should just COME with onions. Any onions.)
- I sampled some of Beth's prosciutto sandwich last time and it was also delicious
- Negroni introduced me to a vegetable called fennel;  wow, do I ever love fennel
- It's very reasonable - it was $40 for 2 of us with tax and tip (only 1 alcoholic drink)
- Top notch staff
- GREAT music that the cooks get to pick

The bad:
- There could be more beers available
- The aforementioned lack of onions on the porcetta (they are happy to add some though)
- It's always less busy than I want it to be and the sound carries and echoes when it's empty

Would I ever eat here again?
Yes.  I will take my sister here once a week when she moves to town.  We will sample every panini they have to offer and she will stay in Toronto for forever because she won't be able to live without Negroni panini.
