38-sjGYYVcQEKrZe5Nu47A Came here for St. Pattys day 2014. Had a burger which wasn't great. Tasted like fish. Meat was frozen, not fresh for sure. Also, ordered the burger without some toppings which we still on the burger when it had arrived. The service wasn't on top of their guests and took forever to get anything that we needed.
