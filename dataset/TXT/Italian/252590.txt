VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w After seeing a dead guy in front of Tao, we were a lil fucked up and got all bad vibes, freaked out, and headed back to our room at Palazzo. Came across Lavo; were able to bypass the line and went inside... 

Its nice, for a small club, its big on decor. The mosaic mirrored pieces everywhere and the catwalk with the faucets is pretty cool. 

Super crowded. Not enough beautiful people, that's for sure. 

And I know I am probably in the minority for this: But I HATE what everyone is mixing these days, progressive house? Untz Untz, BOOM! 
I hate it I think it really sucks. No one can dance well to it, the go go chicks look a lil strange trying to rock to it. 

Really pissed me off in fact. 

To almost every other review that complains about drink prices in a club in Vegas- you probably shouldn't be at a club in Vegas. Moronic complaint. 

Not impressed, maybe would go back if it happened to be easy and convenient.
