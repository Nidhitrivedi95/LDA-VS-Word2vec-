uuaH1UNcqcV-alT6nh42WA Well the delivery was very fast. The delivery  man was about 15 minutes early. He was very nice and professional. However I had asked 2 slices of pizza to be plain cheese with the rest of the pizza to have the 2 toppings and they did not get that right I am afraid. Overall, the pizza did not taste great so I will not use their services in the future.
