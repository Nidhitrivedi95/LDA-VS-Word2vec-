7PRse3yCQbEprAj1DWrEQQ I must confess, this review does not take into account any food quality/taste, ambiance, or service criteria. But based on the conversation I just had with their hostess, I don't care how good it is, I will never eat here. After an attitude-filled greeting, she informed me that my preferred date (admittely, a popular date, but I was a month early, there was hope) was booked and there was "like, no way " they could seat a group of my size (5) until 9:30pm. We had older people in our group, so I asked if I could be put on a waiting list and I got  "Siiiiiiigh. I guess. I mean, if you want. But we never have people cancel. We're very popular, you know, and very small." 

Wow. Well, forget it then. Snotty hostesses are very pre-recession. If you don't want my money, or at least make me feel like I should want to spend money with you, I don't want to give it to you. Really, hostesses at restaurants that book a YEAR in advance (like Volt or Le Bernadin) have never been that rude to me. I'm very disappointed, Dish. I heard good things...
