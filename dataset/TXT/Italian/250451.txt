VnS3kmAmRyHeN9_lMPBp0g Dropping this review another 1/2 star if I could. Service was slow and incomplete. Waitress doesn't bother to ask you which of their sauce to go on you pasta nor which kind of 4 crusts for your pizza. I guess she will bring you what she wants. Last time tried their Sicilian square pizza. For my taste it is way over the top. I am downgrading this place one star from my former review (4 stars) due to this. This pizza was way overloaded with toppings and the crust was not even close to the tasty thin pizza they have. Don't get me wrong. We have liked the other meals we have had and are big fans of the thin pizzas. Beware though, if you order sausage on your pizza it is an italian sausage sliced in to slices and they put a lot on there. 

I am just disappointed that there was such a great disparity between their pizzas and they don't seem to know it. FYI - I am a big fan of a good Sicilian pizza - Check out my review of La Tavola.
