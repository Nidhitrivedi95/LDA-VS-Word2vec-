gjATEWAllTfxfxhGqJ93sQ I've had lots of wood-oven pizza which is always good but this is above-average.  I don't think it was so much the wood oven as it was the sauce that was outstanding.

Having been spoiled by all the great Italian food in St. Louis I wasn't sure what to expect as we found this on the fly while exploring Montreal.  The super-busy atmosphere and super-efficient and friendly service tipped me off that we made a good choice, the food confirmed it.  Had the Margherita pizza and it was outstanding.  Also had a glass of the house red and it was very good.  Ordered the A La Griglin pizza as Vegan (no cheese, gluten-free crust) and it was very good.  

Well worth a visit if you are in the Downtown area of Montreal.
