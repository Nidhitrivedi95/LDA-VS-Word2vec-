kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg Shame on me for not reading the reviews before we spent over 100.00 for the two of us.  Our server should look for another line of work, we sat and got water and bread rather quickly and he introduced himself (Nick) and said he would be back in two minutes, 10 minutes later he finally returned.   Not attentive at all, wine glasses remained empty for several minutes and water was never refilled.  We ordered the Artisan cheese tray 19.00 with three small slices of cheese, water crackers and four slices of bread drizzled with olive oil, some meats and extras, the description sounded nice but presentation was poor and quality not that great.  Chopped house salad with grilled chicken, the chicken was like chewing leather.  The atmosphere is very nice and wine was good but that's it, we will not be back.
