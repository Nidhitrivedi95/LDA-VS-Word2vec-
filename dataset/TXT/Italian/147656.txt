kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ We had a wonderful lunch at Central Bistro.  Shelby was our server and she was very attentive and helpful.  As a gluten-free diner, you never know if you're going to end up with just a plate of greens, but Central Bistro has gluten-free pasta available upon request.  Husband and I split the Kale Mixed Salad and the Garden Pasta and both were delicious.  The Kale salad definitely rivals True Food's Tuscan Kale salad -- very tasty.  Portions are very generous - we were glad we split the items.  This is a great addition to the neighborhood and they've thought of small details like the filtered water with your choice of orange, lemon or lime...decor is modern but warm and comfortable.  We'll definitely be back to try the weekend brunch as well.
