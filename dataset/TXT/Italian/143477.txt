JsUprRhyzQyukZmAhcOg0A I joined my mom, sister and grandma here for a ladies lunch. The inside is beautiful and the patio looked cute. One thing I really like about Brio is they do brunch Saturday and Sunday all the way till 3:00. (Some of us are not earlier risers on the weekend and like to do our brunching later in the  day.)
Although, on this trip I was feeling more lunch so I had one of their lunch platters which came with lasagna and your choice of salad. I had the chopped salad which was very fresh and yummy. The lasagna may not be authentic but you could tell it was made with real ingredients, not thawed and cooked like at the OG. 

The other ladies at the table tried the risotto which received several mmms and ahhhs. They have two different kinds of risotto scallop and shrimp or the chicken with sweet potato. I tried both and they were fantastic. My grandma had a gin martini and she is VERY particular about her cocktails and she said it was made perfectly to her specifications. 

I would come back here for brunch or lunch but I do think the dinner prices were really high. Go in the daytime because you get dinner sized portions but at reduced lunch prices.
