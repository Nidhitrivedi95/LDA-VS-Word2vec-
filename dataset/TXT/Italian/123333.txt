hlrZHM4D48XiQtXh6cRg_w Food is average. I ordered their classic spaghetti and meatballs with meat sauce. Spaghetti texture is good. Meat sauce taste like something I can cook easily. Meatball is too spicy for my taste. Service is poor. Booked supper for 9:00pm, we arrived on time and waited for 15 minutes before we get seated. The restaurant was half empty, I am not sure why we have to wait so long. Service was very rush. Server never greeted us. We ask for water, it came after the complimentary bread is serve. The water never got refilled until we asked. We order before the table next to us, and they got service way ahead before we do. Good came very slow. Has to ask for parmesan cheese twice for our pasta. Server keeps on changing and none of them stay more than 5 seconds at the table expect during initial ordering and billing. May come back here for their atmosphere, maybe for their food, but definitely not their service again.
