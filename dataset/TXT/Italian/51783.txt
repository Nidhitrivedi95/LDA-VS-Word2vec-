9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg Maybe we hit them at a bad time, but I was unimpressed.  The server for our section actually only came to our table once, and they weren't that busy.  The poor girl who seated us had to take our order and bring our check and another guy dropped off our pizza. Odd.  Pizza had a limp crust and all of the toppings literally slid off the slice when you picked it up.  So weird.  Not to mention the fact that this place looks like it popped out of a 1990 time machine. Think of the restaurant that the kids from Saved By The Bell used to hang out in.  That's this place!
