hAPlM1MJzCqiCfHbQFXXJQ Unfortunately this location is a hot mess. 2hrs plus wait for your delivery order and an incredibly impossible manager who will never contact you to follow up on any complaints (It's been a year. Lol)... but judging from the other reviews, it's clear that his/her call back list is their entire delivery area, so he/she might be very busy. Disappointing from a chain that use to be one of the best.
Food quality is hit or miss, on slower nights it's good but incredibly oily & salty... on a busy weekend the food quality is subpar at best.
