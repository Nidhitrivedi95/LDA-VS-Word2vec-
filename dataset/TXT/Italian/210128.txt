qvQ-i1HgSloSJLkGnXsfhw We have ordered here from work twice now.Neither time was I impressed at all. The pizza barely tasted a step above little caesars and was on the pricey side. The outside window for togo orders is convenient and nice for running to pick up but the food left a lot to be desired. I really wanted to be a big fan but just do not see any quality in the food we ordered.
