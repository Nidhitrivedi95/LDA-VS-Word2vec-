dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA We ordered two pizzas both were burnt and "Robert" decided to make new ones without telling us. He tried to recreate them and was leaving out toppings we had already paid for. We then noticed something was wrong and decided to get up and make sure they were putting the toppings we had paid for. The second pizzas were made in a hurry and looked like they just threw everything on there. 

In the end, we walk out with 2 burnt pizzas and a poor experience. I went back in to ask for "Robert's" name and he gave it to me while laughing and made a few comments as I walked out. Who knows if that was even his name.
