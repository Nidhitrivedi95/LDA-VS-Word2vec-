ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw Just ordered a cheese pizza, extra cheese. It took over an hour for them to get it to me, and when it arrived it had NO cheese on it! Seriously, you just delivered me an expensive dried out cracker with dried out sauce on it. There are 20 pizza joints in this neighborhood, congrats on being the one that can't manage to freaking make a cheese pizza.
