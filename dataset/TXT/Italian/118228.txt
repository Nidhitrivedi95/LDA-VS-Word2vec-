gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw My sister and I ended our 5 day Las Vegas vacation here for lunch. We were seated "outside" and had a view of the neighboring Italian restaurant. The waitress threw us some prewrapped bread and when we opened it, it was burnt. Not just a little overdone, BURNT. I couldn't help but look at the people sitting at the other restaurant eating their soft bread and watch their waiter pour olive oil and balsamic on a plate. Not here, folks...plain and burnt. 
Salad was OK. The Parmesan was great on it, but otherwise, so-so. My sister got a pizza, and I got pasta....again, so-so. 
The worst part was the service. Our server was more concerned with the table of men behind us that she completely forgot about us. After she finally gave us the check, we waited about 25 minutes before she ever came back, and trust me, the restaurant was not crowded yet. This was early lunchtime. I was very disappointed and personally, wouldn't go back there. It was a little pricey for lunch, too. Not that I mind spending money on a good meal, but this was not so much.
