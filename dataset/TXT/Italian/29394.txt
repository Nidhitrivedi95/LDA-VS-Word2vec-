5CqM8dr3d3LI_B-1_-5U7A I can't say enough about how amazing this restaurant was. The service was impeccable, the food was to die for. I ordered the cap these salad and steak special which was cooked medium to perfection. The wine was delicious and the waitress was so friendly and helpful as was the manager who came to check on us as well. It was so good I'm seriously debating about eating there tonight again!
