LUd3UdlUvCr54H-7ttm0TQ I went there a few times and was never dissapointed. Food is always on point, tasty and fresh. The menu os changing according to local harvests which is a plus. They (almost) only serve made out of local products. In terms of service, nothing to complain about either. Don't be afraid to try out anything that's suggested. I'll definitely come back!
