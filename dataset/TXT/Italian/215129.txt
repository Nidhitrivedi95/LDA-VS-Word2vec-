RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ Service isn't great at all. We got here at 6 (with no one at the bar) we had a party of 7 people. Spend about $400 we were ignored most the night. Took 10 mins to get water. both Nate and Little blonde bartender are VERY rude. I still tipped 20% which was probably a bad idea they def didn't deserve it. Manager isn't special either. Bad attitudes for a restaurant that wasn't even busy. Quit hitting on girls who don't pay for there drinks. Won't be back.
