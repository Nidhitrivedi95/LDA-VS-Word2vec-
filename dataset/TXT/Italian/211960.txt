r1RZJ5JQeEfCBc_MbHJ8AA I've been here several times for lunch and dinner - I've even tried it for takeout. The service is good but the crowd is so lively that you can barely hear yourself talk. The food is delicious, with my favourites being: the margarita pizza, the kale salad with extra goat's cheese and the Nutella fritters. Even their iced coffees are yummy. Disappointments: they don't make any substitutions and their bellini cockatil is tiny.
