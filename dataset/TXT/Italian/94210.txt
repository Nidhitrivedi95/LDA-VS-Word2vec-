ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Ocotillo is freaking amazing! The food, the environment, and the service are all superb! 

We shared a steak with grits and the skillet pancake that was on the brunch menu.

The steak was juicy and had a ton of flavor! The grits were so yummy that I could eat large bowls of just the grits!

The skillet pancake was huge and came out on a cast iron with good flavor and syrup that went perfect with it! I didn't use too much syrup though, just a little bit. 

If you want a good place to eat, definitely check out Ocotillo! It is not a cheap restaurant, but i am sure you will enjoy it!
