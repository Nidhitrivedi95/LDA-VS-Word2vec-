qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg The food here was good but the portion sizes aren't very filling. I loved the black tea & the lentil soup. The Greek salad was good but the chicken & veggie skewers were lacking in the flavor department. 

My biggest complaint is that although our server was very nice, she wasn't there very often. Also, the server that brought us our food gave us the wrong food & then continued to ask several tables if the food was theirs, until she finally got the right table. 

I'd give this place another try because overall the food was good & the prices weren't bad at all. Hopefully, the service will be more consistent next time.
