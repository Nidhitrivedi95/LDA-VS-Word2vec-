POJL-N7Smw1UZMP_xldFwg What a surprising discovery thanks to yelp.

It's about 10 min. drive from my house and I never knew it was there.  Both the pizza and the pasta carbonara that we had were delicious and different.  It was tasty and better than our regular restaurant - abruzzo  (which also has good pasta in richmond hill).

Generous portions that left us very full and satisfied.

It's a small, quaint place and you can tell the chef/owner's take pride in their service and food.  Definitely going back and this is saying a lot as we have a lot of good italian restaurants in the region.

In comparison, I've been repeatedly disappointed in Il fornello in region.

Only catch is that it's a small restaurant so if you have a large party; it's unlikely that they will be able to accomodate you.
