WX8cx6tfFcEn0cK4cIbWag Tried during their initial opening. Staff great service good but we were oversold in food. The upsale was fast and furious. Normally I don't complain about cost but for what we ordered very over priced. Food just average. Nothing spectacular. I did enjoy the octopus appetizer though. Won't go back.
