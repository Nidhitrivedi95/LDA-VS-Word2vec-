VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w I think of this more as a Nightclub rather than an Italian restaurant, hmm.  Anyways, this is a semi-small nightclub.  No huge majestic staircase, no huge long winding corridors, just a simple layout with the bar, couches/ lounge chairs surrounding it, and a dance floor down a few steps.  Positives: you won't lose your friends in here!!

With regards to the open-bar drinks, I believe the best we could come up with was when we requested the bartender to make us something "fruity & strong".  I don't know what was in it, but it suited its name.  Also good here: pineapple + vodka, redbull + vodka, yes a lot of vodka... 

The restroom attendant was very nice.  Made small talk, she was friendly, handed us a towel after we finished washing our hands, and recognized us as the night went on!  Well-maintained restroom that is VERY CLEAN!!!!  Sometimes hard to come by.

All the bartenders were nice, attentive, and NOT RUDE.  :)
