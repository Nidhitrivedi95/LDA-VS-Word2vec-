Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ Damn fine New York style pizza. Sauce was fresh and tangy. The toppings (pepperoni, sliced bacon and mushrooms) was wonderful... The meats and veggies obviously fresh. 

The house salad and the garlic Mascarpone dressing was unique and yummy (good for pizza bone dipping too)... But needs more veggies like tomatoes and carrots and less veggies like raw onions.  

Considering how much it all cost tho, you best be prepared to pay!
