aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA In love with Oreganos. Like...in love. 

Here's a little tip though...figure out what kind of pizza you want BEFORE you arrive so that you can order it when you sit down. Their pizzas can take anywhere from 25-40 minutes to cook, so you don't want to be starving yourself, smelling all the Oreganos goodness, feeling tortured with every table that gets their delicious smelling pizza before you. 

Trust me.

Also, save room for pizookie. It's a skillet baked cookie that's just every so slightly underdone so that it's soft and gooey...and then they top it with ice cream. Can you say heaven in a skillet?? Try a half macadamia nut and half chocolate chip so you get the best of both worlds.
