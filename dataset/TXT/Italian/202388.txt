q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Amazing! Great service and food! Definitely try the meatballs, its to die for. Love the atmosphere, really makes you feel like you're in the prohibition era.
The outside is completely different than what it looks like inside. So glad we decided to try a restaurant outside the strip!
