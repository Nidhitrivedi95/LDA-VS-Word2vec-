h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ So I ended up here last night because Don Michaels was closed. The restaurant is nicely decorated. The menu had a good variety. I assumed that the entrées came with soup or salad. We were a party of 3 and each ordered a regular pasta dish with chicken added and 2 soft drinks and water, our bill was $77! The food was ok but not like wow that's good stuff. It's overpriced considering all you get is white bread with your meal. I'm still in shock about the cost, service was decent. Our waiter apparently serviced the entire restaurant by himself. 

This was a first and last time I will dine here, there's other establishments much better with better prices
