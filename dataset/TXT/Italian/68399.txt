BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Good food and service but incredibly loud after the recent renovation in July.  Too many hard surfaces and a high ceiling. I could barely hear my friend 3ft away from me and my ears were literally ringing when I left.   
Too bad. They have everything thing else going for them.
