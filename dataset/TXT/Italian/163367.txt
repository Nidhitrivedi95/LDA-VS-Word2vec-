lwpQQflP1CGJPV7QLybzOg Have frequented this place several times and felt it was time to give a review. 

 I have noticed the last few visits that my pizza is burned black around the crust and/or doughy and limp in the middle so inconsistent baking here folks!  Ordered a calzone last night and it was bland, no garlic AT ALL and the dough was limp and the filling all kept falling out - not a true calzone!  

My biggest gripe about this place is the revamped pick-up and take-out process. You have to walk into the bar, jump up and down to get noticed to let them know you are there to get your order, be made to feel like you are interrupting the staff be being there, play cat and mouse trying to stay out of the way of everyone while you are backed up to a wall next to the bar waiting for an ungracious server to bring you your meal.  Then you play a balancing act trying to hold the bill and pen in hand to sign the receipt which you can't see because you are in a dark corner. I've decided not to return after the rude manner in which I was treated by the staff last night and I know they get a large part of biz from take-out.  Better re-think this part of the process there, I'm sure other patrons do not return for the same reasons.  Go back to bringing take-out the the front hostess stand on the restaurant side of the place like you used to and make even your PAYING take-out customers feel appreciated!
