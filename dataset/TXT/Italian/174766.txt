ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw Tried a new dish during annual visit and had two perfect Bellini's, but the new dish wasn't top notch. This was the eggplant parmesan, but it was not a breaded version as the bartender had insisted. It was more like pieces of mushy eggplant with perhaps a bit of bread crumbs on top? and that was smothered in a red sauce which contained a boat full of basil. I was picking basil strips out of the food for the entire session. The bed of angel hair pasta and the garlic bread though were both good. Skip the eggplant, but it did taste better after those Bellini's.
