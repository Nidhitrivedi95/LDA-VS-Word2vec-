d1_Ko1DQ4QyB9BjnCFjVLw Service has always been great, don't care for the dry bread but it's the horrible water that stands out as trying to get the customer to order a "drink". Out of the four of us at dinner we all agreed the water tasted like chlorine water from someone's pool. The server said it's "filtered". NOT a chance! We asked him if we could get the water from bartender. He replied "it's the same". He kept pushing ordering a $4 sparkling water or cocktail etc. We all agreed no thanks. I went up to the bar later and asked for a glass of water. What do you know? It was fine and definitely filtered. Food is alright but when the water tastes better at even In and Out or any other restaurant you know they aren't paying attention to detail. Plenty of other great Italian restaurants on Bell Rd.
