We made reservations on a Wednesday night, arrived early and were still able to get seated relatively easily around 7pm.  It get more crowded as the night progresses.

Casa Di Amore has a number of classic Italian dishes.  We got the Mini Oso Bucco ($14), Calamari ($14), Gypsy Pasta ($26), Chicken Marsala ($27) and the Gnocchi Alla Prosciutto ($23).  All portions were quite generous, and in fact I could have eaten the Mini Oso Bucco as a main.  We had freshly baked house bread that came with garlic butter plus oil and vinegar.  

The Oso Bucco was very tender and the risotto it came on was excellent. I definitely would recommend this dish!  I liked the Calamari but it was borderline too crunchy.  Probably the "worst" dish was the Gypsy pasta.  If you're used to Thai food, it's not that spicy - has a nice kick, but I didn't find it that special and probably wouldn't order that again.  Overall, a fun place to take friends from out of town.
