3cqB5VOEBP52C9wbC8P-UA Went to Maialino for dinner last night with 2 of my girlfriends.  I made a reservation for 6:30pm - but being as it was a Tuesday evening, it wasn't that busy there and I probably could have just walked in without a reservation and been seated.  A few other tables around us filled up during the time we were seated (mostly couples).

The server was friendly and knowledgeable about wine and recommended a great choice for us.  

We were brought some aged proscuitto and bread sticks (complimentary) as well as some fresh bread and more bread sticks.

We had the rice cones as well as the asparagus and mozzarella starter.  Both were quite good.

2 of us ordered the short ribs for our mains and my other friend ordered a special seafood dish (I can't remember exactly what it was called) but everyone enjoyed the food.  For dessert, 2 of us declined and one of my friends ordered the cannoli.
We could see the sous chef (or might have just been another kitchen staff member) prepared the cannoli - there were 2.  When they saw it was for our table for 3 ladies, the chef made sure to add a third one (even though 2 of us hadn't ordered the dessert) and he brought them to our table himself.  It was a nice touch.

We were there for almost 3 hours and it was nice we didn't feel rushed to leave (although there was no wait for tables - so not sure if we may have been encouraged to leave had it been busier).
