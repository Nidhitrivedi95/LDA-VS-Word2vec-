2A1wvIFdKQZZe-vtTO7olQ We have had multiple parties here and the staff has always been right on and perfect. The food is always fantastic and their attention to detail is impeccable. The food never looks or tastes rushed and has a fresh taste. The Calamari is better than most you will find in Cleveland's "upscale" restaurants and I was very impressed with the Eggplant Parm. 

I think my X and I especially like this place because we can take the kids to dinner with us at a reasonable cost and still feel like adults. The decor is very nice and clean with a separate room for the Bar area. I noticed they added an outdoor patio and i cant wait to try it out. 

This place is a hit. I couldn't think of one negative so i had to give it 5 stars. The only thing that could possibly make this place better is if it was free, but at their prices, it might as well be!
