I have never had something there I do not like. The flavors & presentation of the food are perfect. The wine list is one of the best I've ever seen. Anytime I get the chance to go I consider myself lucky to have such an amazing experience. Such an amazing & unique place that the Scottsdale Quarter is lucky to have!
