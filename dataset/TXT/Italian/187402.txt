Os1NdWfFCpz9FWa4gDOLRw This place was a surprise for me. My sister and her boyfriend really like this place but it looked like your average chain. The surprise was in the quality of everything. The two Pizzas we had, the traditional supreme and the chicken potato, were both really good in their classic thin crust style. Also surprising was the guac...perfectly seasoned. And the service was top notch. The wife also loved their wine selection. I opted for the cookie pizza instead...also good choice. Overall I really enjoyed the place.
