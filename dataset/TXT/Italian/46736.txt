- beef short ribs
- NZ lamb chops
- Pesca piccata
- Sicilian roasted cauliflower

The beef short ribs were good, and the marsala sauce was a nice compliment.  The garlic mashed potatoes were flavored well, with the level of garlic and salt being just right.  The dish should have come with some type of nutritious green vegetable, though.

The lamb chops with melted Gorganzola were excellent.  Again, though, for the price, there should have been a choice of side dish.

The pesca piccata was a disaster.  It was clearly a pre-battered, frozen fish fillet, and the roasted brussel sprouts were severely undercooked, making only the outer leaves edible without risking severe gastric distress. The other vegetable side dish was OK.

The Sicilian roasted cauliflower was very tasty, but there was a bit too much cheese for my liking, leaving the dish over-salted and my mouth dry.  When I got home, I chugged some V-8 for the counteracting potassium, and my palette returned to neutral.
