FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA According to my friend, this place when it opened used to be nice and perfect to chill. 

Well my visit didn't have any of that. The place was packed by 8pm on a Tuesday. Lines outside, and people staring at your table in case you "feel ready to go". 

Aside from this hectic picture, the food is simple in terms of elaboration, bruschettas and paninis (in ciabatta or focaccia). I had the Autostrada half with salad. Enough for dinner and good mix of flavors. 

By the end we also tried the crème brûlée wich was ok. I had a fresh squeezed Mimosa and my friend one of their wines. The funny point, are those little double purpose cards they have on the table where the sugar/sweeteners are. You can glue your chewing gum or flirt with any other costumer.

Service is great, but better arrive early!
