3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg Took the wife for her birthday.  I have been here before  and it was fantastic. This time we tried the fried deviled eggs. All you tasted was the oil from the deep fryer and the dipping sauce was lacking of taste.  The hash browns were rectangle, deep fried that tasted like they got them from a fast food drive thru,  the cream cheese was mixed with sour cream  as a dipping sauce rather than being mixed in with the hash Brown before cooking. Once again fryer oil tasting. The sauté spinach had a very strange taste to it, that I only took 2 bites and left the rest to be thrown out.  I happen to love spinach. The mushroom medley also had a strange taste.  My steak and ahi tuna were very good though.  My wife's filet minion was very dry. Can definitely say I won't be returning.
