nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere special to celebrate our anniversary. We spent a good hour narrowing down Italian food restaurants based on reviews and the menu, and we were very disappointed with our experience at Buddy V's. When you walk in the atmosphere is very welcoming, dimly lit, guy playing the piano, and nice decor. That's where the nice experience ends. Once we sat down, our waiter tried to hard sell us on this wine that was clearly the wine the restaurant wanted the waiters to sell that night. We had to tell him "not interested" at least 3 times. I don't expect to get hassled and given the "hard sell" by our server at a really nice restaurant. The food we received tasted like it had been frozen and reheated. Definitely did not taste fresh. We started out with the Meatball appetizer. The meatballs had no "crispiness" to the outside. The sauce was thin and had no flavor.  My boyfriend got the Lasagna (which was supposed to be their signature dish), and I got the Pasta alla Vodka (normally very yummy if done right). The sauce with the Lasagna was runny and had no flavor. He even commented that the Lasagna I made at home tasted better than what he got at Buddy V's. As for my Pasta alla Vodka, the sauce was runny and had no flavor, the chicken was tough, and the pasta wasn't cooked enough. I went to an Italian food restaurant in Shenzhen China that had better Pasta alla Vodka. To top it off, the menu prices were $25+, which is kind of what you expect from Vegas, but I expect top quality food at that price, and especially from a celebrity chef. Do not eat here.
