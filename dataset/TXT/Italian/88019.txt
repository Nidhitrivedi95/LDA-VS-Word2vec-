DwTfWV4QzjF69DRllB_SVg I stumbled into this quaint little restaurant out of pure hunger desperation.  I was famished and my blood sugar was dangerously low (you don't want to meet that gal).  I approached the counter and looked around.  I was greeted by an influx of home-style aromas and next a pleasant employee.  He asked me what I would like, and I told him "I'm in a major hurry, I'm absolutely starving." Within five minutes, he had made me an Italian sub that puts all others to shame.  Since then, my family and I have been devoted regulars.  The food is consistently fresh and delicious, and the service is impeccable.  They have a good wine and beer selection also.  Their canolis (pastry shell filled with ricotta cheese and whipped cream topped with chocolate chips and powder sugar)  are the best I've ever tasted- in fact, I ve never been able to find one as good as Carmine's anywhere else.  
All-in-all, I just love this restaurant.  It's reasonably priced, has fantastic food, and just makes you feel good eating there.
