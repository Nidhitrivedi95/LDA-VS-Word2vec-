tpesKzKbcPFekdThYZ4UpA This review is based entirely on ambiance! But I'm a fan, and would love to go back for an entire meal!

After dinner at Utopia we were looking for a good dessert spot and stumbled across BI - they had a lovely dessert menu that was reasonably priced. There was tiramisu, chocolate tort, some sort of lemon tart dessert and a good selection of tea to accompany. They also had biscotti for $2, it wasn't too hard, and just the right amount of sweetness (chocolate & almond). 

It's a really neat spot - cool decor, big comfy round booths, WICKED light fixtures, it was just right for a hot beverage and a sweet.

Heads up - the hot chocolate isn't sweetened, they offer sugar with it, but it didn't receive a favourable review from my girlfriend.
