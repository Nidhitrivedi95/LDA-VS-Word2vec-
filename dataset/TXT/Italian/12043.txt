0URIvKxCNT-AVgtdYFAX8w Got lunch to go from here and it was excellent. The Pollo Alla Parmigiana was the best I've had in Arizona and I'm wishing we ordered more of the Garlic Cheesy Bread because I swear it's almost like it has crack in it because it's so addicting. Very polite staff and they even gave us a complementary drink because it was so hot outside. This place is great
