NhMEvtG8TA6AnCLFC63v_A Yummy dishes. I had the chicken parm and the hubby had sausage and peppers, way good. I especially liked the breadsticks they bring, coated in butter and parmesan cheese. Great decor too, warm and not pretentious. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars, we weren't offered a refill on our bread.
