ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw This was my first visit here. We decided to try it because I've heard good things about their pizza, which definitely did not disappoint. Great outdoor atmosphere. 

We ordered a large pizza and had to wait what seemed like an hour or more for our pizza. In the meantime, people arrived, were served and left. The manager finally came out and explained to us that there had been a mishap in the kitchen and they were working on our pizza now. I'm still not sure what happened but they offered to bring us a free appetizer and to comp our pizza. We politely said no thanks to the extra food, but a manager still brought us a sausage sandwich that they had an "extra" of. Though its not something we would have ordered on our own, we still appreciated the gesture.

I just wanted to say that though we ended up spending an extra hour at lunch waiting for our food, the service was great. We appreciated that they took full responsibility for the problem. The pizza was great and well worth the wait.  I recommend!
