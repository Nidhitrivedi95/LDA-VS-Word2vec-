YJS7cXGLAvWw9DUDXpw84Q We have been to this Italian eatery quite a few times. We ate in a booth for 2 people in the bar area because one of us wanted happy hour drinks & food. Happy Hour is from 4-6pm in the bar area or patio. A martini is $6. and a 8" pizza is $6.
Bread with balsamic & vinegar is served to every table and was very fresh tasting.
The special on Mondays & Tuesdays is spaghetti & meatballs for $5.99. Our server Rafael was excellent, just the right amount of checking back with us and was on top of his game.
I did see a "guy" who looked like a manager in a blue shirt(younger guy) there were 2 managers  in blue shirts. The younger guy seemed to be on his phone behind the bar and at the register area too often. Wasn't really bothering me,but if there is a problem with something in the restaurant I am not sure how he would handle it, as he was not really paying attention to his surroundings at work. I should never see an employee on their personal phone while I am dining.
Parking is in the lot by Fry's grocery store, can get busy at times in the parking lot, Arby's seems to have too many signs reserving parking.
