3prYLfbO9h30ozqdUCZ_6A This was a very disappointing dining experience. We ordered 3 family portions of 3 different dishes. We had to send back the fettuccine because the noodles were so over cooked. The spaghetti and meatballs were very bland. The only dish we liked was the chicken dish. 
When we wanted the fettuccine boxed up to go, the waitress said she was going to have us do it because they were having issues with hair getting into the food when they boxed it up in the kitchen. She went on and on about it. Completely ruined our meal. All 7 of us left saying that Buca used to be good, but this would be our last dining experience there.
