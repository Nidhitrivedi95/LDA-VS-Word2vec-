3v8vcGGeJRZXTGxpeyq0gA Pizza Pronto has an extremely misleading name. I am giving a good review but it's not due to the pizza, which I think is honestly sub par. I like the Gyros, but I have seen them underpreform as well. What pizza pronto does extremely well is any thick pasta dish. If it involves cheese, sause and pasta, the chances are that pizza pronto does it exceedingly well. Their "Classic Meat Lasanga" was fanatastic but sadly they stopped making it. Give it a try, it's not very expensive.
