-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw My review is for the Happy Hour.  We were lucky enough to score a table as we got to Brio at exactly 4pm, had we waited 15 minutes and we would have been out of luck.

I'm usually skepticl when it comes to HH menus but this place is amazing.  The food was $3 or $4 bucks a plate and the drinks around $5 depending on what you got. 

The selection was fantastic and even better was the service.  There was 6 in our party and we ordered quite heavily on both the food and drink menus.  Our server was on top of it.  He was pleasant and friendly and really added to the experience.

The food was out-friggin-standing.  We got the pepperoni/sausage flatbread and it was defnitely a favorite amongst everyone.

The deep fried raviolis were top notch too.  We got the lettuce wrap cups and sliders.  

We also did dessert, I did the marscapone cheesecake and it was amazing.  

I am now confident I will return many, many times.
