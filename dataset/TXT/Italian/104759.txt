fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ This is the actual location where my boyfriend worked as a server years ago. We also celebrated our first Valentines' day with dinner at this chain. As such, it has a special place in our hearts.

Service is always stellar- Charles in particular stands out.
The house wine (and rockin' honor system policy) and bread are both higher quality than other chain's standbys, but their smaller menu allows them to shine instead of spreading themselves too thin.

We always get the stuffed mushroom appetizer.
Favorite entrees include the chicken under a brick, Carmela's chicken, and the shrimp portofino. For lunch visits, the bibb and bleu salad is my usual, and I'm really bummed that the italian wedding soup is now a special instead of a menu staple. Favorite dessert is the lemon passion.

The service, food, and ambiance of this restaurant and the high standards of the chain make it one of the few places we choose to dine that isn't local.
