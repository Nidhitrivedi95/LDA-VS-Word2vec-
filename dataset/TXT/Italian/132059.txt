Ijdoi6pDMK3Burw3TtAOZg Not that great overall service and place to eat, pizza was alright while hot...i also enjoy a cold slice of pizza just as much a hot slice. Next morning was like biting into shoe sole. 

ordered a order of garlic knots, what i got was deep fried dough with no garlic flavor or parmessan cheese.  When have they started deep frying garlic bread? i prefer oven baked cover with garlic and parmessan cheese all over.

Not sure if I'll go back, i would say no but never say never.
