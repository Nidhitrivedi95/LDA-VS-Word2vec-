MrmwDgMlL2GtthlAZsJwNQ I went to this restaurant for the first time as part of a Yelp event on Monday night.
The manager explained to us that they are considering revamping the somewhat staid Alice Fazoolis brand and this is their dry run; if all goes well with this locations then they will convert all the existing restaurants to the new, classy Italian style eatery. The decor is nice and warm, if a bit dark. They have a lovely patio which is decorated with flowers and is isolated from the parking lot, making it a peaceful haven. The inside was very loud though, by the end of the 2 hours I had a headache from trying to make myself heard. I feel like they could use some sound-deadening, all the hardwood doesn't help. The service certainly was enthusiastic and quick. It seems the bruschetta didn't make its way to us but we sampled the pizza, meatball sliders and the cheese with fig jam all of which were very tasty. The food is fresh and well-made.  Their blood orange Bellini was ok, I think I prefer the ones at Milestones. I would recommend this place because of the quality of the food, but be warned the noise level isn't really conducive to conversation.
