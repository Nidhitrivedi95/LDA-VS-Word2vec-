T1J9PQXqfeG_skaaDV6O0Q Stopped here tonight for the first time.  Very good food at a great price.  10 meals on Sunday for under $10 with a Soup or Salad plus bread.  Restaurant was able half full and there was a very large party in the banquet room as well.  Service was very much on point and food was very good.  I couldn't stop enjoying the food and my wife decided to bring half of hers home.  No room for dessert.  Décor is a little outdated but the place is very clean.  Owner stopped to see if we enjoyed our 1st visit and told him he will be seeing us again soon.
