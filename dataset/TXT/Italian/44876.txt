8dSIAoz_UphMGpZr_uMing Went in the first week and ordered a cal zone. The dough was not cooked all the way and the beer taps were inop. I have stayed away from this place until my cousing ordered delivery. Thin crust pizza and extra crispy well done wings! Holy ass I dont think ive ever had better wings ANYWHERE else. The thin crust was the best i ever tried. Whether it was the cheese, sauce, or maybe even the hint of oregano but i could be wrong. The combination of the two had me sprung as soon as my teeth sunk in. Afraid of the deep dish since my first experience with thick layers of dough had me almost never coming back. The thin crust and well done wings will has me hooked though.
