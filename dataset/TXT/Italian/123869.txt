HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q Excellent espresso, quick service, and an excellent assortment of gelato (although I did not take a taste).  The line gets ridiculous after eight a.m. but around 6 I was able to get in line and be waited on within a few minutes.  You can have your drinks for there or to go.  I ordered a double esprsso and it was piping hot with lots of crema.  It was perfect.  Anxiously awaiting the chance to go back and sample some gelato.
