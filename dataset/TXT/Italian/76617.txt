cVlW0omVTRaVJqnT-OBBsQ Be careful what you wish for or you just might get it. When I saw the construction for Piola in the front of my building, I hoped it would be good. Unfortunately, it is. The ease of good pizza steps away is definitely not good for the wallet or the waistline. 

Their pizzas are great and in the price range you'd find at most TO pizzerias and they have a good selection. 

The test of a good pizza is always the margherita, and unfortunately this one isn't that great. A recent order left me with an overcheesed, undersauced, flavourless pie. Luckily, they do have a fantastic burrata pizza. Lots of buttery burrata cheese, with delicious tomato sauce and plenty of fresh basil. I'd recommend spending the few extra dollars for this pizza.
