xJ94FRxbFwkmpi1hjuWlaw Revised Review Below: 

I have eaten at Rocky's before, both in the store and home-delivered. I think they're a bit pricey, but when I want a pizza I am willing to pay a bit more for something good. This past Friday evening I ordered from them to have it delivered. An arrival time of 30 minutes was predicted in my confirmation email. The order was late and cold. 

Disappointed.

Updated and Revised Review

This is the kind of review I much prefer writing. Paul reached out to me and I called his store. He wasn't in, but they forwarded the fact that I'd responded to him and he called me from home. I understand this is his personal business and it was quite clear - he is very passionate about both his product and his relationship with the community. He offered me a free large Rocky's Reitano on my next order, noting from my customer history that that seems to be our favorite. (It is!)  He also pointed out to me that I have savings waiting for me for a free dessert with an order because of my birthday that had just passed, and I still have a half-off reward - a tribute to my recent anniversary.

I'm so glad to see such wonderful customer service and the personal touch that makes Huntersville all that we want it to be. 

Appreciatively,
A grateful patron
