Cr5CLpmVrmzFyz_RfQ6rmA The food was delicious and had good size portions. I enjoyed the stuffed meatballs and spaghetti. Full of flavor.  I would have liked a small side of bread or salad with the meal however the portion was large enough to fill me with out ordering any extras.   I did splurge on a take desert to go and was very glad I did. The chocolate jar cake was a great way to end the night.  I was also impressed with the the service.  I sat at the bar as I wanted to see the game on TV and the staff balanced a good mix if talking and acting entertaining while also not talking too much. They made good suggestions and the staff acted like a team to make sure I had all the food and drink I needed. The music was a little loud and the TV's should have had closed captioning in the bar area so those who wanted to see the game could read more details.  I asked the bar tender to help with closed captioning and he said he would ask the manager however this man was too busy trying to go home and talk with other staff so he could not be bothered.  It was overall strange the place was so empty.  I was the only one at the bar for almost an hour.  The tables were moderately filled but clearly the place was not doing great business for a Thursday night.  The food could not be the issue, as it was delicious.  Looks like it would be a great place for groups
