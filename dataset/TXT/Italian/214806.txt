rlDuAQgXTnVcdFXeEiE53A I love Antonios take out, but going into the restaurant to eat is less than impressive. Service is scattered and so, so at best. Took my daughter in law there for her birthday on Sunday afternoon,the place was empty. Appetizers came out fairly quickly, were good. Pizza came out within 20-25 mins afterward. 30 minutes after the pizzas came out, were still waiting for our dinner orders. Really?  So you bring out half of the tables food, then send the rest of the food 30 minutes later? Finally, we get our dinner orders and guess what, they are luke warm ! Yeah, that was worth the wait!  I dunno about you, but I like my spaghetti and meatballs hot. We had a $100 check and we were there 2 hours trying to get our food. With all the other restaurants opening in the area, I would think they would want to keep their customer base.  This isn't the first time the service was bad, but I can assure you it will be the last. There are too many other places I can spend my money.
