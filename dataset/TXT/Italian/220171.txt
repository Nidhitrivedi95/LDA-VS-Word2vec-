SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Consistency is a rare commodity, and Herbs & Rye steakhouse endures the old school steakhouse and bar. 
The minimal interior (velvet wallpaper is my favorite) and masculine atmosphere is old school Vegas.  This town needs to be back in The Rat Pack days;) 
Emily easily achieves to strike a chord with the customers at Herbs & Rye!  She has the ability to mix and serve a cocktail, all the while exuding a rare charm. 
Their menu will please any carnivore's cravings  with outstanding cuts.
This is nestled away from the Strip and by all means if one is visiting the Strip- please do make a point of coming into this gem.
