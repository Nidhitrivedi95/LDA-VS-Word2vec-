g9iIBuh-g4ld3w3kUWLMqw I like the pizza here, granted they were closing at 10p on a Thur night and were only serving slices.  I thought the pizza went well after a few drinks around downtown.  I ordered a slice of mushroom and managed to finish that and order another slice before the kitchen officially closed.  I ordered another mushroom, this time you can tell they kinda half assed it by making a cheese pizza and putting mushrooms on top of it after it was cooked.  Either way, after a good buzz I couldn't tell the difference.  I wouldn't mind trying this place again sober!
