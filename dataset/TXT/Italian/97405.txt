eTmy0-h4tTEpfbDVAue0MA I've had the Mamma's Calzone and a couple different pizzas at least 10 times. The pizzas are great! But the Calzone is absolutely AMAZING! I have never had such great food.

The service has always been decent. But in fact, the service could even be terrible and I would still probably give it 5 stars since the food is so amazing!

My kids like the spaghetti, but I've never tried it. (How can you mess up spaghetti anyway?). I've only tried the vegetarian pizza, spinach pizza and the Mamma's calazone... So I'm not sure how the rest of the food is, but the dishes above are absolutely incredible.

Oh, good price too!
