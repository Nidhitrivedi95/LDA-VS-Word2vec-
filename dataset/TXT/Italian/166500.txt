MDoI5wE1eCLEZUNL-IVerg When I can't make my own, I order in from them. We are used to good pizza. We moved here from NYC, and have lived in Chicago and New Haven CT. The pizza here is as good as you'd get in any of those places, and the sides (like wings and salad) have been good every time we've ordered. I haven't eaten in the restaurant yet, but I have picked up the pies on my way home, and the place seems nice enough.

We've tried a few other places here in the valley, and were disappointed in some way by each of them. If you want a good pie, you can't go wrong here.
