Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg Best restaurant in Las Vegas!!! Whole menu is unreal. The antipasto is the best I've ever had. They have tons of different deserts and they are all wonderful. Staff is all Italian and very nice. 
  If you are looking for a spot off the strip this is for you. It's only about a mile off the strip and centrally located on spring mountain.
