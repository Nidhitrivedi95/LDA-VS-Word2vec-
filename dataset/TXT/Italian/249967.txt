vkOvleiw5wTqGGi_-aTZ_w I went there with my dad at 11 pm since it was the only restaurant that was still opened. When we first went in, one of the waiters gave us that bitchy look and the receptionist seated us. Our waiter Martine had one of these nastiest attitude and I honestly don't understand why shes still a waiter. The service was so horrible that it made me want to go see her and ask what was wrong with her. I ordered the 10inch sub and it was 15$! It tasted blend and it was definitely not worth the price. My dad ordered the sandwich and it came with fries and coslaw. The fried were not crunchy at all and it tasted like it was microwaved. The coslaw had a strong vinegar taste and it ruined the whole salad. I was hungry and wanted to leave quickly and when I had a mouthful of their tasteless sub, Martine came and took my plate without asking me if I had finished. She didnt even refill our water once! When we were done, I had to get up and ask for the bill because she stayed at the cash register like if she was contemplating life. We asked for the bill and it came off 40$ with the tip! It was definitely not worth the money and it was a huge disappointment. I would never ever go back again at this restaurant even if someone paid me to go.
