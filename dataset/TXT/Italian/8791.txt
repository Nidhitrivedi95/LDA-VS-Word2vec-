0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ Great Italian place! 
Lived in Italy for 2yrS and  brick oven authentic pizza is hard to find. Love this place because you can build almost any type of pizza your cravin.  Single serve pizzas. Perfect size. We usually get the chopped salad too. Everything is made right in front of you, pizza subway. 
Kids love and and we do too. A must if you want a place everyone can enjoy. 
They also give military discount!!! 
Thanks for great food and service
