DZfFFSVFVJVxs3vfFVVf0w Ambience: Old school, nothing fancy but not dirty either. New York memorabilia covers the walls in this small, 64 person occupancy dining room. A tv in the corner invariably shows ESPN.

Service: Very New York. Even the accents. These guys are short, to the point, yet very helpful. They lack that west coast bubbliness that is typical of AZ servers, but they are no less attentive.

Food: One of my top 3 pizza places in the valley, I can't talk it up enough. Crust is thin and perfectly chewy, toppings are good quality and very flavorful. Wings are crispy on the outside, and they have excellent buffalo sauce.

Price: A bit steep for pizza, they have a deal for a large pizza and a dozen wings for 24.95 that is pretty reasonable. Be prepared to pay about $30.00 for two.

I've been to this location at least 5 times and I plan to visit even more in the future. Don't confuse this Rays with others, it is truly unique.
