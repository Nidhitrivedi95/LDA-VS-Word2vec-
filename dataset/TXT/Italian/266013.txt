x-ZnHkRIhpGwZ_7VwiKlRg Amazing.  Started a new job on the East side last week and made a point of stopping here on my way home (West side) after work.  Last time I was here was 4 years ago when I lived on the East side and we ate at Crostatas often. Then and now ranks as one of my top 4 favorite pizza restaurants in CLE.  It was just as good as I remembered.  Had the Quatro Formaggio and tried the Aroncini.   Both were excellent.  The Aroncini was much better than others I've tried elsewhere.  They've added to their menu and my next visit I'll definitely try the homemade cavetelli or ravioli.  You can add meatballs or sausage.  I can't say enough great things about Crostata's.  Get there, you will not be disappointed!
