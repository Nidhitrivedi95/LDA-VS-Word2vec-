OBG1j517k7aZRNC1HAL0TA came here because the lineup at Joey's was way too long that we didn't have the patience to wait 50 mins!

The location is kind of hidden that I didn't even know this restaurant was there.

I appreciated being seated right away - however the service wasn't great.

I guess they hadn't anticipated the rush and were understaffed but the customer suffered in return.

We ordered the lamb bacon pizza, risotto and veggie pasta.

The bacon pizza was slamming, definitely the reason this review gets 3 stars. the pasta wasn't great, it was really oily and the artichokes were really soggy. 

What I didn't like was that we had to ask for everything, from water refills to fresh ground pepper and cheese.

We weren't the only people unhappy the table beside us cancelled their order and left. I was starving and didn't want to wait!
