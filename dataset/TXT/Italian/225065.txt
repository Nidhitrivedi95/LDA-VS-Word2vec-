SN6mvy2vbXL0F_CYFkx8zg Very traditional italian food. The flavors were just right and not overpowering like Casa di Amore. Also the restaurant only had a few other patrons inside which made it a very comfortable atmosphere. They were flexible with the menu items, probably because it wasn;t packed.

The service was also excellent. They were extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and wines.

I recommend the osso bucco. There was a generous portion of meat around the bone and was very tender. We had it served with gnocchi which was extremely tender as well...not chewy like I've had before. I ordered the risotto which had other seafood besides the lobster. as stated in the menu We had the lobster bisque and beef carpaccio for appetizers topped off with a bottle of Penfolds shiraz.

We are defintely coming back again and again and bringing friends.
