C2HKdN-Ft1JJY2xDj-3gxw We arrived at about 7.15pm and were seated quite quickly. Soon there were lines behind us. Must be decent we thought. If you have never been here, pizza is ordered using the menu, but other food like veal parmigianna, desserts, salads were ordered at the counters. Neither the hostess nor the waitress told us this which is bad training, and we had to ask  - loose half a point.

There were 2 of us and we ordered a small (Personal Size) Romana pizza, substituting the mushrooms with sun dried tomatoes. 

After that we waited literally 30mins, but nothing arrived. No one bothered to check on us which I found ridiculous - loose a point

We asked a waitress and she checked - staff forgot our pizza and it would take 5 mins. No apologies, nothing - loose a point.

THe pizza arrived with nice, fragrant, and delicious. We also had the Carnoli and gelato for dessert, and they were very well done. THe flavour of the chocolate and hazelnuts came through and it was not too sweet. -gold star!

When the bill came, we found that we were charged for the substitution of the mushrooms - how come no one told us about this? Sigh....loose another point.

So yeah - the food is good, but the staff need a little more help. Go if you want good food, but be prepared assert yourself because the staff really werent too helpful the evening I went.
