TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag For some reason, lunch this afternoon felt like quite a rush - or more like, service felt like it was rushed and that isn't exactly a compliment. I'm usually a big fan of Buca Di Beppo - foodwise, count me in - but when the overall dining experience isn't up to par with what is expected, I am forced to lower down the rating a notch. 

My parents and I came here a late Mother's Day lunch and ordered a small chicken carbonara, small calamari as well as the garlic pepper broccoli. Our waiter had great sales talk about items on the menu, however, at some point, he started to feel a little pushy. When we weren't even done with our dishes, he came up and asked if we wanted a box for our carbonara of if we wanted it taken away already, when there were still some calamari left on the plate, he took it away without asking...and my parents and I were left staring at each other in uncomfortable silence as he walked away. 

Other than that, the food was awesome. Carbonara filled us up to the brim, we didn't have room for dessert although that tiramisu sample our waiter showed us looked prettttyyyyy tasty. I also highly appreciate the photo service with complimentary postcards per table - with optional bigger photos for about $5 if I remember well. Music was really chill and the atmosphere didn't feel as intimate as the Paradise branch. So that's a 3/5, nothing more, nothing less.
