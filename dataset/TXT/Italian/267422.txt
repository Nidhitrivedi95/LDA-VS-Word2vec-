XD0LjNuPPwJPsTAHecUh7A I had read mixed reviews about Terroni before booking a table here. Most said good food but poor service. We booked a table for New Years Eve and had a very positive experience overall. We ordered fried calamari (the best we've had so far in Toronto), caprese and carpaccio for starters - all very delicious. We were also very happy with our main course selections - pizza, pasta, and steak. There was nothing wrong with the service whatsoever. Overall, very tasty food, great service, good ambiance. Would definitely recommend.
