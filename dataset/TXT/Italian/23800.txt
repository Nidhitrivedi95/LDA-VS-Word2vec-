My boyfriend and I come here about once a week and sit up at the bar. Our bartender Johnny already has our drink prepared before we sit down. Yes, we are regulars... And so are many other customers who come here. Johnny is the most amazing bartender and best customer service there is. Thank you uncle sals and Johnny for making our dining experience feel like home every time.
