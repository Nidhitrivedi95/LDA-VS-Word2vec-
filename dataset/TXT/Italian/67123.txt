bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg If you have time to kill, want to spend $$$, and don't care about lousy service, then go. The food is good.

But I have no patience for rude service.

I asked for no cheese on my pasta, then got an attitude when they brought it out with cheese. They took it away for 3 minutes and brought the same bowl back with the cheese picked off (except for the pieces they missed).

Besides that, the slow, 'tude-y service adds this restaurant to our no go list. Too bad.  Like I said, the food is good.
