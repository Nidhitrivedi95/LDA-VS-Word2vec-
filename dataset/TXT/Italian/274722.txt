y769FA7VJOW4QQYdYlR62A Came here again and found out I can mix and match the pasta and sauce!  We ordered the Carbonara sauce with Rigatoni pasta, much better combination!  The pasta was less packed, the portion was just right with the sauce ratio.  We also had the Affumicato Pizza, it came with lots of smoked bacon and mushroom, we prefer this over the Soppressata Pizza we had last time because it was loaded with more tasty ingredients.  For dessert this time we ordered White Chocolate Tiramisu, it was light and creamy.  They also sell glass bottled Coke there, a nice touch.  Overall another satisfying meal.
