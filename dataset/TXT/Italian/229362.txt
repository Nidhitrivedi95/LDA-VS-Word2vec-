t59EjJ_flqR75Mk2RWILAg I thought from some of the reviews this place would be horrible. We went here because we had a coupon and were very pleased!. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The raVioli and fettuccini Alfredo were exCellent. The only coMplaint I would have it's that they do not serve a pizza for one person, only 14 inch and bigger. We definitely willv come back when we ate in the mood for Italian. Also the atmosphere and lighting had a great romantic feel. It would be a great place for a date Night.
