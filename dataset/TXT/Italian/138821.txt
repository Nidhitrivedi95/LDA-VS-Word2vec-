jcasci3gjbsSuTEVzvDQKg Very disappointed as I've heard wonderful things about Mama Ricottas. We ordered the lasagna and carbonara to go. The sauce was broken and flavorless in the carbonara. Plus the portion size was tiny. The lasagna was over cooked and made it extremely chewy. I'm only giving two stars because the staff was friendly and polite. Sorry to say I won't be back and still in search of a good Italian restaurant in the area.
