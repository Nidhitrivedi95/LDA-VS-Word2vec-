3xXU6QBovnxeLSOkrRQI8A I have eaten at Nicola several times and I love the food. Very authentic Italian Pasta, sauces, bread, pizza, and the best cheese-steak hoagies I have ever had!  Very good meatballs and sausage, too. Absolutely delicious. The owner and chef are very warm friendly people. They make me and my family feel at home in their restaurant. About once a week we get take out and it's worth it. Reasonable prices for generous portions.  Reminds me of my Italian Grandmother's food. I love it. Highly recommended.
