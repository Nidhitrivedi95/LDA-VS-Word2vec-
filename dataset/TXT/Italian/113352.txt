Gh-qmVwvibLnNdqEZXcQHw Nope. Nope. Just, nope.

I wanted to like this place. The menu looked good (even though it is waaaaayyyy too big). Our server was pleasant enough and made wine suggestions. And they put cucumber in the water, which is awesome because I love cucumber in my water. So this is where the two stars came from.

The food, however, is terrible. We started with the Eggplant Cappicola. It came out 22 minutes after we ordered it and I was flummoxed as to what I was supposed to do with these things. They really didn't have any flavor at all and my husband said his portion was cold in the middle. I ate about two bites of mine. 

I ordered the Shrimp Giouvetsi on Fillo. When the waiter set this mess in front of me, I was a little appalled. The fillo dough was a soggy mess on the bottom and the edges were ridiculously thick. The shrimp/tomato/artichoke concoction in the center of it tasted weird. Too much rosemary. Like, tree branches of rosemary. It was not OK.

My husband ordered the Chicken Astoria. I tried a couple of the baby corns and the sauce wasn't bad but, like mine, the presentation was awful. Now, don't get me wrong, if food tastes good, you could bring it to me in any presentation and I wouldn't scoff but none of this tasted GOOD. Some of it was OK but none of it was GOOD. Scratch that, the side salad was good. So, there's that.

I won't be come back here. $58 for a terrible appetizer, 2 sub-par entrees, and one glass of wine (I drank water) is not worth the money. And it took 90 minutes to get through this horrid meal. Not OK.
