nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Hands down, best Italian restaurant I've experienced. Italian food is my absolute favorite food and I have been to A LOT of Italian restaurants, but Buddy V's is by far the best. Everything about it was authentic...even our server! He was awesome! I had the Sunday Gravy. It's a pasta with sauce full of different meats. Everything about it was amazing. The Lamb was the best and most tender I've ever tried and the Italian sausage was amazing. The food was so delicious that we passed all of our plates around the table so everyone in our group could try each dish. The Mac and Cheese and lasagna are to die for as well! This is definitely a restaurant worth trying during your trip to Vegas!
