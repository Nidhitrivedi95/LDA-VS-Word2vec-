VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ I was looking forward to dining at Bernard's. I passed this place several times in my neighborhood and have been hoping for a local French joint in the area. I found it! But..it was not all that great.

The food was subpar, I had the escargot, which were good but anyone can make good escargot with butter and bacon. Next, the salad dressing was bland and salad overall was not satisfying. Measly vegetable side for the entree, could be much better. It looked like steamed vegetables out of a frozen bag. The steak itself could have used more seasoning. 
Also, I asked for just a crepe by itself and they could not do that. Why? There are three crepe entrees on the menu, why not just cook off one plain for a side?

Language barrier with servers (no it's not French). 

Wine was great though, and good prices on wine as well. 

Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more for crepes for lunch or just had wine and cheese.

Creme brulee was excellent.

Overall, for the price and concept, it's just okay, I've experienced better.
