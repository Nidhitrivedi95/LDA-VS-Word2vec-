0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ The pizza is good though it was little soft for me. i like to fold my pizza in half and half of topping just slice just slid off the bread. I guess that's why the knives and forks are there.    The service was good.  I find it a bit pricey for a small pie and toppings at a dollar each but I knew the price before I ordered.  I cashed in the free dessert which helped even out the price for me a bit.
