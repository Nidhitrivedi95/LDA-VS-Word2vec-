xU_QqrlaxXlf2SKoNIaGpg Had dinner for the 1st time here. After checking Yelp for reviews and saw it was a 4.5 star knew we were in for a nice meal.
Was very impressed with the serivice and the menu choices. The prices were very responsible and entire staff was attentive.  Will will definitely be back!
New gem in the desert.
