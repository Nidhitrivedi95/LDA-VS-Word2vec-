C451jDDMy9RL3AHZAxqw_A You wouldn't really want to get drunk in Harry's Bar, but you might very well be drunk in Harry's Bar. 

It's a place that you might stumble into en masse with a bunch of your mates once you've all had a few to many and are looking for a dark corner to have a bit of a boogie until you get a bit tired and emotional.
It's just round the corner from Charlotte Square, although you couldn't really miss it at night. I suppose the most important thing about Harry's is that it's really, really, fairly priced. The crowd is perhaps a little older than many other places, however it's right good for a people watch.

It's the kind of place where people really let there hair down, if I'm honest, if you're in Harry's there's a good chance that you're hair is already down.
