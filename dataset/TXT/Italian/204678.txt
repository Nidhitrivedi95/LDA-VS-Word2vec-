QcV8KIPKbGRnWQPql55bKQ I have never ordered the pizza there but I did order pasta for delivery. My order was spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parmigiana and fettucini Alfredo. Let me just say that it was not at all good. The pasta was over cooked. Meatballs were flavorless and overall tasting of food was below average standards. I will order pizza one day and then finalize my star rating!!
