K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ Let me start by saying I did not pay to get into the club, my friend and I had a club promoter who got us in and we received free bottle service at a table, however our club promoter did not take care of us very well and we seemed to be shuffled around from table to table all night which was kind of annoying, not a good impression, I will not be using him in the future. However I did love that this club had old school hip hop mixed with top 40, it was definitely a nice venue to dance your tail off too! It's a small dance floor venue and they pack it to capacity but I had a great time despite all the negatives.
