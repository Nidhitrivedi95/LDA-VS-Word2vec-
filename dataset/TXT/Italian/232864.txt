TLMysu1mWiLEslCBon5W1g Made some resos here the other week - took my best friend for birthday dinner. Charming atmosphere. Excellent service from the minute we walked in. Ordered the steak frites - simply amazing. The steak was cooked to perfection. Better than Goods & Provisions in my opinion. Would definitely recommend. Will definitely return.
