2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg When you need some ambiance and great cup... this is the place to go. Add in a pastry, table service and sometimes live music and you truly feel you are not in Vegas anymore. Lovely outdoor cafe with quite a few tables, so seating is not usually a problem. Truly has a euro feel.
... Did I mention breakfast.? The Mediterranean eggs were drenched in feta and the plates are large enough to split. Had a pumpkin latte which was rich and flavorful, but  did not rely on sweetness (like some other coffee shops that overcompensate flavor with sugar). Go on Saturday, when the farmer's market is at Tivoli and watch the world go by!
