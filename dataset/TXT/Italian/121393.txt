HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A Looking for EXCELLENT Italian food?  This is THEE place! I'm originally from NY so the bar is set pretty high, Mastrioni's is by far the BEST I've had in the 6 years I've been here! The ambience is just great! No corny "figures" no gaudy "Italian" flags etc. Our server, Dane, was friendly and had all the specials memorized. He was very friendly and attentive, every need was taken care of. The food was Stellar!!! I had the Chicken Marsala, which was fantastic & a good one is definitely hard to find in Vegas! My 4 other native New Yorker's were impressed with their meals as well! If you're looking for REALLY great Italian food, Mastrioni's is THEE place to go!!!
