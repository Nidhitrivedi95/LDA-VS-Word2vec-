5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA Fantastic food and service.  We've held our company Christmas party here the last couple of years (the last one being just this last Friday night) and we couldn't be happier with Michael and his staff.  They handled our 90+ group well and were very accommodating to our needs. This is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Las Vegas and enjoy coming here on my own whenever possible.  Highly recommend for a nice romantic dinner or for your corporate event.
