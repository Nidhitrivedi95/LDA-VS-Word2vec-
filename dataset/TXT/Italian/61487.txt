AYLxEeVq8NKG2UhcBiggrA Great lunch time experience all around, not really anything I could complain about. Located in the Long branch neighbourhood of Etobicoke (literally half a block from the Mississauga/Toronto border), it's a fun, modern, and surprisingly Canadian wood fired pizza joint. I say surprisingly Canadian because of their pizza menu utilizing classic ingredients fused with a little canadian flair both with ingredients and in name.

Our server was wonderful, patient, very sweet and was a joy to speak with (I believe it was Chantel?)

My pizza, was amazing, I had the one with fresh pepperoni, olives and spinach. I can't recall the name but it was amazing (maybe Superman?!?!?)

They have my fave brew "Canuck" by Great Lakes Brewery in a can, so that made my Pizza and Beer splurge experience even more enjoyable!. 

AND... with yelp check-in you get a garlic bread style pizza, for FREE!

Great fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked pizzas, and fab service. Can't go wrong with this joint!
