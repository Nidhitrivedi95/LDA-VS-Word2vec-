B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw Came here with colleagues after work. The food is delicious, I had the Branzino, a grilled mediterranean sea bass. It was crisp and delicious. The décor is pleasant as well, the patio is a must on a nice day! Waiting staff are kind, courteous and prompt. Overall a great dining experience.
