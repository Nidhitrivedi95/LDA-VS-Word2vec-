LzYy9DdprXyI2zXNSP267g Came in on family day, hoping to sit down for a nice family dinner. We're regular patrons of this restaurant and our kids love the food here. 
Kids wanted to get some spaghetti and meatballs. Waiter informed us they ran out of meat sauce. Kids wanted soup with their meal, ran out of tomato soup. My daughter wanted to get Italian wedding , they're were out but after waiter came back, they managed to get a pot going and got  another somehow. And no Coke! Seriously?  How? It's a syrup.  It seems to me that there's a significant issue with management in respect to anticipating demand during valentines and family day. If they know they'll run out of certain items, management needs to do everything they can to make sure they can handle dinner service. Call your suppliers and get it done. It is embarrassing that they won't even give my son a side of fries instead  of soup. Management will not allow. What the heck is going on? Are they purposely trying to prevent customers from coming back?  We haven't gotten the main course yet so stay tuned.... Ok. Got main course. No wholewheat noodles so I got regular. Meatballs weren't even cooked in sauce and aribiata sauce was very suspect. Tastes like plain sauce. chilli flakes sprinkled on top. Literally. That's not how I remember it. Maybe they ran out as well.  Wasn't impressed at all. Job well done. They managed to lose regular customers.  Oh yeah. They messed up the bill too.  Simply terrible.
