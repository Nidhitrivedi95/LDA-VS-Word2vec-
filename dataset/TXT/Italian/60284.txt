aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA My best friends are from Wisconsin and fly back to visit their family several times a year. I live in Virginia. One common story I always would hear from them is how amazing the pizza is at Ian's. Well I finally got the chance to find out when I flew into Madison for my best friends wedding. I didn't get cheese curds first like I should've but instead I went for Ian's pizza. I got the mac and cheese slice, the brisket with tots slice, and a slice of pepperoni to be safe. Ian's held up to every word from all the stories I've heard about the place. The mac and cheese pizza was the best one to me. I'll be back again once Badger football starts.
