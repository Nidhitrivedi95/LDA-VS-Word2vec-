With 5 in our party and with a beautiful porterhouse and ribeye we started in with the expectation of an enjoyable meal.  After the first bite we began hoping the next would be better.  By the third piece I was only hoping for a piece I could swallow.  After complaining to the manager he wanted to give us free dessert.  I don't eat dessert.  I went there for the steak alone.   I told him we would give them another chance, after all everyone can have an off day.  After a long story about how they feed their cattle and prepare their steaks we received no resolve, no discount towards another meal...nothing.  The manager was arrogant enough to claim they could never have prepared a steak as we (5 of us) had claimed.  We have all eaten at the Palm, DelFresco, Morton's and others.  Mario Batalia should be ashamed of this experience we encountered and embarrassed by how his staff treated us.  For a good steak and dining experience, stay away from this restaurant.
