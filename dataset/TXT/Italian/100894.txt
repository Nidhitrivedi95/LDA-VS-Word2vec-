fbLYRHIZAt3q839whhaBUg Love this place! Especially because it is so close to my house! The service was alright when I went here, the waitress was nice and always was checking up on us to see if our food was good or if we needed anything else. The service for getting the food out was a little on the slow side which sucked because I was starving the whole time I had to wait for the food to come out! The misters are nice on the outside eating area especially in the heat of Arizona. Parking lot is huge since it is in the complex as same as Paradise Valley Mall.
