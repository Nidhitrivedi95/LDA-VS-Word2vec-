Y_SKyssv8ClQ_p25lCsbAQ This is an update to my original post. Found ourselves out and about with friends on a Saturday night. They suggested 1905. I held my tongue, given my first experience....but they were persistent and raving about it. We called enroute...it was 8:30ish, knowing they would be closing soon. The owner was welcoming and said they'd wait for us. We arrived a few minutes later and were treated very well, given the late timing. We had wonderful bread with dipping oil and beans/greens to start. Both were plentiful and delicious. My husband had a veal/pepper dish, I had white clam sauce, friends had pasta primavera and a chicken dish. All were huge, hot and well prepared. I am converted.
