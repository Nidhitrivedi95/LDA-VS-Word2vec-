FdiZDOs8LbSnBpA_e5R5HQ Ordered delivery for the first time Saturday night. We got the extra large deep dish chicken alfredo and I have to say this pizza is awesome. Delivery was quick and the driver was super friendly. He had a Navy hat on but I did not get his name. We have eaten at every pizza joint in the area and this place is the best.
