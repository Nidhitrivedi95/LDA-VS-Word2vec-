esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA What a delight.  Had modest expectations, but the food was excellent. I had linguine with clams, and the light, white wine sauce had a lemony accent.  My daughter kept stealing off my plate, though she really enjoyed her gnocchi, which were large and plump and clearly homemade.  The wait staff was very friendly and personable, but the service a little slow, so plan to relax.  We had 6PM reservations and had to get out by 7:10 to make it to a show, and we did make it.  Prices were reasonable and we enjoyed a yummy split of champagne that was perfect for the two of us.
