Case in point: just waited 2.5 minutes on hold just to place my order and quoted one hour delivery time. Both "inconveniences" are justified by how yummy their pizzas are. 

Warning: the less than stellar reviews do not do this place justice. I can only attest to the pizza and garlic knots. It's a delicious and solid pizza!  

We have dined at Lorenzo's on numerous occasions. It's an old fashioned pizza joint with a big pizza oven and not the fast food style pizza cooked with a conveyor belt. Seeing how many take out and delivery orders they handle is extra validation to how many of my neighbors love their food. 

Lorenzo's is conveniently located in the shopping center on the Northeast corner of N. Scottsdale Road and E. Pinnacle Peak Road. The shopping center had plenty of free parking.
