5OV1bavavdsYyfeBRNiOeA Well, I would like to say that it was impossible to get something positive out of my experience at Osteria.

Attention: Overall decent and the reason for the only star.

Price: Expensive in relation to the portions and the mediocre taste of the food.

Quallity: It cannot get worse than a cold pasta and bad bread.

Size: Ridiculously small.

Hope this information can help you make a wise decision steering clear of this place.
