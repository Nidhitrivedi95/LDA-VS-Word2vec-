4RL5ydKIIFpU8bevsOKRdA Came here on a late Friday evening for some dessert and coffee. It took them over 30 mins to bring a coffee, which I think was made from some instant powder. And another 15 mins for a slice of pre made cake. Seriously bad service.

My bill was only $9. I put down $20 and the waiter asked if he should bring back change! Well of course he should, that poor service doesn't deserve a tip.
Took another 15 mins for him to bring back the change.
