G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Wonderful ambiance and the smell ... foodie haven. Definitely had the chacturie board, it's outstanding. I normally won't post anything negative so please take this more of a tip than a bashing: I had the veal which while huge was deep fried and should've paid more attention to the menu. Was with a big group and everyone else left satisfied and having enjoyed their choice.
