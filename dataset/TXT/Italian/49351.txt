Food: very authentic Italian (thin crust) pizza. Recommend the vegetariana. 

Price: Decent $11-15 per pizza. 

Service: Friendly but very slow. Be prepared to wait at least half an hour on weekends to get a table and  table service is slow as well  (they don't take reservations for parties under 6). Parking is a bit of a nightmare. 

Service/parking is why I would rate my overall experience as 3, but food wise definitely a 4.
