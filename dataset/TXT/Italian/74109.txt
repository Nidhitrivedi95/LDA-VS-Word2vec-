CPgyfcsyPegLha1ajaSRoA Pasta Too serves tasty Italian-American comfort food. It's not the height of fine cuisine--it's delicious pasta with yummy cheeses and a pretty tasty red sauce that goes on most of the dishes. Their manicotti are craveable--the crepes are delicate and the ricotta filling is perfectly seasoned. Veal parmesan is tender and delicious. Their fettucine alfredo is a little too bland for my taste, but the grilled chicken on top of it was perfect, herbed and marinated to keep it flavorful and moist.

The waits can get pretty absurd, and that's even taking into consideration that I've only ever had takeout here. The people who answer the phone tell you your order will be ready in 25 minutes no matter the day, the time, or the food ordered, and it is *never* true. So definitely only plan on eating here--even for takeout--when you have a little time to kill.
