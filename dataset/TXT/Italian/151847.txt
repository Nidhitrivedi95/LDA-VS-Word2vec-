kQ9gVGp5R_jZwLi0-q8PZQ if I wasn't hungry I won't eat here.
it was late night and I need something to grab with my friend other than sandwich.
so I was happy to see this restaurant was open.
I told staff that it was my first time here.
she wasn't all that friendly.
I order spaghetti with meatball and chicken pasta.
it was overcooked pasta and pricy for what I got.
