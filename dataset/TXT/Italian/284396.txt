zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA I am not even sure what to say: I had pasta that was overcooked including all
of the vegetables inside. My brother had a  Italian sandwich that made Subway seem gourmet.  The free garlic 'bread' was cooked in stale oil & the French bread- I was charged almost 3 dollars for - even though it's bread that normal restaurant give for free.

It was so bad that the three quarters of the meal I did not eat my $11 pasta- I left there- rather than even considering to eat it later. YUCK!
