UlSvQqRRzrqRy5i5hHlQaA I typically love Carrabbas but something with this location. Moved to area a few more the ago and now given it three tries. I don't want to stop enjoying Carrabbas but may have to limit when I'm in Scottsdale or something.

First was a carryout. Ordered gluten-free. Salad had croutons. Hmmm. Should have stopped there but I was hungry and ticket read gluten free. I got sick. I even emailed them to explain experience and no return message or anything...

Second came with a friend. Slowest service. Food took forever and a day. Even the soup, I mean really? Refills were tough to get. Waited forever for check, you get the point. It wasn't busy. I'm pretty forgiving being I worked in industry in past.

And I tried again tonight. Ate alone at bar to not take up much room. Guy walked up to me like he didn't think to say hi or give me a menu. They were doing amore Monday on Tuesday, no special menu, no happy hour info. No Silverware. Asking for cheese seemed like I was awful to ask. I felt ignored and Iike how dare I bother him.

It's sad. I love this place, just not this location. I emailed first time so management knows what's going on but I figured that was ignored, will this help them improve??? I'd only hope...
