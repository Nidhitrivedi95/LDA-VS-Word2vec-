Tp07u-0AOFRfQhtNpAXaQA Four star update for the Manager, Josh playin phone tag with me until he got a hold of me to get my input on my last dining experience. This shows true customer service and that NYPD wanted to make things right. Coincidentally, I got the same original server and things went smoothly this time around. I appreciated the call and the kind gesture.
