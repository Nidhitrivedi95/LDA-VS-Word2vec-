G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q All Hype no glory. Expectations high food not so much. Went for lunch first thing when we arrived top of the steps young lady was on phone for at Least 5 min paid no attention to us. Then after she hangs up she asks how many we say two she says it will be 10 mins or so ok we have no problem with that except when we finally did get seated there were only about a dozen people in the place and lots of empty seats. Our server was very attentive and helpful. Very limited menu. I get it do a few things and do them all well !  I ordered the Muffuletta with zucchini do dads ??? Wife ordered the pesto grill cheese with arugula salad. About 5 minutes or so went by and the server comes to our table and let's me know they are out of the Muffuletta would I like the menu to make another choice. Well there is not much to choose from so I just go with the grilled cheese and added prosciutto.  They served our food and wife had zucchini do dads not a salad the zucchini things were not good at all tasted like fish from dirty oil and it was like trying to eat and untangle shoestrings anyway so I left mine on the plateSo again several minutes go by and they bring her a salad.  The sandwiches were just OK no real wow factor that's all I can say. 22 bucks for grilled cheese ( welcome to Vegas ) while eating we saw a Walburgers over our shoulder sure wished we had choose that for lunch.
