caq9CTtWB-8K0tdFUhTfAQ We had 12 in our group and service was slow. 
The food is fresh and delicious, my linguini marinara was very good.
Lots of mussels, cod, cuttle fish and shrimp and fresh handmade linguini.
The atmosphere was the typical Italian restaurant around the Vaughan Mills area, sterile and not much character.
