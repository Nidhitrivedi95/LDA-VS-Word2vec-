Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A At first I was a bit turned off. My husband and I arrived around 3:30pm as we were told dinner service didn't begin until 4pm as they were transitioning from lunch. Mind you there was only another couple around. Didn't feel welcoming. They asked if we wanted lunch or dinner...but I thought dinner started at 4? I asked if we could stay and eat dinner(like is it cool if we can still eat here? Lol) They sat us down and everything else was great. The food is authentic and flavorful and definitely fresh. My Italian husband enjoyed the meatballs entree with red sauce. Recommend the mixed drinks and arrive closer to their meal time I guess! Lol
