4sPSNBZo2sLxEGDvUHGdbg We came in for a late dinner after shopping. We noticed a new Italian restaurant on the outer edge of a row of home furnishing stores and decided to see what it's all about. 
The restaurant looked brand new, modern decor with dim lighting, very stylish. 
We had a rigatoni alla vodka and a pizza (flammkuchen) that had bacon, creme fraiche and onions. Both were pretty good. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was good. 
Pizza was really tasty, thin crust, just the way I like it.
The waitress brought us bread before the mains it seemed to be made with spices and herbs - initially thought it was olives, but after having a few slices I believe there's oregano, chilli flakes, and rosemary in it. It was really good! 
The waitress was very pleasant, always smiling with a vibrant personality. She made us feel very welcomed. 
Prices are reasonable, not overpriced like many other Italian restaurants and the atmosphere has a nice stylish lounge vibe. It can get a bit noisy I'd imagine as the ceilings were really high and sounds were echoing a lot while we were there and there were 3 other tables near us. 
It's worth a try if you're in the area or if you're looking for a new Italian restaurant to try. 
Remember, although the bread is amazing, save room for the mains, they're pretty tasty!
The fifth star will be for consistency, so it looks like I'll be coming back again.
