KLb9mnirF7LqD57W8IElwA What a surprise I got when I found out that La Fontana wasn't on Yelp yet! 
This small business opened a few years ago in Quartier Dix 30, and I have been a fan of their gelatos since then. I swear. They are homemade, they are fresh, they are tasty, they are.. everything that someone could ask for! Their sweets are what brought me in first, but I found out that everything that they offer on the menu is just as delightful. Small confession: I am slightly addicted to their Penne Alla Gigi. Nothing serious. 

Their menu includes salads, pasta, paninis and many more!

This is definitely a place that I would recommend trying out if you happen to be in the neighbourhood! And if you do decide to give it a try, make sure that you take a glimpse at their dessert counter (or, as I would call it, Heaven).
