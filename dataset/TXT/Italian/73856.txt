Our server came by for a drink order, listed 3 beers on special, and when we asked what type of beer one of the specials was, the response was, "I don't know".... not, I'll go find out, just "I don't know." Later when ordering entrees we asked about a pasta dish, and the explanation from the server was literally, to read the description off of the menu over my shoulder. The homemade pasta was tasty, but stuck together too much. I'd rather go to The Parlor or Mr. Bianco's new "Italian Restaurant" any day. This place has to fix the totally unenthusiastic front of the house for any hope of making it.
