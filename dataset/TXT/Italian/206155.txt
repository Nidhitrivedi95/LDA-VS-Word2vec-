qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA This place was absolutely amazing! 

I ordered the clam and pasta. It was sooo good. The complimentary bread was also very delicious. The service that the waiters provided was so caring and sweet and definitely patient to provide excellent care for their customers. 

Although this place was very small, it was indeed very nice.
