VxgjMl8tQrT4idJW_z8daA Yay for Carrabbas...after a bad experience with trying to get into The Outback next door we went to Carrabba's instead and goes we did. We got seated in about 20 min on a busy Friday night and the service was great! The food was exceptional and quick. I got a wood fired pizza and the wife got a steak. The only thing she didn't like was her salad... too much hard iceberg lettuce but the bread was hot and fresh from the oven and they serve it with delicious olive oil. Thanks Carrabbas for making our date night complete
