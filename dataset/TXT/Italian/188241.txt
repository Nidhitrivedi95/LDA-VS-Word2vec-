ow3oP3cfmhlfmSsGaXe25Q One of my favourite neighbourhood lunch spots! The owner Monika is very friendly! Some of the other servers are nice too.

They have a beautiful patio in the summer. 

Destingo serves up delicious Italian food like sandwiches with truffle fries, and a variety of delicious pasta dishes, like lasagna, gnocchi, spinach and cheese stuffed pasta in rosé sauce... My favourite sandwich is the chicken one, and it's hard to choose a favourite pasta, but the gnocchi, which comes in a garlicky white sauce, is definitely up there. 

They also have some tasty red wine, as well as great beer options for beer drinkers. 

This is one of my favourite lunch spots!
