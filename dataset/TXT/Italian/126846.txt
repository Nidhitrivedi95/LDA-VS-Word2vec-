hTsZSiftorNUFb1VaHCHHg My friend and I tried the Chicken Marsala and Spiced Chicken. Like other reviews the Chicken Marsala was delicious! Tasted like the authentic Italian dish. Also liked that it was on linguini and not mashed potatoes. I tried the peas in some kind of cream on friends dish and that was great too. Didn't actually try the chicken on it. We shared the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert. The "cake?" was almost the texture of a scone. I'm used to cake, so it was different. After it soaked up some of the berries it was better. The addition of a basil flavor was over the top delicious!

The reason for 4 stars is our waiter was very serious, almost grumpy. We did manage to get a few smiles out of him towards the end of the meal. I believe the man who was the manager/owner? was very helpful when I described a flavored rum drink that I enjoy. Very nice man.

We came on a Wed. So not as busy. With the few booths and bar that was occupied I imagine it would get hard to communicate with your table mates. We asked to be moved down a couple booths.

Menu a bit pricey, however I will be back to try other dishes. The Poutine sounds yummy!
