VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w I came with my friends on one of their Industry Nights on a Tuesday. 

My friend put us on the guest list and even the guys didn't have to pay cover! Yay! We got wristbands so we got free drinks/open bar from 11:30-12:30. Awesome! The bar was pretty crowded and crazy but the bartenders were amazingly fast! The guy we had was super nice and sweet too. Not rude/attitudey at all. Huge plus for that. 

Overall ambience is nice. It's like a Mediterranean bathhouse type theme. A lot of people complain that their dance floor is really small and I admit, it is definitely on the dinkier side compared to other Vegas clubs... but it's similar to a lot of dance floors in LA. So I guess it's all relative.  

Music was really good in the beginning - hip hop, top 40s, etc. but then towards the middle of the night, the DJ changed and it turned into house/trance music which I'm not a big fan of. They also gave out these huge long styrofoam glow sticks that look like pool floaties. LOL that was interesting...

Overall, I'd say LAVO is a good place to pre-party for the open bar but not a club I'd wanna stay at the entire night.
