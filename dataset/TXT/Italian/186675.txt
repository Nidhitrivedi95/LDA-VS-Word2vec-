Orgm9nmcClxnAUva4nOKyA Came here once for a friend's birthday brunch. Right away, I think I fell in love with the architecture and design of the restaurant. Design aside, we were seated right away (as we had reservations) and hot a wonderful table with a good view. It was a Sunday, so the place was packed! 

The selection of food was quite impressive, ranging from your typical breakfast foods to more exotic choices, which I found quite neat. I'm a huge fan of savoury breakfasts, and that's what I got! Tons of potato choices, eggs, shrimp, breads, bagels, and even an omelette bar! That was pretty cool. 

The selection of cakes and pastries was quite impressive as well, with muffins, cakes, Danishes, and other lovely goods! 

We were also lucky enough to see a live band performing, and the jazz music was a beautiful complement to the birthday brunch. 

The price of the brunch was about $30 (I ordered coffee as well) + tip. The experience was lovely, with superb service and great food choices. My philosophy on this is "why not spend a bit for a good time?" And that's exactly what we did and had! :)
