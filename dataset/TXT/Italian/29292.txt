5CJOaZc8Muu8WothauxQ4g I love pizza! Having this place in the hotel was a great convenience for us! Open till about 3am, was a great late night place for a pizza lover like me. I would rate it more like a 3.5 but due to poor customer service, rounded down. The pizza itself was just like a typical new york style pizza, get what I expect. Nothing wrong with that at all, I love when food tastes just the way I want it to! We ordered a whole pizza just to take up to our room. Was made fresh. The only problem was when the pizza was finished, none of the 3 people said anything to us. We were the only ones in the restaurant waiting and another table eating. Just a little rude from my perspective, especially when the 3 people were just talking and standing around while our pizza sat there. Only waited about 3 minutes, but still a long time considering how hungry I was. Still, a good place for your pizza needs!
