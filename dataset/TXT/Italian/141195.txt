jNQnscvgn_dMTS954qW_9Q I used a groupon and still felt like they should have paid me to ingest this greasy, canned, smelly, revolting garbage.  

It astounding that this dump is still open.  It's gotta be a nostalgia thing with people who have fond memories of this bastion of canned and frozen cuisine from their younger years.  The clientele appeared to be, uh, rather obese.  So maybe it's the massive portions of high carb/fat that keeps these heifers coming through the door to graze?  A BMI that high does not come without putting in some effort!

The "meat" in my dish was some greasy lips and assholes.  I tried to get by the visual and get a forkful into my mouth.  Needless to say, this was a mistake.  

And to finish up this Tour de Food Lion, the owner at checkout was a rude.  When my friend and I tried to split the bill with two credit cards he said "Oh come on.  You are killing me!".  My response was "Yeah, the feces on a plate that you call food is killing me!".  He did not appreciate that.  Not at all.  And I could not have given less of a shit!
