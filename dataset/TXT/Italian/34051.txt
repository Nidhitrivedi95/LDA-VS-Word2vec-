65kCKrnO3SulNYEen0itGg I went here based on the reviews.  The pizza was good but no substitute for a slice from Brooklyn. The slice and square were both very greasy and were missing the crunch and crust.  It was also upsetting that the counter man just threw the pizza into the box without a plate or wax paper.
It's also comical that when you ask for a slice you get a blank stare from the counter man. If it was really a New York slice you would not have to distinguish a slice of pizza as a "cheese pizza" when ordering.
