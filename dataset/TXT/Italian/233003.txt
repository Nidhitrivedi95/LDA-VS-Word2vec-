TLMysu1mWiLEslCBon5W1g This place has absolutely ruined my friends birthday tonight. And in my books wins the worst service ever medal... Our dinner lasted from 8pm to midnight and most of the time we were waiting for food ( which was less than average). We requested the bill around 10... Didn't come until 11.30 as 2 of our waitresses couldn't figure out who to charge what for an hour and a half for the party of 10. Bitter bitter experience. Such a shame.
