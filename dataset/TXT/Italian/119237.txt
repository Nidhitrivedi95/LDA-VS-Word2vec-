H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g this restaurant single handedly made me lose faith in mario batali for life. i've been here twice. both times, i was extremely disappointed by the quality and taste of the food. the pastas and pizzas lacked the rich, heartiness of italian flavors- uplifted by herbs and arromatic cheeses. the food tasted like it came from a cheap wannabe italian deli. for some reason, the ice cream cone waffle tasted like fried fish? service was spotty with a bunch of servers standing around and giggling. and of course, completely OVERPRICED for the experience.
