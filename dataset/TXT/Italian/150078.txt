We were lucky to get in at all; the adorable host found us a seat int he bar area, which made for a much more relaxed dining experience. Actually, I think I would have preferred sitting there to the main area (or the "outside"); our meal was served more quickly and was way more low-key. I had the salmon pasta which was deliciously fishy and flavorful. My husband pasta with clams which was also excellent. Sure it was pricey, but it is Vegas, and it was so worth it.
