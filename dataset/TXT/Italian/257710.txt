w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A I've been having pizza here for almost 10 years now and it's still a strong showing in the pizza department.
Usually very busy during dinner hours and it can get noisy with the kids getting grumpy before bedtime, but just order another glass of wine or another beer and you won't hear the screaming kids. ha ha.
Food was great tonight and service was good. Our server forgot our salad, but we just took it to go and it's all good.
I wouldn't order the Alfredo with grilled chicken, not only is the chicken a seperate charge, you don't see or taste any chicken at all in this dish.
Chicken pieces so small even a child wouldn't notice it. This is a pizza place and a solid one at that, but you take your chances with other dishes.
My parents loved it all and we took enough leftovers home for later.
