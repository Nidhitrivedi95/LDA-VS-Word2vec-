But come on, people - IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BRUSCHETTA! Holy cow - what delicious topping combinations! Ricotta w/dates & pistachios. Prosciutto w/figs & mascarpone. I could go on... 

Great time here - my two small complaints were (1) the sauvignon blanc by the glass is one of those "SB w/semillon" concoctions - not our fave by a long shot, and (2) i like my bread a bit crispier for bruschetta, but understand it's a house style.

When next in Phoenix, we'll be back.
