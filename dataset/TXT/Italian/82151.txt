DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw I normally don't do this, but I was very excited about eating here based on all the wonderful reviews and people telling me how great it was. My opinion... HORRIBLE. We arrived at about 9:30 PM on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty. We got seated right away and drink order and menus were brought soon after. I must say for being a wine bar, there were no wine menus or suggestions or even asking if we wanted anything other than water from the person who took our order. We waited for over 15 minutes for a server to come take our order. Meanwhile we were filling ourselves with bread. Finally our server, on his way somewhere else said I'll be with you in 2 minutes. For the restaurant to be as empty as it was, this guy was running around as if he was slammed. He comes up, no introduction, no offerings, no welcome... NOTHING, all he said was you ready? My boyfriend said hello to him, and he just stood there as if we were taking his precious time away... gave him our order and he took off... running around like a chicken with no head. We felt very rushed by him. Finally our food came, which was ok not worth the price in my opinion. We made a comment to one of the bussers and he was apologetic but he just said that that's how the server was. For it being our valentine's day dinner it was very lackluster. Kinda ruined our night. The place is beautiful but just based on the service provided to us I would not recommend this place to anyone, and definitely not coming back.
