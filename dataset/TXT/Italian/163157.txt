LWcn5_F8c5iDLvVCootw3A I had the worst meatball sub I have ever eaten I could only choke down one third of it before I finally said no more. I brought the rest home to my dog he could barely eat it. He is a pitbull Boxer mix. He will eat anything. And he even barely could eat it. This is very disappointing for a place that supposed to be an Italian eatery. The owner needs to eat his own food. There's no way he's eating the slop and still feeding it to his customers.
