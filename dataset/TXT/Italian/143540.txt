JsUprRhyzQyukZmAhcOg0A I'm rating based on waiting on my reservation. If there were negative stars the reservation staff deserves it. Made a reservation, and showed up 35 mins early. Asked if it was better to keep on my reservation or to get on the wait list and low and behold everyone in the lobby has been seated before us, including wait and reservations. This is ridiculous.

Asides from the horrible hostess service, the manager was apologetic about the situation and our server and food was superb. Everything came out on time and tasted great. Drinks were filled and we were checked on frequently. Dishes were large portions so come hungry.
