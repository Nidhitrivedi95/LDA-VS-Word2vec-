0VOh4VIq13oFburRU9gddw The atmosphere of this place is great! Very friendly and local feel to it. I tried a few things here:

- Zucchini & onion rings: pretty good, but nothing special
- Garbage salad: very tasty and fresh!
- Pizza: Great crust and toppings
- Rootbeer float: Yummy!

The best thing about this place is the price. So cheap!

The server was very friendly and attentive. However, when we asked for separate checks, she seemed upset. I would tell her to lighten up!
