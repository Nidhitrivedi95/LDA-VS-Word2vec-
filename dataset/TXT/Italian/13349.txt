15YuEFO59yXd7BTO5NZgYw a complete insult to italian cuisine. the calamari was fairly decent however only served with some trashy ranch dressing.. and that's where the good ends...
The green tea had NO FLAVOR. The ciabatta bread was COLD. not room temp. out of a refrigerator cold!
I ordered a special this evening... pasta with breaded shrimp with their specialty "sunrise" sauce (marinara/alfredo mixed together)... The sauce tasted like baby food, and the pasta combined with it tasted like water. The shrimp were a good size but there were only a few, considering the $16.95 price... (also, for this price, soup or salad should be included. not $2.00 more. The shrimp were overcooked and  I bit into one and had to spit it out into my napkin... something I NEVER EVER DO regardless of how something tastes.. It had a foul STRONG fishy taste that was just absolutely nauseating. I alerted the waitress to this and she seemed concerned but offered nothing in compensation. My family members ordered other non-impressive meals.. the vito's italian sausage sandwiches were also cold, and had      slimy boiled peppers in onions.  My dad's Chicken Picatta looked like it was made with frozen-in-a-bag chicken breasts from the grocery store.. again, absolutely insulting considering the menu price. Waitress was unpleasant and visibly angry about something going on with her co-workers.  Completely unprofessional. Let's hope that foul shrimp doesn't come back to haunt me in a few hours!
