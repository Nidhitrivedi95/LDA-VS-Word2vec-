DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q The Sky Harbor has many great options for food and this place is no exception. They do pizza, sandwiches, burgers, and salads. I was feeling pizza and I ordered the "Fallen Angel". It came with sausage, fennel, onions, mozarella and red sauce. The pizza was well cooked with a nice chew and the pizzas are single serving. I was impressed.
