d1_Ko1DQ4QyB9BjnCFjVLw Better Italian food at Olive Garden and that's saying a lot! 

New to the area I decided to give this place a try and unfortunately it'll be the last time. 

Happy hour is not happy hour, the waitress who wasn't familiar with the menu had to keep coming back and telling me all the things I couldn't get. Not a great business strategy. 

Worst of all I couldn't customize my order which was shocking. You'd think if I could have a burger made my way at a fast food joint that they could customize your meal for the price you're paying here! So be careful if you are allergic or really dislike certain foods. It also worried me that the food isn't being cooked to order because of this and perhaps just frozen bulk that's reheated. 

I ordered the spinach manicotti which I forced myself to finish because I felt bad for my friend who had offered to pay.  

The food was lukewarm at best, not presented well and I felt ill after it all. 
I won't be returning, there are plenty of other restaurants in the area to choose from.
