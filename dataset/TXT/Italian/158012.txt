On a busy night, I did take-out to ensure I could savor the flavors. Homemade calvetini pasta in marinara sauce with meatballs and a dinner salad. There is nothing like fresh and homemade pasta -- tender, melts in your mouth goodness on a fork. The sauce was tasty --next time I'm getting on pepper flakes for that kick. Hit the stop and oh so delicious.

Will be back for the pizza and other homemade pasta selections.
