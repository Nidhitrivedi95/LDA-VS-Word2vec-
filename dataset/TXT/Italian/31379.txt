The food is delicious, and my family being Italian, executive chef, Salvatore, gave us a personalized experience. From the moment we entered and started a conversation with him, he gave us a personalized choice of food, showed us all the seafood, which he gets fresh from Italy, and gave us choices and options that we have only seen in Italy. It was my mother's birthday, and Salvatore proceeded to bring a birthday cannoli, baba, which is a type of warm dessert, and champagne for the entire restaurant, which was on the house. Very hospitable place, felt like being in Italy. 
The seafood, pizza, and desserts are accurate Italian dishes. The restaurant has an amazing story and amazing food. Tradition ran deep throughout the restaurant, giving it a very enjoyable atmosphere. If you want to taste traditional Italian food, this is the go to place in all of Madison. 

I must say that if you have Italian heritage, especially if you speak fluent Italian, you must come to Naples 15 for a great experience of Italy.
