eQCYur0033RkZdh5VjbF8A Came here for my birthday with a party of 5. Pretty nice and classy place. I ordered the seafood spaghettini which was okay , nothing special but definitely not worth the price. Also got a sangria which was absolutely terrible, it just tastes like club soda mixed with wine, which was not as described. Service was not the best, they were not that busy and it still took forever for someone to take our order. My friend had ordered the soup and it came out half cold. Also got the peach cobbler for dessert which was probably the highlight of the meal. Other than that would not go back.
