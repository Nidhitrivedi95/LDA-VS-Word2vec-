TNz-jO5giwObxMkbj9wAag I never had their breakfast (hence can't comment on other reviewer's negative experience), but I just went there tonight for dinner.  Forget the hot wait staff (which is always a plus), their dinner menu is solid.  We had the Tuna Tartar and Risotto with mushrooms and black truffle, and both came out better than expected.

As for the hot waitstaff, I live in both LA and NY so pretty girls are dime a dozen to me, but what makes Otto's waitstaff so much more attractive (other than their French Canadian accent) is their sweet personality and charm.
