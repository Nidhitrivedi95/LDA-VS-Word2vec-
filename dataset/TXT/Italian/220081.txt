SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Came here with a friend for the first time and didn't know what to expect... but I sure wasn't expecting a vampire dungeon castle with class... 

This joint definitely looked hip and I was curious from the moment I took a step through the door. My party and I were immediately greeted by a hostess and then we made our way to the bar. The bartenders were ready to serve us as soon as we parked our batooki's on the bar stools. 

I personally ended up ordering the stake salad flatbread, which was divine and 
a glass of chardonnay that was not such a great recommendation from the B-tend, but it was still good enough for me to drink it up. My buds had 4 french beers between them and calamari.  

Overall the bill for 1 glass of wine, 4 beers, calamari + 1 flat bread was $70 tip not included in calculation which is a little steep, but I thought it was worth it because the aesthetics made it feel like it was worth spending the extra green. The food did take a bit long to arrive, but it was no biggie. I definitely dig this joint and will be coming back real soon.
