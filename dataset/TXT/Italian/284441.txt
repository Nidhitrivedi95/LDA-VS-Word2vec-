zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA When everything is 50% off perhaps it tastes twice as good? I was tempted to give 4 stars here, but we haven't gone back, so I decided that perhaps at the time we were doubly impressed because of our magic half-off everything coupon. That's a good deal!

The Chicago lady who sold us our car had insisted that Rosati's was the best in Vegas. Granted, she gets her Rosati's from a Henderson location, but we gave this one a try. Thanks to the coupon, we went a little overboard and ordered salad, wings and a pizza. Now, that's just crazy.

The salad is delicious. One of the most solid green offerings I have had at a casual place. The dressing appeared homemade, and all of the ingredients were fresh. I was impressed. I was equally impressed by the artery-clogging garlic knots. I rarely find myself unable to resist a bread basket, but I may have eaten 20 of these tasty morsels.

Chicken wings were good.

Now, as for the pizza, it was perplexing. When it arrived to the table, we had to confirm with the waitress that this was indeed the deep dish. She said it was, but honestly it looked more like a Pizza Hut deep dish than the brick o' cheese I associate with Chicago-style. It didn't come out in one of those pans that the waitress has to carry with a special wrench. It was like a thin deep-dish or something. The sauce was good. Overall, a nice tasting pizza, but not as sinfully cheesy as the Chicago-styles I have had in the past. 

As for service, when we first arrived we had this on the ball, chipper teenager, but half way through he left, and so did our service. Kind of a 50/50 on the service as well. 

I'll definitely be watching my mailbox for another coupon.
