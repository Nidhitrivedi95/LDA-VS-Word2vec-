JBrBsKpw0bbXK5nlrXVOYQ Early Sunday evening with another couple and our kids. Surprisingly the place wasn't that busy, the 7 of us sat in the middle of the dining room but still have in view of the TV's in the small bar area to watch playoff football.

Drink order taken and a few minutes when are young waitress returned she took our order. We opted for the pizza and wing special with the addition of a meat lovers pizza. I ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup.

Pepperoni pizza delivered along with our 30 wings. 10 medium, great sauce. Not too spicy with the traditional vinegar tang. 10 BBQ, run of the mill. 10 sweet and spicy, I don't really know how to describe these wings, but sweet and spicy. Tang and spiciness of the medium but with a hint of sweetness. Really good. Meat lovers delivered shortly there after.

Pepperoni pizza is pepperoni pizza. The meat lovers is another story. Loaded with toppings, finely diced sausage and bacon with cheese that was a golden brown

The soup, clearly homemade but lacking in something.

Kids meals reasonably priced starting at $5.25

This is a great local mom and pop restaurant and they have a large back room for banquets and meetings. Service was good, nothing spectacular but for the young waitstaff it will do.
