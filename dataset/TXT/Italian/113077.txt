my BF played baseball at unlv after Friday games we always wanted to try metro pizza but the close early. Years later we came back to try it and everything was amazing !! 
The staff was super friendly, the food was SUPERB we got meatball sliders, bbq chicken pizza (not my fave) pulled pork pizza (PHENOMENAL!!!!!!)  

Checked in they said they'd honor the free drink but they forgot. 

Definently recommend !
