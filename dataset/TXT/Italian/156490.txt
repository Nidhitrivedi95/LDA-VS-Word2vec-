l8SNag-Ii0YUeSGHkA3Vhw This is my favourite Italian restaurant in the city. The food never disappoints. It's consistently the best food and the one place I sit back, close my eyes and savour the flavours at Ferro. 

Apps you need to order:
- Magic Mushrooms: get ready to die and go to heaven. This dish is the absolute bomb. I genuinely get a foodgasm when I have this. I also don't like to share my magic mushroom. 
- Carpaccio: so thin, tender and delicious. The flavour complemented by fresh sliced parmigiano reggiano. This dish is incredible. 
- Cozze: love their mussels and prefer them with the white wine sauce.


Salads: their salads are insanely delicious, I love the Zucca salad with a grilled salmon on top. Their salmon is tender and delicate. 

All their pizzas, pastas, gnocchi's and risottos are cooked to perfection and enhanced with the finest ingredients. The quality of everything here is beyond excellent. In my opinion, their pizzas are the best in the city. 

Dessert:
You MUST have the tiramisu!!!! Omg, it straight out of a Nonna's kitchen in Italy.

If you haven't been, go, right now. Stop reading this review and go already!
