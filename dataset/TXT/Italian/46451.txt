8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg We came here with a discount coupon from tickets 4tonight, which we paid $4 for and told the waiter about it.  He said fine and he told us about the prefixe menu they had there that night.  We ordered it and were half way through when we were told that the manager wouldn't allow us to use the coupon for that meal.  Ruined the meal.
