FmraE2CWt65VRnEqCAqNEg The hubs and I have a weekly lunch date every Friday, and we try to find places we've never been, preferably locally owned joints instead of chains. It was my turn to pick, so we gave Harvey American a shot. What a pleasant surprise! It takes a lot for my husband to give high praise, and he said, "My sandwich [the French dip] is excellent." Excellent in hubs' terms = the bomb! I had the chicken pesto flatbread and it was also excellent. The edges were crispy, the cheese was melty and flavorful, the chicken tender. Can't complain! But the crowning glory was the onion rings. Best I've EVER had. They are clearly hand-made, and it shows. The onions were sweet, and the coating was crisp and not greasy. When you take a bite, it doesn't fall apart. You get the bite, and the rest of the onion is left in the coating for the next bite. Imagine!

 Love the decor--all wood, very cozy, and next time I want to sit in one of the little hidden away booths. 

The only reason it gets 4 stars is because the food took quite a while to come out, even though the restaurant only had like 5 tables occupied, and because the country music was blaring. It was distracting. 

Overall, we'll be back. Definitely.
