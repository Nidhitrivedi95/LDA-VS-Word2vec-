MyW7qbrnQboiBJg6-u0tzg An Italian place in our home village, we've always wanted to go but the hours never worked for us. finally we made it for lunch. inside the decor is a little modern-meets-garage-sale but the staff was friendly. Good sized menu of Italian favorites and wood fired oven pizzas. We had a pizza and Penne pasta lunch dishes. both were solid Italian from a German-Italian restaurant. We also ordered the bruschetta, which was good though the tomatoes could have been a bit more fresh. We are going to go back for dinner and will keep on hunting for great places in Weilimdorf.
