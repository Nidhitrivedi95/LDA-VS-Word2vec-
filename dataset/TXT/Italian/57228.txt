ANAGlfG4ELW3jiO62GQ1zw Ok, I've compared Wing Lei (Wynn's Chinese restaurant) to Panda Express.....and now I have to compare Corsa Cucina to Olive Garden.  And no, I'm not crazy, or some snobby SOB who expects the very most from a $120/person meal.  I know food in Vegas is expensive....that's the way it goes......so I could care less about the dollars....I care more about the actual food.

Ok, ok, maybe not Olive Garden, but really nothing special.  If you're looking for a decent meal, then this place is fine.  The salad is good, the appetizers are good, the drinks are good, the wine selection is solid, and the meals are ok.  The main theme - good, good, good, solid, ok....nothing fantastic. It's a nice and vibrant place, so you'll even feel and look cool while you trade stories with your buddies of how your straight got flushed out the night before.  The service, as with any other restaurant at the Wynn, is great.  It's also a decent place to people watch....especially the locals who are heading to Tryst from the Wynn parking garage.

I personally think most of the restaurants at the Wynn are over-rated.  I think they all garner maybe 1-1.5 more stars than they actually deserve, just because they're at the Wynn.  If you're feeling like a little Italian, and you're near the Wynn, might as well go....nothing spectacular, but it'll get the job done.
