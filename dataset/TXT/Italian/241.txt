-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw Went to Brio Tuscan Grille in Kierland for a lunch meeting.  It was the perfect atmosphere to do business - prompt service, good food, lots of space, and a moderate pace to the meal.   Plus, upscale food at reasonable prices.  A very diverse menu and lunch specials ranging from $7.95 to around $20

I had the salad and risotto lunch for $11.95.  A huge wedge salad and a solid portion of the sweet potato and chicken risotto.  There was a considerable amount of meat in the risotto (I actually would have preferred less) and the rice was well seasoned with chicken stock, sweet potato, asparagus, and onions. Bread and flatbread were brought to the table before we ordered.

The service could have been a little more attentive.  The server admitted she was new to the restaurant, but seemed unnecessarily nervous or distracted. I'm sure with a little more training, this will be a 5-star experience!
