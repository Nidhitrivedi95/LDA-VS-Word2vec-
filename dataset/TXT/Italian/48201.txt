93FVxoipAIYG07gisMOQhw I got the lasagna and it was absolutely delicious. My guest with me this evening received the fettuccine alfredo and she didn't like it. I tasted it and thought the same thing - it was bland. The owner's wife came out and was very kind and sweet and offered us replacement dish. So we got the chicken parmesan. Much better, so thanks to the owners wife and the waitress for being so responsive in this situation. 

Cheers! We'll be coming back!!


Ps. After writing the review and the check came to the table, they had compensated chicken parmesan and the cannoli desert that we ordered; which was delicious by the way!
