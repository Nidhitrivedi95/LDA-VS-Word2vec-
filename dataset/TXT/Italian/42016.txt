7PRse3yCQbEprAj1DWrEQQ Dish is another culinary reason for me to miss living in Pittsburgh. Located in an old row house, Dish serves up options for every person in your party. On my most recent trip I ordered the lamb Osso Bucco, which was actually pretty disappointing, but that could have just been me. The man at the table across from me all but gnawed on the Flintstone looking bone, so he obviously enjoyed it. I did get to sample the filet and that was a tasty cut! The killer martini and wine choices, as well as the delectable desserts completely made up for my somewhat lacking meat selection. There was no going wrong with the chocolate bread pudding or pumpkin flan and since I skimped on my meal, I was the one practically licking the dessert plates clean. I couldn't have been happier.
