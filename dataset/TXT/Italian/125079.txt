hr0vxeTzlHx6fTpSSmu2AA went with another couple before attending Cleveland Orchestra performance at Blossom  the service is wonderful and friendly and the food!!! We were able to bring our own wine and were ok with the corkage fee.. got the bill and charged twice! that wasn't cool.  The appetizers were delicious and so many choices.  we were told that it's really fun to sit at the bar and watch the chef work work their magic
