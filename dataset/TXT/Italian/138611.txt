jcasci3gjbsSuTEVzvDQKg Italian is my favorite kind of food, so it's no surprise that I would frequent this place when I was back home. The pasta, bread and chicken are so delicious. My only gripe was that the restaurant got crowded from time to time, but that's to be expected when you're talking about a fine restaurant such as this one.
