vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA Growing up With an Italian mom ,I am used to being really picky with my Italian food but this place really compared to a home cooked meal . The plain vodka pasta was unbelievable good. We all ate so much bread and appetizers that by the time we got our food , we all were full . The Veal  Parm was crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle, cooked perfect . The decor was beautiful and the big ass menus will crack you up . I don't know why the menus are so big but that's the only thing I would change .
