kpZ2vPjkHfee4pCLC05tfg I was just there over the long wknd !! It's a nice authentic italian eatery! The atmosphere is polished but not snooty with a great spacious patio....the menu has all the great italian classics and new things too!  Once you've ordered,... the food comes out fast!  The portions are good and plentiful... a tad bit on the greasy side! 

The only thing I would suggest is that the waiters/waitresses don't put too much pressure on the clientele to order! I felt a bit rushed.
