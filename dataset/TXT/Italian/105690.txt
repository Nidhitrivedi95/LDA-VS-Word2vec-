fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg Just got some to go action from the CherryBlossom peeps and I'm dripping in soy sauce as I type. YUM! Quick, attentive and friendly service! I can't wait to dive into my wasabi, my spicy tuna roll and my crunch roll. If you read this and I still have some left...ha ha...I might share with you. But, props to the staff for the sake while I was waiting...Strip malls in Phoenix shall not be ignored people!
