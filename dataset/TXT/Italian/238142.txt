u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Went back in the evening for some more of the delicious bruschetta!  This time I went with another friend and we shared that plus the artichoke dip and a sandwich.  We over ordered, but I wanted to try something new this time. He wanted the "Nine Iron" which has chicken, bacon, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, and dijionnaise on ciabatta.  It was rather tasty, however, the ratio of fillings felt a little off.  I love tomato, so it wasn't a big deal to me, but the sandwich was full of it with one thin little leaf of lettuce and clumps of chicken that weren't evenly distributed between the ciabatta.  I ended up opening the sandwich and rearranging the ingredients myself in order to help it along.  Fresh produce, good flavors and amazing bruschetta!  Honestly, I don't think you can really go wrong ordering it.

The service we received this time around wasn't up to par, but decent enough.  We didn't get our water refilled and the waiter never came back again so that we could order more drinks.  It was a shame.  The food still salvaged the visit though.  I just hope it doesn't happen too frequently since I plan to come here more often with some more friends.

This time we sat on the patio since it was a little quieter in order to chat and despite the chillier weather (I say that loosely, since I'm from Chicago and shouldn't really complain...) I found the outdoor torch like heaters (no, I don't know the technical term for them and apologize for that) to be perfect along with my jacket. Next time around, I think I'll try the soup and salad!
