Took the groom and the groomsmen to this fancy place trying to have a memorable experience.  Bad decision!

Waiter was slow, service was slow, food was slow.

When I tried to complain to the Manager on duty, Tyler, he didn't even have the decency to look like he was even interested in what I had to say.
I'm not typically the type to complain, I'm quite easy going when it comes to restaurant services, but the horrible service and bad experience we were having prompted me to talk to the manager.  

On top of the bad service, the steaks were NOT THAT GREAT!  I've had better elsewhere...

You are essentially paying for crap service and crap food if you go here...AVOID.
