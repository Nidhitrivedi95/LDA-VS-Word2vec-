kz7O0_o6WrDQk1Kl8dKeHQ I rate this a 3.7 rounded up to a 4. Came here the other night for happy hour. The pros: the drink selection as well as the wine selection was great! Another pro their happy hour menu items are very substantial compared to other restaurants. From the happy hour menu, we got the Kung pao cauliflower, fruitti de mare, salami board and also got other appetizers that weren't on hh: short rib dumplings and crab Mac n cheese. We ordered a lot thinking hh items would b super small but we were wrong!! They were huge portions! Everything was delicious!!! We had extra bread from the fruitti de mare and from the salami board which went amazing w the left over crab Mac n cheese! They should seriously add some bread to the Mac n cheese! Very good!

As my entree, I ordered the short rib since it was highly recommended w a side of brussels sprouts. This is where I was a bit disappointed hence the minus couple points. The short rib was very tender but soooo salty!! The first bite w the glaze made me cringe. Way too much salt in the glaze sauce. So after wiping the sauce from the short rib, it wasn't as salty but needless to say I was disappointed w this dish especially reading rave reviews on yelp. And the brussels sprouts were super salty too. 

So overall the atmosphere, service and all the appetizers were amazing and worth trying.
