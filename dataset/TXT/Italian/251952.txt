vrpW_ZIjHvsAX3ByyeHjCA Could not even give this establishment a complete try. We went in for an early dinner. Yes, we were greeted by a host / server / bartender. When I stated we had never been here before, the reply was a tad sarcastic being "We've been here 22 years.".  Well, then why not SELL your establishment and tell us about your Happy Hour Specials / Drink Specials / Soup of the Day / Dinner Specials etc. etc.

Nothing on the menu stood out as something to try. Especially if the staff can't be bothered to suggest their best sellers. 

Won't be going back.
