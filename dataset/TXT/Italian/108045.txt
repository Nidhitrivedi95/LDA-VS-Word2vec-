FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A When I come to Vegas I try my best to stop here. If you love pasta then this place is for you. You can make your own pasta from choosing the noodles, protein, sauce, and vegetables. This location in particular is okay. My food had to be redone because it was made wrong and the toilet in the bathroom was leaking water all over the floor when I was there. However, it is a must try.
