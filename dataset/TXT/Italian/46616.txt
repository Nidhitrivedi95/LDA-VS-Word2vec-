8qNOI6Q1-rJrvWWD5Btz6w I can only recommend foods like pizza, Stromboli and their sandwiches (they have amazing breadsticks too). The dinners here are inconsistent, often bland and I suspect they overuse microwave ovens. The atmosphere is also nice, but I wouldn't recommend anything other a night of beer and pizza here.
