sT6KKMATRTiNSJ896D7l2w pizza by the slice is great, and the chicken tenders were pretty tasty as well. we are from Jersey and this was pretty close to NY pizza which is hard to come by down here. nice atmosphere, lots of Tv's to watch sports while you eat. wait staff was pleasant and service was timely. we have gone back again since our first visit.
