DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q I purchased the yogurt parfait with granola while awaiting a flight. I have eaten numerous parfaits over the years, and this had to be the best. The yogurt was neither sweet nor tart, the fruit was abundant and fresh, and the granola had great texture and crunch. It really hit the spot.
