0VOh4VIq13oFburRU9gddw Great pizza!  We've only ever done takeout and I think we've only been there on weekends but from what we've seen it seems like there needs to be a manager there at all times. Perhaps it's the weekend rush, but idk. Staff yelling at each other and making a scene in front of all the customers. But --- great pizza!
