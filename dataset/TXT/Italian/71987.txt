cbddL2q8uRA38RwycB0FJg Seat yourself in the back.... Only one server/bartender from 2-4:30 pm.... But good service regardless....fried ravioli was good.... Meatballs ok... Chicken rissoto was delicious....chicken eggplant parm was fried....( just to give a heads up)....lemon bar is very sweet( but good).  Carrot cake yummy....1 dessert is enough to feed 2!  Discounts for upmc family house guests..... It started raining and the manager offered to drive us back to family house when we asked to call a taxi... Great service for a good price.... Definately would recommend!
