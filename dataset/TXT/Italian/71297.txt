C63sF-wG4f1doMIMv2qvOg I went here last Sunday night with my boyfriend. We loved it! The food was so GREAT. I had the gnocchi, and he had pizza. We also ordered the bread which was also delicious. We wanted to order dessert as well, but they told us the kitchen was closed. That's the reason for only 4 stars. The service was pretty bad. They seated us, and then ignored us until we got up and asked a waitress to take our order. When someone finally came over to our table, she was pretty rude. But, overall the food was very yum, so I will definitely be back!
