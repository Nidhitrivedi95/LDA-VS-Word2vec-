Went here for lunch.  They have a decent priced lunch special that includes salad.

I got the meatballs with marinara.  Was pretty good.  Not sure if the sauce is authentic -tasted like they added some sugar to it.  Of course things with extra sugar always taste good.

Not bad for lunch - get a special
