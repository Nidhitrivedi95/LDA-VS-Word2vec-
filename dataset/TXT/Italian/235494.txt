TVYJx5iUkLJFiuiXc8rxEQ I've lived in Phoenix for a year and have yet to find a pizza place worth talking about (I'm from Chicago...nothing compares).  I decided to give this place a try last night.  It was delicious!  I loved the atmosphere...had an upscale-ish décor but not too yuppie to make you feel uncomfortable for wearing jeans (our server had on a black tee shirt and a baseball cap.  The server was very personable, we never had empty drinks, and knew his way around the menu, which was great, as we had never been there before.  We got the Caprese for an app, and since my bf and I have opposite tastes in pizza, we each ordered our own so we could get what we wanted and have leftovers.  We could tell it was starting to get really busy, and a line was forming out the door, but the server made sure to stop by often, and not make us feel rushed as we sat for a few minutes finishing our beers.  Their ingredients were fresh and more than you can get at most pizza places (an awesome variety of cheeses to choose from, and everything from regular veggies to shrimp or salmon!).  For 2 people our bill ran just under $60, which was totally reasonable for an app, drinks, and 2 pizzas.  I will definitely be returning and recommending to my friends!
