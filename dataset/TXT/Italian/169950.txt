MtvN8vMiKcLkkz_tCvBx3g Came here during restaurant week a couple of weeks ago. The restaurant itself was very nice. The hostess seated us upstairs (ladies in heels be careful). Our waiter was pleasant. I had the gnocchi for the appetizer and it was delicious. My dining companion had the crab cake which he enjoyed. The main course is where things started to go left. I order the lamb shank with mushroom risotto. It was pleasing to the eye but the taste was too pungent and overwhelming so I switched out for the penne with vodka sauce. The penne was better than the lamb but not the best penne Ive had. My dining partner had the salmon, which he stated was just ok. For desert we had the cheesecake which was pretty good. Overall the food was just ok, with the exception of the appetizers. Will only visit again if I'm in the area.
