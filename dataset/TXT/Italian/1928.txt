-L88B-PrtzwujhLuYc2k_g I came here with a couple of friends before the Lady Gaga concert.  The restaurant is huge, so it was one of very few that had reservations open near the ACC when I was making the reservation the night before the concert.  I arrived with one friend and told them I had a reservation.  They sat us in the back dining area, which was much quieter than the front of the house which had a large bar and a lot of people there for after work drinks, so it's very noisy.  

$60 + tip for a salad, pasta and a drink.  Not a bad price....if the food had any flavour.  The caprese salad literally tasted like nothing.  I don't know how else to describe it.  It was so bland.  The rigatoni bolognese wasn't too bad.  You get a decent size portion, and I was certainly full after my meal.  For the price I would have hoped for homemade pasta, which this definitely wasn't.  White sangria was okay.  It tasted more like juice than a wine drink.  

Although I wouldn't choose to come here for a nice date, this place serves a purpose: it's great for tourists, it's great for large groups, it's nearby union and the ACC if you're checking out a show, and takes reservations.  Because it's a tourist trap, it's definitely overpriced IMO, but if I wanted to make a reso to have dinner before another event at the ACC I would consider coming here again.
