VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w I called in a pasta order ahead.  I tried two dishes.  The chicken parm and one other dish.  The sauces were tasty but a bit on the salty side as the other reviews have mentioned.  AND I LOVE SALT!!

I don't know what it was but the staff (owner and cook) were both very nice but for some reason I felt awkward in that place like I was an unexpected guest.  Then again, I'm a younger, sharper dressed, fine watch, imported car kind of American boy and this strip mall isn't in the part of town that makes you all warm and fuzzy inside.. It wasn't enough to turn me off but I did feel weird being in there.

The food was good overall with the exception of being really salty.  At least it isn't bland and has flavor.  

I will surely give them another shot and try the pizza...
