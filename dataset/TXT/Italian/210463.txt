qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ My family and I came because I saw that this was the best pizza in AZ according to Yelpers. Pizza was five stars. I tasted both the regular and Sicilian variations. The crust is really well done for both styles but I like the regular/thin crust better. The sauce and cheese mesh well with the toppings and the crust. The cheese sticks are awesome and the garlic knots are decent. Only reason I didn't rate a five is because they forgot to give us our garlic knots, side of ranch dressing, and the plates, we had to ask for that stuff. I'll come back though.
