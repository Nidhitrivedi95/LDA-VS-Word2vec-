qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg OPA!" is a Greek word that is heard often in the celebration of life!!  We need the word for AWESOME food!!  

This place rocks!!  The atmosphere is quiet and comfortable with pictures of Greece on each of the tables.  Service is spot on and the Owner is usually there to check on the newbies and give them a 15% off coupon on the next visit. 

You MUST have the Saganaki, fried Greek cheese with a lemon brandy sauce eaten on pita,  oh my!  Yummy! The Greek trio is a great way to try a few of the Greek dishes they have, my fav is the Masouka, almost like a shepherds pie but better. 
 
The pomegranate chicken is marinated overnight and is to die for, super tasty.  
All of their dishes are made on site from scratch and you can tell....really great food.  

I think this place is one of my new favorites - OPA!!!!
