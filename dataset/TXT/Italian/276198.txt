ydSiR7YyALkmmACVNtXzhg This review is specifically for this gem that saved me in my new job... I recently got hired in the area, and as an event planner for all the functions we host, people told me how they have tried Italian catering places and food was not good at all!  So I had a lot of work to do to find a local spot that's great and can impress my colleagues. 

I got a flyer in my mail and it looked proper, I contacted them regarding their lasagna and pasta, and they were very quick to help. 

I ordered their Meat Lasagna, Vegetarian Lasagna, and Eggplant parmigiana with a chickpea salad, and pasta salad. 

I ordered for 30 people, and let me tell you something, their prices are very reasonable and the food was enough for all, we even had left overs and everybody fell in love with the lasagnas and eggplant parmigiana. The salads were perfect, and the chickpea salad is great for any vegans or Vegetarians. The main meals are great for vegetarians but not vegans.

I ordered as well an assorted sandwich platter, that comes with chicken, turkey, prosciutto, and a vegetarian. They were all on focassia bread, and holy smokes this bread stayed ALL DAY FLUFFY, and not hard like these other restaurants that you go to, people were having them at the end of the day and their teeth weren't breaking like other focassia bread, and we ordered a lentil salad, and it was perfect, great for vegans too. 

They also didn't take charge us delivery charge unlike subway who is actually across from us and charged us $20 delivery charge!!!

Their desserts are great, cannelloni are amazing, so are their cupcakes, and tiramisu. 

Honestly for corporate catering they are great and food is clearly fresh.
