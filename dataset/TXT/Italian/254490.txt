VWR1zQYVyHAFRcF1acKczA I enjoy local business.  I went to get a buffalo chicken wrap yesterday and the place seemed dead.  I was concerned about how good the food was even though the menu looked spectacular.  I was surprised on the quality that came out of the kitchen.  I munched down the wrap which was awesome and I was hungry for seconds- not due to actual hunger but because it was so dang good.  Im ordering a pizza today.  Lets see how it comes out.
