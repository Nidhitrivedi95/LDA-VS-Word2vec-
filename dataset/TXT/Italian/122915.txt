HhPVzZYQI-akaXRK_A4dKQ I was in Lawrenceville and was looking at local eats and came across Del's. I was further intrigued by seeing that it had been on Restaurant impossible so we headed over for lunch.

The decor is nice with a big mural on the outside and a couple off-street parking spots. We walked in past the decently big bar toward the first dining room. Looked nice and trendy.

I ordered the California chicken salad with avocado crusted chicken. My fiance ordered the sausage and pepperoni panini. We both got waters and were offered lemon which was a nice touch.

We got some soft italian bread that was unfortunately served cold but it was tasty and soft. While we were waiting for our entrees our server asked us if we wanted more and we did. We got individual butter pats with our bread.

Our food came out and my salad looked beautiful in almost a Cobb salad display. The tomatos were coated in some sort of oil and they were not my favorite part of the salad. The bacon was really crisp and tasty and there was plenty of food to go around. My fiance's panini was a gigantic portion but he said it tasted like a mediocre pizza since it was too big to close and eat as a sandwich. He was only able to eat half and we took the other half home. The fries were more like potato wedges and these were very good. They brought us out an extra side of dressing and ketchup to dip the fries in promptly.

Our server was very good and refilled our waters in a sufficient amount of time. 

Overall I would give this place a B- but would probably come back here to try some more of the italian specialties.
