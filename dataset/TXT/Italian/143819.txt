jTnD_YpFIeUzhopfuvKpvA I had high hopes for this restaurant as there are not a lot of dining options in the Anthem area however, I was disappointed.   We went there with our two small children, which we thought would be fine as we looked up the menu online and saw that they have a kids menu.  When we got there we asked for juice or milk for our 3 year old daughter to drink.  The server told us they did not have either and that "most people don't bring their kids there".  I felt that was a slightly rude comment to make considering we did bring our kids there.  He finally found some orange juice at the bar which he served our 3 year old in a pint glass.  They did not have kid appropriate cups.  I think if you have a children's menu, which specifies for children "under 8", you should provide a cup that a child under 8 can drink out of.  The restaurant was out of veal!  This is ridiculous considering half of the menu options include veal.  The service was slow even though we were the only table in the whole restaurant from 5pm until 6:30 on a Saturday night.  The eggplant parmigiana was extremely greasy as was the lasagna.  The chicken francese was bland and the marinara sauce was nothing spectacular.   Very disappointed.  The one good thing was the bread and olive tapenade.
