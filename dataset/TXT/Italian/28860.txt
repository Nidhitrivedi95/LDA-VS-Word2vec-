I know I ate pasta with shrimp here, now I feel like going back for deserts that I never got to try. Appetizer as well. Feels so authentic, by far one of the nicest looking restaurant I've been to in Toronto. Felt like stepping back into time. Looking forward to trying risotto porcini and rigatoni romani. From so little italian restaurants I have tried in Toronto, this one by far takes the cake, and although I haven't been to too many, from the looks and sounds of it on here, it seems justified.
