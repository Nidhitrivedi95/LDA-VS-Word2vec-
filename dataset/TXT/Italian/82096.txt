DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw Made reservations because someone in our party was craving Italian food. Walked in and promptly greeted by a friendly female and taken to our table and given a wine list. Once we said we did not plan to order wine the demeanor of our server changed. We each had a mixed green salad that was very good and we each had a different entree. Out of the three of us, none of us were incredibly pleased with our food. My spaghetti carbonara was dry, the ravioli was ok and so was the lasagna. Really disappointed because this restaurant had good reviews.
