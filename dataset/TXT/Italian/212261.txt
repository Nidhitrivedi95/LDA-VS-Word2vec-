r4HkiC71nB9k8Fe8zIORFQ Ordered through Eat24 for pickup. Service was fast. You ordered just a regular pepperoni and one of their White Truffle pizzas. (I am obsessed with truffle anything, especially fries). I can now say my life is complete because I had this amazing pizza. It is mostly cheese and truffle with a small amount of their red sauce on a nice crispy-on-the-outside-soft-and-airy-on-the-inside crust. You have to try this pizza.
