fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ Went here for Mothers Day I have been many times with my family. Macaroni grill isn't anything special just an Italian chain restaurant. They were pretty busy we had 8 people in our party they gave us one loaf of their bread to start because the kitchen was so backed up they also couldn't find the balsamic vinegar to add to the olive oil for the bread. After about 25 minutes they finally found it, the bread is always good and fresh though. 

I got Carmela's chicken for my entree. It was rigatoni with chicken and mushrooms in a Marsala cream sauce which was pretty good for a chain restaurant. My uncle makes the absolute best Marsala and have never had one that comes close. I still do love chicken Marsala even if my uncle doesn't make it. 

My advice is if you are expecting some incredible Italian good look somewhere else. This is a big chain restaurant though it isn't terrible it's pretty basic.
