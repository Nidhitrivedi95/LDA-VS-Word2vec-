oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw Only 3 stars because of service.  Food was 4 1/2 stars  
Service was typical of every restaurant we visited in Vegas. Terrible. But the food more than made up for it. (the fact we were on an expense account and not paying for it ourselves certainly helped!)
Ordered a pizza for an appitizer. One of the best pizzas I have ever had. I'd you go - you MUST order the pizza
Wine list was great and they have some decently priced bottles which was not typical of many of the Vegas restaurants we visited.  
Green lasagna was really good and the Osso Bucco was tender and flavorful. Love the drizzle of horseradish over it. 
Would definitely go again - as long as it is on an expense account!
