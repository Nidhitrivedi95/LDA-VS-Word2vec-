w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q The best lunch specials bar none. They have recently renovated the interior. The service is perfect here. Food came out quick. If you have never been here the lunch special is probably the best deal that exists. They recently must have slightly modified the offer it doesn't include the dessert any more but it's still a good deal. I had the swordfish which was perfect. It came with split pea soup one of my favorites and as good as it gets. They give you homemade bread as well to nibble on. You also get a side item. Had the green beans also perfect. I realize why they cut the dessert no one can eat all this. The price is great at slightly over $20.
