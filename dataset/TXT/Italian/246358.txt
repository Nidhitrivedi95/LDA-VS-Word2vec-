uzpdcxvlKx5BuoWU3NRHbA A learning experience! I can't really speak to the food because I don't know that I've ever had Sicilian-style before, and it seems unfair to compare it to other italian food I've had (I will say it was delicious and rich and I left feeling way too full...they use much more oil and sauce than I'm used to). What I really enjoyed was how knowledgable and helpful our server was! He explained things in a way that didn't make me feel like an idiot, which led to me asking more questions and finding out even more! I learned that I like rosé (I'd been misled in the past to believing they are all sweet - they are not!), that it's acceptable to say bruSHetta in America (even though the italian pronunciation is bruSKetta), and that what I've always known as chicken piccata is called chicken piccante in Sicily, which I still don't totally get because it's not spicy? Anyway, if my experience with the staff hadn't been so great, this place wouldn't be as high on my list to try again. What a delight to not be treated like a clod when my wine inexperience is on display!
