uEqkWCzfywBb8hCHhTquIA I ordered a calzone from the pizza section of the menu and they didn't bring me a pizza, they brought me a calzone.  I'm not sure why they put a calzone in the pizza section if it's not a pizza.

Everything there is overpriced, basically twice what it should cost.  $18 for a calzone with no side, or anything else?  It should be $9.  

$28 for Linguine?  I'm not sure how they justify these prices.

We came with 8 people, and they put us at a 6 seat table.  Instead of moving another table over, they just put cramped us into the 6 seat table.

They don't refill your water glass, they just put a bottle of water on the table, and when that's all used up, guess what?  They don't bring over more water.  Look, if you're going to charge this much for food, and include the gratuity, the bare minimum you can do is give us water.

The windows should be tinted, they're way to bring making it hard to see the people across the table in contrast to the bright light behind them.

And the handicap parking space is not next to the front door.  Why even bother having a handicap parking space if you're going to put regular parking closer to the door than handicap parking?

Okay, now for some positives.  There's nothing wrong with the food it's self, it tasted like average pizza, salad, and calzone.  Everything was clean, the tables and chairs, and everything was clearly built of high quality materials.  And even though the wait staff didn't refil out water, there was no problems other than that, they were friendly.  And it was someone's birthday and they gave them a desert for free.

Really my main complaint is the price.  That $22 Stracciatella pizza, and that $22 Salumiera Pizza.  No those are not a family size pizza, they are not 16 or 18 inches.  Nope they are 10 inch pizza for $22 plus tax and tip.  If you get a drink, you could easily end up paying $60 for 2 people to have a lunch.
