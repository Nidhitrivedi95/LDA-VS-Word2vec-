EtLmuDIMsBCmqdgpysz60Q La Strada is located on East Fourth.  It's features Italian and Mediterranean fare.  The prices are high and the atmosphere is trendy. The service is great and there's never any wait (in fact, a couple I know likes to go there for that reason alone).

FOOD.  They start you off with warm bread and dipping olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The bread tasted like it was very fresh, and I ate it all without any concern of spoiling my appetite.  I ordered a Spinach salad, which came with more balsamic, goat cheese, candied pecans and prosciutto.  Conceptually it was good, but  the ratio of spinach to everything else (including the dressing) was too high.  They needed to accessorize that spinach more.    I then ordered the vegetable kabobs.  Two skewers with Onions, Zucchini and Squash served on top couscous with more veggies and chick peas.  The veggies were well cooked and seasoned, and all was served with a side of this delicious sweet tomato topping.   A most excellent healthy, light menu choice.

Price - the salad was $11.  The kabobs were $15.  Value assessment: Too much coin for what I got. It was good, but not $26 good. 

SERVICE: I went in and sat at the bar, as I was rolling solo.  The bartender took my drink order and presented me with a menu, but there was some confusion as to who was actually my server. I ordered a salad from the bartender after getting her attention, and then my server came over to take my entree order.  Once the server figured out that he was taking care of me, the service was EXCELLENT.    

In summary, this place is great if you're looking for a place near the Q without much wait... and the food and service are above average, but not quite worth what you'll pay.
