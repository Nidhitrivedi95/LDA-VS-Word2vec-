g9iIBuh-g4ld3w3kUWLMqw If you haven't been to this place in the last few months, give it another try. RCP used to be a "only go if you're drunk and won't notice the crappy, crappy food" kind of place. Now they have new everything, and it's a whole different place. Great pizzas, craft beers, a ridiculously glorious wine list that makes me happy in my face. To top it off, they now have delicious, interesting options you won't find anywhere else (Beef Heart Tartare, anyone?) and isn't crazily overpriced, like a lot of places downtown. It's definitely worth checking out.
