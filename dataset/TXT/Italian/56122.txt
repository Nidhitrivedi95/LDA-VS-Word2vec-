aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw Ever since I saw Costa Di Mare on the Travel Channel with Andrew Zimmern food show I wanted to try. I was in Las Vegas for a trade show and our company had a dinner there. We had a party of 14 and were seated in a beautiful private room. Our group were served the $170 level per person dinner not including the drinks. The wine and drinks flowed through out the night and the bill was over $3000 before tip. We were served the following 

Starters
Burratta with at least 5 choices of bread and bread sticks. The Burratta wad soft and creamy almost like butter.

Grilled langostine and octopus the langostine was excellent like a skinny lobster but the octopus was soft and flavorless

Lobster Penne pasta was perfect with the pasta more on the al dente side with cuts of lobster in a cream sauce. 

John Dory fish wad the best of the meal light and delicate. 

Grilled steak was very rare had a faint flavor of rosemary was under seasoned. 

Dessert was a small light donut with gellato and a vanilla mousse. 

Service was excellent. Located in the Wynn was not completely full on last Tuesday night.
