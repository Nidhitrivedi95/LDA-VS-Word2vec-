fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I've been craving ramen and yelp had lead me to this place. I'm glad it did. I came here for lunch and had their ramen and California roll lunch special. The ramen soup was so flavorful and perfectly cooked! I'm still craving it right now. The California roll was fresh and a great portion as well.
I can't wait to come back and try more things on their lunch menu but you better bet I'll be ordering that ramen lunch special sooner than later!
