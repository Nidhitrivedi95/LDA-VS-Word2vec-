LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw Oreganos is our favorite spot for date nights, girls night, anything! The food is delicious and we love the atmosphere. We have always had great customer service. I recommend the "Alfredo the dark" which is spicier than a normal alfredo pasta but so delicious! For dessert try one of their pizza cookies! You can't be disappointed with either of those! Also, heads up that their portions are big so you can share between 2 people or have yummy leftovers!
