Longer Story

I received a watery funky unknown flavor of iced tea and I knew things would decline. The dining room was very loud with music but it was mostly but not all sounds of the forty's I suspect. The restaurant didn't seem busy as it only had a few tables seated but it might have taken about a half hour to prepare a salad and the sandwich we ordered and another half hour for the server to return.

I receive my salad and the greens were fresh and good and I will go on to say the blue cheese tasted like a good blue cheese. The turkey however was very dry chalky white meat that lacked flavor and the house made concoction of cranberry relish was something I didn't relish . It was lumpy thick and creamy and was hard to identify a taste because it was not good to me. I could not eat it. So I ate very dry flavorless turkey on wet plain greens and the only flavoring I got was from the blue cheese. Our server was walking around like in slow motion and never made it over to check on us.

My husband tasted my dish and just like last week he said, "WOW that's Bad! Then he tried his dish. He also had a plain green salad without dressing. He said the ciabatta bread was good but his sandwich was tasteless. I tried a tiny bite of the chicken. It was cooked nice but was oddly tasteless. I wouldn't say his plate was awful it just wasn't tasty.

We finished and waited for a LONG TIME for our server to give us the check.

My review is based on just one lunch visit.
