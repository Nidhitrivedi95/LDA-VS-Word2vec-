7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ We were recommended this place by several people and excited to try. Upon showing up the Menu looked great however our server Moriah was terrible. We ordered a few pizzas and a salad, food was excellent. Our server couldn't get it together, not once did she come back to fill the water glasses, bring replacement silverware or for that matter even take the order. We caught her outside chatting with her chronies and washing windows behind the teapot while we were her only table. She wasfast with the check lol. 5 star food 1 star service
