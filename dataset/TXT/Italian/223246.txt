SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING FOOD!!! Everything on the menu is DELICIOUS! The service is great and the owner is AMAZING! Prices are very good, best Pizza in Vegas yet! Try there Stromboli's, Bistro Salad and Sliders; it is to die for! Basically try everything on the menu when you get a chance, because you will be surprise by the amount of flavors in each bite. The food is ADDICTIVE, so be careful ladies!  Will definitely come back and would recommend this to EVERYBODY!
