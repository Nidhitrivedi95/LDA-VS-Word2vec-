GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q Chicken salad sandwich is very good. If you come here starving you're going to have to probably buy two of whatever you get, because 1 - it's delicious, and 2- its a modest size. The menu at DeFalco's for example is much broader, and they have larger portions. I had the Italian sandwich and it was good as well.

As several have noted, this place looks like someone kept the dust covers on everything for 30 years and then decided to reopen it again. There is a lot more potential for this place, but they seem to be sticking to what has worked for the past 30+ years. While nostalgic it also seems a little lazy. 

Bottom line is eat here.
