ow3oP3cfmhlfmSsGaXe25Q Pros:
- Best service, the servers were so attentive. We originally sat outside but it started raining, so they stationed outdoor umbrellas above us but it wouldn't cover us completely so they helped up move inside. 
- The tomato, prosciutto, mozzarella, basil appetizer was so good with the bread
- I had the risotto and it was good but a lot and very rich.  Luckily I got to eat my bf's red sauce seafood  pasta (I don't remember the name) and it was good. 

Cons:
- none
