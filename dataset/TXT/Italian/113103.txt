GfHBBCi6LJAPVFTcCwu9aQ This is a simple addendum to my original review. Came here for the UYE, and like last time, Casey was a great host, and recommended me a glass which, once it had some time to breathe, was smooth and complex simultaneously. "Talladega Nights" was replaced by some random movie starring Cameron Diaz and Ewan McGregor (anyone?) and a good number of folks were there for Wino Wednesdays, hanging out and having a good time. Very Cheers-ish, but with wine glasses. No REO Speedwagon on the stereo this time, though. Alas. 

But seriously, the scene at Centro is so non-pretentious it's hard to believe they actually have wine here. Me? I seriously would be a regular here if I lived closer.

Also: this time, I engaged in some food-eating. Yes! The complimentary apps (traditional bruschetta and one piece of toast with some goat cheese) were good and my chicken panini with sweet potato chips were mighty fine and tasty. Genuinely friendly service, which given some other recent experiences in this city, was definitely appreciated. 

All in all, a definite hidden gem in central Scottsdale. 

Without the "Scottsdale".
