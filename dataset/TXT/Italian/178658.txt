NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ Crazy expensive, poor quality.

That $30 veal parm?  Comes with no sides.  Expect to pay $6-10 add'l for a side.  And it's just ok.

The calamari is horrible.

The best part of the experience is the R-Rated movies on the TV's so you occasionally get to see a topless woman.

Skip this dump.
