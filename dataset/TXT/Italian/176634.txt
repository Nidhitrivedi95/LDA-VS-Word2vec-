nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ My wife, daughter and I came to Trattoria Reggiano to give it a try after some friends recommended it to us. I would have to say that this place is great. You can tell they are still getting come grand opening details figured out but the food and service were excellent! I have to make sure to mention that Vito the manager went above and beyond to make sure our experience was pleasant. It's not easy going out with a 15 month old and I felt welcome here. I hope they keep it because I plan on returning. Oh and before I forget the meatballs were unreal!
