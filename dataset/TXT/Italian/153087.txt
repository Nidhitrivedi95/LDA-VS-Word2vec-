KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg 3 stars partly because this place gets sooooo much hype and we waited an hour to get in, only to find that the pizza was just a bit more than avg. One pizza we ordered had arugula on it and it was closer to a salad than a pizza. It wasn't bad but wouldn't be the first place I would go back with so many amazing choices on ossington.
