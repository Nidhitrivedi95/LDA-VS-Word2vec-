u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Postino will forever be my favorite wine bar outside of California , I am 100% convinced of this fact. Having lived in the PHX area permanently now for a few years, I can honestly say that Postino has set the standard on the bruschetta bar.. and it is high very hard to find one that compares! I have not found any other place that even comes close on the bruschetta variety and taste scale . For $14 you can get four different bruschettas that are generous and on the perfectly, freshly baked bread.. not soggy and not too crisp! I actually don't have a favorite one and I like that Postino has a seasonal bruschetta now that changes from the usual. It's always fun as a group to order all of the bruschettas amongst a few boards and sample them all! The cheese board is always good; the salads you can't go wrong with , either. Monday's and Tuesday's after 8pm, bring your date or your friends and $20 gets you bruschetta and a bottle of vino! Or how about brunch for $5 mimosas or sangria on the weekend ? I've also ordered catering from Postino and they always get it correct! Sometimes I just NEED that amazing bruschetta variety in my home for entertaining ! This is always my favorite place for a date night with my new hubby. I introduced him to wine, ( okay not really!!)  and thus, Postino Arcadia being in my old pre-marital hood, we cultivated some of our 3 years together right here in Arcadia at this very Postino.. and if wine isn't your thing, don't worry, they have a great selection of brews! After wine there are lovely, yummy desserts or for brunch , Postino offers cappuccinos and lattes. The patio is dog friendly and the ambience is all lit dimly with candlelight and hip beats for your sipping. Since this is about my 9000th review for Postino, I think it's safe to say, I rate it on the highest PHENOM level!
