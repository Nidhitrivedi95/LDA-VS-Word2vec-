hTsZSiftorNUFb1VaHCHHg Good selection for a bar atmosphere but higher priced. Bruschetta tasty but a bit on the flat side. Staff very helpful, knowledgeable and attentive.decor rustic and comfortable. Pizza good and hot with great tasting crust.  Drink menu was fun but we didn't drink. Cocktails and wine a bit high priced but beers are at $7. We'd come back.
