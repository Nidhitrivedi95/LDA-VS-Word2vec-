Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag Food was mediocre and, even though our waiter was nice and attentive, he was so dang animated that it grew tiresome. He greeted us with what seemed like a song and dance show. However, the low star rating only reflects the food. The linguine was a bit flavorless and the pasta had a texture similar to whole wheat pasta, so I didn't really enjoy that. The chicken was nice and tender and flavorful. We also got the appetizer mussels and bruchetta. Mussels was in a red sauce that I wasn't too fond of and they only have two small slices of bread to dip the sauce in. The bruchetta had a great flavor but I didn't like how the bread was so thin, the sauce ws quick to soak up the bread and sog it up. Prices here are pretty decent compared to other Vegas places, but it's not some place I'd crave for.
