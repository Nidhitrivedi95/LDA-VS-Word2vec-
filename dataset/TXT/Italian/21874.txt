3cbsPfoUUrysf-M8FI_0IA Excellent, casual restaurant.   Great, creative food, and a wonderful atmosphere.  The menu seemed a little light on choices, but it also seems that it changes frequently, so I can forgive that.  Nevertheless, there was something for everyone.  

The one thing that kept me from giving this place the full 5-star rating was that the corkage fee was a bit high at $6 per person.
