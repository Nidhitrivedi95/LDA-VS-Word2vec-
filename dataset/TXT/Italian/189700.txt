I've never been a huge fan of stuffed pasta but after having a friend make us dinner, I had to find out where this awesome pasta came from! 

A real gem of a place- I ran into the owner, a friendly man with plenty to chat about who knew his every other customer that came in. There were plenty of options for pasta (that was fresh kept frozen) with typical spaghetti or fettuccine at about $1.50 a serving, as well as various raviolis and agnolottis, reasonably priced, the mushroom one being a real winner for me.

When I went home and made it myself...pasta heaven :D 

Definitely not going to be able to buy store bought 'fresh' pasta after this haha
