ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg Stopped in about 1PM for lunch and the $5 pizza, drink & salad text special. The food was delicious as I've experienced at the Bell Road location but the service...was...so...slowwwwww and there were only about 6 tables occupied! The hostess finally came by after about 15 minutes and took my drink order. About 15 minutes later, Christine the waitress came and took my lunch order. After another 15 minutes I got my food, then had to wait another 15 minutes after finishing my meal to pay my check and get my change. The waitress was struggling a bit due to a wrist support she was wearing but over an hour for a slice of pizza and a salad seems excessive to me. Also, I did not find the restaurant to be as clean as the Bell Road location. I was sitting near a window and it was smeared and splashed with something. I'll go back because I love their food but I'll probably do carryout instead of eat in. Disappointed. I eat at the Bell Road location near my home several times a month and love it.
