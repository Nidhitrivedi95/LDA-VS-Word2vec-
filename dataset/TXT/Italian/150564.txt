They call this casual dining but it's far from casual.

The decor is sexy chic

I Try to keep away from this place when I'm training because the carbs are a delicious sin 

Huevos rancheros are traditional with a modern twist

Triple stack buttermilk pancakes, Vermont maple butter, vanilla cookie tuile. They are a fluffy, warm and melt in your mouth . 

cinnamon roll FrencH toast* are a sweet tooth's dream. caramelized bananas, cinnamon whipped

Found their weak spot.
The staff is a Lil uptight.  I don't think that they are allowed to smile. 

Tip: ask the host for a friendly waiter to kinda get them on their best behavior and treat you decent

Ladies please be ladies. Cover up. No bikini tops. Not allowed. They will then you away. Save your self the embarrassment . Besides no one wants tatas in their tator tots.
