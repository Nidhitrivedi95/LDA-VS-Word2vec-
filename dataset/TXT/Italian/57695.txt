aNYunG3j5zNJ4F0dQcZMyQ This place is amazing! Went here on Thursday to check out the new summer menu specials and it did not disappoint. We failed to make reservations but were offered a short wait time or the full service bar. Opted for the bar as I couldn't wait to get my mouth on a decent chianti - yum! We enjoyed squid ink seafood pasta, decadent lobster raviolis, and a strawberry cream dessert. Can't wait to be back!
