lu6IAy3HQaQytbKIAPh2EA Wednesday night 8pm - restaurant was busy; luckily I made reservations. 

Service seems to be lacking - perhaps understaffed.  I can see the effort is there though.  

The spoon was a bit dirty - had to request a new one; literally had to yell to get anyone's attention.  

They ran out of the dish I wanted (lasagna and then the mushroom raviolli)

Had to ask for bread after 45 minutes since arrival (It didn't come with any olive oil, just butter)

Pasta was very good though.

Perhaps I had high expectations from the reviews, but it didn't meet expectations to be a "classy" restaurant
