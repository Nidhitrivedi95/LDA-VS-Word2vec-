9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg The food is OK-I was really excited about the mozzarella bar. But that's nothing spectacular.

I've been on three occasions now-and only keep returning because they give us free dinners because the service is so bad. In fact the last time the waitress said "we have a special free dessert we give customers when we provide bad service..." Imagine,  a desert dedicated to their bad service! LOL

I've been served appetizers before mains, beverage orders never arriving, and other peoples food. Our checks have been wrong, and even when corrected still wrong. I've been ignored for up to half an hour at a time, and managers promised to adjust tabs and then forget to do so.

Seriously, I am a fussy diner from a food quality perspective, but I have great compassion for waiters. It was not us being bitchy, it was definitely a poorly managed staff. 

I still have yet another free dinner offered, but I don't think I'll bother to go back. The food is not worth the aggravation, and in general it is a rather loud restaurant, which is not something I prefer.
