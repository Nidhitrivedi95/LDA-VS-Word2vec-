3qTSOuJ-ZyU1L7o62KHSIg Our friends in Toronto raved about this place, and they live in the neighbourhood.  This summer we were there for a visit, and loved wandering around Leslieville.  

While walking we noticed a large paper mache nose outside this otherwise unmarked building.  This was it!

Inside was PACKED!   We got a little table for 4 and despite it being really busy, it was kind of cozy and nice, it wasn't overly loud and felt really comfortable.

The service was really great despite being so busy - its nice to see restaurants that can actually handle a crowd while maintaining good service. 

The food here is sort of like Italian tapas.  We ordered the meatball, involtini, grilled calamari, and a few other plates.   The involtini and meatball were amazing.  

This restaurant is a not to miss if you are heading to Toronto, or specifically in the Leslieville area.    I'm still craving the involtini months later.
