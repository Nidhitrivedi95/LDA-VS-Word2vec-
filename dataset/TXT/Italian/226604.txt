ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag Vero has come really far in a short time. It is not nearly as awkward as it had been in the past when they were first opening. The food is always incredible, you can't go wrong with any of your selections. 

A few months back we ordered a cheese and meat appetizer and there was honey made from blueberry flowers WHAAAAAT?? Delicious! I inquired where to get this honey and apparently it comes from the dishwasher's uncle's apiary. I guess what I'm trying to say is these people don't mess around with their ingredients. 

Don't ever go here if you are in a rush to go somewhere, they will probably make you late. Settle in and enjoy your experience at Vero.
