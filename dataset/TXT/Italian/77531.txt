cy3Or8iSsDOmHBBu2MwnOg I broke bread with my new employer at Toscana, it was like a being in New York with old school Italian Families. The space was small but awesome and the decor was unique. I started with a taste of red wine, it was ok, but ordered goose and tonic, I ordered the Kale Salad good, then followed with Mare: Lobster, shrimp, calamari, clams, mussels, scallops, imported linguini pasta, cherry tomatoes, peperoncino, garlic & white wine
