A7waf6G3cvnLfAqKeLL8DA One of the best meals we've ever had!

Dinner
Ambience:4.5/5 (rustic)
Service: 5/5 (when I dropped my napkin, it was immediately replaced without any prompting. I didn't even realize I had dropped it!)

Food: 5/5 
Crushes some of the Michelin starred chef run or critically acclaimed (NYT) restaraunts we've eaten at. 
What we had: bread knots, cured meats, cheese, preserves, rabbit pasta, lamb, cauliflower and artichokes. For desert we had tiramisu :) Every dish was very good to .... So good you'd be passing out from multiple foodgasms good.

Value: 4.5/5 
Pricey. But worth it!

Final word: So good my partner proposed we get married here (a few times)!
