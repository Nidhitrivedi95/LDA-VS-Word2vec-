oUvqwPJkorOnYZFKRt0oEg This is my favorite italian restaurant in Phoenix by far!  My favorite dish is the capricosa dish.  I've never seen that dish served anywhere else.  I typically order it with Chicken and Shrimp but sirloin and shrimp is also great.  I love small family owned places like this.  Even though I love how nice their new place is, I kinda miss the hole in the wall feel their old place had.  The owner is super cool.  He even made me a dish once per request that wasn't on the menu.  I got back from a trip from Italy and asked if he knew how to make some of these dishes.  If you ask the owner and eat in, they will make things that are non menu items.  Another favorite of mine is the Lasagna.  Its so good that I normally don't eat lasagna at all but I do theirs.  That's how good it is.  I think the only thing I ate there where I wasn't super impressed was their pizza.  I haven't had it in years and it was just once but it was okay.  Everything else though is amazing!
