UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w Greeted by a nice lady when my bf and I walked in. I didn't catch her name though. The place isn't very big, limited tables. There are a couple of TVs in there & filled with football stuff! definitely a place to hang out at for game nights. 

So we ordered a couple of things starting with the garlic knots. Myyyyyy goodness. These were amazing! By far the best I've had in Vegas. Came out hot & fresh & just amazing. Probably my favorite out of everything that we ordered. We got a large margarita pizza & with the check-in, it's $5 off! I'm not sure if I even liked margarita pizzas before today??? Lol but this pizza was soooo good! Hot, fresh, crispy crust, good flavoring. Idk what else you can really ask for. We also ordered zeppolis ,or however you spell it, to go. These were okay. I'm not sure if it was cos we took it to go? They weren't bad though. 

The nice lady always made sure to ask if we were okay, or if we needed anything, and made sure our waters were never empty. Really good customer service! 

Overall, definitely one of the best pizzerias in the valley. Will keep coming back! Even if it's quite a drive lol.
