G099MT9cwtwgdsR71JLp6w I love coming here and finding out that the menu has changed (always in a good way). It's kind of hidden and looks like it might be closed so you can almost always get a good table. The bread basket is one of the best in town too. The portions are a little smaller than most Italian restaurants, but that means you can try more dishes. Go here during farmer's market season for Saturday lunch. The paninis are awesome.
