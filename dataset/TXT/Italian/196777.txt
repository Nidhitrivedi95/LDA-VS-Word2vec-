pOhX1XjbBdPoO2Fyy8RGJg Geraci's offers, as far as I can see, the best traditional pizza in Cleveland and undoubtedly in Ohio. I can't say that it is the best pizza I have ever had, but it certainly is among some of the better local pizzerias I have been to. 

As others have said, the sauce is incredibly good. The dough is fresh and properly cooked. I wouldn't suggest straying away from getting a traditional pepperoni pizza. This is what they do best, and it is damn good. 

The first time I went there, I ordered a custom pesto pizza. Unfortunately, it did not turn out quite as lovely as a pepperoni pizza. It had a fishy taste and almost all of the bacon pieces had completely turned to char; I ended up returning it. I decided to give Geraci's another shot and went back for a large pepperoni. I was again impressed with the pepperoni pizza. 

I cannot comment on the quality of other items offered at Geraci's, but I can say that as far as a traditional pizza goes, Geraci's does a fine job.
