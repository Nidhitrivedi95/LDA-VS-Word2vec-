te-QMdSMQdjws6NnRexjJQ This is my dependable 'go-to' Italian restaurant when I'm in the area, and over the years I have visited often. The prices are reasonable, the food is always good, and the service is friendly and efficient.

I usually opt for a pasta dish, garlic bread on the side and a bottle of Peroni. This time, the waiter suggested I try a new local lager that they had in, an Edinburgh brew called Paolozzi (after the sculptor). Jolly nice it was too. 

The garlic bread wasn't quite as nice as I remembered - in my mind it was crusty slices and not the limp thick white slice that turned up, but no matter. It was tasty enough, as was the fettucine vongole (gotta love those vongoles!).

While you're eating, check out the mural on the wall and try to identify all the famous faces.
