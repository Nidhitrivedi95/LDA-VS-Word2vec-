cZAU9Gs-rIv8DvsVp3qUTw We ordered the small Buffalo Chicken pizza with a house salad and BBQ wings on the side. The first item that came out was the bread. It was very tasteful and light. That was a plus. The next items were the salad and BBQ wings. The house salad was... Ehh... Just a salad.... Haha. The BBQ wings were pretty good. I could tell that these wings were fried rather than over baked. I love fried wings! That is the second plus. The downfalls comes from the pizza. The cheese was so thick and caked on the pizza that it took away from the balance of the rest of the toppings. Oh and I had a nice long strand of dirty blonde hair weaved through the thick layer of cheese. Pretty funny and disgusting. Haha. The 2 stars mainly comes from the mediocre food. I don't regret giving this place a try; however, I won't be stopping by again.
