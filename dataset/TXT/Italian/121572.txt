hc81y_5FQjTiZcgqnY8vfQ I used to go out of my way to go to this Pizza Hut.  Recently, they can't seem to get an order right.  Pepperoni Lovers pizza should have spots where you see the crust.  The online app gives to a place to request special items, such as double extra sauce.  They don't read it.  I won't order online anymore.  In fact, I'm not going to this Pizza Hut anymore.
