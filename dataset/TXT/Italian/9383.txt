0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw This place needs another "$", IT'S EXPENSIVE!
My wife and I got a club sandwich, iced tea, root beer, and a bowl of chili.  Add 15% and it was over $32.00!
Great people and above average service though.  

LOL the next night we had chicken parm and pasta with meat sauce for four right down the street FOR FOUR PEOPLE for less!

Let me know when you get back from ridiculous with your prices.
