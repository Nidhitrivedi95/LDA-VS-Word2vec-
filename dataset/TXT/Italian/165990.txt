Mb4V2aPneclZZ8BfZUjWGA Had some dear relatives in the CLE  last weekend and decided on visiting the Cleveland version of Ken Stewart's famous Akron restaurants. Really enjoyed the "industrial/modern/freighter design of the restaurant. Very cool use of indoor/outdoor fire pits, lighting and window views that will only get better when the East Bank of the Flats returns to its glory in the next few years .Our server couldn't have been better. You appreciate impeccable timing when dining as a group. World class- Stuffed banana pepper appetizer, the small filet mignon and the sea bass. Had better-20 oz bone-in ribeye and edamame hummus app. Don't let the latter stop you. a great dinner awaits and the opportunity to have Ken and his beautiful wife (who happens to design the restaurants) stop by.
