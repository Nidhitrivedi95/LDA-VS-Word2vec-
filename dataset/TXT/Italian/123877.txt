Rainbow colors of gelato greeted me.  My ice cream parched system, cried "Yes, Yes!"  And suddenly I found myself with 2 scoops of savory, coconut gelato in a small cup in my hand and the soft creamy coolness sliding down my throat.

Expensive?  Sure . . .everything at the Venetian is.  But for this one moment . . . . .ice cream in hand, that I took to savor on the deck of the pool, it was worth it.  Even if it meant more time on the treadmill in the morning!
