epoEBSCz3Mh4X-vVvcioNA We went to this place on Saturday night for dinner with my sister and brother-in-law.  Glad I didn't pick it because it was not good at all.  The owner was a very cute guy from Milan and the place itself is very nice.  That's as far as my compliments can go!  Our waiter was very scattered and couldn't answer a question about one of the sauces.  I ordered the lobster bisque soup and the special, which was lobster ravioli.  When it finally arrived, my soup was very disappointing.  Not a shred or bit of lobster in the soup!  The taste was quite good, but to me it should have at least a few bits of lobster!   My ravioli was not very hot and there were a total of 4 very small ravioli's.  Nothing else was served with this except for the table bread.  I am not a big eater and so I was happy at least for the bread.  My husband ordered another special and his portion was small as well.  Even the pasta was skimpy!  Also, be sure to ask the prices for the specials.  They were very pricey for what you got!   We went upstairs to the bar for dessert and an after dinner drink.  Our waiter forgot about us and it was quite awhile before he remembered that we had gone upstairs...  I will say that the tiramisu was very good.  However, my Amaretto was served without ice and I'm not sure I even got a "shot".  On top of that we were overcharged on our bill for it.  Won't be going back again!
