GQAvKHDfuBws7312iIqX6Q Few things make me sadder than making this review:

I have been going to Buono's for over a decade now and it never failed to impress... 
When I was told there were new owners I was told the recipe's and cooks were all the same so I was optimistic (especially considering that it has been good since I was 16 years old and started going there *29 now*)

I have given them 3 chances now and each time it has gotten ruder and the food has gotten worse with every visit. 

If by any chance the owners/ coming managers read this page: Here are a few things that could have circumvented losing another loyal customer.

Specifically to the owner: 

If a customer shows you that they are being over-charged do NOT make the excuse that the "school kids" are changing the prices on the outside chalk board... After that, if they point out that the same price is on the menu above the register in green ink... do NOT double down that the school kids changed that price too!!!

To anybody in charge of the food:

1. The garlic knots were a welcome addition when they were first added to the menu and started out delicious but it is very clear that the dough for them is made far in advance and frozen which leaves them very stale and tasteless.

2. If a pizza is black on the bottom it should not be served.


As much as I have been frustrated I do hope they turn it around but I do not expect to be back again. I will really miss Buono's but I ate there so often that I am sure to lose a few pounds in the process.
