smBsHggLvIuABgntBvlYLw Cute place. Our first time here.  They start out by giving you fresh bread and olive oil w/balsamic vinegar for dipping.  Yum!  Rob had a bacon and pepperoni pizza,  had a meatball calzone.  Very good, light and fresh.  The place had a consistent flow of customers, which to me says something.  We defiantly will go back.
