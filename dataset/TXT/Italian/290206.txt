My cousin and I each opted for medium cups (5.25 vs La Paloma's 6.50), me - chocolate/lemon and her - cappuccino/pistachio.

OK, all were delicious, but let's get to the pistachio.  It was like no pistachio I've ever tasted, except the actual nut.  All other pistachio ice creams I've tasted had that acceptable, fake-pistachio taste.  This tasted like the actual roasted nut.  I swear I could taste the crispy skin of the nut.  It was amazing.  Try it.

NB  I preferred my lemon to the chocolate, and I'm a chocolate lover.
