OXrFWgoz533T8tMRemkiww Pasta is my second language. Eating pasta is my sport! 

With that said, I'm always hesitant to get gnocchi because it never seems to be cooked right. It's always gummy and gross. But the waitress assured me the gnocchi here was homemade and very delicious. I took her advice and was served an incredible plate of melt in your mouth light and puffy clouds of Italian magic! Need I say more? Ok I will.... 

The sauce also tasted delicious and definitely homemade. I was torn between getting the gnocchi or pasta vodka. I would have been totally satisfied with that choice as well. Thankfully, my friend ordered the pasta vodka and I ws able to steal away a couple bites of it. The sauce was fantastic! It was so creamy and had a hint of Parmesan cheese flavor. Cheese makes EVERYTHING better in my eyes (and mouth)! 

Our server was really fantastic and did a great job with input on our meals and also filling us in on some upcoming events. They're having cooking classes and wine pairing nights, which I'm totally into! Such a great way to get people in the door and eating, plus drinking! 

Very quaint and cute inside. I went there Thursday and had to hold myself back from not going there again on Saturday.  My pasta loving self will sure to be back soon though!
