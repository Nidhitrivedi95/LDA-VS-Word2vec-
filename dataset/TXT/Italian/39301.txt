7EtiFdHnoWwvC-8m8ixC1g Too legit, too legit to quit! The best thing about our extra large pepperoni pizza was the dough! Wow it was really awesome and I wish I could have another slice right now. The pizza came with a meh amount of pepperoni but that cheese and dough saved the whole pie. We ordered cheesy garlic bread that was pretty decent. 

Service was good for pick up. They were fast and 20 min wait for the pizza an hour before closing. Not too shabby. 

Overall I loved the pie and the all star was that dough! Wish there was more pepperoni. The cheese was so good and thick! Would come back again.
