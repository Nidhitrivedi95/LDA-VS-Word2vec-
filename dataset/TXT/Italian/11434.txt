0qet57CmMA5qUm6gPFUTpg The pizza is pretty overpriced here because it's in Caesars.
I would not recommend the pizza.  It's thin and soggy.  

If you're in the food court, you have better options like Earl's Sandwich or Phillips Seafood. 
Good luck since you're probably in Vegas reading this review.
