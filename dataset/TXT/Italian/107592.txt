FyKefsWq62xeXpje0Flcig Had dinner yesterday being a return customer, I will not be returning again. The calamari was tough, over cooked and freezer burned, and cold. I ordered chicken parmesan which was tough, dry and had no flavor, also came out not hot. These are not hard dishes to make, being Italian I look for quality Italian food. (This place is lacking in quality.) It will not be found here. Lastly instead of ordering a dessert and being disappointed again, I ordered an espresso. First of all the cup was not full the coffee was not made correctly, it was like mud and it wasn't hot at all.Very disgusted with the our whole dinning experience. I will not be returning.
