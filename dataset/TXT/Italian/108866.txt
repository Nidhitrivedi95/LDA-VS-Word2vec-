G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Gorgonzola cheese with raw honey and sliced pears were the start of a truly amazing meal. Life changing for sure! ! 
Then the chef had a lunch special of polenta under grilled shrimp and a chili oil that was to die for. 
The piece de resistance was the dessert. .. heavenly lemon ricotta cookies, chocolate chip walnuts and chocolate peanut butter cookies with a raspberry jam. I also had the orange mocha mio which was perfection. 
I can't wait to go for dinner. .. except for the next reservation is late October.  
Well done Giada.
