G3rk0dDROzpDdTugsnSDTw Stunning restaurant. The white / atmosphere very beautiful. The ceilings / hanging art - very cool. I came with my family on a saturday night. The waiters were attentive and the food was great - pizza / pasta / salads were all had. The pizza was actually top notch. The only downside was the wine list prices - a little on the steep side (no bottles under $50).
