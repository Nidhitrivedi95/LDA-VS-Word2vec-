qBXfNxSpo2_8cP_WHQRvOg Usually a very nice place to eat. I noticed they have raised their prices but hey what can you do? Waiters are always very nice and attentive. Only reason for 3 stars is I ate here On Saturday and underneath our table was a broken salt shaker, there was glass everywhere and I was wearing flip flops.... just kind of scary .
Ok update my server Carson was so great. Kept our glasses full, courteous, professional, welcoming. He was timely and efficient, promote him
