-7PX_FOoCwktlunImRyZdg Good thin crust pizza, and probably the thinnest I've ever had. We ordered green pointer and carbanaro. The spicy and sweet flavors went well with each other. I really love it. The center did become a little bit of soggy after a while, but the taste was still good. My friend loved both of them and din't notice the sogginess at all. I'm probably a picky eater. I discussed this with the chef and wondered wether that was due to too much sauce on it. He apologized and enumerated several possible reasons. It was really nice of him to cook a roman focaccia for me.  I'd love to come back to try other flavors.
