4LB4xtFAwfvJRachr6Eaxw We originally went here because a friend gave us a gift card for our anniversary. We were not disappointed. It's comparable to the famous Pizzeria Bianco, but better... because you don't have to wait 4 hours and you can order take out. The pizza is crisp and light. When you finish eating it you don't have to collapse on your couch and take a nap. The sausage and caramelized onion pizza is amazingly savory and to DIE FOR. My kids always get the pepperoni but I really enjoy the rosemary potato. I know it seems like an odd combination but it's delish (ask them to go light on the olive tapenade, though, unless you really love olives). The spicy chicken sausage pizza and cookies are also tasty. 

The pizza is extraordinary and will make you feel like you are ordering a $30 pizza, but the prices are super reasonable at about $10 per pizza. I HIGHLY recommend this place.
