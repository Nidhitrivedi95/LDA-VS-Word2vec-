JPmu9-2jd7nGIuTXEqT9zg My whole family loves this place.  My parents found this gem when they moved to the northern Solon area, and we have been going ever since.  The decor isn't the most modern, but the food more than makes up for anything lacking in the visual department.  They ALWAYS have tons of fresh fish and pasta specials and the garlic rolls (pizza twists) are delicious!

For several years, Gino, the authentic Italian owner (born in Italy), worked to upgrade the banquet space in the back to use for parties.  He was finishing up the makeover right around the time of our wedding (about a year ago).  My husband and I rented out one of the smaller rooms for our rehearsal dinner.  The food was delicious, family style, and reasonably priced.  I think we got out for around $35 per person for food and alcohol.  Gino and staff were very accommodating.

I always get something different, but you have to try the lobster ravioli if they have it on special!

To be fair to some of the negative comments, I haven't been back in a while as my husband and I have moved further south, so I cannot speak to the current state of the place.
