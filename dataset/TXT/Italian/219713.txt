SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg So my wife and I went with two other couples to herbs and Rye tonight. We went specifically for the happy hour. The service was bad but the food was decent. All was bearable until when the check came. We were charged tax and "automatic" gratuity based on the full price of what we ordered! Not the happy hour price! Based on what the bill should have been, we paid 30% gratuity for crappy service! This place has figured out how to advertise one thing then charging you more then the normal price! We know we weren't the only ones noticing this. Everyone had their phones out adding up their bills. The manager went to four other tables besides our trying to explain how the happy hour price isn't a deal. This is our last time at Herbs and Rye. We will spend our hard earned money at an honest place.
