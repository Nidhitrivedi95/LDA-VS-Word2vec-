TP6hgLCNGkqjFne9nCfaiA I mean who doesn't love walking into Fred's and eating lunch in the middle of Barneys...I've been twice and honestly had a great experience! amazing service and delicious food. Once for brunch - I had the prix fix brunch that includes a salad, brunch entree, drink, dessert AND coffee... for 24 bucks! not a bad deal....

second time I came was a little different - I strolled in with a friend and we had a boozy weekday lunch - he had the burger and I had the chicken salad...he ordered a manhattan which he exclaimed was the best one he's ever had and I had a delicious pinot grigio (micah I MISSSSS you!!) but the wait staff was the best! we made friends with them and chatted them up for almost two hours... they kept coming over and gave us cute places to go too... they were really sweet!!! 

Too bad its INSANELY overpriced like the Proenza Schoulers!!
