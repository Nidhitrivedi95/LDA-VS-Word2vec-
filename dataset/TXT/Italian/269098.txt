XjAb0mxgCtq96pWWJjUBAg Came here on Mother's Day so I knew what I was getting in to. Called around noon hoping to make a reservation. Unfortunately, was told they were not accepting any more reservations. They even went as far to say walk ins were being turned away and not welcomed due to overwhelming demand. I went on Open Table and found I could make a reservation at any time during the day for 15 minute intervals. Booked for 7 pm. 

We were seated at 655 and were instantly told they didn't have high chairs available and my two year old would have to sit in a chair. The stack of four high chairs approximately ten feet away from our table said otherwise. I took one and she had a high chair. 

We sat for 25 minutes and asked for our server to greet us twice before someone finally came over. The server apologized stating our original server had a panic attack and announced she "just couldn't do it anymore". The younger guy who waited on us was very nice and through. 

The food was what you would expect. Given the hectic day, it was a positive to be in and out in approximately two hours.
