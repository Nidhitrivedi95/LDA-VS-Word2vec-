anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg This feels like old Vegas.  They've been here since 1982 and are still delivering wonderful food with efficient, understated service.  My husband and I ordered a bottle of wine, for instance.  The waiter poured and took the bottle away.  Never once did our glasses go empty, however. He constantly monitored our table, but never once did we feel "monitored".  My husband ordered the crab claws for a starter and the swordfish as his main.  Both were perfectly cooked and quite tasty.  I had the Caesar salad and the Chilean sea bass.  My salad was good, but it was not special. The dressing was just too heavy. The sea bass was the best I've ever tasted.  I will definitely go back.
