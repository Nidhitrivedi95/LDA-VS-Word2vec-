HYhbeLznSWEl6JIYTllVUA We came to check out the new place in same spot as the old Grimaldi's.  We arrived at 630 PM on a Sat night so the place was very busy!  We had an acceptable 30 minute wait and got seated out on the patio.  

Ambiance:  The patio dining area is nice and has a nice open view.  Note though, the place is VERY loud inside and outside.  The acoustics of the place and the fact that there were so many people makes for a very loud place.  The waiter had to practically shout to take our order, and it for me it made the dining experience a little more tense than I like because it's hard to even talk to your dining companion. 

Service:  The service was friendly and professional.  Our appetizers and salads came fairly quickly considering how busy it was.  My only compliant is that it took a long time for the main entrée to come (25-30 minutes after our salad was done).  The waiter came by to apologize for the wait, but still too long to wait.

Food:  For appetizers we had the Caprese.  It was pretty good.  We also had Caesar salad which was good although a little heavy on the dressing.  For the main course I had the Chicken Marsala.  It was decent, but not great.  It was served on a pizza plate (see my picture) which made the dish look a little odd too.

Prices:  Prices all seemed reasonable and fair.

Summary:  I think this place is geared more towards pizzas and paninis (that seemed to be what most people were getting).  Maybe I should have stuck with that.  It is strange though because it displays itself as a fancy Italian place so I expected more entrée selections.  I will definitely go back and try the pizza next time.
