rFeJgbnLxtcdqIpBdhpxtQ It was a Tuesday night and slow.  A bit dark to read the menu.  The music was good.  There was more than one person and some thought the food very good, the other mediocre.  So that is why the 3 stras.  Maybe it was an off night.  Having read the other reviews, it seems we were there on an off night.  I would go back and try again.  The spinach dumplings were really good and flavorful.
