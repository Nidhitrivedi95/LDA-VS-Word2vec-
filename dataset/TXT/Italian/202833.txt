q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ The food and atmosphere were terrific but the service was pretty poor.  It really ruined the whole experience for us.  The server took a long time to even take our order, refused to split checks or even allow us to use multiple credit cards, had other people deliver our food, never refilled our drinks and was anxious to get us out of there.  The place was only about half full and this girl claimed to have worked there for a while but obviously was not interested in doing a good job.  For the money, I'd go someplace that actually wanted our business.
