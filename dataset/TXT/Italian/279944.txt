yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w DOG FOOD! This is by far the WORST place I've ever eaten in my life. Nothing more than microwaved frozen, low quality, tasteless, no worse... really bad tasing food. Then they force on to patrons all the wine you can drink, which is undrinkable. Nothing good about this place, overpriced, dark and dingy, poor staff attitudes, a total disaster. And a prevailing feeling by our table of four. Whomever gave this place any kind of a favorable rating are probably paid to do so.
