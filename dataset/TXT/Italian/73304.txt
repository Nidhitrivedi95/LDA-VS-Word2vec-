CkO8osRw9g1HTtOj6sgs-g If you want the best and affordable pasta, panini and espresso in town, come to Espressini. 
They also have the best salad/salad dressing (i believe its a mix of honey/mustard) that usually comes with your salad and pasta. You can order a full portion or a half portion, depending on your appetite.


 They are now serving breakfast on Saturdays and soon will also be serving various cakes to compliment your coffee.


 You will also love the welcoming vibe that the place gives. This cafe' gets packed between 1230-230pm so come early to get a seat.
