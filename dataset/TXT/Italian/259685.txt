WNnkyVvBfY1vTqiqSufZQA Went to Cibo a few weeks ago with a group of 14 for a friends birthday.  Before we ordered anything, we (actually two of us) asked if we could have separate bills.  One would think, not a big deal and the waiter said "no problem".  I asked if he could give me the bill for the birthday girl so we could split it and pay for her.  Again, "no problem". 

Unfortunately, at the end of the night, PROBLEM!  The waiter comes with one bill and not the agreed upon 14 bills.  He suggests that we just spilt the bill evenly between all of us, but not everyone knows each other and many have spent less or more than what a spilt bill would be.  The manager says they do not do separate bills, that it is their policy.  Both said that it would take too long to separate it out.  That's why we asked at the beginning of the night, before we ordered drinks and appetizers!  They left us to figure out the amount, tried to charge us for two things we never ordered and when we left, we passed another, yet smaller party with separate bills.

This is on top of the fact that it took a very long time for our server to take our orders and half way through, he stopped and went off to get something for one of his other tables, without excusing himself.  He continued to take our order 5 minutes later.

The food was ok and the restaurant itself is beautiful.  However, the bad experience at the end of the night left a bad taste in the mouths of ALL who were in our party.

There are other restaurants in the city and neighbourhood who have better food and service!  I would recommend that you go to one of them.
