SWS5gooAPjG3BITQyNj_Qg Went there for lunch today. I needed something fast and yummy.  As I was walking up (after 1:30) I saw their specials.  Lemon chicken, yummy.  As I ordered, they were out, out of every pasta they made for today.  They had pizza but only margarita and bianca. I ordered one slice of bianca and back to work...I've had much better food.  Or maybe I just had my taste buds set for lemon chicken.
