fmgGNZyZfeCU8fug5LnpjQ I would say the food is subpar to mediocre. We visited this restaurant last week with our family and shortly after eating, approximately 30 minutes later my wife became very ill after having a pizza with prosciutto .  The servers were very good but as the saying goes once bitten twice shy. We won't be back.
