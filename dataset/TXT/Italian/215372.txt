roz-ed8kvBF6fwKBPeJ49Q This is a comfortable neighborhood Italian restaurant.  All the staples are here including pasta, veal and seafood. I had the veal marsala which came with a side of fettuccine alfredo.  

We also ordered a couple of bottles of reasonably priced sangiovese wine.

For dessert the tiramisu was large enough that the four of us could share.

The service was prompt and friendly.  Overall it was a nice experience.
