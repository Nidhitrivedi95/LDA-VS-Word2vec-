Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA Decent slice of pizza. I went there on lunch one day since I work at UNLV. I had their buffalo chicken pizza and a side salad. The salad was pretty tasty and although I wish that they made their own salad dressing opposed to just giving me a packet of Newman's (although Newman's is very tasty). The buffalo chicken was just standard. It needed a little bit more buffalo sauce to be able to taste the buffalo chicken flavor.
