5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g I recently ate here Saturday night, we wanted to eat at Cowfish but we had such a large group the wait time was so long!

Needless to say we hopped over to Rooster's for dinner....maybe it's that I had my mind set on Cowfish...or maybe Rooster's really just isn't that good - but I was not satisfied with the food.

The atmosphere is awesome - the smell when you walk in is great! Our serve was pretty helpful and friendly. They portion sizes they claim to be large are actually rather average. Everything is served a la carte - still not big enough portions to share if that's what you were thinking.

I got the arugula salad which was very basic - greens, cheese, apples, dressing - nothing too impressive. The mac and cheese was just okay. The BBQ sauce is pretty sweet. Natural chicken was kind of dry.
