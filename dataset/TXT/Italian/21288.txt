38-sjGYYVcQEKrZe5Nu47A We stopped in on a Friday late morning.  Our intention was to have a couple bloody Mary's and hit the grocery store. When we walked in the owner was standing at a table in the bar area talking to a group of gentlemen. Nobody was behind the bar. We sat there for 7 minutes, watching employees mill about,  the owner talk to the table. Nobody approached us at all. When we got up to leave the owner was standing by the front counter and said "see you guys". Really?  Great customer service.  Needless to say we didn't say "see ya" back.
