dBg3BFuPGaPtzUeLtGk_zg Arriving on a rainy Thursday evening we were surprised when we asked for a table for 4 and were asked about reservations.  We did not have, so our host led us on a stroll through dining the room up some stairs around a corner and into a solarium type extension on the back of the building.  When we first arrived it was empty except for one other table but, we had little choice according to our waitress the downstairs was booked.  She was sweet enough to let us know it wasn't so bad, there wasn't live music to miss, that's on weekends only.
The room eventually filled up and the atmosphere became warmer both figuratively and literally.  This room would be great on a sunny day in summer as it has a whole wall of garage doors.  I was able to walk through the place on my way to the ladies room and I checked out the decor.
Lots of medium size rooms, very spread out over a huge area, two solarium, one indoor, and then an outdoor garden area.  The kitchen is open concept, along a wall and is very sleek and modern, (kick ass oven, with crust maker along the side), but is mixed with a heavy wood panellings which warm the space and makes it very appealing indeed.

We ordered the following 2 Pizza one Sopressata e pecorini, and quatro fromaggi, then two pastas, Fruitti di Mare and Bocsaiola Cavaletti.  The pasta portions are generous and the freshness of the ingredient is a standout.  The pizza is thin crust and also very fresh with a nice red sauce.  I would definitely recommend ordering as we did and sampling family style.  The wait staff is also very friendly, efficient, and accommodating.

I plan a repeat visit and happily recommend everyone try it out as well, reservations may be wise if on a weekend.
