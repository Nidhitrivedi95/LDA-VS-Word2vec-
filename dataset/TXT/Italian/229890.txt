TAoN9nsibXOxsOnnG7Kd_g Riazzi's has consistently raised the bar in service and food quality. My Husband and I come here every year for our anniversary. This most recent time compelled me to write a review. The dining room and bar area were incredibly busy, I know that the staff must have been running around behind the scenes. Not only did our server seem attentive he even suggested a special wine to go with our meal. The food was exceptional, as always. The chicken Valastano is pure, fresh made perfection, the Marsala sauce is balanced and a wonderful complement. I look forward to every visit.
