VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w This review is for dessert only. I've had dinner here before, but it has been years. So, I'll stick to reviewing only the desserts I had.

I showed up at Lavo with the intention of getting 2 desserts to go. The front staff kindly pointed me to the bar to order and wait. 

I ordered the 7 layer rolled chocolate cake and the peanut butter cake. The bartenders were super friendly and did their best to make my wait as enjoyable as possible. I did expect them to be faster, since I only ordered dessert, but once they brought out the dessert, I understood what took so long. The peanut butter cake is so large that thy had to get creative and wrap it in a pizza box.

The decor at Lavo is beautiful. I would definitely recommend Lavo for a drink or a date. Before the club gets started, this is a quiet and relaxing place to be.

As for the cake, it's amazing. Both were really great. You need to really, really enjoy peanut butter to love that cake. It's super filling and rich. It's a dessert to share. I preferred it to the rolled cake, but I love peanut butter. The rolled cake is like a ho-ho only bigger and denser. Overall, I would get both again. The prices are also super reasonable for the size. I highly recommend dessert here.

P.S. I've had the Oreo zeppoles in the past. These are awesome, as well.
