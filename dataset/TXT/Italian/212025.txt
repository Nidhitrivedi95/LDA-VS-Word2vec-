r2BP0Irh63hqYUDSZd0ijQ Great buffet. Friendly staff. Very gluten free accommodating. 

Went here today and had the buffet. It was really yummy and had a ton of options. Upon asking the server if it had anything gluten free he went in back and came back with a whole list of things for me that I could and could not have. He even informed me that I could do the buffet and request a side of gluten free pasta to use with the sauces and such in the buffet. They had a lot of gf options on the menu as well including pasta and I believe I even saw pizza on there.

The interior was really nice as well. Great atmosphere for a family outing. 

Not a single drawback I could find. 

Overall, this was one of my favorite Sunday lunches in a while.
