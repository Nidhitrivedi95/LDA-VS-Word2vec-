I've had the opportunity to dine at plenty "fine" restaurants around town and I must admit I've never felt more unwelcome. The atmosphere was extremely stuffy. My overall experience was simply okay. My guest an I sampled many selections including a variety of recommendations from our knowledgable waiter. I don't suspect I'll return anytime soon but it was quite the experience.

My waiter lost all my trust when I gave him back an unacceptable plate. The waiter gave me back my plate after I watched him scratch the black of the plate with his nail wipe it with a napkin and bring it back to me.
