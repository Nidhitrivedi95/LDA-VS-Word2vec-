UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w We've been in Las Vegas over 25 years and have longed for the great tasting pizzas from our Midwest upbringing.  We have tried almost every pizza place in town and we have finally found a pizza that blows every other place in town away.  We found  it on Yelp, and decided lets go......what a stroke of luck and genius.  Walked in smelled amazing, the owner Jason greeted us right away and recommended a pizza.  WOW, YUMMY, the crust is crisp and delicious and the toppings (Pepperoni & Sausage and Veggies) were to die for..(think he brings in his ingredients from Chicago, where he's from)  The prices are reasonable, beer was cold and the place is spotless.  We were planning our return trip on the way home.  Way to go Jason!!!!!  John & Jayne (Packer fans, sorry)
