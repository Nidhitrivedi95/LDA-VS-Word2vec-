GzYAIjVULpRrFV2dQMKDog Absolutely fantastic!  My wife and son shared the proscuitto flatbread, which was excellent!  My son enjoyed a cup of the minestrone soup.  I had the grilled chicken panini.  That sandwich was hands down one of the best things I have ever eaten!  I highly recommend this place.  A total hidden gem.  We will definitely be back.
