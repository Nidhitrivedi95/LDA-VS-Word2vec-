0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg Best. Pastas. Ever.  We showed up at around 5:30p for an early dinner with our son, who just turned 21 (in Vegas!) and were happy to find out they had a social hour until 7:00.  Do not miss on that menu - short rib bone marrow agnolotti and the duck and foie ravioli - literally "last meal" worthy.  Also, the pork belly was amazing.  The $7.00/glass Sangiovese was surprisingly great (we ususally don't opt for happy hour wines).  We also ordered The Spaghetti with added meatballs from the regular dinner menu.  It was the best spaghetti we have ever had.  Dessert was the incredible mascarpone cheesecake with a perfect double espresso.  We luxuriated in one of the curved booths close to the entrance which was private but let you observe the comings and goings of the restaurant.  The decor, music, ambiance, etc. is first rate.  Last, but not least, the service was superb.  Friendly, efficient and professional.  This was a true 5/5 dining experience and we will definitely be back
