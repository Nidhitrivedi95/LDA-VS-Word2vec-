4BBda3yy_8GXGmYLcgggHw OK.   Yet again - thank you King west for bringing what I want and love to me.

Built upon the same great za from ossington, the food doesn't disappoint.  I dunno if they have a wider appetizer menu at this location, but we ordered literally every one and it was a treat to such an array of taste buds adventures. 

Solid drafts.   Nut darks to Muskoka ales.  I'll keep coming back.  Such a great place for a party or group!

Cheers Libretto!!!
