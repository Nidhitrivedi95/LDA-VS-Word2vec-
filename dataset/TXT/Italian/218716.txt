The food is good, but not incredible.  We were very happy with the over all experience.  The staff was friendly and the celebrity chef comes out to talk to patrons.  She didn't come to our table, but we weren't looking for a conversation.  It's a very nice place to eat is you stay in theater, and we were very satisfied.
