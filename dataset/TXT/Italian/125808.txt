hrNIDao4XnOhrv7aaFehTg I have to admit, I hate ordering out. I try as hard as I can to avoid anything greasy and cook as much as possible but being a new mom to a newborn those days are slowly disappearing.

Earlier this week I had way too long of a day and dinner was not happening, so I had my husband stop to pick up pizza. Being new to the area we weren't really sure where to go (trying to avoid places like Pizza Hut-ugh) I turned to Yelp and found that Marco's was just down the street. Long story short, best delivery pizza. It literally tasted like it was made fresh at home - NOT a greasy box of cheese. The prices are a little steep for the size of the pizza but after tasting the freshness of the ingredients, so worth it. Found our new delivery spot! :)
