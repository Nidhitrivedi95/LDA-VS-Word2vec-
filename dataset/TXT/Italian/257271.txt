w2IE4nbufBqwrub7CW80xg Second time here. Every choice on the menu seemed to either be false advertised or non existent. Arugula Salad advertised with blood orange. Regular oranges in the salad. Spezzatino not in stock, lamb spedini taken off the menu. Half litres of wine not available why?!?!

Unless you want pizza or 4 types of pasta don't bother. Thoroughly disappointed tonight folks.

To top it off arugula salad had a massive long hair in it. I didn't make a scene I just quietly showed our waiter who quickly whisked it away. Any comps? Nope! Date night ruined grazie.
