3cbsPfoUUrysf-M8FI_0IA Probably my favorite restaurant in pgh. My husband and I pride ourselves on being foodies and the food here is some of the best we've had in the city when it comes to authentic Italian.  The service is excellent and welcoming. Sadly.. they don't take reservations for parties under 6...but you can open your bottle of wine and have a drink downstairs while you wait for your table to be ready!  I highly recommend the gorgenzola mess for an appetizer...delicious!
