f_R4-FMtQ2Dj6m8LNuse1w I love these two places, immensely.  We've been to the Woodlawn location many times. We recently moved to a different neighborhood and were happy to find a Libretto's near our new place. I've ordered delivery, twice, already! 
 What a treat to have fresh, delicious, Italian American food with no mess in my kitchen!
 The chopped Sicilian salad is so flavorful and crisp! Lasagna is a dream. The portions are generous! The cannoli, mmm. 
 But remember, the food has to travel from the store to your location, so, if mozzarella sticks are hardened by then, you'll live.
