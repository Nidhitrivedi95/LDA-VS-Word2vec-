dj6nbGIqguJDXgz49nmFBw I ordered two pepperoni pizzas and I just finished a day of moving to this side of town and I was tired and SUPER HUNGRY!
I ordered carry out and it said it would be done in 25 minutes, so I show up and it wasn't close to done yet I had to wait another 20 minutes.
Normally I'd be pissed, but ANITA was amazing!! She communicated to everyone who waited and was working her butt off for everyone!
She gave me plates because she knew I just moved into my place.
The pizza was good. 
But my review isn't about the pizza it's about Anita who made my night less angry when I was tired and starving from moving all day.
Give this lady a raise most employees at pizza places are rude and I never really have many stand out experiences at any chain pizza restaurant.
Because of her I'll order again.
