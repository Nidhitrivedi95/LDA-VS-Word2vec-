64o_nYvzIKwHFOSYSEm-qw They should be arrested for calling this New York pizza. I just left with a pizza to go. Its overpriced but no big deal if its good. The whole pie has 3 inches of soft chewy dough with no sauce or cheese they think is a pizza crust. For their info a pizza pie should have maybe an inch of crunchy crust around the edge. Not 3 inches of chewy dough. Almost 1/2 the pie is chewy dough instead of sauce and cheese. They should put a dominoes logo on their window.
