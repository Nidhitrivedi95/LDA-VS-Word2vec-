74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw We enjoyed the Italian food at this restaurant.. the service was prompt, and they had a few vegetarian options (although the primavera they made for us off the menu was the best item served!)


The eggplant was kinda crappy.. the sweet pea ravioli was good, although it was undercooked and looked like fying saucers to me.  

The bread was great...and the sticks were amazing..

We did not do dessert here.
