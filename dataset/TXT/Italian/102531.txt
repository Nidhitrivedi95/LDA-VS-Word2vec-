fi6s29AbDqLjoQ1LSe5lrg We come to Michael's every once in a while after finding it in the Entertainment Book which they are no longer in. Two veal parmigiana's cost 45 bucks alone. If you can not looking to spend money I wouldn't recommend coming here.

We both ordered a soup, I had minestrone and it was delicious. I am very picky on minestrone soup because they all taste so different and I like the soup here. My boyfriend got the butternut squash and he loved it as well, it's funny how the table beside us who the waiter knew got double the size of butternut squash soup...

One of the pops came back as diet and the owner changed it, when the bill came the waiter argued with us that we had 3 pop and would not listen to us about one of the pop being diet and was changed.. He was too busy socializing with the table beside us...

The veal was good overall, the waiter Tony I wouldn't recommend as the service was horrible and he just stood beside us the whole time talking to be other table about Cuba and this and that... We had to argue with him about the bill and if he didn't remove the charge he wouldn't of got a tip.

I thought customers were always right?
