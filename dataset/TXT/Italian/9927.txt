We started with the octopus and squid salad. A fantastic choice. It was served some clover, chick peas, and a slice of octopus that was so tender, I couldn't believe it! The squid was rolled up plated with some greens as well. It was delish!

The pasta we chose was the house speciality - tomato and basil. It was so fresh and so basil-y! There was just something about it - almost creamy, but not creamy. The texture was all to do with the tossing of the pasta and sauce with a little EVOO as a second step. Yeah, I asked. 

For dinner I chose the veal chop, and I'm so glad that I did. It was cooked perfectly and was just the right size portion. My husband had the fennel crusted cod. It is prepared with the skin on, and was very nice (so he says, because I didn't get a taste!). 

Then dessert was a spectacle to behold. The anniversary trio was complete with chocolate-filled doughnuts, strawberry milkshakes, chocolate toffee brittle, and ice cream, too. It was unbelievable. 

We will definitely make this a regular stop in the LV book!
