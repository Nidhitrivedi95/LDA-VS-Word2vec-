J5puhDnVL9WetWnWWDMhQw On our first night in Mississagua we discovered this "True Jewel" restaurant only steps from our vacation rental property.  It is a family owned place and we loved it.  From the wonderful woman who greeted us, the amazing chef (her husband) and the staff it was such a great experience.  It is small and intimate and a great place to relax and truly enjoy the dining experience.  Food was amazing and their house wine was wonderful.  We loved it so much we went back there on our last night.  Do give this restaurant a try.....you won't be disappointed.
