 We had a delightful meal here after my foodie father recommended the place. We were seated immediately and our server took our drink order right away. This was quickly followed by a basket with a variety or fresh breads with and olive oil and vinegar dipping sauce. My partner and his friend opted for the pris fixe menu and had salads (one caesar, one house) and salmon. I am an occasional fish eater who has always had a dislike for salmon. I tried a bite of my partner's salmon and I must say it was the best I have ever tried. I ordered the calamari and putanesca flat bread for the table and both were delicious. The calamari was very lightly breaded and cooked to perfection. Unlike previous reviews we had mounds of calamari to  the green beans. I ordered the angel hair pomodoro and while it wasn't the best I've had, it was good. 

Our waiter was very attentive without being intrusive, and provided what I consider to be above average service. 

We only had to sit through one song performed by a waitress. While her voice was very good and I liked her song, the microphone amplified her voice too much and was too loud. Thankfully that did not go on too long and we were quickly back to our delicious meal. 

Overall we really like Le Provencal and are looking forward to trying the crepes out front tomorrow.
