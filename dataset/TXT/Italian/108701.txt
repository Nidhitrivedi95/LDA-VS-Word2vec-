Two items to work on the sun screens flap in the breeze and could hit someone or clear the wine glasses from the tables. When you are asked to wait, sit at the bar order a drink and the hostess wishes to seat you without the drink or the tab the service is not transparent. You have to wait until you get their attention to ring the tab as opposed to sending the tab to the  table. 
Joseph was exceptional, his training on service and the menu were quite apparent.
