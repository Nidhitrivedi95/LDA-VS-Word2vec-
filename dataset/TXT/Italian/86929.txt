dulgBrNtDCGjYcbQa2E6uA Food - Very good 4.5/5 
Australian Wagyu with lobster tail, roasted cauliflower, french fries. Steak cooked perfectly, plating a little boring

Service - 2.5/5 
Always nice to have a rapport with server especially at a place this pricey. We had 3-4 different servers, wasn't terrible but we've had better service at Swiss Chalet or Keg to be honest.

Experience - 1.5/5
So here was our issue.  Booked reservations several days in advance only for them to tell us the dining room was full and they would have to seat us in the lounge. What?? A reservation i would think meant i reserved a table in the dining room...not the area where ppl can walk in hangout to drink and watch the game! 
We literally had the worst table in the place. Quite disappointing considering we spent over $600. 
Also note, that they don't like to split the bill and they'll let you know.  I'm guessing if Morgan Freeman or any other celebrity had dinner here and requested a bill split it would probably happen.(not that they would do that!) 

At this price point you are paying for great food, great service and a great experience. Unfortunately Michael's on Simcoe falls short. 
Consider Jacobs and Co. and Harbour Sixty.
