C63sF-wG4f1doMIMv2qvOg On a Friday night after work, I want good food, but not a lot of fuss. Porta Alba definitely delivered! Our wait was minimal, the staff was courteous and helpful, and of course, the food was delicious! I had the diavolo pizza which had just the right amount of heat without overpowering the cheese and crust (as I also want to taste those). My husband had the carbonara as he was in the mood for pasta, and it was nice to have both of our cravings so well met.
