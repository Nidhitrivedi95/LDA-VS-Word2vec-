OXrFWgoz533T8tMRemkiww We were in Dormont for the Beatles " Eight Days A Week" screening at the Hollywood Theatre.   That was so good. 

Sadly the food that followed was not.  As far as I know the sauce is the thing.   It was not here.   O well!  Definately will drive by next time!   Service tried but something was going on in the kitchen.  They took care of my entre and the pizza that replaced it but i would have preferred a delicious meal...esp since i was hungry and there's nothing better than eating good food when you are hungry!!!
