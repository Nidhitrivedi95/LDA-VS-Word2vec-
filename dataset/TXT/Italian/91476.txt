EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw I had pretty high hopes for this place considering how well it's reviewed and the unique dishes they offer. The majority of dishes that our party of 6 got were on the disappointing side. The best things that they had by far were there appetizers. The burrata and ricotta cheese appetizers were really good. Along with that was the smoked olives and crispy pig ears. Olives had amazing flavor and the crispy pig ears were very unique yet delicious. The entrees are when it started to go downhill for the majority of people. I'll start off by saying that I actually really enjoyed my entree. I got the brisket and that was probably the best entree out of all of them. My sister got the pasta dish with fowl which had a really unpleasant flavor. Stay away from that dish. My wife got their risotto. It was just okay. I've definitely had much better risotto then this one. My parents got their fish of the day which was an ahi tuna and it looked just okay. The food was a little overpriced in my opinion so that also made the experience not the greatest. Service was good however. If I do come back, I will just get the brisket. You just gotta make sure you order the right thing here because if not then you may not have a great experience.
