YDeN4OHayfKocEo7Tz4jMg I have given this place 2 tries and both times I wish I could have gone to Olive Garden rather than this place. At least there you get a consistently average meal, where here it has been below average both times. To start off with, if you're going to have alcoholic specials in North Carolina, you must do them all day. You can't have them for specific hours of the day. Both times there have been issues when asking the staff about specials. 

First time I came to this restaurant, I ordered the pizza. Absolutely nothing special about their pizza. Have had way better tasting ones from Brixx down the street. Second visit I ordered the soup and salad. I know, how can you mess that up?! But when you offer lobster bisque and there is no lobster in it, I would say that is a fail. Also, the croutons on top were very soggy. Salad was not that good either. Dressing tasted nasty to me. 

Two tries and no better the 2nd time versus the 1st = I will not be back.
