LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA You must visit Maggiano's. We were in Las Vegas and decided to make a reservation on Open Table. We were certainly not disappointed. As in a previous review we requested a corner table by the window. It was perfect. Our waiter Matin could not have been more pleasant and made my special birthday celebration one of the best. My husband ordered the Caesar Salad and Lasagna. He didn't want to tell me that their lasagna was better than mine. I had the Maggiano Salad and Chicken Piccata. It was fabulous. Their meals are delicious and the prices are reasonable. If you have not tried this restaurant do yourself a favor and do so. You will not be disappointed. One glass of Chardonnay, two salads and two entrees for $55.00 + tip. Very, very reasonable.
