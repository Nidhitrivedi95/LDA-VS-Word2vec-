QBN_TcWQ1mZrzekFM4p0LA I actually wrote a review about the Arrowhead location a couple weeks back, and was contacted by management. They offered to make it right and sent me a gift card to come back. My final tab was like $1.02.

With that being said, I had a MUCH better experience here. We tend to joke around with waitstaff a lot, and it's usually a good judge of how the service will be. At Arrowhead, our server was in such a "hurry" that she didn't bother to converse with us. Courtney at this Mesa location was very involved with the three tables in our section and definitely rolled with the punches. She even brought the birthday candle/song over for my wife (as our meal at Arrowhead was initially for her bday).

I left happy and full. Carbonara and the mini meatballs were solid. Much better than my last visit!
