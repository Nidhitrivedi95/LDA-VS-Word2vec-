Tp07u-0AOFRfQhtNpAXaQA I eat here probably once a week for lunch and I must say, It's one of my top favorite pizza joints. Lunch here is a breeze. There is usually no wait at peek lunch hours and to boot they have an express lunch line that gives you the option to order by the slice from an assortment of pre-made pizzas. Ok. I know I know. Pre-made??? Let me tell you, they heat that shit right up in their oven and its perfect! I usually pig out here and get three slices, either the plain cheese (so simple and so good), the pepperoni/jalapeno or the tomato ricotta white pizza. Oh yeah, the sicilian style pizza is awesome, but that one you have get made fresh to order. Way better that way. You can really taste the NYC water in the dough with that one! If you enjoy a good Greek Salad this place has one of the best. The dressing is so damn good.

I have tried on occasion to stray from the pizza and have always been disappointed. NYPD is excellent for pizza, I suggest sticking with that when you go.
