JgIKV1b7cgcJ-yFaMFKfBQ What a joke. Pepperoni pizza was greasy to the point where I had to keep it a way from me while eating so it wouldn't drip on my clothes. Not to mention being burnt and having little black specks on the bottom from their dirty oven. Just like other reviewers experienced, the skin and bones chicken behind the counter acted like I was bothersome and gave me screw face when I said "thank you very much" while accepting my mediocre pizza. 

GARBAGE!
