VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Had one wild night at Lavo, woke up Monday morning and had to venture out of our suite at the Venetian in search for the ice machine so I could ice a half dozen bumps and bruises on my legs, still not sure how they got there! Yes, I got a little wild :) but from what I remember of my evening here, it was fabulous. Our company hosted an opening night party here - so things started out right downstairs with a glass of Pinot and their meatballs. Yummm! We came upstairs and I'm not sure how many cocktails I had but we had an entire section behind the DJ to ourselves so lots of space for me to lounge out and kick up my heels after dancing for hours. I really like the little cut out shelves all over the place and especially on the dance floor for your drinks. The bathrooms are clean, the bartenders were all pretty cute - all in all fun little spot! Whoever the gentleman was that kept telling me I was "the hottest chick ever", thank you! Of course I don't know the prices, because I rarely pay, and if I do - we all know good food and alcohol have no price tag ;) but Absolute Vodka was compted for about 2 hrs, so I may have had 5 or 6 drinks - yep Good Times!
