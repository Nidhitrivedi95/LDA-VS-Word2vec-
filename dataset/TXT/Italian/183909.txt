oglIZt5mg2nErhpTH_AakQ A great little restaurant on the north side of Madison. Fast delivery and friendly service.

Penne ala vodka is good, though when pastra travels it tends to get a little soft. Pizza has a decent crust with ample toppings. Their eggplant parmesan pizza is good but it's fried so there's a lot of grease. Basic pepperoni/sausage pizza does the trick and is affordable.

The highlights of the menu are anything that includes their slightly sweet red sauce, and their home-fried items. Onions rings are the best in Madison. The fried eggplant can be ordered as an appetizer, and it's enormous and delicious with their red sauce, which comes with.

Basic spagetti-with-meat-sauce absolutely kills for $7, soft delivery noodles or not, as does their spagetti-with-meatball. Can't do better in Madison for order-in lunch at these prices. 

Dinner is fairly priced and neither on the cheap or expensive side. This is more of your New Jersey big-portion of comfort food kind of Italian, in contrast to the local-farmers-market ingredients of Lombardino's or Nostrano. That said, I give Bellitalia a very high recommendation, especially for delivery.
