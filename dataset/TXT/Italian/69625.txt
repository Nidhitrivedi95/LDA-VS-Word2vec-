bXbCGFk3ZjLcTdQQB-xPyQ I have been to Luciano's several times, and must give them 5 stars due to the impeccable service and consistently delicious meals that come out. Last night I was here for Valentine's dinner and ordered the chicken piccata. It was hands-down exactly what I was hoping for and so tasty. We ordered strawberry shortcake for dessert, and it was perfect. Light, fluffy, and topped with a couple strawberries. A manager came around to make sure everything was great. When our server brought our bill, he informed us dessert was on the house--THEN brought us 2 chocolate covered strawberries to end the night! It was great. I recommend sitting in the sunroom area at the window.
