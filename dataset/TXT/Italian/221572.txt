SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg Chef Julian Serrano aims to please and never disappoints! Lago is a new sleek, hip and contemporary restaurant that offers amazing views of the Bellagio fountains! Lagos menu showcases a modern take on Italian tapas. There is so much variety on the menu for any palate.  Service is impeccable also.  I will definitely dine here again!!
