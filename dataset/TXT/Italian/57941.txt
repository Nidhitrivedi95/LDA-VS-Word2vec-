ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg It has been a number of months since I have been here. My niece shared that she had a poor experience several weeks ago and I read a few poor reviews on Yelp before going there today. The service was a bit slow however the server and manager were friendly. The food was exceptional as always. My suggestion is to give yourself plenty of time and relax - the food is worth it IMHO!
