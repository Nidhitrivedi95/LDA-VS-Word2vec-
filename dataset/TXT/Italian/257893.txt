w3PwDEbI0EDx4YI_BkFhIA We really do like this place and the food is always on point and great family place. Most of the time we eat in the dining room cause we are with the familia but at times my wife and i eat at the bar. The last 4 times we have eaten at the bar Woody has been our bartender he is absolutely miserable, not only with most of his customers at his bar but how he talks and speaks to his fellow coworkers. Tonight was just bad overall on how he was talking to us and if i was the 2 coworkers he was talking nasty to i would have went off on him at the bar. From now on moving forward if the of us come in to have dinner at the bar and Woody is there we will go somehwere else. I know hes been there forever and the regulars deal with him but enough is enough.
