j4s9X08gDTZH3MwcByfCHQ Service is fast and workers are friendly and polite. Took advantage of their online ordering though Yelp and got to select our pizza and toppings which was nicer than calling in the order. Opted to pay upon pickup so very convenient. 

Pizza is on the better side with fresh toppings and doughy crust. I was especially impressed by their specialty pizzas-the broccoli cheese and bbq buffalo chicken were pleasant surprises and worth the extra money.
