SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw Don't let the half-empty strip mall location be a deterrent. We decided to try Bistro Pizza after the rave reviews from Shirley B. on facebook and yelp. And wow, are we glad we did!

The Garlic Knots are a must-have. At $5 for 6 knots, it's a steal. My young sons would have been happy to have made a meal out of just those. But thankfully they saved room for pizza. As my 9-year-old declared, "Mom this is MUCH better pizza than (insert another local pizza joint we often frequent which has MUCH higher prices)!"

The owner was friendly, gracious and welcoming. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was they currently don't serve alcohol and I enjoy a frosty libation with my pizza! But we will be back again and often!
