VIP5_HoBm98wcJPwz0lZjg Very bad people. I have been working there only for 2 weekends and it was my worst working experience ever! they are nice only with customers because they mean "money" but being a nice person is more than that. I worked there for S.Valentine and they didn't pay me my tips! and they payed me less hours too...why? only because it was my first working night, but I worked as everyone else and it was a very crowded night, do you know how many tips you can do for S.Valentine? a lot and they didn't give me even a dollar of MY tips....it was not fair at all.The kitchen is not well organised, customers can wait a lot before being served and many complained about the fish, the meat and the cheese for being not fresh.
