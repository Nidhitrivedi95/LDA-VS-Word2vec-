lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ Family style Italian restaurant that serves up your typical Italian fare. I think the food and sevice is better than other casual Italian restuarants I've been to. If you go with a party of two, I recommend just getting a salad and entree and that should be enough. If you go with more people then you could order more entrees or opt for the larger sized plates. The entrees are large because they are meant to be shared, hence a family style restaurant. If it's your first time here they will explain the menu and plate sizes to you. I have only been here a couple times, but look forward to coming back again.
