4HGVxC-zIeQnR1CsD9GePQ I just wanted to add to my review after holding our wedding rehearsal dinner here.  We had about 45 people at our rehearsal dinner and they were all raving about the food (including my mother who is 100% Italian and cook like crazy).  I like eating here normally, but when they do a party, they do it right.   There were multiple appetizer courses including their homemade ravioli, salads, three good entree options, multiple dessert options, wine on the table.  It was nice.

I don't remember the exact numbers, but I remember thinking that we got a smokin' deal, too.  I think it was like $45/head OTD including alcohol.  It might have been more, but not much.

The other thing that was nice was that we didn't have to do much to make it happen.  We sat down with the owner for about 5-10 minutes and made up a menu and he wrote it down on a torn out piece of notebook paper.  He wasn't a stickler about deposits or anything.  (That might be because we are kind of regulars, now).

If you are considering putting together a party, stop by and try the food.  If you like it, I would definitely talk to the owner about doing it there.

We have continued eating there since getting married.  The rehearsal dinner experience and some of the recent dinner specials bump this place to a definite 5-star deal.
