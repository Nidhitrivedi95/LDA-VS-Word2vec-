PJVjfGtVc71M0XlUr83teQ These "build your own pizza" places are becoming some of my favorite places to go.

The space is small but laid out well and I enjoy the large patio seating they have. It gets pretty busy but the line moves quickly.  

Make sure you read the menu, there are a few basic options for a cheaper price, or you can go for the make your own, load on as many toppings as you want awesome feast. 

The ingredients tasted fresh and I really like the option of the wheat crust! I felt the sauce could have been a little more prominent, but overall a good pie!
