qVQGfHphxolps16v6g5X-g After reading reviews on Yelp my husband and I decided to try this place. We took our son and a guest who was visiting from Columbia. 

Let me just get down to it- The good, the bad and the ugly....

The good-
Very large portions- if we had liked the food we would have had leftovers for days
The Bakery- That was attached to the restaurant was very (VERY) good- keep in mind the prices are a tad on the expensive side. So, expect excellent baked goods for a high price.

The Bad
There was only one word for the service and it wasn't good.... Altogether there were two waitresses serving both the bakery and the restaurant. They had two other tables when we arrived and a total of six when we left. Numerous times I had to ask for a refill on my drink, for some dressing, etc. It took a while to get our check even after asking for it. 

And... The Ugly
They didn't have any type of "kids" menu... nor did they have Mac and Cheese! No Mac and Cheese? Throw some pasta on and put some cheese on it! If this is a from scratch type of restaurant make some Mac and Cheese from scratch!
The restaurant itself was a hole-in-the-wall type place and looked it. I could have overlooked this had the food been good.

The food
My husband was shocked they had clam chowder on the menu- if you have seen my earlier reviews you know he is a sucker for good chowder. So he asked the waitress if it was homemade. She said yes- After one bite- my husband says "no way"- It was Campbell's Soup all the way!
We had Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna and Spaghetti.  All were just fair. Nothing to write home about! Again large portions, but not anything I wanted to reheat and eat!
