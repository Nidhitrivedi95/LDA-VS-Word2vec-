BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA Not really impressed. Happy hour is only offered at the actual bar, which is bogus. I'll never understand why some restaurants do that. We chose the bar area on the outside because the patio was really, really nice (even in July.) I think that was our mistake because we were the only 2 people on the outside. There was a sliding glass door on the other side of the bar that remained closed and the bartender had to open the door and physically come out to check on us. The visits were few and far between, which was a bummer because the female bartender was ultra nice. It was moderately busy inside, but nothing crazy. There was another bartender working with her, but she was the only one who ever came outside to see us, so I don't know if she was getting very much help...

The meatballs were not good. They were semi burnt and kind of falling apart like chopped hamburger meat. The orange butter that came with the bread tasted like absolutely nothing and had the consistency of play-doh... The panna cotta dessert tasted store-bought. Again, very, very nice bartender and very good drinks, but I had an empty drink for about 10 minutes before the bartender came outside and after she dropped off the dessert menu, we didn't see her for another 10-12 minutes. 

I really want to try this place again and see if dinner is a little better than happy hour. The pastas looked amazing.
