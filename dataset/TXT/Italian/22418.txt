3k9treY8PmsZ42bKmuICgA I've been to a couple of the Spoon and Fork franchise locations and this is one of the better ones.  This location has dim sum along with a variety of Thai/Vietnamese meat skewers.  They also have a lot of options for fried rice and noodles compared to other locations.  The service was great and the food came fast and mostly a lot at the same time.  The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 stars was because it is not free drink refills like the other locations and desserts are extra charge.
