Mpnh7Hut-zO3U-kHy2LfRg Value: got the 1/2 chicken dinner and frankly, its bigger than what I get from the churrasquierr dowm main street (near TD). Paid less than $10

Taste: chicken is moist, rice is tasty, their hot sauce is alright (kinda reminds me of Frank's. Not spicy enough but its okay)  however, the potatoes are really nice.  in comparison to other places ive had it at, this is the most seasoned

Service: really friendly staff. Quiet takeout atmosphere. Fast service as well.

Maybe next time ill try out their sandwiches
