w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q You got to be kidding.  We went to this restaurant upon a friend's recommendation.  We were going to take advantage of early specials on appetizers advertised online and then have dinner.  When we sat down, we were told that the specials were only served in the bar.  Okay, I'll go along with that.  Most expensive beer pints in the world.  Drinks were very good.  Appetizers were good.  We should have stopped there.  Dinner was served by a very energetic waiter...and his son.  Very pleasant, close to annoying.  Service was consistent and outstanding throughout the evening.  Main courses for steak were tasty, but way over priced.  Avoid the veal, it was dreadful, worse I ever had.  Dry, pounded gray substance of some sort.  I guess it was meant to be that way.  Look else where unless they have a good advertised steak special which they did the previous month.
