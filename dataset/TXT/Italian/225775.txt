We brought wine in and they took care of all of that perfectly.  We ordered a lot of food and wanted our dinner served slowly throughout the evening so as to enjoy the musical entertainment.  Everyone raved about their dishes, and the food made me feel like I was back in Brooklyn...a very good thing. I will definitely repeat.
