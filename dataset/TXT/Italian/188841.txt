OXrFWgoz533T8tMRemkiww While in Pittsburgh with the hubby for a quick weekend getaway, I took Misty B.'s (@chi_mist) recommendation and tried this place out. 
Casual, but trendy, restaurant that was the perfect little date night. 
The wine menu was good - and the server helped us pick out a few based on our tastes. 
The food was VERY good. We had the Polpettini (mini meatballs) as an appetizer and they were all gone in about 5mins. 
We shared two entrees: the DOC margherita pizza and a pasta special of the evening - penne with a lamb ragu. 
The pizza... the pizza... the pizza.... I could eat the entire thing by myself. I forgot about the pasta, and to be honest, it couldn't stand up to the pizza.

This 5 star rating is absolutely for the best margherita pizza I've ever had - and thanks Misty for the awesome rec!
