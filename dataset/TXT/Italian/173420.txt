N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg The food was outstanding. 

Service sucked tonight. .The hour wait was fine and preorder option nice however, we were not offered appetizers salads or desert. 

The waitress was flown in to train new staff but needs training herself. So the pizza is a preorder while your waiting. We sit and I inquire about a salad the waitress tries to talk us out of when we insist we want a salad before our pizza she seems irritated. 

She dropped the check and we said we want dessert again felt like we irratated her but we got it and she forgot to print us a new check with the new total. 

I actually thought she was new and understanding. But, challenged my dinner partner and we asked if its been a busy week and when we found out she wasn't from here we were bothered by her horrible service.

Great pizza and welcome to Arizona get rid of this girl very bad impression for the business.
