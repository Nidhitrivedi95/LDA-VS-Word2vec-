4gXdyihRiytmXEAfqLNMBw Great service and delicious food! My husband and I dined in on a Sunday night. The place was full but we didn't have to wait more than 3 minutes for a booth. Our server was friendly and attentive. The appetizer bread that comes free with the meal is amazing! We ate 2 plates of it. We also ordered the bruschetta trio which was really unique and delicious. One of a kind and fun to choose the flavors. I ordered the Quattro Formaggi pizza with mushrooms. It was perfectly thin and crispy. Definetely my favorite pizza I've had in a long time. My husband ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. He loved the concept of it with the salad inside and the thick bread. He wasn't blown away by the standard buffalo sauce. We were too full for dessert because everything was so good! We'll definitely be going back.
