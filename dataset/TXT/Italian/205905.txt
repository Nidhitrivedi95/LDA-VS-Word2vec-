qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA Amazing!! Been to Vegas twice and out of the many restaurants we tried, this was our favorite restaurant. We actually bought a discounted coupon for it and just figured we would try it out, and we ended up loving it. Garlic bread/knots to start which were very good - always a plus!
