rLMsz9ams_xrlX_weejhtQ Came for lunch on a Monday & had the Thai Chicken pizza.  Very tasty!  Appreciated the julienne vegetables & chicken and wasn't too spicy.  Crust could have been a little crisper; will ask them to leave in oven a few extra minutes next time.  They get a gold star for having Coke products and I got a lemon in my diet Coke without asking.  Bartender was polite and efficient.  I did get there a little early (11:30 am) and their meatballs weren't quite ready and I may have those next time. 

Overall great experience.  Parking appeared to be limited; I counted about 11 - 12 spots and don't know how it would work if they were busy as there's no street parking on Desert Inn here.  I'll be back!
