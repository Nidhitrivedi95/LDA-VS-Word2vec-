RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ Three of us had dinner at the Different Pointe of View on the outdoor terrace.  The food was absolutely amazing and the service was impeccable.  We had Ian as our server and received such fantastic service that I would definitely ask for him by name.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu, the wine list, and even the view and surrounding area.  He was one of the best servers we have ever had.

The risotto is absolutely amazing!
