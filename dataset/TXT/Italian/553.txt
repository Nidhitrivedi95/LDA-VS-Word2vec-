-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw NOTE: This is  not a 'walk to' restaurant if you are cruising Kierland....hopefully someone will think of building a pedestrian bridge from Kierland.
A Tuscan feel upon entering - to me if smelled of crusty bread too!!

I think the restaurant had only been opened a few days - so everything was quite new - including the service staff. No worries there.

We stopped in for a quick lunch - they had a great selection of salads - good portion sizes!.
Will be back.
