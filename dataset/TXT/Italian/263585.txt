wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q The first time I came here is a blur as in so long ago But I went to one in L.a liked it so i came to this one. The place was kind of busy so we sat in the bar and the girl who took care of us was awesome. A bottle of wine and crayons were given to us quickly. And it was a date which she realized so I noticed she check first to see if she should come by. THIS was awesome of her. Anywhoo on to the Italian food. I got the oops.. too much wine. I think I got marinated chicken. and the date got a pasta bowl. WE loved it. Everything came out when it needed to. The stars were aligned. In fact, I can't wait to come back.

And Seriously, an Italian place that lets you color on the table? 
I'm sold. 

Oh one last note. If your wondering if you should come here or say Olive garden... I'd pick here... :) :) 

Because the house wine is sooo much better.. Seriously.
