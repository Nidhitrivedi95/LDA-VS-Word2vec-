YOD9dXrnpu8HTRILpF0onw I eat dinner here a lot with my toddler son. Slices of pizza are $1.50 so I don't have to flip out when he decides he won't eat it. The staff is amazing. (Very nice in a friendly comfortable way )  I tried the bloody  Mary build your own bar this morning and I liked it. Not fancy but decent and close to home. The salad and pasta dishes are priced too high for the quality coming in at around $15 so I stick to the pizza.
