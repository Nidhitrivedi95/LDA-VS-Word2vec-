GmgAToSKHnnB3BUtp9eQzw My roomie and I went here a couple weeks ago since we'd heard all of the rave reviews. We got a seat at the bar as a walk in, which was lucky. Definitely get reservations as the dining area is very small. We had the chicken liver pate, which was quite tasty, and the porkchops, which were truly HUMONGOUS. We split the porkchops and couldn't finish them. It was truly a gargantuan portion. You are getting bang for your buck with the porkchops and it was delicious - seared to perfection, juicy, fatty on the edge. 

Service at the bar was great. All of the servers were pleasant, attentive without being overbearing and were very knowledgeable. Will wait for their menu to turn over before we make another visit!
