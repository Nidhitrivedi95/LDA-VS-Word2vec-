I have to admit it has been a few years since I've been here. It was a little hole in the wall but they have renovated it nicely and now accept reservations.

Our usual waitress, Sophie, took great care of us. We ordered our subs (Bologna special for me, Steak, Steak and more Steak sub for buddy #1) while my other bud had a veal parm. All served hot and delicious. Such a treat to eat here. Never had one bad dish or service. They really take pride in their food and it shows. Ordered a small bacon pizza to go since my wife never had Bologna. She really enjoyed it! Oh before I forget try their onion rings, really crunchy and yummy.

Now fair warning to all. It is an Italian family style restaurant. It is loud, loud loud. It makes Elios pizzeria sound like a church. So just letting you know that no, there is not a huge fight happening in the resto, it is just us Italians enjoying conversation :-)
