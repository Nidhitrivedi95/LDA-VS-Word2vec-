pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Loved this place!  Definitely lived up to the hype.  It's a really cute restaurant in a nice neighborhood and it fills up fast.  We got there at 11 AM on Monday for lunch and had no trouble getting a table, but by the time we left, there was a 20 minute wait.  The waiter was kind enough to let us do 1/2 and 1/2 with our pizza so we went with 1/2 Margherita and 1/2 arugula white pizza.  My dining companion does not like arugula, so we ordered it just as a white pizza.  The margherita was good but not the best I have had, but the white pizza was amazing.  Such delicious parmesan flavor.  I am sure it would have been even better with the arugula.  I would definitely return!
