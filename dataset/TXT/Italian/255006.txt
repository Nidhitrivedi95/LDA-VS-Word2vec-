VxgjMl8tQrT4idJW_z8daA Been wanting to try Carrabba's for a long time. Commercials really make it look good. We went last night.... won't go back. 

We went to the one on Clearview in Mesa.

1) Food was REALLY good. 

2) RELENTLESS, HIGH PRESSURE, DECEPTIVE, UPSELLING WAS EXHAUSTING............. EXHAUSTING........... from the start.

3) We asked the waiter to please back off the upsell - we find it offensive - we came for a relaxing evening, not an evening of high pressure to maximize the check. He agreed to "back off", but he was cold and distant after that, though he did give good, professional service.

4)  We talked with the manager about the over-the-top upselling and the deceptive pricing (which we got caught in - similar to the blue cheese scam in W.Y.s review below). He went on and on that the customer's satisfaction was his top priority, all the while spewing gushes of weasle-words trying to convince me that what I call "relentless upselling" is really their exceptional dedication to customer service, menu clarification and presenting options....  HUH? Apparently he thinks we're not just stupid, but REALLY stupid....

Won't be back.
