Atmosphere is nice, dim with accent lighting, classy ambient music on a Tuesday night. 

We ordered 3 food items and two drinks. 

The drinks were good with a decent selection of local craft beer on draft. 4 solid stars. 

The meatball appetizer came with three golfball sized meatballs drenched in a chunky marinara sauce. We gave them 4.5 stars.  

We also ordered a "fungi" and pepperoni pizza. Both were decent fresh and re- heated later at home. They averaged out to 3.5 stars. 

Overall we enjoyed our experience and while it's too far to be added to our standard rotation, we're interested in trying the rest of the menu and plan on returning for a beer and app before any visit to the attached AMC esplanade theater.
