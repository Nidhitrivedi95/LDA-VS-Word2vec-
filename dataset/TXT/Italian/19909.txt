2Zeh89IUg7T4dUFjRfqtdg My grandparents came over from Sicily so I know Italian and this is really good.  Not only is their dining choices excellent but I love their made in store delicious Italian sausage, both sweet and hot to choose from. I like them both. They have the best pepperoni that I can find anywhere. I have to buy extra to freeze and bring in my suitcase to my sister!!!! My husband eats a big chunk in front of the tv. Their Italian beef and Dip is delicious to take home also.We have eaten their delicious spaghetti and meat balls, but our recent favorite is to share the "howie's pastrami" sandwich which is on a huge roll, lots of delicious, lean pastrami and topped with lots of coleslaw. It is messy, but soooo good. I know pastrami doesn't sound Italian, but it is delicious.We also share a 1/2 order of fries. Trust me you will be stuffed.  They also have broasted chicken that looks great, but I love everything else so much I haven't tried it.
