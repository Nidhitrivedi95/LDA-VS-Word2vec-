qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA Yelp you failed us on this one. There is no way this place is not using a microwave. We had the chicken parm and shrimp linguini. The chicken was absolutely disgusting almost in edible. The shrimp fared a bit better but still not up to par. Do yourself a favor for 5.00 more a plate go to lavo you won't be disappointed.
