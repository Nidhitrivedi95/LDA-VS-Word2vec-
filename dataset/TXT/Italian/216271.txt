rsjrcxOIJm9VdkSNpkXZ9Q Went here for lunch today. Definitely enjoyed the overall vibe. I would have given it a better rating if the person taking my order was pleasant. She had a TERRIBLE attitude.

We ordered the Tuscan fries, the Caesar salad, the Rose linguine with shrimp, and the Pomodoro (noodles were overcooked and stuck together). Despite a few mishaps, the food and portions were good. Not sure if we will be going back.
