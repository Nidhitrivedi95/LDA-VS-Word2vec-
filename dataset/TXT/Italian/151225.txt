KMNr-4ygvoqmDpxFiocwSw Service was terrible, our server had the energy of a wet mop and looked as though she hated her life. The food was sub par, for an "Italian" restaurant in the most Italian part of the GTA, I was very disappointed when I realized I could get better pizza at Pizza Nova. The overall experience was regrettable. Will not be returning.
