l07I7E_F5IhhBd4uvxxcdA Just like everyone else, I do agree that the owner and his son are very pleasant people. Always very welcoming and give the best customer service. With that said I honestly can't say a lot about the food. The boneless wings are out of a frozen Tyson bag you can get from the store. Same with the curly fries. They taste like the ones your mom would make for you in the oven. In my personal opinion I would have invested money into a soda fountain and a fryer then arcade games, but that's just me. Also the wait time is unnecessarily long. With no one else ordering, it shouldn't take over 30 minutes to complete an order. 

The "Chris Classic" pizza and there stromboli's are very good. I definitely recommend both. Other then that I always leave feeling hungry and feeling like I ate food from home. 

Very nice and humble people, hopefully they can work on making the quality a bit better.
