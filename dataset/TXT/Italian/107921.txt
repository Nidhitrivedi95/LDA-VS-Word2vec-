FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A This is a nice little place for a quick lunch or dinner. The menu is great, and I love how customizable it is! To be very honest, I've only ever tried their mac and cheese. But, I can personally vouch for the truffle mac and buffalo mac and cheese being amazing. The truffle baked mac is my favorite - very delicious flavor, perfectly melted cheese, and crunchy breadcrumbs on top. It is a little pricey, but the portion sizes are ridiculously large (and their pasta makes for great leftovers). The service was friendly and fast, and it's great that they offer you free garlic bread for checking in! They also have a Coke Freestyle machine which is really nice. The restaurant itself is clean with cute decor. This is a great spot for quick, customizable comfort food.
