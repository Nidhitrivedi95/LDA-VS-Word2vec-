I2jqzhNnV75V0dy24Clqng Oh did I ever enjoy myself! 

As soon as I walked in I felt like I was at the Old Port which surprised me for the location (in a strip mall far from downtown)

Got a seat at the bar and was impressed that although the place is not huge and was completely packed- it was not cramped in the least. 
I did see a few people try to get in before us but had no reso so they couldn't. It was full and I've heard it's like this every night- so make a reservation! 

They have a nice range of entrees (we had spicy peanut dumplings) although it was a tough choice between that and the beef carpaccio! And I felt the rest of the menu-  including the table d'hôte, offered something for everyone. 

I had the Waldorf salad (my 1st) which was refreshing and the filet mignon that almost melted in my mouth! Top that with a nice selection at the bar (although I always order a Crown- and they had it) I was really happy with my meal. 

Ambiance wise- great music- everyone was having a great time, not too loud. A few people even started dancing at one point and it didn't bother anyone including staff. 

I had a great time, really enjoyed my meal and put it on my 'go often' list :)
