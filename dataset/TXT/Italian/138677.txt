jcasci3gjbsSuTEVzvDQKg Came into town for the Belk Bowl. Based on previous reviews me and my boyfriend chose this place and we weren't disappointed! We shared the chicken oreganata pizza and it was wonderful! Also had a side salad with their homemade creamy Gorgonzola dressing which was good too. 

Easy to find and parking available. It's a little dressy which I wasn't prepared for in my Dawg sweatshirt. :) but good and affordable. Go if you get the chance!
