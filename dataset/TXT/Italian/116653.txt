GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q Amazing food. Fantastic service in a friendly family run business.  The food quality is outstanding and all made with care and passion. Prices seem too low for this quality of a product and service. I was fortunate enough to meet Joe, one of the owners and driving force behind this place.  What a treasure he is.  I had heard good things from a  friend who use to live here and went on Saturdays.  I will go back when I am in the area.  Take CASH. You will need about $15 for sandwich sides and a large drink with some left over for a tip (and the ladies deserve it).  Great place.
