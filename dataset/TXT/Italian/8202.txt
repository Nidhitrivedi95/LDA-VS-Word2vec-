0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw I love the food and the atmosphere at Joe's.  I have been going there for a long time (my sister found it before the DD&D show) and I have always loved going there.  I would have given 5 stars, except the last two times I have been there the lines have been HORRIBLE.  

I don't mind waiting in a line when I think the restaurant is doing everything it can to get me through it, but both times I have waited in a line for over 30 minutes they have had ONLY one register open. Once was on a Wednesday night, and once was in the middle of the day!  JOE, if you read this, make sure that if the line is out the door you get them to run both registers.  The food came out quickly, so I know the cooks weren't busy.  I would rather wait at the table a little longer for my food and have one of those cooks taking orders.  At least then I am sitting down.

As for the food, it's great.  Love the BBQ Chicken Salad, the pizzas, all of their chicken sandwiches, burgers and the onion rings, the sweet potato fries (dipped in their homemade ranch, yum!) and even the beet salad are great.   But come prepared to wait in line!!
