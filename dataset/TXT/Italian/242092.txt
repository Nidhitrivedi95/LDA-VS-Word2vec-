UlSvQqRRzrqRy5i5hHlQaA It's been forever since we stepped into a Carrabba's! We came here for dinner on Saturday night. I called ahead and while they do not accept reservations they can put your name on their list before you head out to shorten any waiting times. At around 5:15 it was moderately busy and by the time we left it was pretty packed with patrons.

We started with the arancini. These little fried rice balls were perfectly cooked with a crispy outer coating, tender rice, and sausage. The marinara sauce with them was robust and went well with them.

The other entrees were nicely presented and for the most part everyone was happy with them. The fish dishes (Salmon and mahi mahi) had a smoky flavor to them from the use of cherry and oak wood on the grill. The only slight negative for my mahi mahi dish was that the artichokes in the sauce were cold compared to the temperature of the fish.

Dessert was a hefty portion of tiramisu. Creamy, chocolate deliciousness!

Service was excellent. Our waitress was cheerful, friendly, and had good knowledge of the menu. Drinks were filled as needed, and were plates taken away in good time.

If you are like smoky flavored foods cooked on a grill, this is a great choice for service and food quality.
