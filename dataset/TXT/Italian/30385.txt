The setting is beautiful, the staff was friendly and kind, but even after adding salt, the food was lacking flavor. The capresa salad tasted like balsamic vinaigrette. I tried to scrape it off, but it wouldn't go away. Then I ordered the seafood special. It was sold to me as a white wine based dish, but when it came to the table it was swimming in a creamy pink sauce. I would never order seafood in a red sauce, but that's how it came. The fish was bland and tasted more like tomato that what it was. It had no acid flavor to it and was completely disappointed. I ended up eating the caprese salad over the rest of my pasta dinner.
