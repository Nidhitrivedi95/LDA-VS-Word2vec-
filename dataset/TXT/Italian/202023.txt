Q1L_Nb1QsD0S9pbng5-kMQ The place was packed on a Saturday Night. and they have good reviews. so the average local likes this place. Now when it comes to Italian food (or Mexican food) with me - I am not your average local. I was born, raised and FED Italian food my entire childhood. I come from a big Italian family, most everyone cooks, including me. so read my review with that in mind. It was ok food. I wouldn't say it was great. MAYBE I could say it was good, but then it might sound as though I am approving how they make the Italian dishes. And I do not. For starters, we ordered an antipasto dish that was suppose to include Mortadella - an expensive Italian ham. It did not. It had Food Lion brand ham. It also had processed turkey roll on the plate. You dont ever under any circumstance put turkey, never mind turkey roll, on an Italian antipasto plate. period. Then came my Shrimp Scampi entree. I wasn't impressed. I couldn't taste any garlic in it at all. I couldn't taste any butter. The lemon you could taste. And my fettuccine I am not so sure was fettuccine...you know those noodles you get in Cambells chicken soup? I got that.  So while the service was good, and the place packed, I have to tell you the food was ok at best.  If you are from a part of the US where Italians live in abundance and you have been eating good Italian food, you may want to skip this place. If you think Pizza hut is perfectly acceptable food, come on in, you'll love this place.
