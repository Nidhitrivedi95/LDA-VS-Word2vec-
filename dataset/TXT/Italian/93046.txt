Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag Maybe it was just an off day, but the pizza we ordered was just mediocre. The bruschetta was AMAZING, so we had high hopes for our main course, but it fell flat. The cheese didn't taste very fresh and I honestly felt like I could have ordered from one of the stand alone shops on the strip and had a similar result. However, the service was excellent. I would give this place another chance, but I won't go running back.
