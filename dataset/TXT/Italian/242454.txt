umxki_So2--o08q9bkXK6Q I stopped in very quickly for lunch, it has a really nice authentic and modern feel. I ordered pepperoni slices to go, it was very quick about 10 minutes and the girl at the front desk was very friendly! I have never been so she was helpful with the menu while I was trying to figure out what I wanted. I would defiantly like to try it again for a full meal!
