Walking into this place it feels like you've stepped back into Miami Vice (its an old TV show from the 80's for the youngsters). It's fun and I appreciate that more so than places without any decorations. I'd also like to point out that service was awesome. Both the greeter and our waiter were very nice. 

The pizza made me want to cry. For starters I appreciate that you can create whatever you want and we made one half of our pizza pepperoni, mushrooms and ricotta and the other half was ham, sausage and pineapples. When we went to pick up our slices, they both drooped (a lot, like half the slice). It was like eating wet and uncooked dough. Not only did that happen but the flavors weren't great either. Everything was bland. With each bite I regretted the carbs. Finished my slice and just felt sad. 

So I ask myself on every sad review, what was good? My free Coke with a yelp checkin and the service. That's it and I have to say this was one of the worst pizza experiences ever.
