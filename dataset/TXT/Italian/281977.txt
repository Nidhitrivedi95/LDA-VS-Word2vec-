yxQsedCcjJEfqhC7u8Rl0A Alioli has become a regular stop for myself and my friends. Service is beyond reproach; and the quality of their food is impeccable. If you get a chance ask for Tony and let him take care of your menu for you.  You won't be disappointed. One suggestion, the veal chop is to die for.
