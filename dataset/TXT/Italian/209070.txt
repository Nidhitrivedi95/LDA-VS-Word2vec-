qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg My family and I love going to this place because of the lunch special. It's affordable when you have more than 2 people. Their gyros are good and I love their Greek salad. I haven't gone on the weekend yet but I know for sure their food are delicious. Customer service is up there. Staff is friendly and courteous. I would definitely go back which I have done.
