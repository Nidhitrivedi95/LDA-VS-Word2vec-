e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw My boyfriend and I came to dinner here with another couple last weekend while we were in Vegas. We wanted to do a fancy dinner at a romantic restaurant. This place definitely captures that mood. However, the food was decent. It's better to make your own entree rather than picking from their menu, which doesn't have that much of a selection. They are pretty accommodating to your taste though. Dessert was probably the best part. The restaurant is kind of loud because it's so small so you can't hear the music playing or anything. The one thing that was a bit annoying was that no table has just one waiter. We were served by 5 different people, which was a pain. Next time we're in Vegas, we'll probably try something else.
