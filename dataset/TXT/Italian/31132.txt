5nZVVPO_cYH9aQeClTP9zA I work right by this location and I've always been pleased with the service. But today I called to order lunch, on my very short lunch break. They asked me to hold briefly and I agreed. After 5 minutes (no exaggeration, I checked the call time on my phone) they finally picked the phone back up. Even then I was still patient and ready to order. So I tell them again that I'll be placing an order for pick up, and they ask me to hold again. So I let them know I had already waited 5 minutes to order, and he still pushed to have me hold AGAIN. When I only have 30 minutes for lunch and I'll still have to wait another 10-15 for them to make my food, I don't have time to hold over and over. Needless to say, I've crossed them off of the list of places for lunch in the area.
