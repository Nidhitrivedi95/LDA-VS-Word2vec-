nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A I was looking for a quiet place to do a web meeting during my trip and saw this place so I stopped in.  I took a seat on the couches in the bar area and quickly ordered an ice tea and some cannoli.  Once my meeting started, the server checked in on me quietly once or twice to refill my ice tea.  I didn't realize that he didn't know I was in my meeting already.  Oops.  Anyway, this was a nice place to sit and relax away from the crowds in the shops area.  The cannoli was a treat, which I enjoyed one and took the other back to my hotel for a late night snack.  I'll have to try Buddy V's place again so I can check out the whole menu next time.
