anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg The finest restaurant I have eaten at in Las Vegas. Off the beaten path, the service was excellent and the food was excellent. Very nice old style atmosphere which was quiet enough to hold nice conversations with family at the table. Prices are comparable with other high end restaurants, but you don't feel like you are at a production line. Would definitely come back and recommend to others visiting Vegas.
