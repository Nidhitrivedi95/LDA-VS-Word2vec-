_OimUEl0DzPg6GtJXYeoJw I have always loved Piada food. I must confess myself disappointed in this location. I can't really point to anything necessarily... the service was a little slow but not horrible. The restraunt looks okay... Compared with the Kettering Dayton location where service service is fast and friendly and the restaurant is always clean... this location falls short.
