At a whopping $2.25 per topping (on a medium, adjust for a small or large), I'd consider saving the extra $5 and running over to market district to get my own vegetables. Understandable for cured meats and specialty toppings, sausage, pepperoni etc. but why am I paying the price plus tax for the full pepper or some thin sliced onion on half my pizza?
