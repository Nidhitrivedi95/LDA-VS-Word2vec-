6LR0Eg5EAMEIES7CY7ITOg Just had a family dinner there tonight on a Monday evening.
I was starving and ordered the pizza Canadese - the crust was nice and thin; very crispy, but interestingly enough, the toppings were hardly wilted down by any cheese - it was straight up mushrooms, green bell peppers and pepperoni.  The pepperoni was a little crispy, but my daughter can't stand mushrooms or bell peppers, so that was a bust.  The saving grace was the half order of pasta our waiter suggested - spagettini with their meat sauce.  It was fine for her nearly 3 year old palate, so I was pleased with that.  The bread was soft and chewy but not warmed.  The service was lovely - the silverware was not - the fork/knife/spoon all had shmutz on them.  I will not go back to Ferraro's because now I know with 100% certainty that I prefer the pizza at Terroni.  At the end of the meal, our waiter brought complimentary "S" cookies for our little girl and Double Bubble gum for my husband and myself.
