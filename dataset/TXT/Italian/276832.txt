yGd87bkFijZ6YHrHtW5maA Possibly the worst Thai place ever. I ordered through grubhub and regret all of it. My food was cold, tasted old, and was soggy. When I called the store the manager was rude and refused to give me the number to call to get a refund on my order. I looked the number up myself and the lady for grubhub customer service was very nice and helped me get a refund. The restaurant will not stop blowing up my phone and when I finally talked to the manager he said he was going to show up at my house and "taste" the food. An employee actually showed up to my door and was pounding on the door. I didn't open the door, but it was beyond rude and frightening for a person who lives by herself. I advice everyone to stay away.
