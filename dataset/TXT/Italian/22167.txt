3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A I love that Enoteca Sociale serves up real Italian portions in antipasti, primi, secondi in a casual setting and the food was great. Definitely recommend but my only concern was that their pasta was harder than most fresh made pasta and they were overcooked by 1 minute, cuz I prefer my pasta al dente.
