FXiPQQGr_2bwlJ4wOrW2eA Just finished an incredible dinner!  We were a party of 20 and the restaurant was able to accommodate us with no issue.  Service was top notch.  They were on top of everything.

We started with cocktails and a few passed appetizers.  I ordered a belvedere vodka with soda and lime.  The drink was perfectly prepared.  My husband was impressed with their beer selection as they had a few quite unique options.  Others commented on their wine selection and how good the house red was.

Everyone enjoyed their meals.  I started with a half of their chopped salad and for my entree I had the Chicken Milanese  (the menu has veal but I opted for chicken).  It was perfectly and lightly fried in what seems to be a panko like breading.  Served with sautéed mixed vegis and roasted potatoes that tasted great!  My nephew had the chicken parm and he devoured it until he was able to lick his plate clean!  No dessert for this girl but those that did order made me jealous!  They serve assorted sorbet and gelato's along with tiramisu and other awesome looking sweet treats!

Arrive early for a cocktail in their quaint bat area.  You can enter from the back parallel with the Summerlin Pkwy if you wish to avoid the casino and hotel area.
