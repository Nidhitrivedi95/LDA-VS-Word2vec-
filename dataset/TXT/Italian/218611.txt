I ordered the chicken parmigiana  sub as an take out. it didn't wow me at all. Super thick bread and bland chicken and sauce. For an establishment that tries to seem like an hole in the wall Italian restaurant I wasn't convinced at all. Even though I never tried the pizza or anything else. But first impressions are everything to me. Nice try but new energy and food is needed.
