_mg5bYknpZgaWSfjQVmrJQ Way over-rated.  This location used to be good.  Now its a gamble on what you get.  The Chicago Steak calzone lacks the key ingredient....STEAK.  For a small its a little over over 12.00 there should be an even amount of steak throughout the calzone not a thin layer in the middle and a bunch of veggies.
