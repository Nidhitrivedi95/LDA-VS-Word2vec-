UFvLouGNq5q3w-0Ud_HP7w I gave the original Buddyz location 4 stars because the pizza was freaking awesome (even though the service was spotty). We were excited that this location was so much closer for us and the pizza is seriously just as good, but service just sucks. There seemed to be only two wait staff on duty for Fathers' Day (not that anybody would go out for lunch on Fathers' Day, right??). It honestly didn't look to be that busy, but it took FOREVER. Our actual waiter tried to make up for it after he realized we weren't that happy. The gal with the pretty hair would come by once in a while, ask what we needed and then never brought it.

It was a good 15 minutes before we even got water. Finally we had our wings, and eventually the pizza came. Except that they made one as deep dish instead of butter crust which we specifically ordered. So our choice was 1) skip the other pizza, 2) get the pizza after another 30 minute wait, or 3) let them make the right pizza while we ate the other and then take it to go. They did not offer any compensation for what was a major screw-up. If you want people to come back after that, offer free drinks, free dessert, the pizza for free - SOMETHING. Geez. There are other pizza places, people. And that's where we will be going next time.
