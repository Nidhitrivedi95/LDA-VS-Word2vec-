i1t1vBPEWkjPVEW9OoDH2A Delivery time was 11:30. Called at 12 to check on my order and was told it was just going in the oven and would be another 45 minutes to an hour until it was delivered. Told them to just cancel the order. And they got an attitude with me about it. Not to mention in the past they couldn't even bring me my entire order.
