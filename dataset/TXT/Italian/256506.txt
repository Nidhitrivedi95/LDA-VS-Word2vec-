w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q This is absolutely one of the BEST steakhouses I've ever been to! I ordered a filet mignon (medium) and it was very juicy and delish! my friends had the lobster and shrimp. The lobster was HUGE and tasted awesome and the shrimp was in this creamy sauce that was to die for! It is a bit noisy in that restaurant but overall the atmosphere was great!
