5jYYHTRka2SMS7zBOuN9RA If you're looking for quality pizza in Phoenix, look elsewhere. An entirely uninspiring pie. There are plenty of Italian places serving actual Neapolitan style pizza that is ten times better for the same price or cheaper. Cucina Cucina offers a pizza that is more cafeteria than DOP.  

The crust is fairly thick and puffy, and lacks the distinctive taste of a well fermented dough. The menu says it was cooked in a wood-fired oven, but it was missing the leopard spotting indicative of a high-temp environment. 

The sauce was also disappointing. The best sauces place fresh tomatoes at the front of the flavor profile. This sauce tasted like they couldn't be bothered to make different recipes for the pasta and the pizza. Spaghetti sauce on pizza sticks out like the sorest of thumbs.

All around low effort. The combination of arugula and prosciutto on their signature pie is one of my favorites, but even that couldn't save the experience. The margherita was worse, as the taste of the sauce was all too overpowering. Nothing stands out with these pizzas. You could get the same at any lazy chain restaurant that threw pizza on the menu as an afterthought. For an Italian place, low quality pizza is a no-go. Do yourself a favor and go to place that actually puts effort into the pizza. 

Combined with somewhat lousy service, there's no reason to order this pizza a second time. Especially with so many amazing pizzerias in just about every direction.If this is modern Italian, I'd rather stick with the tradition.
