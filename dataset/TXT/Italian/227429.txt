SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Awesome place to go! Was there had the spaghetti and meatballs. Waiter was cool. Very friendly; our friend got drunk and we still were able to finish our food once we got a can for him. 

Being next to the fountain makes it have a surreal feeling to it. Can't complain will go again.
