WNnkyVvBfY1vTqiqSufZQA I used to go to CIBO on King west location but tried the Yonge location for a friend birthday.
Don't recommend it at all:( we were group of 9 and reserved table in advanced but they sat us next to exit door and every second staff where going and coming from and opening the door each time made us froze all night; asked the servant to do something as it was really freezing and he said they can't do anything as they are using the door! 
Another disappointing point that my husband chose a 2013 bottle of wine and they silently brought 2014 and when my husband mentioned it to servant he simply said their menu is not updated and should be fixed.. to me it is a rip off to sell 2014 wine with 2014 price...
Overall would say pick other choices if you have other options.
