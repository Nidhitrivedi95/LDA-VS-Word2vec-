js9rQZAlA5rr7oSBRRcCDw Definitely going back.  I went there for the first time with a few friends and enjoyed everything: the ambiance, the service, the food, and even the prices!

I had made reservations for 7pm on a Thursday and when we got there the place was PACKED and I worried that our table reservation might be 'lost' or we would be made to wait, but nope!  A perfect table was waiting for us.  We had a great waiter (with an adorable Italian accent) but actually all the staff was very attentive, very professional and pleasant (not snooty)!  Their timing was perfect and they were almost psychic in knowing what we would want next and when.  Maybe I shouldn't be surprized but I was.  Everyone in my party loved our appetizers, main courses and desserts.  We enjoyed a very good pitcher of the pink Sangria, and finished off the night with decaf cappuccinos that were actually decaf!  The tables are close together and the place was noisy but what else would you expect on a busy night in Yorkville?  We had a great experience and never felt rushed to leave.  Definitely going back.
