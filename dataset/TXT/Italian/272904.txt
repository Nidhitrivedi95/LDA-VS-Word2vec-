XXXb0ANM2vU37VnAAZvlVQ I have been to this particular location for many years whenever I don't want to make dinner then a walk-in special (or two) is the perfect choice while on the way home.

The space is large & bright but, most importantly, it is kept clean.

The owner is really nice and if you have been waiting around for your pizza longer than you should then he tries to make up for it by throwing in a dipping sauce or two. :-)
