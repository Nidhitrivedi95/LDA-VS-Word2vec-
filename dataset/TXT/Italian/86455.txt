dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg It'd been a while since I sat in and ate at this location. This time I called an order in. 

I called to order a roast beef thing, but completely forgot that it was Streets of NY that has that thing...that number 10. I decided to just go with it and ordered the Big Beef. It's super spicy, but I had the poblano peppers and habernaro mayo left off. (Technically, I didn't know the mayo was spicy. It was the waitress on the phone who suggested that it be left off and I'm glad she did...I wanted no heat!) I asked for mushrooms to be added .89c extra. The phone service was great, friendly and accommodating. 

I get to the place and open the back door and greeted by a super friendly waitress who asked me if I came for a pick up. She was getting menus from the outside area. She grabbed them and said follow me. I went to a station inside where she told me someone would be right with me. Another person said, "I'll be right with you." They assisted me seconds later. 

The Big Beef is MASSIVE. (Two meals) Tons of meat and cheese. Served with waffle fries AND a side of coleslaw. I was speechless! 

I got it home and like I said, couldn't eat the whole thing. It was tasty, flavorful, filling and worth every penny! ($12 and some change) Great service, great food. So glad I decided to go with this order when I realized it was the wrong place. I WILL BE BACK!
