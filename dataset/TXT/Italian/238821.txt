My friend wanted to order red velvet cake for dessert she was informed it's only an option on the price fix menu. She also asked for mozzarella cheese on top of her pasta and was told no. Like I'm sorry since when is the chefs ego more important than the customers prefrence. Like get over yourself. Also while the decor is aesthetically pleasing the music is way too loud you can not have dinner conversation. It's a restaurant not a club. Unfortunately the restrictions are what left the lasting, bitter, taste in my mouth and therefore I will not be returning nor recommending the resturant.
