Fresh veggies, great cheese and tomatoes, crust with just the right chew. Perfect. And the beer and beverage options are fantastic. I had a Genziana beer imported from Italy. Hints of chocolate and malt. Great pairing to the pies.
When they have gelato too. It brings back great memories of places I've been in Italy.
