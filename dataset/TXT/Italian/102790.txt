FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Our server recommended us to try the Sunday night tapas and surely, it was an amazing recommendation.

I'll point out some of my favourite dishes from my meal - but I pretty much enjoyed every dish they had on the tapas menu :P
Loved: 
the vichyssoise with truffle oil, seared branzino, corn soup with chili oil (SO GOOD! The spiciness adds a unique flavour too it!)

The cheese platter display was really pretty and was also very tasty. It was crispy on the outside while the cheese is sizzling hot in the inside. They also had a few sauces to dip it in.
The dessert had 3 parts to it: chocolate mousse (shot), strawberry shortcake and mango mousse (shot).
The chocolate mousse was a little too sweet for me but the mango mousse was perfect!
