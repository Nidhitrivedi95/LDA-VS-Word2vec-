366FaRQ1MWEHBhaEKTcriQ Ordered pizza and a side salad from here to be delivered to the Sleepy Dog Brewery right down the street  while I'm in town for work.

Person taking my order over the phone was friendly and energetic. Pizza took a bit longer than I would've expected to be delivered to a place a mile away, especially since it was a Tuesday night.

The food itself was very good (I had the thin crust Chicago) and I was happy to share it with another patron and staff at the brewery. Would eat there again if I were back in, although may try it out dining in or something.
