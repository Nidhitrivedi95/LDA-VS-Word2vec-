-raUM9T-1dKPiB5_vRmFYA I read other peoples reviews and it bothers me. Every place has good and not so good reviews and that is fine. But, in my opinion and my opinion only, unless you have worked the front and the back of the house, only then you can judge the attitude of a restaurant. I as a customer have bad attitude too some times. Not every day I am all smiles and high spirits. My cousin owned restaurants in this town and I have periodically worked there. Maybe is me, but I don't go to Luke's for their cleaned toilet, I have that in my office. I go there for their great food. I don't worry that the area is not great. I called south Phoenix home for many years. It is nothing wrong with 16th street and Indian School. There are better restaurants in worse areas of this town. Luke's  roast beef with all the extras is the best I ever had. Support the little guy, the local restaurant. Yes, the big boys can build bigger and better places, but personally I don't go to a place for the decorations on the wall. I go there for their food. And I review based on how good their food is.
