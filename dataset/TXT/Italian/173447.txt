N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg Came here with my husband and two friends on a Friday night at 5:50, waited and was seated at 7:10. The wait wasn't too bad since we expected it and we were able to stand inside and grab a beer by the bar. We ordered the large malnati classic deep dish, hot wings, and the family size malnati salad. The salad was great and had nice big chunks of cheese and bacon and the dressing flavor was really good and well tossed and mixed into the entire salad. The wings weren't anything special but the sauce was pretty good and we enjoyed them. We were all so excited to try this famous maltani classic deep dish pizza and when it came out and we tasted it, it was really disappointing. The pizza wasn't hot with stringy cheese and tons of sauce, but was rather flat and the crust was wet and doughy. We asked our server if the pizza was supposed to be like that and he looked at it and said it did look under cooked and went to grab a manager. The manager came and looked at the pizza and said that's what the pizzas looked like and pointed to the soggy dough and said "that's all the sauce right there", but it wasn't saucy, so we weren't sure what exactly she was talking about. The atmosphere is really fun and inviting. The pizza is really nothing to rave over and if all the pizzas tasted like the one we ate, I'm really not sure why people like this place for pizza. Not sure if I would come back because this was a real disappointment. I was hoping for something better than Pizza Hut, but what we got today did not leave a lasting impression
