0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw If you see a long line... just keep driving.  It will not move fast.  This place has good food but the service is so slow!  Got in line at 11:30 and didn't sit down with our food until 12:45.  Granted it was a Saturday, but over an hour wait is a little ridiculous if you ask me.
