so so different and wonderful!
I honestly cannot write enough good things
First, the food is so different and tasty
We had the smoked tomato and mozzerela salad with the pliable oil and it was delicious! Great to share and local Ontario produce! Does it get much better?
I had the steak and my boyfriend had the lamb meatballs. Again, so tasty and different. Full of flavour and I love the use of different Ontario produce.
The desserts were AMAZING! I had the movie snacks and the Twizzler sauce.. WOW! 
MY boyfriend had the mock apple pie! This was one of the coolest desserts ever!!
The waiter was great, so personable and really made the evening wonderful
Also, considering the unique food and how different it is, the prices are really quite fair. We had the 2 most expensive entrees and alcohol and the bill was around $100 for two!
I will definitely be returning!! We both loved it
