93FVxoipAIYG07gisMOQhw I had a wonderful experience on Saturday night. We went around 6 pm and it was getting pretty busy but the server sat us right away. 
They have a hostess but she wasn't the one to seat us. The server was very busy but still helpful.  I ordered the seafood linguine but I didn't want the sauces they offered so she quickly helped to come up with a butter garlic sauce and the kitchen did a fabulous job with it. I loved the breads that came with the meal as well as the side salad. 
I am definitely coming back.
