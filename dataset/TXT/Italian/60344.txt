aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA I was in town for the state basketball championship and had heard good things about Ian's pizza, so I decided to try it. The first slice of pizza I had was the sriracha chicken and it was disturbingly bland for a supposedly spicy piece of pizza. The second slice I had was the bbq pulled pork. This slice did have a taste, but it was not of bbq or pulled pork. The environment was loud and very busy. Overall it was not worth the $4 per slice and the wait.
