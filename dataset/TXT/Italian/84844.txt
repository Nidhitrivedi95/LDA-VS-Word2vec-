DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA Absolutely DISGUSTING. I was visiting a friend in Arizona, and thought it'd be cool to eat there for lunch since I saw Kitchen Nightmares. I didn't know what to expect, but I thought it wouldn't be as bad as the experience I had. I ordered the blue ribbon burger and my friend ordered the garlic chicken mushroom pizza. It took forever for our food to come, and our food was definitely not worth the wait. My burger was undercooked and complicated, and my friend's pizza was undercooked and doughy. The owners were loud and angry, which is why we did not make a complaint. The restaurant was clean and looked nice. But sadly, it's food was bad, and the owners were worse.
