pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ We had 5:30 reservations at Nora's Cuisine for dinner, for my birthday (11/17). Good thing too - by 6:00 it was packed!
This is an Italian place on W Flamingo & Jones, in a strip mall. It gets very good reviews on yelp and TA, has reasonable prices and they do my favorite dish - Veal Marsala. I had signed up for email specials and had a coupon for 1 free appetizer and dessert and another coupon for 10% off. They accepted both coupons! The dining room is all tables and chairs with butcher paper topped white tablecloths. The entire ceiling is covered in trinacria (the 3-legged symbol on the Sicilian flag). Casual enough for jeans. The lady at the next table was also celebrating her birthday, today! Again, small world. She said I had to try the Berry Explosive - she was RIGHT! The food was the best Italian we've had in 20 years - I kid you not - I wish I could write a description of how it tastes besides saying OMG it was good!

Garlic Bread
Arancini (4) for an appetizer
Crazy Alfredo for hubby
Veal Marsala for me
Tiramisu for dessert
Berry Explosive (I'm hooked - it went well with the meal too - go figure)
Jack for hubby

The bill came to $49.00 - deal of the century for food & drink this good! I'll never come to LV again without eating at least one meal here.
