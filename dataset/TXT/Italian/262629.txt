WtkzllWKYCEmN85E7fMBUw I hate to do this. I do. Because I was ecstatic I found another good place to fill my belly. But unfortunately the past few times, the quality of the food has been bad.

I don't know what gives! I've ordered pasta previously and it was amazing! And although it came in a tin container the presentation was great. Penne pasta, sauce on top. Unmixed. With cheese and parsley. The way it should be at your prices!

The most recent order, the pasta was way over cooked. Most of it was broken. And the sauce was so watery and it was all mixed up with no cheese. 

Also, I ordered their BBQ wings...the sauce made me want to puke! It was sour! It didn't taste like BBQ sauce at all. It even smelled sour.. Ive ordered your wings before, and they were perfection. No other words to describe them. They were crispy, and they had plenty of sauce. 

And if you're going to charge almost $5 for a piece of frozen tirimisu...it should at least look decent...

And they changed their portions as far as the poutine goes. In the past Ive paid $6 for poutine and got a huge circular tin of it. This time, the tin is half the size and its hardly even full.

Lastly, the fried zucchini. Zucchini is NO where near being expensive. So you charge $5 for (I shit you not) 5 strips of fried zucchini?? That's crazy.. I used to get a least a handful or so from you guys. 

I waited a long time to give an update. We used to order from these 1-2 times a week. Cause I was really hoping that these guys were just having a rough patch.. But it appears another gem in the rough lost its sparkle. 

Im done with these guys.
