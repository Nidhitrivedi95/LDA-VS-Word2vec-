pvCcrHFAGCml492qoQBsQg Based on the yelp reviews we had to check this place out since we were in the area. At first when we walked in we couldn't figure out if we should sit and someone will take our order, or do we order first. If your wondering you must order first, pay, take a seat and someone will yell out your name and bring out your platter.

We ordered the basic panzerotti and added pepperoni and green peppers (for an additional cost). We also shared the lasagna. The lasagna was good but I highly recommend the panzerotti it was fantastic. The dough and ingredients they use are fresh I was completely stuffed. Make sure you bring an appetite.
