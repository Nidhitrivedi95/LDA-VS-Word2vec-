-L88B-PrtzwujhLuYc2k_g To summarize; good food, great service, and incredible decor!

I came here on a Friday night with some coworkers for Winterlicious 2017. I was surprised by the size of this restaurant as the decor was very retro with an Italian vibe to it. After our orders were taken, we received some bread, olive oil and vinegar (my advice is to split the bread in two and dip it into the olive oil / vinegar to let the bread soak in all the juices). We also got their Chardonnay VQA white wine as it was a Friday night and we wanted to enjoy our happy hour (lol).

FOOD:
For the appetizer, I chose the Butternut Squash Soup. It was delicious and creamy with a good mixture of flavours and textures with each bite. For the main course, I ordered the Veal Shank. The veal was very juicy and tender and melts in your mouth with every bite. I also added salt, pepper and parmesan cheese to expand the flavours! For dessert, I got the cheesecake covered with lemon and strawberry sauce. It was beyond my expectation as this was one of the best cheesecakes I've had! (Maybe the lemon and strawberry sauce added a bit of zest to it lol).

Overall, I enjoyed this restaurant! Given their wide selection and reasonable prices, I would definitely come here again to try other things on their menu.
