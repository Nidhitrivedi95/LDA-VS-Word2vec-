MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg My husband was 3rd in line at their grand opening to get a weekly free pizza for a year. So we should be visiting this wonderful neighborhood establishment at least on a monthly basis. 

The employees are very helpful from when they greet you at the door and when leaving the restaurant. 

Our first visit to Plantones was right before the grand opening. I guess it is common place for many restaurants to do this for training purposes as the employees were getting acclimated to their new environment. During this first visit, a few mistakes were made, but to our advantage. My husband had ordered a 10" pizza with chicken pesto and all the veggies except jalapeños. Instead, they made the large pizza and added jalapeños. No big deal since they didn't charge us extra for the large pizza and we could easily pick off the jalapeños.

On our second visit, the first Friday to claim our free pizza, it was right at lunch time. Big mistake. Super busy. We waited in line for a good 13-minutes.  I almost feel that this could be improved as there are two windows.  So because it took so long to get through the line, I expected a long wait on our pizza as well.  I actually turned on the stop watch on my phone, went to the nice and clean restroom, got back to the table and within 4-mins and some seconds of waiting, the pizza arrived. Now this time does not include getting a drink and finding a table. So if anything, it took no more than 6-mins, which is still really good considering the lunch crowd.

Be sure to save room for dessert. The cannoli and tiramisu is fabulous.

Also, be sure to order a drink. They have the fun coke machines. So far, my husband's favorite concoction is strawberry vanilla coke.

Great start Plantones! Keep up the good work.
