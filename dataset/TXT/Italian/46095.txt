8pmGz3Lg4f_r7HdDZPa4dQ We dropped by last night and we're lucky to meet Vinny.  He's a great guy.  Very friendly and helpful and full of helpful suggestions.  We started with zucchini rounds and garlic...Absolutely delicious.   We cleaned the plate.  Next NY style pizza.  Yummy.   I am a fan of Hawaiian style but often disappointed because many places go sparingly on pineapple.   Their version had the perfect ratio of ham and pineapple.   Vinny checked back often to ensure all was well.   We are only visiting a week but are heading back on Thursday to sample his lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs.   Highly recommend!
