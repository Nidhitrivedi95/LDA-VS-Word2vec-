VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w Been wanting to try this place for some time to see what was up.. the only thing I can say is that I'm sorry.. so sorry for not coming here sooner. Yes, this place is in the hood and is smaller than a postage stamp but is so good that you can brave the seedy location for one night. 

There are several pasta's on the menu but only a handful are handmade. We had the gnocci in the vodka sauce as well as the cheese ravioli.. come on, these are so good.. like crazy yummy good! The creamy sauce paired well with the perfectly prepared pasta's.. eyes were rolled back into our heads!! 

For our main course we ordered the meatball Metro.. this pizza is HUGE.. check out the pics! for 25 bucks this monster is worth every penny.. sweet chunky tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella and little chunks of meatball.. the crust was a little bit salty in a good way.. the crust could have been enjoyed on its own! 

In the end this place so many wonderful elements.. fast personal service, great pricing and wonderful eats. Its a real winner!! Cant wait to try the new location over on our side of town.
