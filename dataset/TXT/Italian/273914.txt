Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A I purchased the Groupon deal which was 42 bucks for a buffet and drink package for two.  We went on a Friday night for the Crabs.  The crabs were excellent, but the rest of the food was not that great.  Not many vegetables on the Mongolian grille side, Waitress Corina was great, couldn't ask for a better waitress.  Desserts were terrible, Ice milk or Ice cream was served.
Needs much improvement
