-RIWE3MU3GCHM5KIW7PLww I really wanted to love or at least like this place a lot considering I've just moved into the neighborhood.  My tastebuds & I were so excited to try this place after reading the rave reviews.  The place is very charming inside & I can appreciate the live music, however, I wasn't expecting the music to be blaring to the point where it ruined the meal & experience for me.  I think the hostess should let people know that there is I've music, especially mid-week (the entertainment started 10/15 minutes after we were seated) so we were slightly caught off guard.  Our server was lovely, however, the younger-ish (30s)  server lady seem offended that I mentioned the volume for the small number of people in the restaurant.  The volume was set for a packed house. The server responded with "that's just the volume it always is".  A second couple was seated next to us & moved less than 5 minutes into their visit. The severs seemed bothered that they moved on their own without being seated. But it was just so loud, so I could totally understand.

Still hoping the pasta carbonara & Alfredo would make up for it we stayed with high hopes.  The shrimp was fresh and very good however the pancetta you could barely taste and the Alfredo was a bit runny. 

Phoenix is really up & coming in w/places like The Parlor, Federal Pizza, and Pizza Heaven (which have really upped the ante in the "to die for" quality department.)   I was hoping to find that same atmosphere & deliciousness close to my new home. I'm bummed that my first visit didn't result in a 5 star review.
