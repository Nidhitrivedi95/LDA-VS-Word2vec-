8yoe08nCUpjDQ56Y9qVPKg The guy at the window is rude. The Italian Beef for 7.00 lacks the real condiments.  They are cutting corners and your not supposed to say anything. Get yelled at if you call it out.
When you say Sweet peppers and hot peppers.
It's not green bell peppers and jalapeños.  That's not Chicago that's Mexico. Sorry taking my 10.00 else where. And it's because your lacking honesty about the food. 
* sweet and hot peppers  are ball peppers.  
You can't throw on Jalapeños and think someone who has been to Chicago doesn't notice.
