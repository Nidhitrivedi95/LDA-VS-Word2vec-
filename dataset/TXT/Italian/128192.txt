HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA Came here with a group of friends last night. All of us but 1 have never been here so we were all excited to try out this place our friend was raving about. Parking is scarce, so it was a good thing most of us carpooled. The restaurant isn't really big, but was big enough to have 2 parties of 10 and a couple of extra tables for other guests. 

Being a fan of the Food Network shows, I was pleased to find that Dining, Drive-Ins & Dives was here....so naturally, I ordered what Guy ordered. 

Suicide Fries:  Fries smothered in a hot pepper blend and habanero-garlic sauce. Topped with sliced jalapenos and yellow peppercinni. 
   I wasn't too thrilled with it because the fries were wet and soggy. I have to note that the sauce they used was the same sauce they used on their 'suicide' hot wings. The sauce had a nice heat and kick to it, with a nice, smoky flavor.

Guinea Pie Pizza: Grandma's meatballs, spinach, ricotta, white garlic sauce and mozzarella.
   I ordered the smallest one they had, the 1/4 sheet. Man! It's HUGE! I swear it can feed a whole family! I had about one slice which was really good. The dough is homemade and I was told that the chef grows his own herbs, which is a big plus! 

Why 3 Stars? 
1. The fries were soggy. Not because it was smothered in the sauce, but because the fries wasn't crunchy to start with.
2. The wait for a table. It was a long ass wait.
3. The restaurant was dimly lighted. The guy standing in the front, behind the register, didn't even have lights to see. It wasn't until we were about to leave(11:30pm) that someone figured out that they should turn on some lights for the restaurant!
