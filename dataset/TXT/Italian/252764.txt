VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w had an amazing meal here this past weekend. the service was great and the waiters were very attentive. ordered the lobster Benedict, meatball and spaghetti, and the louie salad. everything was outstanding! the Louie salad had an amazing dressing and tasted so fresh. love the croissants and mini blueberry muffins they bring out at the beginning of the meal.
