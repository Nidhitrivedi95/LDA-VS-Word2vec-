FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Postino is probably my favorite go to spot whenever I'm in good ole AZ.  

I make it a point to stop by here once or twice every single time.  $5 wine glasses and amazing plates of bruschetta.  I've had pretty much every single type of bruschetta and have not been disappointed.  

The wine menu is extensive as they have something for every palate.  Service has always been excellent.  Outdoor and indoor seating.  Parking lot but street parking is also available. 

What can I say?  I love this spot!
