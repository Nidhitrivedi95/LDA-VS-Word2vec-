k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw The food was great. It's lovely to see a vegetarian lasagne on the menu! The ambiance was lovely with mood lighting and a talented pianist. The family behind the establishment has a fascinating history which they share through the menu. Our waiter was very friendly and patient. Overall we had a great time here and the only thing which would make it better was if it were a little cheaper. Thank you. :)
