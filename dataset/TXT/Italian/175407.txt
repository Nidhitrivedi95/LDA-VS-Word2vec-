nebRKfau_9iTxRDR6WGj9A I just think it's a load of crap that someone can enter into the karaoke competition STILL,  after 4 rounds? If they were still looking for more candidates, then they shouldn't have made the other rounds mandatory for those who were already in.
I think it's crap that there were 6 more rounds which meant a total of 10, but when I asked before I entered, I was told that there was only going to be 3 or 4.
I also thought it was odd that on Saturday (competition nights were Wednesday) I texted "Kuya Ray" & asked if I made it to the next round, & was replied with a "yes," then the very next day, I text "Kuya Ray" another question regarding the karaoke contest,  but this time he had no idea who I was?
I would have continued if it all wasn't so shady, fishy, & suspicious.
Also, the 1st time I sang,  our tab had drinks that weren't ours. Only reason I came back was because of the karaoke comp. But now I realize it's just that whole bar. Your customer service sucks. A thousand thumbs down.
