l8SNag-Ii0YUeSGHkA3Vhw Decent Italian food, dimly lit space, OK service, and fairly crowded on most nights. What's missing? More attentive service, creative inspiration for the menu (standard ingredients on oven-burning pizzas, pastas, and salads), and get rid of those TVs! I was enjoying a candle-lit dinner at a corner table by the window and all I could see was a boxing match glaring on the big screen while club-type music was blasting in the background. Total mismatch! The space has great potential for this neighborhood (whose other upscale-casual restaurants are a bit stuffy) and it is well-decorated but the TVs have got to go and they need a new DJ.
