Good service. Antipasto was very good, nice selection of meat/cheeses. Sautéed mushrooms appetizer is worth passing on. Had veal and chicken francaise and both were tender but sauce was very heavy vs brothy,lemony, buttery it should be.  Theirs was more like the consistency of a hollandaise sauce.
Good dessert.
Overall good, I just live across town and came after a Rebel game cuz it was close to T&M. Would I travel across town? No, would I stop by if I was within 10 minute drive-yes.
