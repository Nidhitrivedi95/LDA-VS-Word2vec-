60uVlCUiLJvq3xNo_3bhQQ Very good pizza! We are Chicago pizza type family, but on our way to wet n wild we noticed this place and stopped in. We were highly impressed! While sitting there we noticed lots of take our customers which made us feel good that they had a good customer base. The lasagna pizza was great but very filling. We'll be back for more!
