My wife and I like the salads because the veggies are fresh and meats are excellent. The atmosphere is very friendly and the volume of people talking makes it feel like a happening place, without having to raise your voice to talk. I think the friendly atmosphere starts with the wait and host staff as soon as you walk in the door until  I you leave. There are plenty of TVs, beers on tap and bottled, and other excellent dishes.
