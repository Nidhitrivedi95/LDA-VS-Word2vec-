P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw Great pizza.  Lousy business. They just decided to stop serving at 11pm.  Major fail.  This town is a 24 hr town. I've made a ritual of getting naked city pizza at least 2 times a month after work. I work second shift. Off at 1130 pm.  Wtf!  This will hurt MoonDoggie's bar business too.  It's just bad business.  Basically a F U to anyone on second shift!! I've seen this literally kill other badly managed business here in Vegas. At l say stay open till 1am or 2!!   Who is this lazy and stupid?
