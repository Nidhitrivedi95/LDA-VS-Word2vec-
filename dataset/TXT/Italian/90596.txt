eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA Went here for Easter brunch with my wife and a good friend. We sat outside on the patio and had a wonderful meal. The service was extremely courteous and friendly. Our food was served pretty quickly, and most importantly, it was delicious. We split an appetizer of bacon and tomato jam bruschetta with ricotta cheese and I would do it again in a heartbeat. I wish I could have taken a jar of that jam home with me. It was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten. For my main course I had Gorgonzola-crusted lamb chops. They were cooked medium well, I asked for medium, but they were still great. The Gorgonzola crust was delicious and the mashed potatoes on the side were also quite good. It's a little pricey for brunch, but if you're not on a budget this is an excellent choice.
