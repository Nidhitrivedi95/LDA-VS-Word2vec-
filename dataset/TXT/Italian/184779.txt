OIdOJaNS8M624F58XGV3PQ I've always enjoyed Pizza Libretto - ever since they had the one location on Ossington. I like the Danforth location because they accept reservations. 

We usually order a round of Margharita pizzas - can't go wrong with a classic! My only one complaint is that sometimes the pizza is not consistent - i.e. with four margharitas coming to the table, 1 will look totally different (i.e. in terms of amount of cheese, how well done the crust is). Even with that, I think Libretto has the best pizza in the city. Add to that exceptional service and a decent price point, and we'll certainly back (probably on a weekly basis).
