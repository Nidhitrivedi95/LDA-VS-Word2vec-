This is an all-wood-paneling-sound-travels type of place. Initially, we couldn't hear each other talk. We could clearly hear the booth Across the dining room from us; lots of echoing at the Tornado. The booth next to us had 4 loud boomers that yell when talking and were singing at one point, but we hadn't been here before so we stayed.

Not the place for a quiet birthday dinner. I mentioned it was my husband's birthday when I made the reservation, they don't do anything special, unlike Delaney's on the west side which makes birthdays really special.

Food: Filets were perfectly cooked. The filet au poivre was bland. Brussels were undercooked, asparagus was crisp tender. Included salad and bread was nice touch.

If you are in the mood to get loud and remember the past, go here.

For a quiet celebration, keep looking.

I'll probably try again only for late night..
