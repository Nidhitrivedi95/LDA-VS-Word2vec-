i53HvxUdQEMllZ1XmpjjyA This is without a doubt the worst food i have ever tasted, and I will eat anything.
1. Steak sandwich is in style of a calzone, the bread is bad, steak taste like dog food looks.
2. Jalepino poppers made me wanna puke after 1 bite. (Not kidding)
3.Gyro came with slices of bad tasting meat.
4. Fries were cold and soggy on arrival.
Somehow hotels let this place slide menus under room door, I now see why they do this.
They are trying to take advantage of tourist not familiar with area. But thanks to yelp, we can help save people time and money one review at a time.
This review doesn't refund my money, but it does give me peace of mind knowing I helped save someone else from ordering from the menu just because it slid under door. Don't fall for it, it has 2 stars on yelp for a reason.
