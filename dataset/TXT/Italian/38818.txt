7d3tmP0XIFdjdqQ6hBRA4Q We called Il Bacio on about 10 min notice when we & our 2 out of town guests were rained out @ Wade Oval Wednesday concert. They were able to accommodate us. Our guests absolutely loved the old world ambience. All 4 of our meals were outstanding-- 2 veal chops, 1 veal scaloppine & 1 steak. The owner offered to make any other dish to suit our tastes, with any ingredients shown on their menu? & allowed us to bring in the wine we had purchased for our picnic ( w/ a corkage fee, of course), Tiramisu for dessert was light & delicious. Live mandolin music added to the ambience. This place is an absolute gem -- ambience, food,  & service. Cannot wait to go back !
