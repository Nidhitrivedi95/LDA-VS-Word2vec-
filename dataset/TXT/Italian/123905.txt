Don't get me wrong, it's a fine product, illy coffee is one of my favorites; but here at the illy espressamente shop, they make it just a little hotter than they should. (Ten minutes later and I'm still burning my tongue trying to get a sip). I'm sure once it cools down a little (a lot) it will be delicious. I'm just not sure I have the patience.
