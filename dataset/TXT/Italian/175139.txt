ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw Haven't dined - in at this location before but I get take-out a lot and the girls helping me at the take-out counter are always so sweet and helpful! We are obsessed with the chocolate chip pazookies, even when you're stuffed, you wouldn't be having the real Oreganos experience without ordering one for dessert! It's a half pound of chocolate chip cookie dough, partly baked with scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. SO GOOD!
