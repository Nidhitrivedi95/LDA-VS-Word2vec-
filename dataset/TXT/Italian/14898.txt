1muT5zEqoC4qp9ms08qJtQ Finally made it to Gino's East on our quest to try the Trifecta of Chicago-style pizza to hit the desert!  We went on a weeknight so wouldn't have to wait in the long lines noted in many previous reviews.  Walked right in and were seated at a table near the bar so we could watch the baseball playoffs.  Groaned when the TV changed to Thursday night football but the bartender immediately checked that nobody at the bar was watching and switched it back.  We were thrilled to find out that our server was Regina - she who is mentioned in so many reviews!  Our service was as good as advertised - Regina even helped us prank the friend dining with us!  She did get a kick out of us calling her the "famous Regina from yelp!"

But about the food - we tried the spinach sticks.  My husband does not like spinach but tried to eat more than his share of the appetizer!  They were great with just the right amount of spinach to cheese.  We had the Field Salad with the house dressing - the entrée salad was more than enough for three of us to share!  And the pizza - we ordered the Meaty Legend but of course had to customize it.  Pizza came out exactly as ordered in all of its cheesy tomato deliciousness.  The crust is a little mealier than other deep dish pizza places (heard that they add corn meal) but complimented the sauce.  I noticed that we all ate the crust and didn't leave it as we have at other places.  The tiramisu and apple crumble were both good and more than enough for the table to share.  

We will definitely be back - both for the food and the service!
