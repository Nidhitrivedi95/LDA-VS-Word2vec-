D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg I came here for a friend's birthday dinner. It was such a wonderful experience. The ambience is cozy even in such a large dinning space. If you sit near the windows there's a great view. We sat in a booth and it was still very intimate even though the dinning room was full of people. The staff were so warm and friendly. Our drinks were made perfectly by a very attentive bar staff. Our waiter, Zach, was great! Very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the menu. Everything we ordered was delicious but I'd have to say the grilled octopus was my favorite. I could have ordered five orders and been content. It was a perfect birthday experience for my friend.
