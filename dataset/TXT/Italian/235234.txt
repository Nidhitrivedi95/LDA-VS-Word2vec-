TVKenh65WwJX3zEr36zKCA We have eaten at this restaurant for many years. We always split the Pan Roast. It's always so good we order it every time. We went last night we saw something new on the menu. The Sunset Roast. Very similar to the pan but with no lobster, add chicken and andouille sausage. WOW. Our new favorite. We like to sit at the bar and enjoy the wonder aromas of the dishes being created. We sat by Raul. That guy works!  It looked like he had four pots going at once and he didn't skip a beat. He even had time to ask us how our meal was. We've eaten at GVR's "Tides" and it doesn't compare to the Ouster Bar. My rating should be a 4-1/2. The only complaint is it usually takes a little longer to get waited in and to get the check than other restaurants. Don't get me wrong, the food is worth the wait but it you're going to catch a movie, give yourself some extra time. Or, the clam chowder is amazing.
