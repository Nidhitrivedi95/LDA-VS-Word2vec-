61GK4EGXBd4uha_2unicNw We ate here a few weeks ago and it was overall pleasant. There were only two other people dining when we arrived. We were fearful that this was a reflection on the food but this was not the case. 

The gazpacho was absolutely delicious! I'm usually skeptical of cold soups but this was a hit! 

Linguine Trifolate was cooked in a garlic, white wine with mushroom and chicken. I refused to share any of my pasta due to how amazing it was. The only complaint I had was with the chicken. It was a bit dry. 

The fish of the day was a sea bass. It wasn't the greatest sea bass I've had but the person who ordered it didn't seem to mind. 

I'm not sure if I'd visit again only because I love to try new resturants. However, if I did I'm sure I'd be ordering the same thing.
