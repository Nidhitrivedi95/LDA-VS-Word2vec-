0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg I've been to this restaurant several times with my husband and we always sit at the bar. Neither food or service has ever been a disappointment. Tonight was no different. Bread basket with Stromboli (1 w/ prosciutto & 1 w/broccoli rabe) was fantastic as usual. Spaghetti perfect. Pici fabulous!
