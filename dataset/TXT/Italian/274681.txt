y769FA7VJOW4QQYdYlR62A Excellent Italian restaurant, with a very good value for money.
Dishes come in ceramic tableware, with stunning food plating.
Large range of Salads, Pastas and Pizzas. 
Obviously the Pizza is the main event, but the Pastas are pretty tasty as well.
The very modern look and feel of the place disconnects a little bit with the authenticity of the food. But except this little detail, I would definitely recommend Levetto for a true Italian dinner
