wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g I dined here with a large work group. The servers willingly accommodated last minute changes to our guest count which we appreciated because the restaurant was quite busy. 

Our group of twelve ordered items across the menu and everyone was still complimenting the food on the following day. I had the beet salad and the mixed seafood grill both of which were well prepared and perfectly seasoned. I could see the kitchen from my seat, and it was obvious that they meticulously prepared each dish. The pasta was all freshly made in house, as it should be. 

I never know what to expect with themed restaurants in Vegas, and Canaletto was impressive across the board.
