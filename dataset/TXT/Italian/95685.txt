Great staff who were attentive and helpful. The young lady who take care of me mentioned that she's very aware of dietary restrictions due to the near presence of the hospital. So it that's a concern for you, be calm.

I ordered the cheese tortellini right off the menu and it was absolutely delicious. I already mentioned the big portion, but the cheesiness here was great. Lots of flavor, including some heat from peppers, the snap of the peas and the firm bite of the pasta. Just perfect. And yes, I scooped up ALL of the sauce with the bread.

Oh, and that bread is awesome too. Delish.

Fair looking wine list with some specials, but I opted for a Great Lakes Dortmunder to go with mine. It was excellent.
