4_sZelNo2BoCDIsw0MWWAA While smaller than some of the bigger, more popular places, I feel this is one of the best hot tables for lunch in Vaughan.   Slow cooked porchetta is killer!  Pastas change daily (I like the lasagna and anything with their bolognese sauce).

I'd give it 5 stars if they would have a better selection for desert. Throw some canolis on the menu and would be a 5.
