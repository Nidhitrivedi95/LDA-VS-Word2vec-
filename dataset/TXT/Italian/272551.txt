xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA Excellent Italian restaurant in the South Point Hotel & Casino.  

I ate there on two evenings this week.  First night's meal was a sauteed halibut special, served with several large scallops.  (The meals come with a choice of soup or salad, and pasta.  $3 upcharge for a Caesar salad).

Second meal was a menu item: Veal Limone.... kind of a veal piccata but minus the capers.  This had  to be the best veal cutlets I've eaten in twenty years.  No kidding.  If U like veal, you've gotta try the veal at Don Vito's.

Service was professional and attentive.
