MWe2RCV1PuH1qoMAELAqxA Despite entering the place when it was empty we had to wait more than 25 mins for our two sandwiches. After 20 minutes we asked for updates or status and the answer was "sorry what did you order again?". I still cannot understand what happened, the place was not that packed...guess they simply forgot about us.

After that, more disappointments - I could only taste mustard in my sandwich, the excess of sauce killed the other flavors. Really had to make an effort to finish my meal which is something that never happens to me! 

Not gonna come back.
