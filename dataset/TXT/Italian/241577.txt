uIhfZ0nBdax07vEcsia_OQ You'll have to take this review with a grain of salt, because I'm grading the lunch menu while eating at the bar.  I'm sure the dinner menu & service would be great, but the lunch staff wasn't.  My wife & I had to sit and the bar and tell the waitress we were ready to eat.   Once the food came, my chicken pesto sandwich was good, but my wife's salad was a big chunk of feta cheese.  I'm pretty sure the "diet coke" was actually real coke, & the total bill was $30 for 2 people.  A little steep for an average lunch with average service.  Recommendation:  check out the dinner scene.
