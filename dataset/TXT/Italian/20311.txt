3-6biVwm7VwPZ-k67jml-Q If you are not one of their paisans (part of the Italian family or go there every week) they treat you like crap.  Food was good but would not go back. We waited 15 minutes for a seat and when the owner finally got up from taking up a table of 4 to sign papers for a car he was buying....... they tried to give the table to one of their good customers.  We bought a bottle of wine and finished it at the restaurant and was charged $5 for a corking fee.  please explain that ......................The owner and I'm guessing  his daughter who was behind the counter was real rude........... When we left I commented on a dish that someone was eating (it looked real good) the patron said you can get one to if you come here often........WOW -I guess I don't look Italian
