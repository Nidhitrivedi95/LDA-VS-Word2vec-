GxfgOFgUhv2rfr3FXVWfCg OMG! Just placed my very first order tonight! My hubby wanted to try the, 'Godfather', and it did not disappoint. Light on the sauce, and heavy on the toppings. The garlic bread was awesome as well. Light, and crispy! Customer service was great on the phone, and the delivery guy was a sweetheart! Thank you, Pizza My Dear! We thoroughly enjoyed our meal.
