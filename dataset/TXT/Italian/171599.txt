N1Gdq44mY5c7NEazhXeKZA We'd like an order of wings. How'd you like them done? What do you mean? How do you want them cooked? Ooh! Well done I guess.. And half an hour later we had one of best chicken wings I've ever had. Why? Because they cooked them in the same huge stone oven they use for pizzas!! Brilliant cozy restaurant. Lovely pizzas, great draughts.
