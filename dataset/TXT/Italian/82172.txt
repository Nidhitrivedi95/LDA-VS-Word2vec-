DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw Sunday, November 8, 2015, I and an out of town friend had dinner at Ferraro's. They were celebrating thirty years in business with a special menu. The service and food were excellent. Everyone made us feel welcome and couldn't have been more attentive and polite. Even though the menu was special for their anniversary; the portions were plentiful and delicious. While leaving, we met and had a conversation with the owner. He was most pleasant and we felt special after talking to him. I've never had a less than excellant restaurant experience the many times that I've had dinner at Ferraro's. If anyone wants excellant food and service, you must eat at Ferraro's.
