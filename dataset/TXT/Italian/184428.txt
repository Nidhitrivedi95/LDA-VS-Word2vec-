Oi2k3en1Ip-D0n_jfGbvIQ Really good place! We came in for a light dinner and shared a pizza and a pasta. The pizza was very thin, except the crust. The tomato sauce, complemented by the fresh mozzarella and basil, was fantastic. A previous review complained about the quality of the fresh mozzarella, but in my opinion this is not an issue (it might have been, but it was probably rectified following that review). The pasta fresco with white sauce and mushrooms was nice as well. The desserts were very decently priced and tasty - we had the affogato which was rich and creamy and the cannoli which was just like in Sicily! Service was fantastic. We will probably go back to try more of the menu!
