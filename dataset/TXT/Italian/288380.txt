Zps5RW0brl-s43OvlCgZAQ I love food.  I love good food, that is.  I have been cooking Italian food for years, and since I started keeping kosher, I have not had a source for good Italian food outside my kitchen.   Then I tried LaBella.  While waiting for the to-go order to be prepared, I enjoyed a cup of their french onion soup.  Such a beautiful, incredible dark flavor.  I could not believe that there was no beef in it.  It was amazing.  I was sad that the crouton with cheese was so small, but at the same time, I was happy that it did not overwhelm the rest of the soup flavor.  There were a lot of onions in the stock like it was made fresh there. 

We had the Penne Alla Vodka and the Eggplant Parm to go.  The penne was delicious, with a smooth and velvety sauce that hit all of the right notes.  The eggplant parm was, according to my wife, second only to mine.

The service there was superb, the folk were friendly and happy to help.  Next time I head through Phoenix, I will stop there.
