J0ET9_Zvh10E02BrEN74iw It's been a while since I write!  I went there for my 24th birthday celebration with my girlfriends two weeks ago. They've offered the winterlicious menu prix. So far, I remembered what I've ordered:

- salad with calamari *perfect*
- salmon with vegetable  *the salmon is a little too dry but overall is good.*
- creme brûlée *a little too much sweet*
 
Three meal menu was for only $25 plus a 8 oz red wine. This is a good price but Winterlicious special has been only limited edition for a short time. 

In the end of the day, the boss gave us a business card and wrote it "15% off next visit" which is pretty cool. I think I'll come back again with the discount card.   

The only reason I gave it 4 stars because of the winterlicious, and the service is good.
