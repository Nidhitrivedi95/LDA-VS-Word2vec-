It's good for basic chessesteaks and turkey subs. Think a grade above steak-ums. My sandwich came right off the grill, cheese was melted, and mushrooms tasted like from a can. But I liked still liked it. Four teenagers stood in front of store (outside) smoking cigarettes the whole time I was there, so you know it must be a hot spot.
