w2b0ve7xpuCQkwYICFIUOg Awesome service! Very tasty dishes! The cheesy bread and balsamic dipping sauce are very addicting. I highly recommend this place. 

The owner is very nice...he gave us a free dessert as a big thank you to service members (my sis is in the airforce). Thought that was really nice. ;-)
