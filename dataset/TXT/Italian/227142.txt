SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ I have been to trevi many times over the years..and the food is typically good. Last week I was at Trevi and ordered their version of a hanger/strip steak...it was absolutely horrible to the point that it was not edible...it was all fat and soo tough I couldn't even cut it with a steak knife. When I told the server...he had nothing to say...it was handled extremely bad for a restaurant in a major resort on the Vegas Strip. I was not offered anything it's place...the waiter never even asked us if we wanted Dessert and did not even offer Dessert given the horrible dinner. I left trevi restaurant hungry. I am not sure if this is a management issue and the restaurant is starting to go down hill. Being a Vegas resident this is very upsetting..I will probably never go to trevi again ...I also have no plans of recommending it to anyone I know...
