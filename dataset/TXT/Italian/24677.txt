It's run by this nice Italian couple and they make their own hot pepper. I'm love with those peppers truly amazing. I always get the veal sandwich and a pop. It's huge, the portion is good enough for two and it's under $10. They also have a variety of pop u can't really find in toronto anymore like cherry coke or peach fanta, they can only be found on those coke machines and they does taste as good as cans. They but alot of heart into their delicious food. Also the tools... Chesse, onions, mushrooms, pepper, zucchini, eggplant, sauce , just OMG so many and all do good. Totally worth the bag for your buck, always leave fully Satisfied. And the owner he is awesome always so nice and loves talking about his food. Great place for an veal sandwich or chicken.
