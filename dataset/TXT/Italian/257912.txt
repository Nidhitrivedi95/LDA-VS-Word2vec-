w3PwDEbI0EDx4YI_BkFhIA I did not enjoy my dinner at the restaurant . I ordered the  veal and shrimp. The veal was rubbery and tasteless the shrimp were covered in mozzarella cheese and had no flavor. The sauce tasted like water.  If I hadn't been at the restaurant with other people I would have given this place a one star, but the other couple I was with enjoyed their veal parmesan. just because you put a fancy name on a menu doesn't mean you know how to cook it and this is true with this place. There is more flavor in a jar of ragu then there was on this food. I suggest you try a different restaurant if you want good Italian food.
