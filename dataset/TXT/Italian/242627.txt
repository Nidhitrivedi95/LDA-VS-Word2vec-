UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w First timer at Papa Pinny's , the Antipasto salad was excellent hefty amount of Italian meats, the house dressing was great. The signature pizza was awesome,  my daughter's Lasagna was also  hefty and good. Everything was great,  clean atmosphere friendly staff. Will come back to try more.
