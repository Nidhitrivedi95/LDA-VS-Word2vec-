u1tFKPQWr60q_HIUDlHIcg This place has some pretty good fast Italian food. The antipasti salad is amazing and we get that every time we go. they have great dinner specials for under 7 and it comes with super yummy garlic rolls. you order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. service is nice and the place is clean hope they make it in that weird location.
