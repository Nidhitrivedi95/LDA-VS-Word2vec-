c5x6HWB8MTZvlTgabihaSw We just enjoyed a delightful meal at Arrivederci.  The eggplant appetizer was delicious, as well as the arrugula salad.  My husband and I shared the entire meal, including the veal limone main course.  It was tender, nicely flavored, the vegetables were crispy tender and the rice very tasty.  We finished the meal with their homemade pistachio ice cream with belgian chocolate and it was just perfect.  They also gave us their homemade lemoncello as a final course.  The serving sizes were just right and enough for us to share everything and be able to enjoy several tasty dishes.  The service was excellent and the prices were right for the quality.
