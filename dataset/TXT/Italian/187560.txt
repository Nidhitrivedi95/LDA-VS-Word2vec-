OTDogJk9hVcM0oT_ia_09g Really good pizza!!!!! Love their specialty pies, often get the Greek with sausage or ham. Had dinner here once and was not impressed with the pasta, the sauce was too sweet and most egregious of all-- noodles overcooked! Big no no. Might try again, but for now we will stick with the pizzas. Just wish they offered bigger than their large!(which only feeds two hungry adults in our experience)
