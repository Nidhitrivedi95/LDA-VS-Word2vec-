Hb7mHNnGD0dyJs2hScihOA Went here bc I heard it was great. I was good, but the portions were very small. The meals were about $15 each but neither of us left full. 

I had the eggplant parm and my husband had something called around the boot - which is a choice of three things. We also had the moz planks and enjoyed them. 

$35 and we only had water
