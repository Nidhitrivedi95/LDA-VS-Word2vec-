UpmAfOoh6WTF9g6AH-6ofA My review is based on my experience for Summerlicious 2012.

Maybe just the food I ordered? My Vegetarian Date was really happy and enjoyed her meal while I was totally disappointed!

Dinner for $25 definitely not a bad price for a 3 course meal, I ordered:

Appetizer: Porchetta
- One of the driest pork I ever ate... Overcooked? Even hurt my mouth when I was chewing on it
- Polenta on the side was pretty good though

Main: Linguine alla Pescatora 
- seafood was not fresh and the tomato sauce was bland
- I forced myself to eat half of it, while my date wondering what's wrong?! (I wish she can try some of those chewy seafood!)

Desert: Tiramisu
- Best part of the meal
- great liquors flavour, soft and rich....

I don't think I would come back to La Bruschettta with all these Italian restaurants all around the GTA.... 

Service though is really good, but not enough to make up for the food!
