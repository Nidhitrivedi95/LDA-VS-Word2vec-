NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA I thought the bar and the atmosphere were great. Do yourself a favor though and eat before you get there. The pizza was okay if you were going there to drink for 2-3 hours, watch a couple of games and then got hungry and had to eat something. Do not go just for the pizza. 

We stayed at the William Penn and googled best pizza in pitt. There were enough good reviews to warrant a visit and I was thirsty!! The bar must be set very low for good pizza in Pittsburgh. The two stars were for the beer selection only. We tried the bacon candy. Overcooked bacon with brown sugar? My daughter was impressed, me so-so. I always order the Margherita pie on my first visit to any pizza joint. That way you can taste the sauce, cheese and crust without meat and other flavoring interfering. This is chain restaurant pizza a best. Then came dessert, ugh! My daughter always gets dessert when I treat her to dinner. Triple layered chocolate cake with peanut butter filling I think? We got two forks so I dove in. The cake must have been baked last week. You couldn't stick a fork in it!! The cake would crumble and it got harder deeper into the cake. No wonder they buried it under peanut butter, chocolate syrup and some crunchy something or other. A third of the way through my daughter bit into a piece of plastic wrap. 

Our server came over, apologized, removed the cake from the table and the charge off our bill. He also bought me one of my beers. Once is enough.
