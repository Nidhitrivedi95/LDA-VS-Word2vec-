bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg At first I did not think much of this place due to the half empty parking lot. That perspective changed dramatically real quick once inside. 

First off, the place is beyond amazing for it's luxury. You would think you were on the strip, but nope! Aside from the friendly service, they were very professional and authentic, thus meaning I could barely understand a word of their English being spoken. Table mats are actually made to be drawn on for the kids (pretty cool). As far as the ambience, seating is spread out well so you do not feel so cramped, and it is very quite and has a semi dark romantic theme going on. Definitely should be on your date night list, gentlemen.

Most pricey plate here was only $20. I enjoyed their delicious Capellini ai Fruitti Di Mare. So delicious! Took half an hour for all 5 of our plates to come out and everything was amazing including the steak, calamari, and pizza. (pictures attached)

I will take this restaurant over Olive Garden any day. See you soon, chef!
