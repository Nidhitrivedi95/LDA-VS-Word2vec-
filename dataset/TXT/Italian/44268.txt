8axxI33rUyswfRk_v3vS0A Yum! Perhaps not the best pizza out there, but one hell of a fine option if you're in Leith.

The lunch specials are where La Favorita shines on quality and price. £8.95 nets you a main and drink, or £11.95 with a dessert. The pizzas are large enough to satiate a full appetite, or even to be split if you only have the munchies.

The mushrooms on their pizzas are the perfect kind; small and flavorful and a perfect compliment to the pepperoni. With some chili oil you've got proper flavor in abundance!
