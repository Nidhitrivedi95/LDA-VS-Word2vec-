-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw Totally overrated and overpriced. I've been out to eat there three times now. Usually I go grab happy hour because they have a pretty good deal. So this time I went in for my birthday and had a pretty bad experience. To start off they put us (8) at a small circular table that was cramped. Next the server would disappear for 20 minute intervals and we had no idea where he went. The server was anxious and highly stressed running around and wasn't able to play close attention to such a large party. That was just the beginning. The food was sub-par. I ordered a $29 8oz filet medium rare and it was like I was chewing gum. Usually, a filet that price should be cooked the way you ask. Maybe it's the style of restaurant or chef but I received the rarest steak. I had to eat food from others at the table to be satisfied at all. My sister ordered the salmon and had to send it back because it was extremely overcooked. She has been a server for 12 years and has some kind of knowledge on food. I think for the price the food should be much higher quality. I was there for my birthday and definitely won't be going back for anything, maybe the happy hour. I hope they get this message and make some changes.
