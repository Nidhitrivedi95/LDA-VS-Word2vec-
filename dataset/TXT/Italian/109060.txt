G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Absolutely the worst dining experience ever! The wait staff is awful. The food was cold. My wife's medium well steak was rare - after being told to allow additional time for medium well. The crab ravioli was cold. To top that off, the server never returned to the table so we had no opportunity to ask them to fix it. We went to the all night cafe at the hotel. Next night we went to Mesa. Sorry Giada - the ex is better!
