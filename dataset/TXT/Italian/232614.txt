Tl7V8AztDY8s6Jr8yJNKcw I have tried the pizza several times and find it rather bland.  Recently I tried the breakfast sandwich to go, they put two huge eggs on it and a lot of bacon but the container was filled with grease and liquid which made a soggy inedible mess.  The service is always friendly though so I keep giving it another try.
