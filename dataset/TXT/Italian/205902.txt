qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA Tried to make a reservation... Called to get some information first. Spoke with a hostess named Kendra. She was very rude. Not helpful. She had an attitude the entire time and before I got to finish asking  a question she hung up on. She was so unprofessional I could hear her talking to other customers in the background as she was suppose to be helping me get a reservation. when I called back she put me on hold and had me talk to another hostess. I ended up not even making a reservation because of this.
