wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg Highly recommend.  

I sat at the bar.  The service was friendly and quick.  The complimentary olive oil and bread was tasty.

I got a pasta dish - the Alessandra - it was very good.  But I was sitting by the kitchen and everything I saw coming out looked delicious.  

I was traveling to Toronto for work, but if I was in the area again I would love to come back to Grazie!
