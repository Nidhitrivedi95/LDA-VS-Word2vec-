21sGRVR7HEs_t6PdB9tGMw Ordered a large pizza w/ chicken, mushrooms and jalapeños. It was perfect! The flavor was amazing. The pizza wasn't greasy or falling apart. 
It took about an hour for delivery. Seems like a long time, but in reality we all know that's the normal time frame.
Price wise.. With the pizza and an antipasto salad it was about $35. To me, that reasonable. 
Defiantly would recommend you I've this place a try. You won't regret it (:
