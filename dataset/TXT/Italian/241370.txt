UHPjDgiEHnTe7-MP-b2kyQ So on Christmas Eve, my mom usually cooks. However for the first time in family history, this year, we decided to go out. My folks frequent Veneto fairly often, and so we decided it'd be a good choice. Seriously? Best choice ever. We started out with an order of salmon carpaccio. Yes. You should order this when you go, because its sooooo good. I had the Filetto Al Porcini...it was a special...phenominal. In my family we believe in sharing when it comes to food, so I also tried the Sole, Sea Bass, and Arribiata. Delish. It was pretty busy in the restaurant, but the staff didn't seem to break a sweat. The servers/managers that know my parents even made time to come over and hang out for a bit. The owner and much of the staff are from italy, so you know its the real deal. I loved my experience at Veneto, and will definately be going back for more.
