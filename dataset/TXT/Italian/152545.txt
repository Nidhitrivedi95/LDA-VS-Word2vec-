KtSEqZbGV1WHgOgtSMEZFQ I ordered a pasta special with sausage, the pasta was swimming in oil, there was no visible sausage and so salty I couldn't eat it. When I asked the waitress she said it's there you just don't see it. Perhaps they should change the name of the special to the Pasta with the Invisible Sausage. On a previous occasion we ordered pizza with chicken, they should of called that Chickadee, it was good but again no chicken. The restaurant  did remake the  pasta for me it and placed a lot of "something" on top and said it was sausage, they said they did that so I could see the sausage this time, I really don't know what it was. My husband had the meatballs and a salad, it was tastless. The apple tart with ice cream for dessert was very good, the creme brule  it was bland.  There are so many great restaurants in Toronto, not sure why this one is so busy.
