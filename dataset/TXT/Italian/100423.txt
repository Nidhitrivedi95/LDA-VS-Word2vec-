fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w An "off the strip" restaurant.... On the strip. First off the servers don't have a standard fashion of greeting and serving a table. The first question you ask shouldn't be "are you ready to order?" I think the bussers were the most efficient part of the staff. The turkey chili was slightly warm and my roasted chicken was perfectly cooked and tasty, yet small in size. The truffle fries were the best part of the menu. As a Vegas local it seemed obvious this was a tourist trap with expensive menu prices on cookie cutter menu items you can find at every single other linq restaurant. Also, as I was enjoying my apple cinnamon tea (which was pretty good) I watch 4 gentlemen sit down and leave due to lack of attention from any employee. General disorganization and I blame management personally for not havering the staff all on the same page.
