v3AS5LGeV2Si4nOHZ7lgxQ Yum. . . it took me a while to try their pizza (they don't deliver to my house!) and everyone kept telling us the Fetalicious was the best - and I can honestly say that it is. It was the first we tried and although we've tried a few other varieties - its the one we mostly order (plus sausage please). Very good and very worth the drive in our case.
