VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w This review is for the nightclub. It's basically a smaller version of Tao. We came here after leaving Tao, because it was so packed. Kim K.'s fiance was having his bachelor party here so the place was filled with basketball players. The club wasn't that big, but it wasn't packed to the point where you can't dance. I wasn't in the modd to dance since the music sucked as well!! If I would have paid to get in I woud have been pissed!
