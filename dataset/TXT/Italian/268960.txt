XJ2dT7pwmutxM4ceQnTVUg This was the first time my family and I visited this pizza joint. The host was extremely friendly in his pizza costume, as he takes us to our table. It's cute inside and had tv's around to watch the game. We waited a few minutes and the server (he never said his name) asks us what to drink and tried to scurry away and I had to call him back in order fries for an appetizer. He seemed rushed. He drops our drinks and takes our order and twenty minutes later we are still waiting on our fries. We were there before other tables and they received fries, as well as, other menu items before us. While our server passes us four times, I had to ask how long fries take to come from the kitchen. He quickly goes to the computer and says he will check on it. Then, no less than a minute later our pizza arrives and five minutes minutes later my appetizer for my kid. The pizza was great, light crust and sauce with just the right amount of cheese and toppings. Can't complain about that. Our sever passes us seven times throughout our meal and never asks us if we needed refills or if we needed anything else. He was at the bar chatting or checking on a bigger party. We sit there waiting for him to come back to let him know we are ready for a box, then he asks, "how is everything and I took the fries off your tab. It's a gift from the kitchen." A gift from the kitchen more than half way through our meal, thanks!!!! 
Being in customer service/wait staff/bar industry and retail my entire life, I have never treated my customers like this. If you're going to be in this line of work, then work on your customer service skills, if you can't handle the stress of the job then find another one! 

Not happy with the service.
