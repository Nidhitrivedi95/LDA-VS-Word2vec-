QReGruZEFxovIm9FJVa1kw "Zio! Zio! Zio!" And the crowd goes wild! 

Walk down the steps and into the warm and cozy nook that is Zio. Now inhale! Mmmmm! The first things you take in are the aromas. Someone is cooking something that you will want to eat!! Just play it cool though, and walk don't run to your table.

The Pizza - Cheese: wonderful sauce with intense tomato flavor layered with cheese. Spicy Chicken Sausage Pizza: large and in charge - smoky, spicy sausage and roasted red peppers - great savory combination.

The Main Courses - Chicken Piccata - simple and delicious - bursting with lemon, capers and butter, served with angel hair pasta. Now close your eyes and imagine if Eggplant Parmesan was an enormous vegetarian Ribeye, the thickest you've ever seen, fileted and stuffed with fresh ricotta and spinach - really an amazing dish. Now cover it with sauce, homemade pasta and mounds of cheese; yeah, it just got better. 

The Cannoli - do what you must - even if it involves loosening your belt or undoing your pants. You must make room. Both the homemade filling and shells will leave you wanting more. Pop! There goes another button...

Zio, you can be my uncle anytime! I'll bring the napkins and you bring the food! Deal?!
