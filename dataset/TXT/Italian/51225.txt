9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg The atmosphere at this restaurant is amazing. It's not overcrowded like other places downtown, giving it an intimate dining experience. There is no waiting time for a table, and no rush for you to leave. The food here is pretty good,  I'd rate it 7.5/10.

Service was a bit slow, but still decent otherwise. Feiendly hostesses and servers. 

The DJ there, on the other hand?  Absolutely terrible. She needs to be fired. I dined on a Saturday night and we were told that we could request songs to be played. So we requested a song politely, and she gave us attitude in what she probably thought was a quirky reply of "I don't know, can I?" It came out sarcastic and unwarranted. 

I really enjoyed my dining experience there and would love to dine here again. The only thing keeping from doing that is that DJ. Her condescending attitude is out of place in this industry. It would have been a 4/5, but I took one off solely because of her. These little things can really effect ones dining experience.
