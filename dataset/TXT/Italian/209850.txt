Quayv4ZFz7z9xKQHnXbQQg Loved everything about this place. The waiter was very friendly and made great suggestions. It was a nice day so I sat outside in the patio area, though the inside of the restaurant was very cute! I loved the motorcycle seats at the raw bar. 

Ordered half a dozen oysters for $16. Got 3 differ by kinds (2 of each). All were very tasty. The horseradish was super pungent. Awesome! Weird thing is that half a dozen oysters was $16, while a full dozen would have been $34...is it just me or does the math not add up?

Even though it was 94 degrees outside, the waiter told me the clam chowder pot pie is just too good to pass up so I had to get it. And I'm so glad I did! The pie crust was the perfect amount of flakiness. The chowder was not as thick as most I've had but still very tasty. So many clams! And the bits of bacon just really added to the flavor. 

The prices were decent. A little bit pricy but very reasonable for a seafood restaurant. I was hesitant at first since the restaurant was so empty but very glad I took a chance on it. 

Only weird thing was while I was sitting in the patio area a homeless(?) man came by trying to sell me a CD of his rapping. Totally random and unexpected. Maybe I was just surprised since this seemed like such an uppity area.  A little off putting at first but that really has nothing to do with the restaurant itself.
