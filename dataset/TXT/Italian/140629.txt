JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw Chinato: It must serve Chinese food, right? 

Woops!  Chinato is an Italian restaurant and it is fantastic.  My colleagues and I had dinner outside in the open-air seating and had a delightful dinner.  It's a great place to go when you want to feel like you are having a fancier dinner but do not want to get dressed up. Service was excellent but the food was even better!  I ordered the ravioli with pork, veal, zucchini, and shiitake mushrooms.  They were absolutely superb!  The ravioli was fresh and there was a great balance between pasta and filling.

Next time, I will definitely sample one of the wines from Chinato's extensive wine list!  :-)
