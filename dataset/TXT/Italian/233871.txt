Tp07u-0AOFRfQhtNpAXaQA NYPD Pizza in the Camelback Colonade is a great little place for casual, no-fuss dining. The pizza is excellent, along with many of their pasta dishes. I have heard really good things about their cazones, but I have not ordered one yet do to the 20-30 minute prep time. The prices are reasonably cheap, and the service is friendly. Recommended.
