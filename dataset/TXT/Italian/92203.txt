EgwGTDZ705TwudPJwAY0yQ We stumbled here by accident with a large party of ten and couldn't be happier with the amazing service and delicious food! The seating area is small but we fit comfortably and didn't feel like we were in the way. My kids powered through the adult size spaghetti and meatballs, the baked ziti was to die for, and my boyfriend's calzone was stuffed with cheese and the marinara tasted incredibly fresh. It's a bit of a drive for us, but we'll be back! (Or maybe we'll join the many regulars we saw picking up take-out!)
