Nqs4_gT6nKyeTOJ_rgu1mg Kind of a bummer to give them 3 stars. I've eaten here a few times and the food has been great at times, average others. Got the calamari appetizer which was pretty good but had lemon slices instead of wedges. How am I supposed to squeze a lemon slice over calamari? The side salad was just iceberg lettuce out of a bag with 1 grape tomato and 1 cucumber slice. The bread that came out with the meal was a little too done for my liking- borderline burnt, had to ask for a different loaf. The cheese manicotti was awesome, lots of cheese inside and on top. They have Coca-Cola Freestyle as well which gives them points in my book. We had a $12 off coupon from a local coupon book, but the bill was still $40 before tip. Server was attentive and friendly but we were seated next to a party of 12 very loud people when there were 2 of us. We could've sat anywhere. Seems to happen a lot. Lol. I'd eat here again, but wouldn't go out of my way to get here.
