p_22wrx3GmAzlbrGA6LyYg Love their pizza. Everything is made fresh and quick and tastes delicious. 

We ordered 8 pizzas for a birthday party and I was afraid they wouldn't turn out as great as when we order just 1 pizza pie. I was wrong. They all tasted fresh and everyone at our party raved at how delicious the pizza was. 

We continue to chose this place over many other pizza places in the area.
