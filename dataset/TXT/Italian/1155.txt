-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q Had a great experience at this place. My fiance and I were there for dinner on a Tuesday night.  He described our appetizer as the best seafood dish he ever had! It was mussels and calamari with some tomato sauce and served with homemade bread. .soooooooo good!  Pesto lasagna was out of this world too. Pizza Wasn't that good, it was a lil too burnt for our taste, but no big deal, the other food made it up for it :)
Definitely coming back
