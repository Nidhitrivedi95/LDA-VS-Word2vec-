Service could have been better. Our server seemed to focus on my friend more when she took our orders. It also took a while for her to get our bills when we were done eating. She gave us breadsticks when we didn't specifically request for them - she just made an assumption that we wanted more because we ordered the (apparently popular) spinach and artichoke dip. Although we appreciated the gesture, we didn't actually request for them (nor did we want any more at the time). 

Food was somewhat overpriced. Some dishes were better than others. The spinach and artichoke dip were bomb. The baked penne carbonara that I had was very nicely presented. It tasted quite good at first, then became rather heavy as I continued to eat it. As I was finishing up the pasta, I found it to be quite dry and salty. I prefer my pasta to be creamy but it wasn't exactly the case with the baked penne carbonara.
