fDkQcos3MqqCYGWfl64iiA Would probably give it 3.5 stars but will bump it up for the sake of having a nice evening. 

This restaurant is everything you should expect an expensive restaurant to be. Nice (but uninspired) decor. Wide seats and table space for comfort. Competent, prompt and helpful service. Well presented plates using top quality ingredients.  Extensive wine list at an acceptable mark-up.

The problem is I find there is a diminishing point of returns on a meal over $200. 

Yes it was all very "nice" but at $300 I guess I wanted something a bit more special and memorable.
