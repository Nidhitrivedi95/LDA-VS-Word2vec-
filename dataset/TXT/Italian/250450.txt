VnS3kmAmRyHeN9_lMPBp0g I came here with my aunt this weekend and it is a nice, cozy Italian family restaurant. The menu has a lot of great choices and the prices are really reasonable for what you get. 

First, let me just say that any place where I can get 2 tasty entrees, 2 salads, and 2 glasses of wine for less than $30 is awesome in my book! I salivate over checks that small since living in DC is a constant drain on the wallet. 

We both had house salads with blue cheese dressing, and I ordered the eggplant parmesan (though it is called something different on their menu). The salad was pretty big and the dressing was really good--so strange that this is a notable fact--but it was thick and creamy and delicious! The eggplant parm was nothing to write home about as it was evident that the eggplant patties were previously frozen and when I tried to scrape some of the breading off there was basically one centimeter of something that could qualify as eggplant inside. It was served on a bed of pasta, though, which made it plenty substantive. The house wine was also decent. 

Definitely not a bad meal if you're in the North Huntingdon area!
