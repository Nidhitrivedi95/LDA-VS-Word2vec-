9Boahjn3QxlZnP2Aw_V1Rg I tried to get reservations at both this location and their Forest Hill location for my anniversary.  Their reservation system is a voice-mail box that informs you "this is not a reservation" and we'll call you if we have space.

I tried numerous times, and called days in advance to get a reservation.  I guess I wasn't famous enough to get one.
