DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA I don't know what all the drama was about with the food being "sub par."  Me and my wife stopped by here on our way through Phoenix, AZ and we happily ran a bill of over 100 bucks.  We didn't mean to but we kept ordering from the menu because the food we had initially was pretty darn tasty!  I started with the Blue Ribbon Burger and my wife had a pizza for starters.  We also ordered an appetizer but I forget what it was called but it was delicious!  We also ordered some cheesecake slices, about 4 of them to be exact.  We ate two slices in house and took 2 slices to go.  It was the darn good.  We were in fact met by Sammy and greeted by Amy as she personally brought out our pizza to us. I sincerely recommend people try the this place out and try to put what "reality tv" displays before you judge this restaurant.  If I was local to the area I would happily become a regular to the restaurant.
