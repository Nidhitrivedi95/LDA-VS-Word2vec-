RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ The view was great!! It made up for our server's attitude. I'm sorry, but for the price that came with the meal, I expect a server to be kind and friendly. Our server was rude and not too pleasant. The food was great (servings very small though). Pricey! The view was excellent though. A great place to be around sunset. :)
