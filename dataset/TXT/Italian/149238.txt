Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA Honestly, for what purpose it is supposed to serve, this place was more than sufficient. Went to the high roller and realized there's like a little mini outdoor mall so hubs and I went on a stroll. It's in a really poppin area across the "street" from ghiradelli store, etc. 

This place was exactly what I expected it to be, you stand in line at a stand, order, pay, get your food and stand drunkenly mindlessly shoving pizza in your mouth. Drunkenly, this pizza was great. Hubs' blood sugar was running low(er) and we got a slice and shared it, I would say it's similar to Secret Pizza at cosmo, similar style and totally sufficient. Neither are the best pizza I'm EVER going to have in my life and I don't expect that from a pizza stand in vegas. 

The prices are what is to be expected like $5 per slice, and the process was simple and easy. If I were in the area craving a quick bite, would totally recommend this place.
