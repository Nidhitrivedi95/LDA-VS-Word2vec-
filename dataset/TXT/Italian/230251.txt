TcWlYyRE_qggTBAutEfSoQ Unfortunately, Burbs is a little out of its league.  It bills itself as an upscale restaurant and it certainly charges upscale prices.  But the food was just ok, but not great.  Hubby's steak was probably the best of all of the meals ordered at our table.  One of the kids got the curry chicken, which was also tasty.  However, the two pasta dishes were very disappointing ... gnocchi that tasted like rigatoni in a very heavy oily sauce, and ravioli that tasted similarly.  The wine menu was small and kinda disappointing ... when dinners cost $25, you want more than 10 white wines to choose from.  Finally, the service was slow and artificially perky.  For the kind of prices they charge, i was expecting an awesome experience.  Instead, it was just so-so.  Unless they significantly drop the prices, i don't see a reason to rush back.
