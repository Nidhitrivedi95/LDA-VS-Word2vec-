SgSVJWgMwFteYyz4OlHu9Q Well my (now) ex-boyfriend is from Boston, so we came to Bambino's a lot. I just love pizza in general but Bambino's is oh-so-good and their hot wings are awesome. The staff are all very friendly and fun and actually get to know you instead of treating you like just another customer. Someday, Tony will remember my name but in the meantime, I will continue to come here (while my ex is at work). hehehe just kidding!
