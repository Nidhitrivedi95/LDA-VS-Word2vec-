uynbRIP4g85lp87xBJUaTg I meet up with a group of friends here and it was quite a disappointing experience.

I am a kind of person who is always punctual but I arrived late. When I arrived and not even 30 seconds have passed, the male employee asked if we were ready to order. I haven't even taken off my jacket...of course I was not ready and he stood there just staring at us. Not awkward at all... Another minute has past, I haven't even finish looking at the drink menu and a female employee came and ask if we were ready and of course I was not. 

Finally, I decided on what to get and I got the Western Omelette. Honestly, this was not a good omelette as it came lukewarm. There was a lot of diced vegetables and not that much meat. The potatoes were cold as well and the small amount of fruits did not give the dish any justice. I never had such a dissatisfying omelette dish before.

Service was not that great as the employees should give the customers some time and not be so pushy.

I would not come back here for brunch.
