pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Good, not great. And damn expensive. 
The pizza is about 12 inches in diameter. We got half and half with margherita and wise guy. Both of them were good but IMO really thin. Even slightly burnt too. 
It was about $18 too, which I didn't feel was worth the money. 
It was something new for me but it isn't mind blowing like most reviews say
