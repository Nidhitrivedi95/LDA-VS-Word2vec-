-wXyBph4d0IQlQrS8H1rDw We have had dinner here twice now. Both times we felt the food and the service were top notch. In addition, the atmosphere is upscale without feeling stuffy.  The restaurant is a "cool" kind of place and it felt very New "Yorky" to be here.  It is open and airy and the small bar is even a great place to pull your chair up and have some great wine and a bite. All in all, we feel this place is well worth it to eat here and enjoy the food and the atmosphere.
