We had the calamari and the pesto sauce that went with that made for a nice accent. The wild mushroom pizza had a fine earthiness, but it was more crust than toppings, short on sauce -- for $14 small pizza, they shouldn't scrimp on what gives the pie flavor. They did have a decent wine by the glass selection, and I had a velvety Pinot. Staff was young and eager, speedy service, but I found the overall ambience a bit sterile.
