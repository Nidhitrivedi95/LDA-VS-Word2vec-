anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg Came here last night with the wife. Amazing food and service. The food was excellent. 

Appetizer: Crab cakes. They are huge. One is definitely enough for two people 

Salads: got the Cesar and House. Both were good. Definitely overpriced for the Cesar but it is a fine dining restaurant. 

Main course: I got the Oso Bucco. Incredible! But I was expecting that for $48.00. Meat was very tender and the pasta was cooked to perfection. The marrow was also amazing. Wife got the Voda Penne pasta. Also cooked perfect! Sauce was legit. 

Didn't get desert. We were too full! 

Service was also on point. Our server was very funny and polite.
