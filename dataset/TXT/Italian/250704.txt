VoXUt6TIJWyIf_lihbN5xQ We stopped by last night.  The service was great...which is remarkable as their was no service last time we ate here. The food a very bland but pretty good.  I am updating my review because again I noticed they are still very poorly staffed.  There wasn't one server on the floor when we got there. No hostess at the stand.  If the food had more spice and if the restaurant was staffed properly I would go more.  The salad caprese is an example of poor flavoring.  Too light on basil. Too light on oil and vinegar. It was a generous portion but so bland ...and no server around to get more oil and vinegar. We shouldn't have to ask for more basil, oil and vinegar. The salad should be dressed correctly. My muscle dish had four mussels that didn't open. You are not supposed to serve unopened clams or mussels. They should be discarded.
