So friendly, very attentive, was asking if we needed refills before we fully ran out, made great recommendations and had great knowledge of the beers, their taste, where they were from etc, the other waitress was also good, didn't know her name, but she was a floor waitress, when it was slower and she had more time again super friendly and smiley 

Then the worst happened. They had a shift change. The two new waitress were NOT friendly, not smiley, not attentive, one of the girls was even cussing to the other waitress talking about the previous servers and basically DRAMA, now it was loud, she probably didn't think I could hear her, but not only did I hear her I knew what and who she was talking about. Not very professional at all.  

I would probably come back here again, but I would check who was working first. 

I tried the garlic rolls, they weren't anything I will crave again, but they weren't bad either. I saw a few pizzas come out that looked delicious though.
