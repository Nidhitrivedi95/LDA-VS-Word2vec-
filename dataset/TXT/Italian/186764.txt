oRKyGtUsN5IcRReN7ScUwQ I would not recommend this parlour to my worst enemies. After they didn't deliver my food on two seperate occasions, I was refused any sort of explanation by the rude manager on the other end of the phone. Poor customer services, awful pizza (when it DOES get delivered), they always forget the sauce or ranch, drivers who don't carry phones. Whoever is running this restaurant needs to be fired, rehired, and then fired again. Terrible.
