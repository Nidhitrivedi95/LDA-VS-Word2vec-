GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ Horrible wait once you're seated- food is okay- and prices are atrocious. I will never set foot in this place again and suggest you do yourself and friends a favor and don't get stuck sitting for over two hours to eat and pay. That's not including wait to get in which there was none and I know why now!! ASK FOR A MANAGER AND THEY ARE " UPSTAIRS AND CANR HELP YOU" Best advice- DONT GO HERE!! Wish I could give this a zero star rating!
