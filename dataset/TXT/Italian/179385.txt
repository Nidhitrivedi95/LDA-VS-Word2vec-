nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A I went here for a small meal with my parents before departing for the airport.  Among us 3 we split a Buddy's pizza and a pasta carbonara.  Pizza was quite tasty and good, very flavorful, but I thought it was too salty for my full and complete enjoyment.  The pasta arrived in a small-lookin portion, for the price we were paying . . (~$23?).  It's not like I was expecting Cheesecake factory portions, but given the price, the pasta could have either used a bit more pizzaz or a larger serving size.  It was a very .. bland okayish dish overall, something I feel that I could have made at home.  Definitely a skippable dish.
