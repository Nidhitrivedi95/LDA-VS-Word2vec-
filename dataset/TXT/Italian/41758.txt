Everyone has mentioned the line-ups, and, yes, it's true: the wait is pretty terrible. However, I am not opposed to a line-up if the food and service is truly spectacular and makes up for it.

In this case, there is simply nothing special about this place. I love going out for breakfast and there's so many breakfast spots to choose from in Toronto - there's nothing that stood out about Lady Marmalade to me, that would invite me back for another round.

I had a vegetarian omelette, and I also tried out my friends' dishes (eggs benedict, which was pretty good; some other eggs poached, etc). My omelette was OK; again, not bad, just not terribly memorable. I honestly can't even remember what was in it.
I had some sort of coffee - really bland and overpriced. I remember thinking I'd have to stop after for another coffee somewhere.

The service was decent; our waitress was kind and although in a rush, didn't make us feel completely ignored or anything. 

The general atmosphere was ok. Casual, chilled out type of place, from what I could see: hipster glasses with no lenses and floppy-haired guys in skinnies as far as the eye could see...it was kind of funny to overhear conversations, so that was amusing for a while.

I'd give this place another chance, but probably only because my friend seemed to really like it. Otherwise, there's too many other places that can make a mean egg benny AND seat me for breakfast before lunch time.
