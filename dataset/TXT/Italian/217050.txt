rWvn5iE53sHqRXPyzWc0TQ Pizza was OK and certainly did not live up to some previous reviewers on the day my wife and I stopped by for some slices. 

Biggest disappointment was the pizza maker who was outside for an extended period of time talking and hanging with friends then when he returned, never washed his hands prior to handling food products. 

Large place with plenty of seating
