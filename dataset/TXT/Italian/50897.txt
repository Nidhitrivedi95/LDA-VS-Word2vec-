9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg Love love love Scaddabush. The food is excellent. I have tried the margarita pizza and the Alfredo spaghetti. Always have a great time and great experience. The customer service has always been good. The washroom are generally clean. The interiors are nice. And most of the time you don't need a reservation and can walk in. Would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to eat Italian food. As it tastes good, big portion and great price.
