dQ4pxV6AxBaD3X4gssg5zg Went here for the first time during happy hour. Happy hour is from 4-7. Was disappointed that 50% off wine only applied to their house wines. We sat in the restaurant but noticed the bar had a stink from smokers even though no one was currently smoking. While we weren't happy with the bread that was served, the rest of the meal was excellent and the portions were large. The fried calamari appetizer was excellent as were our Caesar salads, chicken parmigiana and lasagna. The tiramisu is the best we've ever had.
