pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ My wife and I went to Nora's because her sons were regulars there.  We were suppose to meet them there as they were treating us to dinner.  We got there before my step son's did and tried to tell Nora's we were in their party but was greeted with disdain.  They mistreated us so poorly we almost walked out.  

Soon my step son's arrived.  When Nora's saw who they were, they changed their tune.  All of a sudden, we were okay.  That didn't sit well with me.  I can't tell you if the food was good because my appetite was ruined.

Note to Nora's.  Since that happened, we have never been back and that was about ten years ago.  You should have treated us with respect like your regulars because we could have been new regulars.  Now you lost a potential regular and your old regular.
