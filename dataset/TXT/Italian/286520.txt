zi_qqjCzkerE2dT-ViE2JA Food is absolutely incredible. While somewhat expensive, I feel it was completely worth what I paid. Taking it in inside the romantic and opulent atmosphere of a 100-year-old church might have even been the best part of the experience.

The bruschetta was topped with incredibly fresh tomatoes that were a little sweet like a real tomato should be, despite the fact that they were out of season. This may have been attributable to the vinaigrette, which was also incredibly well-done. It's my opinion that a good bruschetta speaks to the quality of an Italian restaurant, because the dish is only as good as the sum of its individual parts.

I'd definitely recommend the ravioli, which was some of the best I've ever had. Perfect consistency inside and out, a flavorful blend of seasonings - making something like that takes talent.

Highly recommended for a special occasion or if you're filthy rich.
