My business partners and I, ate here while in Pittsburgh on business. We found Mario's on Yelp.  Our first impression, based on the outdated fixtures, was that it wasn't going to live up go its 4-star rating.  Certainly, the restaurant can use a serious redecoration, which probably accounts for its aging clientele and sparse dining room on a Friday night at 8:00pm.

As for the food - it was nothing short of fantastic - cooked with a lot of love and care.  The "greens & beans" appetizer is not to be missed, as is the chicken Parmesan. 

As for the waitress... Well, let's just say she was as efficient as a computer - but shared about the same personality (none). She smiled only when it was time for us to pay the check... 

If you love Italian food - you won't be disappointed.
