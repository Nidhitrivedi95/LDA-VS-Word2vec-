LWwAMZUiH6iBaL4a6jGRWw I don't know why this place gets all the hate and bad reviews. I've been here quite a few times and never had a bad meal here or bad service. Yes it isn't 5 star Italian food but the dishes are always tasty. Ten times better than Olive Garden and for the price they give generous portions. We usually opt out of appetizers because by the time we get the breadsticks and the soup or salad that comes with your entree were basically full. I like that they serve marinara and Alfredo sauce for dipping the breadsticks in they're kind of boring on their own. I usually order chicken and artichoke pasta but my last visit I ordered the chicken piccata. I have avoided this in the past because I make a mean chicken piccata at home but the fiancé doesn't like capers so I rarely make it. It was actually quite good but I prefer mine better. Mine came with sautéed spinach but they made a mistake. It's supposed to come with pasta. When the server brought it I asked about the pasta and she said it came with spinach so I ordered a side of angel hair. When she brought the angel hair she informed me they made a mistake so I wouldn't have to pay for the pasta. I liked it with the spinach and sauce and pasta it was actually a good combination. The fiancé always orders frutti di mar which is a generous portion. Comes with mussels and seafood. Other than the slight hiccup of the pasta missing from my dish service is always alright and the food is good in my opinion. The fact it's in the smoky casino kind of sucks but we like Pasta Cucina.
