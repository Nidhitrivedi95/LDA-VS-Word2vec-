Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg Awesome place.  I ate there for lunch last year when our General Manager hosted a luncheon for management during Christmas week.  We were served family style with so many great dishes.  I stuffed myself beyond belief.  Some of my favorites.....

Eggplant Parmesan, Gnocchi, Lasagna......all very good.  The bread was excellent as well.  Since I didn't pay for it, I have no idea what the cost was, but it didn't seem like it was expensive.
