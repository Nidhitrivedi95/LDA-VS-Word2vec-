qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA I normally only come here on their board & bottle nights -- $20 after 8PM, BUT I had some friends in town & met them here on Fri night & it was just as crowded & delicious :) the wine is really good, we always get Notebook. And then the best thing on the menu is of course the bruschetta, all of them are really good.. haven't had one I don't like yet (my favorite though is Warm Artichoke Spread). Normally the bruschetta fills me up because the board itself is huge but the salads are & sandwiches are good as well. Highly recommend it here :) Also, nice ambiance, great patio!
