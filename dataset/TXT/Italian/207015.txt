qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA The numerous wonderful reviews for this place did not lead me astray--I enjoyed a marvelous dinner at this location. The interior of the venue has the trendy decor of a wine bar with plenty of booth and bar seating. The outdoor patio is softly lit and kept cool with numerous misters. The music is modern and upbeat and just loud enough to be heard over the cacophony of conversations that will certainly surround but should not overwhelm you. 
On to the food! The half sandwich/half salad deal is perfect for lunch or a light dinner. I tried the chicken and mozzarella sandwich and the raspberry chicken salad--both were sumptuously scrumptious! The salad was a perfect blend of greens and nuts and chicken and fruit. The sandwich was a fantastic compilation of tender chicken, fresh mozzarella, soft bread, and just the right amount of spicy mayo. 
Finally, the staff is superbly friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. Don't know what you want? Just ask! They can help you choose just the right pairing of food and wine to make your day.
