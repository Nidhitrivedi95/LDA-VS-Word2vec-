yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg I went in on a Saturday to watch football games and have dinner. I was treated very good and waited on right a way. The food was very good and waiter was polite and knowledgable about the food menu. I was done with dinner in 1/2 hour and went to the bar where I was waited on by Tom the bartender. He told jokes and talked about whatever happen that week in the news and sports. Very good.
