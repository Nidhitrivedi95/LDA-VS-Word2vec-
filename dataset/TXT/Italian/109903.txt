G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Everything was a wonderful experience start to finish. Nancy, our server was excellent! The rosemary bread they give you before your meal comes is amazing and the entrees were even better. We ordered the lobster ravioli (with chunks of lobster on top and filled on the inside), lemon potatoes, the 7oz filet, the tiramisu cheesecake and Giada's lemon cookies. Everything was delicious and some of the best Italian food I've had! We will definitely be back
