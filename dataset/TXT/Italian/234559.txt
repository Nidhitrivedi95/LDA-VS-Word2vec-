tshN5rYRrzanHu4ZiwCVrA I walk in, I was not greeted and the lady just stared at me until I said something. I asked "Hello! How are you? How long is the wait for 2?" She replied "I don't know 15 minutes I guess." I said okay. Waited 20 minutes, not too bad.. I get to my table and my waitress was super nice, I wish I had her name because she was great. Fast forward to getting my pasta.. There was hair in it......... I asked for the manager and he talked super quietly, for obvious reasons. He asked "would you like a fresh plate of pasta, without the addition?" Very funny, not! He did take it off my bill. The drinks were watered down and no they were not alcoholic, but they were the black berry lemonade and the sweet tea. I prefer other olive gardens.
