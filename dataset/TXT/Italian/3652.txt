_BnBjRMt5Ba-TAv07r3fyw to be clear: The stars are only for the vibes and decor of the place. The Crescent location is beautiful, spacious, and wonderfully decorated. I've come here for everything between large birthday party dinners with 15 guests to small family dinners, and every time the seating is great. No problem there. 

The issue with this place is the food really. First thing they serve you is the usual bread with a pesto/oregano mix for you to dip, which tastes good because the bread is warm and who doesn't love pesto. But its all downhill from there... I've been here four times and every time I leave with a terrible stomach ache. The pastas are okay, the pizzas are dry, the appetizers are tasteless, the only thing that's acceptable to eat is the osso bucco pasta. 

There are so many better places to eat in MTL. Maybe go there for the bar, but definitely not for the food. The hype and popularity of the place is so not worth it
