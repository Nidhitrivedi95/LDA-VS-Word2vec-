ewEDv_q-K0fV0FepkHB8sA I went to dinner with a large party from work.  We were all travelling for training and had been told this was a must for dinner during our stay.  The drive up you see the capital building directly in front and it is very impressive.  The décor is definitely vintage, like old time 60's style, it is dark and lots of wood.  We had a small room for our large party and the staff did a great job of serving all of us together.  I had a filet that was cooked to perfection.  I also had a salad and the hash brown.  It was amazing.  I wished they had a smaller portion because I can never finish even a small filet.   It was outstanding.
