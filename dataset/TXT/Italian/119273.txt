H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g I will say that Otto has this going for it: It's a great spot for picky eaters. There are several standard dishes, and a few that elevate the usual suspects to a new level. For appetizers we ordered the eggplant caponata, which had a nice tart-sweet flavor but seemed like too small a portion for four people, as well as the fried cauliflower, which I really enjoyed. I loved how dark and crispy the breading was, and it didn't feel too greasy, either. The corn & crab ravioli was my entree choice and I think it was the right one---it felt light but also filling, and the swiss chard on top was a nice addition. The lasagna was good but nothing to write home about; the pizza was a little too salty and the tomato sauce tasted like it could be from a jar. And unfortunately the pasta alla norma was a big disappointment: the eggplant pieces were so tiny, there wasn't enough cheese, and the sauce tasted like a standard vodka sauce. None of the desserts sounded very appetizing so we didn't try any of them, but it was nice of our server to give my parents a free glass of champagne each for their anniversary. The ambiance in the Venetian hotel was cool, especially when we first arrived and there was live entertainment.
