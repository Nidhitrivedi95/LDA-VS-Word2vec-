So is set the tone for my trip and it was unfortunate when it came to food. I'm someone who has been visiting oyster bars lately for baked oysters and usually enjoy it. I'm not allergic or didn't get sick in the other where I visited oyster bars so I'm not really sure what was the issue here. The only thing I could think of was I usually get my oysters baked and I'm not 100% sure these were not baked. But then again I don't exactly remember what I ordered other than oysters themselves. 

I will say that the staff was super attentive and super nice. None of this changes the fact that I got sick. That's why this review is "just okay".
