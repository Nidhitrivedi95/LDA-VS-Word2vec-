IDW4QFw-fN_wk81G9OV-Mg I had to visit twice before I wrote a review to make sure what I experienced the first time was real. Well it was.

Took my wife here for the first time, promising a tasty, healthy meal. She was not disappointed. The whole building smells incredible as soon as you walk in. With unlimited choices of combos being able to add any protein to any noodle dish or salad is great. Great local art on the walls, and a general cozy feel.

You order your food, get a number ala Showmars or McAllisters. They bring it out, very happily. All the workers genuinely seem happy, which is rare.

Great spot for lunch, although might be a bit pricey but for the quality, as well as quantity (usually 2 lunches worth) it is well worth a visit to this once ghost town of a road as construction all but shut it down for almost a year.

Something for everyone, even veggies, you're missing out for not having been here.
