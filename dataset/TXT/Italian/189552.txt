OzRGWW5R05kC0pQyUHX3lg Guarino's is one of my favorite restaurants down in Little Italy...the marinara sauce is one of the best I have ever had..the Alfredo sauce could have used more cheese and butter in it (was still good).. The wedding soup was delicious... And the veal was perfectly cooked and had great taste..the lasagna could have used a bit more ricotta cheese.. But that was my only complaint for that dish..great food, great atmosphere, great service, and even the owner goes around and talks to the tables..he pulled up a chair and sat and chatted with us..great place!!
