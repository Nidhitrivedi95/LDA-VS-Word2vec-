dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw My husband and I sat at the bar for the bar menu. We specifically asked for their bar menu as they initially gave us their regular appetizer menu. I asked a waitress at the West Wing (bar in MGM) about the bar menu here and she didn't even know they had a discounted menu...she was quite excited. I love Yelp! Okay, we are sitting at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and we really enjoyed talking to him. We each had a glass of red wine and decided to order the truffled gnocchi, steamed mussles and meatballs. The gnocchi was okay, I think I just didn't like that it was fried. The meatballs were enjoyable, but I guess I was expecting something a bit more special since it sounded so good on the menu. The mussels were excellent. We received a complimentary moscato from our bartendar. I liked the atmosphere and would still go back.
