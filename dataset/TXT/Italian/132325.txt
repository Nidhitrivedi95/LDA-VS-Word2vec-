iJpTpE9A8WDWvUlvUcFZuA Well I'd like to know what "reservations" means at this restaurant. Still waiting to be seated 30 minutes after our reservation time! Seriously! I know things happen but it's quite annoying to start things off! I hope this isn't a sign of things to come when we're eventually seated! Three trips to the reservation stand and we were finally seated 50 minutes late! Now for a food review...don't get the chopped salad---not fresh tasting and too much dressing. Others had the wedge salad and enjoyed it. Lamb chops and Gorgonzola Medallions are excellent. Milanese Chicken was average. Overall the experience was not the best and it will be a long time before we come back.
