The best part is when the food arrived as I was talking to the manager and telling her how an hour later and two basket of breads into my dinner that I am no longer hungry, instead of being apologetic and offering something nice she decided to take my food back to the kitchen because I said I am no longer hungry! This is what you call superb customer service and ensure that I would come back or at least know how good of a food i missed out on!
