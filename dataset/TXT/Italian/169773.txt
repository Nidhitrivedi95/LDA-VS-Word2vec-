msEbcxHbv1d5Xj6YQSUxzg This is the best Italian food that I have ever had in my life hands down.  Okay, there was another place that I loved in NYC, but it's been a long time since I have enjoyed some delicious Italian dishes.  The pizza was to die for, the steak was heavenly, and the penne with shrimp & mushrooms in a rose sauce was out of this world.  Add to that some red wine and tiramisu and ice cream for dessert and you end up with a perfect meal.  

The staff was very friendly and I can't recommend this place enough.
