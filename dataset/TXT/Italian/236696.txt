We were able to book a separate seating area which featured a beautifully crafted harvest-table with accompanying open benches for seating, perfect for accommodating a relatively large group, yet also allowing for a relative degree of intimacy. 

We each contributed 35$ and were rewarded with a selection of antipasto's,pizza's and pasta's! my personal highlight was the Bufalina pizza, an ethereal combination of zesty tomato sauce, buttery bufiliana cheese and peppery arugula piled atop a crunchy thin crust.  M & B is a cool trendy spot, yet it is not the type of place that sacrifices quality food for overt hipness.  This is a real deal spot.
