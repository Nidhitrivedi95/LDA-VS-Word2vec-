Tgc2dTcE1xOey2OUt_PvXA Second time coming in and it was great. Our Server, Sarah was awesome. She knew the menu more than enough to explain to myself all of my many questions and hesitations and recommended an amazing pasta bowl which was A+. Always on top of our refills and ready/eager to answer our novice questions. Definitely will be returning again in the future
