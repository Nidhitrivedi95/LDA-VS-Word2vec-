64o_nYvzIKwHFOSYSEm-qw I ordered a pepperoni pizza online today after reading reviews. It was very easy to order online and I received both a confirmation email and phone call a couple minutes after placing the order and they let me know how long my order would take. By the time I got there about 20 minutes later, my pizza was ready. When I got home it was still hot...and soooo good! This is definitely the best pizza I've had so far here in Vegas. I will definitely be going back.
