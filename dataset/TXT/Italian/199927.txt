PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA Great spot with a menu that veers beyond the familiar standards and digs deeper into the authentic Italian cookbook that most of us now want.  From the Cacio e Pepe to the Uovo in Raviolo* to the truffle egg toast the menu does a great job of taking you back to the 'old country'.  
The ambiance is adequate, the service attentive, and with time this should be a great spot for some great Italian.

*Only real complaint was the Raviolo.  You have the San Domenico name attached to it, where are the truffles?  If you are paying homage the orginator you should be completely faithful to the recipe.
