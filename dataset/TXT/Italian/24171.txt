46JVW4pwLDRIye4gYJboSw So not impressed by this Italian restaurant. As a Vegas local I know one thing: casino's know how to do an Italian restaurant. But sadly this location has a poor Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is beautiful and the service is great, there are no complaints about the waiters or bussers or decor. Their menu is so limited you don't even want to eat there. The food that you do receive is edible but there is no selection. I would only come here for dessert and drinks. Do not come here on an empty stomach.
