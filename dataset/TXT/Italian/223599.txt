Waited for 10 minutes and asked to have a dirty table cleaned up, waited another 5-10 minutes and nothing. You might get prompt service from the token greaser if you're a cute girl, otherwise steer clear unless it's dead. Sad, I had such high hopes for this place. More wait staff, signage saying seat yourself or hire a hostess maybe?
