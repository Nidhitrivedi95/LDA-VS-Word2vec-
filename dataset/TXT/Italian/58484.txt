We tried both thin and Chicago style deep dish and both were cooked to perfection. The originality of the menu makes you want to try their suggested pizza combinations, but will many to choose from you will have to make a visit here again. Only complaint: the music (fit perfectly for the restaurants style although) was a little too loud to enjoy the company around you.
