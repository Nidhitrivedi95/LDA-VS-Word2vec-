RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ This review is for the Terrace Room downstairs from Different Point of View.  Yelp doesn't seem to have a separate listing for it.  This review is for the bar/lounge and wine list.  Although I do get food when I am there, they change the menu often so i don't feel it's fair to review food that won't be on the menu in a few months.

I have been going here for five years now and I never get sick of it.  They have a fabulous wine list and one of the most breathtaking views in all of Phoenix.  This place is a hidden gem and I'm always amazed when people say they have never heard of it.

The bar/lounge is completely walled with glass so you can see the city view from any seat within the bar/lounge.  The seating outside is a fabulous set up.  You can sit in a circle seating area around a fire pit, at a communal couch area, or at separate tables right at the edge of the mountain.  There is also a hidden seating area off to the West side that gives you a completely different view of the city.

Sometimes in the winter the chef will make homemade marshmallows infused with different liqueurs.  The cocktail servers will give you sticks to roast your marshmallows at the fire pit and they also provide different dipping sauces.  This is one of my favorite times of the year!!!  Don't miss out if you are there in the winter time!

The only complaint I have about this place is that it can be rented out so it is frequently closed for private parties.  ALWAYS CALL AHEAD TO  FIND OUT IF THEY ARE OPEN!

The staff is always amazing.  Bill, the manager, is always making sure you are enjoying your visit and April and Richard down at the Terrance Room are fabulous! 

Don't miss out on a drink and view at the Terrace Room!
