rVupX09AQhEg7Q_XnV1jYg Being a Manhattanite, it's sometimes easy to forget how spoiled we are when comes to good restaurants.  But since I am visiting family at Markham, I had to adjust my expectation.  I would give Citro a 3.5 star: 

Pro:
+ we had three dessert dishes, all pretty good (Tiramisu tasteful but a bit too soft, poached pear with gelato-good pear but gelato was actually not very impressive)
+ the short rib was the best--good taste and tenderness, the gnocchi has good taste but a bit too soft, seafood linguine was good, lobster Ravioli was a bit big and salty
+ the espresso was good

Con: 
- the appetizers were pretty week (spinach broccoli cream soup, crab cake, and cucumber tomato salad)
- no signature bread?!
- ambiance was pretty minimum though comfortable...  I wouldn't count against it  
- the wait service was a bit underwhelmed.  

Overall, I liked the experience.  It's a wall in hole place, but I like to help a restaurant with good food to succeed, especially when it's in a place where we don't expect decent Italian place.
