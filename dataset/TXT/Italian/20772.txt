366FaRQ1MWEHBhaEKTcriQ We have been to Spinato's quite a few times and have liked it everytime. My daughter has Celiac disease, so she hasto have gluten free pizza,and feels that Spinato's has the best gluten free pizza. I have had pizza also there that wasn't gluten free and it was delicious each time. Friendly and fast service makes it an enjoyable place to eat..
