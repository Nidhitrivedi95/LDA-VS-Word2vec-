xZeMt4Vg-P9PTyLgCe5phg My wife really likes the gyros here, I'm not familiar with them so can't speak about that.  I ordered the fried calamari as the entree and I think they were just ok.  They don't come with tartar sauce and when I asked for them, they said they didn't have any.  The marinara sauce was just ok.  Service was probably 4 stars, but the food was sooooo slow to come out and it wasn't really that busy for a Saturday night.  We may be back, because my wife likes this place, we'll see if they fare better then.  Also, this place was filled with 60 somethings on a Saturday night, we were the only people not in that demographic.
