kz7O0_o6WrDQk1Kl8dKeHQ Went here for brunch--we got there at 10:30 and the place was almost empty--understandable because of being a holiday.  the restaurant is nice looking--I had a typical breakfast and the food was fine--nothing interesting.  There is something off about this place--the service wasn't bad--but it wasn't right--here are things that were strange.  I am a tea drinker--i ordered hot tea and the only tea bag they had was chamomile.  I know how  herbal teas are popular now-- all that they had was chamomile-a very odd choice as it is usually used at night to calm ones' nerves (oh wait--maybe now I understand)--there wasn't a black tea--ie. earl grey, english breakfast or even a lipton tea bag available--so i ended up not having tea this morning  (which does make a girl cranky)--my friend and i ordered a drink--they brought her gruet first and then after several minutes brought my virgin mary--really they couldn't bring the drinks together?  it is not like the place was overwhelmed.  They overcharged my friend for her gruet--only by a $1 but made no effort to resolve it even after my friend brought it to their attention.  As we were leaving--now about 11:30 they posted their $5 specials on mimosas--did our server mention this when my friend ordered the gruet?  Nope.

the menu is trendy--but not particularly interesting--they would have been better off with doing a straight ahead menu and doing it well.  there is something off about this place--maybe because they are still working stuff out-I might go back because friends want to go there--but it would not be a place that will come to mind that I want to return too--
