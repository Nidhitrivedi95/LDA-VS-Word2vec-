PSRZaGGxXmOmabL2si8pKw The food was delicious for an italian restaurant but what made them stand out was the customer service! our waiter went above and beyond to make our night perfect by splitting our food into 2 placed for us so we didn't have to. we weren't too hungry so we only ordered an entree but the bread and the oil helped fill us up. 

our meal came with a salad as well, so our waiter divided it up for us then when our meal came out, it was divided into separate plates as well. the sides that came with out food was enough to fill us up too! 

all in all we will be coming back here as their customer service was amazing and their food was better than other italian chain restaurants. the place was also nice and clean
