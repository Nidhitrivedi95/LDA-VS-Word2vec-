aYjZc-3aVbPIPaJgGiUK_A I have been here a couple of times for lunch.  The first time I was here for their Restaurant Week.  I had their pulled pork shank sandwich.  It was tasty, but I found it a bit greasy overall.  It was served open on a slice of bread.  I think they had drizzled olive oil on the bread before serving which made it heavy.  

I was here this past Thursday for lunch with some friends.  It was pretty empty for lunch and this was evidenced by the fact that they only had one person working front of house.  I ordered their buckwheat tagliatelle this time.  It came with a poached egg on top and it was pretty tasty, but I would've preferred the tagliatelle cooked a bit longer.  Even though I like my noodles to have a bit of a chew, I found these noodles to be a bit hard.  It was still tasty though and the portion size just right.  

If you're looking for a slow tasty lunch, this is a nice place.  Their desserts are also amazing, but they're really pricy.  I might have to make another visit come Restaurant Week time.
