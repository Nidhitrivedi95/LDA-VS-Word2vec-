Everything was under seasoned and kind of bland. The pasta wasn't fresh which is disappointing because when I go to an Italian restaurant, I expect fresh pasta.   The portions were big but I ended up wasting food because it was so plain I didn't want to eat it. 
The "creme brulee" was a flan, not creme brulee. It was also the saddest dessert I've ever seen. They had taken it out of the container they baked it in and flipped it (like you do for a flan) but it didn't quite come out clean so there were pieces missing which is not too pretty.  Also, I don't understand the whipped cream and gooseberry and mint leaf decoration. It doesn't look good and doesn't add to the dessert.

My partner had cauliflower quinoa ball appetizer, seafood linguine, and Panna cotta.  The appetizer was okay, it was like arancini. Panna cotta was okay to but nothing special.

Overall, the food wasn't good and definitely not anything to come back for. If you're starving and not too picky about Italian food then I guess it's passable. The pasta was so bleh I ate the seafood and left the pasta on the plate. Oh well, only paid $25 for appetizer, entree and dessert.
