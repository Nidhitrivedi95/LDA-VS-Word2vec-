be9JlSE_-Hbl1ufM6UsTcQ this is the old location of digestif...i think it was a great transformation.

authentic italian dishes from scratch featuring a mushroom truffle risotto that is to die for, polenta dishes, and they also have their very own in house pizza oven (the pizzas are also delicious)

i have been a few times and love the wine list and the cuisine. service is great and the atmosphere is sexy...
