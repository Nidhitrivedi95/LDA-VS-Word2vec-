TVKenh65WwJX3zEr36zKCA Everytime I'm in town to visit, this is a MUST stop for lunch/ dinner. Everything here is fresh from the oysters, clams, shrimp, lobster, etc.  The pan roast and seafood chiapp. is my favorite. The chef packs the pasta with big pieces of shrimp, crab, and lobster. I don't know why they have low ratings, but you'll be surprised to taste such amazing dishes from this casino. Come try it out and you won't regret it!!
