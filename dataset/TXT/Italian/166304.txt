mDiFWhywAziq9SKnj6am_Q Il Posto has some really good aspects and it has some so-so aspects.

The outside patio area is completely awesome. It's like you're sitting in a little Italian cafe, with one of the walls mocked up to look like the side of an old style European building. There are Christmas lights strung about in different locations, a small bar area, a lil fountain and some other cool decorations. It's worth a trip just to hang out in their decked out patio area, if only to have some drinks.

The service was awesome. Our waiter was totally cool, friendly and accommodating. 

The fresh baked bread and oil with cheese dipping sauce was fantastic. Loved it.

They had local beer (Kiltlifter) on tap for only $3 a pint. awesome.

The salads and pasta entrees were just ok, which is the reason behind my 3 star rating. I just wasn't wowed by the main course. We'll definitely be back to try them again though, perhaps to sample their highly rated pizzas. I predict a review sequel in my future.
