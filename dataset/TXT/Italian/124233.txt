HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ This is by far one of the best restaurants in the city!  We did the prix fixe menu which featured a stellar lineup of dishes.  The chickpea fries are pretty much the most inventive thing I have ever eaten, and the beef tenderloin with grilled foie gras was to die for!   John was a great server--so informative and friendly without being over the top!
