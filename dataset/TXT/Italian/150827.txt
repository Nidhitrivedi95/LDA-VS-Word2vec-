klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw I went here for the "Taste of Wynn" prix fixe, and I was very pleasantly surprised. We wanted something nice but not too formal for our last night in Vegas (we were tired). We also didn't go to dinner until around 10pm. The food here was very good. The pretzel sticks with mustard was great. I had mac and cheese bites (to die for), jidori chicken (good), and donut bites. The caramel dipping sauce for the donut bites was better than the chocolate dipping sauce.
