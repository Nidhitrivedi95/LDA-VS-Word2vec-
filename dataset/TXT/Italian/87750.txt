dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg Wow were we surprised and happy.  It's located in an ugly strip mall and the outside of the restaurant is uninspiring.  Once inside the magic emerges.  In the middle are nice leather couches and chairs and the entire inside exudes charm.  What is really great here is the food.  Let's start with the bread.  It's absolutely perfect.  It's the kind that is so moist, you can smunch it and it doesn't crumble.  The olive oil is a cut above. For starters we had the caprese salad, prosciutto crudo and artichokes.  It was all so tasty.  The mozzarella was the real deal. 

Next we all had a different homemade pasta with wonderful sauces.  Three of us had the pomodoro sauce which was perfect and fresh.  One had the pomodoro and meatballs which again was perfect.  Finally we topped it off with an espresso which was done in the manner you would find in Italy.  My only complaint was that they should have some homemade limoncello on hand for a  nice after meal drink.

This is a casual restaurant with reasonable prices and superb cuisine.
