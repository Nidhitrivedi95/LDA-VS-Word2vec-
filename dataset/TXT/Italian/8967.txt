0iOF4P2dMmhQRJ84h2wDeg We were here with a party of 17 for a pre-Xmas dinner. There were small children and one 96-year old, so it was a tough group. There was a set menu with choices, but the service was slapdash and sometimes abrupt, the food just OK--bruschetta, salad, pasta for the kids, fish/risotto/steak/chicken for adults/dessert. Nothing was terrible, nothing very well done. I doubt I'd ever return here.
