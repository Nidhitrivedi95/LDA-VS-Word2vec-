q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ I'm Italian, so I've had the best Italian food at home. However, Capo's is one of my all time favorite Italian food restaurants anywhere, not just Vegas. AND the atmosphere is awesome. The piano player sounds just like Frank Sinatra, and I know, because he and Dean were friends of my Grandfather. You see, My Grandfather worked for Al Capone in the 1930's and I used to hear the stories about the numbers rackets and Speakeasies he ran and visited , so to experience Capo's homage to the old Mob Speakeasies of that era is just a treat for me. Capo's Restaurant & Speakeasy is more than a great Italian restaurant and Steakhouse , it's an "experience" worth leaving the Strip for. I promise, you won't be disappointed.
