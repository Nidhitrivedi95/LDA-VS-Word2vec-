ifEHr-ZnGFSKgJVsywiAFg Just OK. 

Wine selection is vast, particularly by the glass but the actual selections are not inspired, and there are no bargains.

Food wants to be high-end but just succeeds in being high-bland.

Bread selection is shockingly weak: some regular italian slices and some over-salted focaccia. The elaborate pouring of three olive oils doesn't cover the weak selection.

From now on, I'll go to the original Nora's on Flamingo: better food, better prices and less pretension.
