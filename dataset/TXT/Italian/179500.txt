nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Excellent! Service was great, very friendly and entertaining. Good wine list, reasonably prices- menu with good variety of classic Italian meals- we had the octopus with fingerling potatoes- very good, tender with orange, rather than the usual lemon
  Also had the caprese salad with small tomatoes and fresh mozzarella-very good 
  Chicken Marsala was excellent, with side if pasta, lasagna was incredible, a veritable brick if meats and cheeses! Plop, you will jot leave hungry
  Ended the meal with lobster tail, split ingest 4 people- very good with its flakey crust and creamy goodness

Overall, great meal, reasonably priced - would definitely return
