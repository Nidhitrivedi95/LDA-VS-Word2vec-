N6-dAWPTAaHqwRb94vXFCQ Slow service each time we come here. Always an excuse. Food is adequate but not worth the wait when there are so many options in the area (and more coming each month). The last two trips the servers were new and unsure of the menu specifics and had to step away from taking our order to check. Both visits, once our order was placed, didn't see the server again.
