qkDlRkNfrXE_4t2vMrTo0A Stopped in for a quick pizza and a Spotted Cow.  We sat in the bar area to avoid the wait in the main restaurant and cleverly ordered our pizza 'to go.'  The bar area was friendly and the service was fast.  Loved the pizza-the crust was excellent and it was piled high with toppings.  It's also super close to the conference center, which is why we landed here.
