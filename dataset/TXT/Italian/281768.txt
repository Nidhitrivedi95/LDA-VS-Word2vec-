YWRn5UF4Fdxo59Vu__t_Fw Wait...what?! How does this place get such good ratings?! I ordered a salad and small pizza and it took an hour to be delivered, when I was told it would be about 20 minutes. Then when it finally arrived the pizza was SMALL, didn't even take up space in the box it came in. And the salad a was fine but it wasn't worth what I paid for it. Really disappointing. Don't waste your money on this place, there are definitely better options in Lakewood.
