_mg5bYknpZgaWSfjQVmrJQ Went for pizza and order the meat pizza. Here are all the good things: the greeter was friendly; the server was friendly and attentive; the pizza crust was crispy, yet chewy; the meat and mozzarella were fresh and tasy.

The negative? The sauce was SWEET. Yuck. I've had sweet pizza sauces in other cities, but the sauces in Phoenix tend to be on the spicy side. It ruined the pizza for me that this sauce was sweet.
