We had a pizza bianco and it could have been great with a little garlic and salt. We also had a pizza with ham spinach and tomatoes and it was also bland and very watery. The staff was kind of slow and the whole time we were there, the staff was complaining and cussing because someone quit and the management staff didn't communicate this with the staff. Understandable to be upset but do it in private.
