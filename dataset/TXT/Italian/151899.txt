KqSWho4bavZzNH0qQ5GnQA I've ordered from this location a lot. You obviously get what you pay for when it comes to fast food pizza chains however I've ordered from a lot of locations. Last week I received my order and it was not made the way I had asked, normally I wouldn't call to complain however ''tis had been the 3rd time in 2 weeks.

I know my review may sound negative from how it started, however far from. Reluctantly I called, expecting the worst and was greeted very warmly by the manager. I had explained what happened and he immediately offered a replacement, what I got wasn't horrible and I was starving so I chose to eat it and didn't want to put them out of their way. Without hesitation he offered me a credit which I redeemed today with ease and they even knew what it was I had ordered so they obviously pay attention to previous orders. 

Great customer service from this location, will continue to order with confidence moving forward. Kudos to this location.
