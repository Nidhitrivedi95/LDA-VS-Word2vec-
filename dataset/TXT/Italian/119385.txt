H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g First of all, I love the fact that this restaurant  is located in the midst of the fabricated Piazza San Marco. I was in Venice last month, and it is a very modern smaller version of San Marco Square, non-the-less it was a perfect spot for the restaurant of the infamous Mario Batali. 
This will always be memorable, because my parents are locals of Vegas, so they were meeting us here for lunch.  Meeting my BF for the very first time, so yes I was nervous. So he ordered a bottle of red wine knowing that a glass would help me. 
I have to say, that I was never a big fan of Italian food and perhaps I take that after my father.  So I was a little apprehensive that my dad would not enjoy his lunch with us. Fortunately everything we ordered was a hit.  We started w/ arugula salad... my favorite. But you can't go wrong with that, it's pretty simple. We also shared  a margharita pizza as an appetizer.  I love that it's thin crust. It was delicious. Both my dad and BF ordered the steak. My mother had the lasagne, and I ordered the grilled succulent pork chop.  We all shared a bite of everyone's main entree, and they were all incredibly yummy!  Our desert was sundae of 4 different gelati. coffee, pistachio, caramel, and chocolate.  Sinfully good! Our friendly waiter was very patient and attentive.  And best part was my parents enjoyed their lunch and getting to know my bf. It was sort of preliminary rendevous to get a taste of where my parents were off to... they were getting ready to leave for Europe... They are about to spend the entire summer in Italy... primarily Venice. So how cool was that?
