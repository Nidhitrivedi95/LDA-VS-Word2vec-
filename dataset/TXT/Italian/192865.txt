pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ It was my first time here and it was packed! Man do they need to expand that parking during lunch hour. It made me feel like their food would be good. When I walked up to the hostess she informed me that my company didn't have a reservation. I was a bit confused because my DM had made one on 3 days ago. I had to wait for my DM to get there and come to find out that our private room had been booked at the wrong time. It was a little difficult to conduct our meeting since we didn't get the private room but they did a good job clearing people around us. The food was pretty good and they comp us free dessert. My overall experience was good except for the part where we had to convince them that they forgot our reservation. It would have been nice for them to apologize for the mix up and possibly had a manager looked in to it. I would recommend this place on a personal day but would we hesitant if you need to make a reservation.
