pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ I used to really love this place. Since they've moved to a bigger place and have hired a bigger staff, somehow they've gained this weird, shitty attitude. If you can't accommodate your customers with their large amount of extra seating you have, then hire a larger staff. Isn't that why you moved into a bigger building in the first place? For more business? I called around 7 pm on a Tuesday, was told it would be a 25-35 minute wait which I was not happy with but because I really love their food, I was willing to wait. I literally walked into the restaurant 5 minutes later and was told that it would then be an hour long wait due to their "reservations and walk-ins" coming in just recently. They don't accept reservations for less than an hour when you call but yet an hour wait is somehow acceptable to them. Sad.
