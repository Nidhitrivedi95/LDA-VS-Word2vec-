KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ Came here last night with my boyfriend and I have to say if I were basing my rating on the service alone it would be 5 stars. 

We started with the calamari, baked clams, and meatballs. The meatballs were absolutely amazing! They were soft, moist, tender and very flavorful. The calamari was a little too greasy for me but again the sauce was seasoned perfectly. The baked clams were mostly breading and didn't have that crispness on top that you look for. 

We then split the Caesar salad which was very good and had nice sheets on thin fresh Parmesan cheese. 

For entrees I had the Ossobuco which I was disappointed with. It was a little tough and the risotto was bland. My boyfriend had the chicken Parmesan which he enjoyed. 

For dessert the peanut butter tart was delicious! 

All in all not a bad meal, but nothing compared to the original back in Harlem.
