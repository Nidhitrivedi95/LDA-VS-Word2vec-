KqxJcRmPEdiUTXHwsZcOZw I could write a 2 page review but in the essence of not wasting any yelpers time as Annie's Gourmet Italian had wasted mine here are some bullet points anyone considering this place should take into consideration.

1.) If you like paying $20+ for a plate of Italian food, seriously go to Olive garden instead, pay less and trust me the food at Olive Garden is better which is such a depressing statement to post.

2.) Expect slow and unattentive service.

3.) And with just my experience, but it could be different, if you actually eat the food and don't find it satisfactory don't expect a solution when brought to there attention just pay your large bill and walk away with your head held low as you just got swindled by this restaurant.
