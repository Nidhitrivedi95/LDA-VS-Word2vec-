N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ Two stars because I could have just saved 11$ by going down and picking up my food from them. They aren't even a whole mile away and there's a delivery charge?
Never again even though the food was decent. Didn't even tell me on the phone there was going to be a delivery charge. Then the driver wouldn't let me keep 

Changing it to one star now because I got a great comment from from the place about how "EVERY pizza place has a delivery charge and it goes to driver and I'm a cheap ass"
No, no, every place does not have a delivery charge. Especially a 5$ charge for less than a mile. And the driver told me he does NOT get the charge for himself which is why I tipped him 6.58$ on top of the delivery charge. So if you say he is getting more than a 20% tip for not even restaurant sit down service, and acquired it through means of manipulation then o am correct in my assessment of not patronizing this place in the future. Who the hell wants to pay 45$ for a pizza and cheap sandwich?
