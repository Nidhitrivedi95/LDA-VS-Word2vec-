G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I normally ramble on in my reviews but for this one I'm keeping it short and to the point.

This is the absolute worst meal I have ever had in Vegas or anywhere else for that matter. It was such a disappointment because I love Giada's shows and I was looking so forward to eating there. 

The menu selection wasn't impressive!!

The portions were small!!

The prices were outrageous!!

The food was horrible!!

The service was forgettable!!

Don't waste your time or money
