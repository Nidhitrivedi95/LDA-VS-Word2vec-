A7fkuHw8wxEdn0v-SKBP9g We felt like calzones and we ordered it from this location. We were a bit put back from the expensive prices on the menu but we NEEDED some quality calzones! They were HUGE, tasty and hit the spot. I'd like to order from here more often but the price tag will limit us from orsering here only rarely.
