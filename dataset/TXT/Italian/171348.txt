mZULBMjzhkQub7nqtHqSlQ A true hidden gem. Busy all the time. Since discovering this place a month ago, I have been 4 times. Food is excellent, wine list is good and reasonably priced. The only minor complaint would be the background music, but that is usually drowned out by conversation. 

Wait staff are pros and the owner is very visible. Can't wait to go again.
