0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ If you're ever in the Centennial area, you know what I mean when I say that there's a ton of restaurants all in a 1 mile radius here.  In fact, there's really no need to ever leave the shopping center if you're hungry. But here's the issue, most of the restaurants are franchise or corporate owned.  So, it's obvious that I was pleased that Chef Marc's Novecento Pizzeria opened out here.  Less than a year since they opened, I finally got a chance to eat here. I am a pizza fan, but don't get the opportunity too often. So when a lunch with a bunch of Yelp friends at Novecento came up, we weren't passing on it.

We didn't partake in the $25 all you can Yelp eat. We ended up sharing a pizza and side of meatballs. Lets start with the meatballs. This was a meal in itself.  A lot of peeps rave about their homemade sauce, but for me it's all about the meatball. No fillers here. Each meatball is packed with flavor and protein.  You can actually get full from a couple of these bad boys.  As for the pizza, we shared their Margherita, which you can consider as a guiltless type pizza. Not much on it, except for pure taste of Naples. Taste, texture, and portions are more than enough. Now here's the bonus, half the pizza is only about 370 calories. This means zero guilt when I ate my half of this pie.

I'm a fan of a great tasting, authentic as it gets, pizza. Novecento definitely did not disappoint.  Novecento also offers a bunch of other pizzas and if you can't decide on which, then opt for the build-your-own.  When I'm in the mood for some good pie, I know where to go when I'm in the Centennial area.  Novecento, you rock!
