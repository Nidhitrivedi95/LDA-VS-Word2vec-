KcIalceIg6PSPONvLlI4-w Lovely cafe/bakery joint that seems to be part of terrroni. Tried their small donuts which were amazing! Was expecting dense typical donut consistency but was airy yet rich with cream inside. Would return to try their other baked goodies! They also sell La Colombe coffee those who are fan of the philly coffee
