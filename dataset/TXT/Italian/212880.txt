The menu is pretty decent sized to the point where I wasn't sure what I was going to have until I was at the front of the line. They also appear to be doing a pretty hopping business judging by the line at both the bakery and the hot food section. I ended up ordering the "Hot beef in juices" which is basically an Italian beef sandwich minus peppers and onions. It was pretty good though I wasn't in love with the roll it was on, but otherwise no complaints. I plan on going back and exploring the menu more since there is a ton of items on it that I'd love to try.
