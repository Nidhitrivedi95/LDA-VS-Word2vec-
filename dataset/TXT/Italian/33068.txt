5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA I LOVE this place!! We go at least once a month. The food is incredible, and I love their shrimp scampi. Honestly, have never had a bad meal. We like this place so much we have had Christmas dinner there the last two years. My only slight complaint would be that occasionally service is very slow.
