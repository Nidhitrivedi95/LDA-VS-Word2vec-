wo6Z6VLOJejln04CsoX1WQ Maybe this place was good back in the day...not so much today. 

I passed by once for a slice after reading all these reviews.  Seriously, everyone's saying its the best pizza in Etobicoke.  So, I grab a pepperoni slice.  Dried up slice.  Nothing special.  

A couple of months later I ordered delivery.  It's not the worst pizza I've had, but it's still on the lower end of the scale.  Nothing near what these reviews are saying.  They best thing they do is deliver your pizza quickly.

If you're in need of a pizza within 25 minutes, order il Paesano's.
