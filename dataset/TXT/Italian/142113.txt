JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A Went last night for a late night drink & snack and was greeted with a waitress who seemed super annoyed. Our bartender was really sweet and made great drinks, but the original waitresses attitude was brutal. Customer service is important, you're a 24hr cafe, what was with the attitude at 11pm?
