ydj6cSmcOM_jVYJLkHzdOA I was there this past Saturday (5/6/2017) for my first time, at first I was impressed with the place, seemed clean, lots of craft beers, the dude bartender made a decent gin and soda and that's where things went downhill! The female bartender proceeded to make a drink for a patron... She sat there for 5 mins trying to fish a bug out of the drink, she couldn't get it out with the spoon and that's when she went in with her fingers!! WHO DOES that? I was totally disgusted. I asked for my bill and proceeded to call her out. She didn't seem to think there was an issue with her fishing a bug out of the drink let alone putting her dirty fingers in said drink. I said what if the Toronto Health department came in and seen her do that? She said it's just a fruit fly, I said, bugs carry bacteria  and diseases, clearly you have not taken your food handlers and or smart serve. So, I waited a day and I emailed the bar and got some BS response back, they also didn't seem too concerned this was my first time there and wouldn't be returning, I guess they don't seem to care about word of mouth.. If this sort of thing happens at the bar what goes on in the kitchen?? Here is their response:  

Hi Lori,

Thanks for your email we will chat with the staff member. To insure this does not happen again the drink should have been dumped and the fruit flies appear with the warm weather but they are easily killed when we bleach the counters daily.

Thanks,

The Dylan Team
