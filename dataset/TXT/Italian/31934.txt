5SEwzlWlrxSVyZx3IgXwLg Very disappointed.  The lamb with gnocci was 90% gnocci, very few bites of lamb and the gnocci was doughy and flavorless.  The chicken saltimbocca arrived overcooked, one dry, stuck-together lump of heavily-spiced chicken bites with very few mushrooms or onions or anything else. 
All four tables surrounding ours arrived well after we did and yet received their food well before we did, even after we politely inquired about our order.  
The only positive was our waitperson - very pleasant and funny, and we actually felt bad for her!
No plans to return, obviously.  Too bad, could be different as  it has nice atmosphere, easy and plentiful parking.
