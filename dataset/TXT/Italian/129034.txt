i4hvmTd4RH9HvOyG8ndYGw My family loves this place! It's a small hole in the wall in a bit of a scary neighborhood at night, but picking up pizza is worth it! Nice big pizza sliced and delicious wings. They are always very accommodating to our specific pizza orders. Our favorite chicken wing sauce is the Carolina sauce, which is no longer in the menu, but they will still make for us. I believe it's a mix between honey mustard and bbq? I don't know for sure. All I know is that it's addicting! Great service, always. :)
