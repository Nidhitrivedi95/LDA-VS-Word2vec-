aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA Some people claim this isn't pizza.....and while i have to agree that Mac and cheese as a topping doesn't constitute a normal pizza, if it were a thing...Ian's pizza got it right. I am SOLD on their Mac and cheese pizza. I mean who doesn't like carbs on carbs? Now, for all you out there that want to say this isn't pizza, fine....it's not deep dish, its not pan, its a mixture of their own findings, but think about this situationally:

It's 2am you're hungry and don't want to pay for the surcharge that uber and lyft has placed for the night. Where are you going to go? IANS. yasss. and if this place doesn't hit the spot at that time, i know you're a dang liar. Granted I will critque the service as I do believe they need to work on a better process of getting the pizza heated up, but once that delicious piece of bread and cheese come out...you can not lie that it hits the spot. 

Also, if you're not into pizza's they do have salad, although i have yet to try it. BUT what i have tried is their breadsticks and those pieces of heaven mixed with their homemade ranch...WOW. so whether you're looking for drunk food on a Saturday night or some slices of pizza for your GNI, Ian's is the place to go.
