z8H4Mdzl4jS9pYswj6Jf9w I had high expectations of Buca from all the amazing things I have heard of it. 

PROS:
- Impeccable service; Our server was very friendly and informative; She made our overall  experience excellent 
- The vibe is accessible, welcoming and casual - not over-the-top formal; I am interested in eating good food, not having to spend 45 minutes in front of a mirror worrying if my outfit is appropriate for a restaurant. Buca has a open vibe in that regard for a restaurant at its price point. 
- Polenta: Must have! An incredibly delicious side
- Fresh, high quality ingredients 

CONS:
- Four of us had different mains and thus, had the opportunity to try various dishes. Overall, the food was very fresh, quality ingredients, I did not find the flavours to have a punch or exciting taste. The dishes were quite subdued in flavour. For the price point, I had higher expectations and some of the dishes (two of the pastas in particular) tasted a bit generic.
