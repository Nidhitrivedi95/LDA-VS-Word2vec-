miUmZ27vC-gHoyEmUQMYuQ We were here for a birthday, we agree with majority and the food was delicious. Amongst us girls, we ordered: calamari, mussels, bruschetta, meat lover pizza, clam linguine, lobster Mac and cheese and a small dessert. We have no complaints, portions were big prices were comparable. We found the service was great and if you're looking for a quaint and quiet restaurant, this will greatly satisfy. 

Everything was phenomenal until our chef was being sociable (again, very nice man and easy to talk to) decided to strike a conversation near the end of our dinner and subconsciously picks deep into his ear and rubbed his fingers together to feel for his harvest. For this reason, my review does not yield full marks. I am a huge stickler for service and cleanliness and when I see ear picking at the front of the house, I question clean and quality. My group noticed it and one by one put their forks down worried we might end up eating his excess. 

Overall, less that experience - solid restaurant, delicious food and warm staff.
