6We2O5X62J_gduXU7jvf8w This is a great place that's honestly, REALLY tucked away in Chandler. Even though it's off of Chandler Blvd...it's the opposite direction of a crowd. It's a few miles from the Chandler Fashion Square Mall, which why you won't find a SUPER packed restaurant. That's a rare gem if you ask me, especially on a weekend night.  

There was not a wait, which was super suprising! I'm used to an Oreganos-like wait in order to get decent pizza or pasta. Everything seems to be advertised as homemade. It honestly tasted like it too. I got the sixth topping (forgot what it's called, something six) pizza. It was delicious.  It was paritucliary sweet. Not sure if all of pizza sauce is that sweet. Wasn't bad st all though. My gf got the turkey and pesto sandwich (I think), and that also was great. The bread was the
 best part, and it didn't fill you up with calories either. 

It was great pricing. The literal only the thing that could have been better...was the waiter. He was a bit awkward - not to throw anyone under the bus! I'll still be back, and could rate this place 5 stars afterwards...
