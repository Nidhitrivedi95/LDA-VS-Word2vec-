MrmwDgMlL2GtthlAZsJwNQ Wow. I didn't realize it has been almost two years since I last dined at Scaddabush.

I had dinner here with my boyfriend this (Thursday) evening and we were pleasantly surprised... Amazing service, great food and drinks, relaxed ambience, and $7 Bellinis every Thursday. ;)

Our server, Nick, was very friendly and outgoing. His recommendations were on point! 

Our go-to is a (peach) mango Bellini, but I wanted to try the Blood Orange Bellini so we ordered both. The Peach Mango Bellini was way better.

We started with the Bomba Burrata and it was so good. Fresh mozzarella in a spicy tomato sauce with bacon over a slice of fresh focaccia bread made in-house -- mmm... It was spicy, but not too spicy. 

Next up was the Italian Burger, which is, apparently, Nick's favourite item on the entire menu. We had to give it a try... The focaccia bun was fresh, the beef was nicely cooked to a medium, the fried mozzarella was crispy, and the pesto aioli really stood out. We also tried the Rosemary Garlic Fries as our side dish and it was great.

My boyfriend was eyeing the Smoked Bacon and Egg Pizza, but instead, opted to try a pasta we've never tried before. We decided on the Pesto Pollo. The pasta was not cooked al dente nor over-cooked. The basil pesto cream sauce was tasty and the semi sun-dried tomatoes complemented the chicken and the spinach well. It was a very simple but comforting dish. 

After a great experience at Scaddabush this evening, I have already recommended the Italian Burger to my burger-loving friends. :) Thanks, Nick!
