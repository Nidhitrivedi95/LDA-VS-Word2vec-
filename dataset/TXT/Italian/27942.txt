4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ Here for a basketball tourney. My son had to carb up. The place was empty, we got good service and great food and the food came out quick. My son had speghetti and meatballs and I had a salad that had Italian dressing and salami. They also carry an amazing blueberry heffinweizin on tap. A little pricey but good.
