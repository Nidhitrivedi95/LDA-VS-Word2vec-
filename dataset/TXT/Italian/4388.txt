_leN3DDSaykQobM8FP9iaA This location was always one of my families go-to pizza sit in restaurant, the food is more often than others better than expected but the franchise has proved to make it more pricey. Overall it's been a great decade or more coming here but this location is sadly closed because too many people order out these days.
