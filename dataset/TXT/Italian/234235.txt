tQBTBxZyM3OarBffqafu4w This place has everything I look for in a casual ristorante! Great pizza, subs and pasta dishes your mamma should have made! The servers are quick and attentive and the owners are usually out making their rounds as well.

We've eaten here over 4 times now and each time left well fed and happy. My favorite so far has to be the sausage and peppers pasta. It's a must-try. The pizza and salad buffet is always good when you can't decide on an entree and even comes with pastas. If you're not in the mood for something heavy, the Italian sub is perfect. We've even taken them out on the lake - perfect for the cooler.

So glad this place has reopened with the original owners! Mangia!
