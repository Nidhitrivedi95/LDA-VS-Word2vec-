SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Maybe it was just a bad night, or maybe because it was a party of 10, but this was not a good night for us at Herbs & Rye.
We came during their happy hour and thank goodness, because the bill would have been almost double, and I am sorry, but the prices they are charging for the quality of food just doesn't match up!
I don't mind paying good money for good food, but this was not good. I guess their specialty here is their drinks. So maybe we missed out on the whole "experience", we drank wine with dinner, which no complaints about the wine. The problem really was the food. It just wasn't good.
The ribeye was cooked properly as far as the medium rare order was placed but there was no flavor, and the texture was bad.  One of the worst steaks I have tasted. As bad as the steak was it was better than the pasta. The penne pasta had a truffle cream sauce and it was really inedible. The cream sauce tasted so bad, it was really not cooked properly at all. The cream was too heavy and was separated. My son had the linguine and clams, he ate all of his dinner without any complaints or issues, my daughter had the angel hair pasta with chicken, and she also did not complain about her dish.
I had seen so many good reviews for this place, and I was really looking forward to going. I knew I wanted the ribeye because of all the good reviews. I don't know what happened on the night we went and I doubt I will go back. At least for the food that is, maybe just go for drinks?
