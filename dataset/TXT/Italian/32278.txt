5sZyYGQH4k-WwvVJk_LIvQ My fiance and I went here after purchasing a Yelp deal as we had driven past the restaurant many times and never made it in!  Let me start by saying the staff were extremely attentive and accomodating (though borderline suffocating at times) but it was also a Wednesday evening before restaurant week so perhaps it was abnormally quiet.  

We weren't planning to have wine with dinner but couldn't resist when they told us it was 1/2 priced bottles night.  We had a tasty Malbec and for half price it was a great deal!

The food was good.  Is is bad I don't really know what else to say than that?  I had a pasta dish with a variety of shellfish in a vodka sauce and my fiance had the chicken parmesan .  Everything I would say was average - portions were plentiful, food was flavorful but nothing really wowed me.  Had I not had the Yelp deal I imagine I would have been a little disappointed in paying $28 for a pasta dish that was just good.  

With that being said, I will file this restaurant in the "Wouldn't choose to return but would be fine with someone suggesting we go there" section of my dining rolodex.  For what it's worth, I think there is much better food (particularly Italian) at other places that can offer the same dining experience at half the price.
