QnTguWLRKRK_reQ__8k7yw Had meetings in the area and had to grab a quick lunch for my colleagues. I found this spot on yelp and called to place an order of 6 large pizzas. They had my order ready in under 20 minutes and the staff there was more than inviting. I met the owner and he offered me a drink for free while I waited. He couldn't have been a nicer guy. Although I'm not in the area often I would highly suggest this place for quality pizza and amazing service.
