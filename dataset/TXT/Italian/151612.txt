KpgPSQmQDgx3tJ6RlKVCBA Service: Daniel and the servers and are short staffed. Service was good but pretty slow night for them. They work hard and they care. Could be cleaner.

Food: Disappointed in the pizza tasted good but very greasy. The salad was fresh, no problem there. 

I think they need to improve food standards and they can do well from there..
