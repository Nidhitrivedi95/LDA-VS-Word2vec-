Ok, the bartender seemed to be having a bad night and was a bit rude and un-attentive.  Then, we overheard all the other employees complaining about issues with the restaurant and I felt like I was on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares! We finally were given our table and service was a bit slow (thank goodness for all the wine) but not extremely bad.  The waitress (who was really sweet) apologized for the kitchen and comped a dessert.  

The 2-star review is mostly for the food since I've just had better italian elsewhere and for cheaper.  We had the calamari which was good but not amazing, the caprese which was fresh and you really can't mess up, the fettucini w/ light cream sauce and the tiramisu.  The sauce on the entree was uneventful and not reduced enough and the peppers were undercooked.  The tiramisu was not the best I've ever had....bit too much cocoa powder on top and a little light on the espresso.  Will prob visit the other Phoenician italian restaurants for comparison before returning.
