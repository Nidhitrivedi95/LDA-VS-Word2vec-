xyMZdF9Xh9N6il831_Czsg I was a little worried I wouldn't like this place from reading reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, you order your food from a refrigerated display and maybe they microwave it (there is a full kitchen so I doubt it) but I really don't care! The sandwiches were awesome! I ordered the sirloin sandwich which had caramelized onions, delicious gorgonzola and roasted tomatoes on a ciabatta. Seriously delicious! My boyfriend got the prosciutto, mozzarella and roasted peppers. Again, seriously delicious! We ordered a side of orzo. The orzo was average but still quite good. I so wanted to have some gelato for dessert but we were too full from our sandwiches.

I guess the owner wasn't there because no one bugged us during our meal except to refill our iced teas.

I love this place and can't wait to go back, my mouth is watering just thinking of that sandwich!
