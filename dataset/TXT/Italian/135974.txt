IXJ5sfKnsGu6drrFUceQ5Q Never been to this place but WAY better than almost anywhere I'd been in Cleveland.   Great staff, much nicer crowd than many bars and the band rocked big time.  "Cleveland's Breakfast Club".  Cool sound system and for those who didn't want their face blown off (we did) they could hang behind the band on the pool table side and still hear things.  Well done - now get the Browns to win and we are all good.
