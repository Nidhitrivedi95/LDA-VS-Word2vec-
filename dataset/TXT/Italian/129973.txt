i7qF0eFoe35Cedn_seUm1w I have to say we love Picazzo's. We just moved over from Italy and have been searching the valley for good "Italian" style pizza. We took a chance on Picazzo's and man are we glad we did. This is the best pizza I have found in the west valley. Outside of driving an hour to hit a small pizza joint in Mesa, this will now be my new go to pizza home. 

We had the Nonna's Favorite plus Anchovies (common in Italy). The crust was good and not to thick. The pizza was not rewarmed and tasted great. The only thing we wished it had was more anchovies or smaller pieces spread more evenly around. 

We did take our pizza to go so I can not comment on the service. There was a live music act and the place was packed. I would have to assume it is a well liked place. 

Great food, not to bad a price.
