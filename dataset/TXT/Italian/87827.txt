dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg I love the atmosphere of this place. Its not quite a full restaurant, nor just a deli, but rather an intimate spot to have a quick lunch or casual dinner. Im a huge fan of their fresh pasta selection as well as their deli choices. Their Italian market is also a key factor with my liking of this place. Its not overly abundant with products, but it seems to have enough to cover your needs if you're in need of traditional italian products.

The food here is great too. I cant compliment the meat lasagna enough. Delicious! The various other meals I've had have been good too for the price. Service is wonderful, food is great, and prices are fair.
