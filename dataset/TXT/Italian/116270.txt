GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA I ate here over New Years weekend. It was a little disappointing since I'm a huge fan of Mario Batali.   I ordered a braised pork appetizer. The name escapes me but I think that there was some pork feet in it. Super tasty and came accompanied with a mesclun salad that had the perfect tangy vinaigrette. I loved my app, so we thought we were off to a great start. For the entree, I ordered the black spaghetti with Njuda and sicilian pesto (the waiter had told me that it was spicy, but this spaghetti was REALLY spicy).  It was so spicy that my mouth was on fire and it completely took away from the rest of the dish which was pretty tasty, I think.  My husband ordered the beef cheek ravioli and although it was very tasty, it was not as exciting as it sounds.  Overall I wouldn't eat here again as there are so many tasty restaurants in Vegas.  Sorry Mario...I'm still a fan of your other restaurants.
