3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A I booked a reservation here for a friends birthday. There were 7 of us and we sat up on a high top table. I wasn't overly familiar with their menu other than it was an Italian restaurant. 

I was definitely blown away and very impressed with the menu options and the food itself. Every plate that came out was amazing, I don't think I had one item I didn't like. 

I can't wait to go back again!
