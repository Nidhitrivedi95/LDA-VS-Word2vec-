VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ Ordered at least 5 things off the menu, about half were edible, the other half, well lets just say its the first time in 4 years my girlfriend had to vomit after eating such nasty food, and no she was not over exaggerating I too came close to vomiting, over priced and awful, the place has a great look to it, inside and out, id give it 4 or 5 stars on just the look alone, but loud staff not working playing pool behind us disturbing the dinner, awful food and about 4 different waiters? Not to mention the last desperate act of the ( spend money get points for free food ) program at the end of the meal, all in all, i wont be back here until some other owner buys it and makes it something else worthy of the ambience and decor.
