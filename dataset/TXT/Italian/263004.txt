wVc3g-YfyDvkOLDecpr4DA I can't understand what all the 5 star reviews are.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  The menu looks handwritten, every word in upper case, which can be very hard on the eyes.  The restaurant is loud and noisy and very run down.  I couldn't hear our own conversation.  I kept hearing the waiter repeating the specials on the menu to other tables. Even he had to yell because it was so loud in there.   I would have had a better meal at the Keg for a lot less.  The waiter did not even know which wine to recommend for our meal. We asked if the ribs were beef - we were told yes by two different waiters.  We had a gut feeling that we couldn't trust them because of his answer to the wine.... So we asked a third waitress and she confirmed they were pork.  We don't eat pork.  Very disappointing when you can't get straight facts from the main waiter.   
Someone said in another review, their dish tasted like a can of tomato sauce on their food.  That's exactly what it seemed like to me.  And we ordered one of the specials ($27) which was the bass fish... seemed like 2 fillets out of the freezer.   
Not worth the money at all!!  Go to the Keg.
