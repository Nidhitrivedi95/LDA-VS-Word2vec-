0iOF4P2dMmhQRJ84h2wDeg Saw so many high reviews for this place so booked reservations for 3 people on a Saturday night to eat some Italian grub.  

When we got to the place and walked in, the place felt very fancy.  It was a bit low lit and the tables were nicely setup.  The next thing we noticed was that 85<U+2105> of the patrons at the restaurant were seniors!  Not sure if it was senior night or something but it was a bit funny.  Love the seniors though!

On to the food review. We ordered mushbroom bruschetta with cheese and grilled calamari for starters.  The bruschetta was nothing special and the grilled calamari was a bit of a disappointment.  It lacked the grilled taste as if it wasn't grilled long enough and it was definitely bland.  For the mains, we all orders various pasta dishes.  I got the the portabello and chicken.  I was expecting next level pasta but to be honest, it fell short.  It tasted just like any other pasta dish at some random place.  Nothing special at all.  Where this restaurant shined in my opinion was their Tiaramisu dessert.  My wife and I ordered separate portions and I'm not much of a dessert kind of guy but I plowed through my portion in a blink of an eye.  Their Tiaramisu must have been the best I've had in awhile.

Overall, the food was edible but if you asked me if this place blew my socks off when it comes to Italian cuisine then I would have to disagree.  The service was  a bit of a disappointment too.   Not once did our waiter come by our table to check up on us throughout the evening.  They didn't even ask us for any Parmesan cheese when the pastas were served.  I had to wave them down for that one.  If I were to come back, it will not be for their Italian cuisine but strictly for their Tiaramisu!
