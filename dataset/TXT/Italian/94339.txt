ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA The food was pretty good but service was too too slow.  We waited for our water, our drinks and our food order was mixed up and delayed to the pont where we wanted to send it back.  Pleasant waiter but bar was backed up so all delayed.  Inside was so noisy we moved outside.  Simply hire more staff !
