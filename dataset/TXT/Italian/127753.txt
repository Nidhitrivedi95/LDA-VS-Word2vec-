hWrr711CC8UpHvQPKyluqQ I and a couple friends came here attempting to eat dinner.  When we got there we waited at the front entrance waiting to be seated (there were at least 5 empty tables at the time).  After 10 minutes, a waitress acknowledged us and said that we would have to wait 5 minutes or so.  It was like being in that Seinfeld episode where Jerry and Elaine are in the Chinese restaurant and are told to wait "5-10 minutes".  

Another 15 minutes passes, and the wait staff pretend not to see us waving to them.  Meanwhile, there is a large party behind us forming, and still no reaction from the wait staff.  Frustrated, we went off to another restaurant down the street, which ended up being much friendlier.  

So not necessary, especially for a restaurant that received only a conditional pass from the municipal government for cleanliness!  Eesh!  Unfortunately, no review of the food, but I do not think I will be returning.
