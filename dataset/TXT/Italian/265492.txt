Their soup is never 'off' and their bruschetta (especially the gluten free) is always on point regardless of the combination. We always start with the olives, and they have so much diversity and flavor in the bowl. Perfect for snacking while enjoying your glass of wine. The kids meals all come with wikisticks for stimulating their little creative minds and encouraging fine motor skill development. Man! What more could I say about a place THIS thoughtful. Even their bathrooms are a place worth checking out. Lots of eclectic decor and the music is very hip. I shazzam a song at least once every time I dine here.
