hsDkxhc-_YYsVqAeQBJJjg This is not a place I would take a serious foodie or critic, BUT there is something to love about Big Jim's. It really defines Pittsburgh to me before a lot of people from out of town started to pour in. It is a family restaurant. 

Their portions are enormous. They are not located in a ritzy part of town on the rise. The decor is absolutely just okay. But it is a very fun place to be. If you want to eat a lot of pasta or nice eggplant parmesan dinner, relax and unwind; you came to the right place. 

I ordered the baked ziti and it came with soup or salad and garlic bread. Everything was pretty plain but you could add as much dressing or salt as you would like. My ziti dish was bigger than my head and covered with cheese. Needless to say, we took home serious leftovers.
