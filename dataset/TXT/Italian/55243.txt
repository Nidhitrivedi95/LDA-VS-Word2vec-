Ah_W72utgLC8U4rIr6VtsA We had a dinner here for my parents 60th wedding anniversary, 16 people. They accommodated us no problem even tho the party room was already in use. All meals were hot and delicious. Not an easy task for that many dinners @ once. My compliments to the kitchen staff! Our sever did a great job also, handling all 16 of us by herself, keeping up with drink orders and refilling the bread which is delicious. My husband's  only complaint was that I wouldn't let him order the tiramisu.:-)
