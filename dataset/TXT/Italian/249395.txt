VjaHHmV-rSkFaOAnU3faxg We came here on a Thursday night and were pleasantly surprised.  We shared a house salad which was delicious.  The greens were super fresh and had some great dressing.  Onward we tried one of the daily special pizzas - I think it was the Farmer Joe - it was awesome.  This is truly some of the best and freshest pizza I have ever had.  They also have lots of craft beer from local breweries.  And to top it all off - our waitress was awesome too.  This is truly a gem hiding in a strip mall in Sun Prairie.  Go now.  Don't ever consider one of the pizza chains again!
