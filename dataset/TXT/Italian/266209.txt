X2U2sEnTGozDh9cyXrFGdQ This place is in the old Mom's restaurant outside Carowinds.  Sometimes when I stop on Carowinds Blvd for gas, I'll come here for lunch.  They offer a pizza buffet.

The buffet contains a salad bar, italian meals like penne pasta, spaghetti and meatballs and your choice of 4 pizzas at a time.

Some of my coworkers say this place is better than Ci-Ci's but I disagree.  They really lack a selection on their buffet and the pizza isn't all that tasty.  The meatballs are the best thing on the buffet.  

Too bad, the place has so much potential.
