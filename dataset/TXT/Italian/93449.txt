Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag One of the best lunches I've ever had, along with the best calamari and mussels. And the best tomatoes & mozzarella in my Caprese salad. Cute little place inside Crystals at CityCenter, with a nice bar area and cool bathrooms! The staff and service was excellent! Our waiter was funny and really took good care of us, we even got a big round table with no reservations. Highly recommend for lunch as the prices are not bad at all compared to most restaurants in Vegas.
