zyPGYeXF4XKCqNN1pjFWhg We had a fantastic meal tonight! Gorge and team accommodated us just before closing with grace and charm! We enjoyed a caprese salad with yummy fresh mozzarella and pesto; octopus with dreamy broth; risotto with lobster (see photo); bolognese; and veal chop. All were well prepared and plated - delicious even for finicky NYC dining folks!
As former-East Coasters, the lobster risotto was the standout as we rarely get lobster out west and WHOA prepared to this perfection! If it's offered, you should def order the lobster risotto!  (no lobster emoji yet)
