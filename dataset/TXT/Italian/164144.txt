lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg Our server was a man named yance. (not sure if spelt right) and he was awesome. Full of energy made us laugh all night and was just a energetic guy. To me personally he is one of the best servers I have ever had. He definitely made our dining experience here better. Our pizza which we were told would be 45-55 mins was on time. We ordered the mozzarella triangles and chicken tenders as starters and they were delicious. We also ordered the deep dish meat and more pizza and was fantastic. If yances boss's read this give this guy a raise because he was funny as hell. Keep up the good work
