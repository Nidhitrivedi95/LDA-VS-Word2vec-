LiSt3sVWELm7nfVIKJs0MA Decent food at a good price.  The atmosphere is OK, but you don't go here for the atmosphere.  You go there for the portions, service and great prices.  They deliver never ending garlic bread that will fill you up before the food comes.

They don't serve alcohol and at one time they were "cash" only, but I think that has changed.  I love ordering their rigatoni and salad for birthday parties.  For $30 you get enough food to easily feed ten and still have left overs!
