6NWSeAEufOHDklHbg4PAww We've been waiting for this place to open - to see what they did to the inside.  I was a fan of Bellini's, mainly for the atmosphere, so I was really hoping they hadn't ruined it.  The place looks great - really open and inviting.  Loved the industrial lighting they had scattered about and they didn't bombard the walls with décor, which would've taken away from the beautiful stained-glass windows. They installed quite a few TV's but they were placed really well, it didn't feel obnoxious like some sports bars. 

We were the only ones at the bar and there was only one other group there.  I believe the bartender said they just opened so I'm assuming the word hasn't gotten out.  They should consider putting some sort of sign out front or in the window signaling they're open.  Their 'Hail Mary' awning isn't enough to show it's a new place, or that they're open.

The bartender was super friendly and accommodating - she had a great, energetic personality.  We ordered the fried green beans which I thought were good but could use 1/2 the amount of batter.  Also ordered the Greek flatbread and that was amazing.  Generous on the goat cheese and olives, perfect crust.  Drinks were a good pour too =)  We will definitely be back.
