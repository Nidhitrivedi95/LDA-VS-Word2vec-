UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ We used to love floridinos but our visit today put a bad taste in our mouth. I wanted a light lunch so I chose a bowl of their Italian wedding soup. I was incredibly surprised when I was brought a bowl the size of a thimble. When I inquired if this was a bowl the server mumbled something and walked away quickly. The soup itself was nothing to write home about the little pearl noodles were basically mush. Everyone else's food in my party was up to par with their normal standards but I was put off by the size of my my meal. At the end we inquired again if this was really a bowl and the server got a little snippy and said "yes! I'll show you a cup for the size!" He proceeded to bring out an even smaller thimble and show us that indeed we had been given a "bowl". For comparison, the "bowl" I was given was the size of a normal soup cup that one would receive at a normal restaurant. 
All in all everyone else's meal was delicious and of normal size but their soup size choices were extremely misleading and I would caution anyone to order their soup.
