Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw My heart is in New York, my home, but when I'm in Vegas this is the only place outside New York I've ever been to that truly makes my stomachs happy. Fresh everything. Oh, and the people that work there? Phenomenal. I can never recommend this place enough. If you're debating on coming here, go. Enough said, just go.
