Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA The location is great and the food is decent.  The portions are a great size that can be shared by two. The service is awful. Waiter took our drink and food order and we never saw him again. We had another waiter drop off our food/drinks. Wanted to order another drink but couldn't find our waiter. Waiter dropped off our check without a word and no eye contact. We noticed an auto gratuity placed on our check. We asked the front desk and was told they do this for parties of 6 or more. We had FIVE in our party. We found our waiter and asked why he added the gratuity and he basically admitted that he scammed us. Not apologetic or embarrassed at all! Sad!
