tUjyGFSN8wQqLgKp5Q0CUA My boyfriend and I went to Trentina for my birthday and ordered the 11 course tasting menu. Though the portions were small, every single bit was so packed with flavor that it more than made up for it. The service was impeccable, from start to finish. Everyone who works there was amazing. I couldn't have been happier with my experience.
