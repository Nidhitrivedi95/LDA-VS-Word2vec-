uOJ87zqbU1MtShCSHDkiyw Management has changed and it shows and not in a good way.  We were there for 4 hours and should have been out in 2.5.  The service is horrendous - aside from being slow, they are not the friendliest folks in the world.  Instead of having 2-3 hostesses sitting at the front desk twiddling their thumbs, put them to work and have them refill waters and clear tables because the wait staff and bus boys can't maintain the level of service there once was.  The food is sub-par - I had to return the Carpaccio because it was truly disgusting.  We had 6 people in our group and there were 3-4 separate checks for the group.  Why are they adding 20% gratuity on each of the checks for a party of 6.  Unreal and uncalled for.  The ceiling needs work - there are huge open vents with freezing cold air blowing through them.  Hope they can get their act together, or they will lose their client base.
