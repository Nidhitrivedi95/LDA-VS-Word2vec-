dSnQTUJC0tCHadU1AGzvrw Been here a couple of times. Good place to grab a drink and enjoy the view however, food is average at best. Had their appetizers and pizza previously and they are certainly nothing special.  Don't get the beer in mason jars but whatever. Will still patronize for a drink but avoid the food unless really famished.
