As the pizza cooked, we sampled beer at the bar. The pizza was amazing! We ate the Noda special. The toppings weren't my usual selection, but the combination was AMAZING! Pulled pork, sweet peppers, carmelized onions with a balsamic drizzle - all the components of good barbeque, but on a pizza. If I lived in Charlotte, I would order this pizza every week. I definitely recommend you try Revolution Ale House & their Noda special. Better yet, take a Feast Food tour and sample from different Noda restaurants. It's worth the money.
