g9iIBuh-g4ld3w3kUWLMqw Highly NOT Recommended! Service is horrible and the pizza is not worth the wait. My husband wanted to try it, because he really likes pizza and it was a new spot to try. We did get seated right away and the busser brought water out right after we sat, but then thats all we did for almost 20 mins before our waiter showed up to take our drink order. At that point water was just fine, because who knew how long it would take for him to come back and take our food order. We asked about the special on the board, he recommended it and said it was good. He did inform us it would take 20 mins for the pizza, we said that was fine. A runner brought our pizza and then our busser brought our plates out after and he also placed a slice in each plate for us. There on out we had to ask our busser for things, because we never saw our waiter after the order was taken. To top it off the seating area is horrible, way too close together, i lost count on how many butts passed my face while eating with people going in and out the area. Overall I would not recommend this place nor ever go back myself, service is horrible and pizza was way too salty. My huband said he'd rather had gone to little ceasars for $5 pizza instead and he doesnt even care for that pizza...but i do agree with him!
