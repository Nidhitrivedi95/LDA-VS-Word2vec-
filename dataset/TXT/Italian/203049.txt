q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Our first time here, without a reservation, but ok, anyways, here's the scoop. The food here is dynamite! The service is top notch and the atmosphere is well, mafia. It's nice in a you're a part of the family kinda way. No problem. We sat at the bar, because, no reservation. Next time, we're going to bring friends. This is going to be our Italian place from now on. It's that good.
