I ordered the chicken sandwich (I know it's a veal place but I can't get myself to stop imaging cute little baby calves and feel guilty) Nevertheless, it's one of the best chicken sandwiches I've had! The hot peppers are a MUST! I love spicy food and their peppers actually give quite the kick.

I paid around ten bucks for the sandwich with extra toppings plus a drink, which is truly a steal for food this delicious. 

The seating is a row of small tables outside, which on a fair weather day is actually a joy!

They take cash only and are very limited on parking.
