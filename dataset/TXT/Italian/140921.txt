JlQsOCa-UPw_Gu1MG7jmig This place is a rip off the pizza looked burnt and I paid $25 for 2 tiny pizzas I called thinking it was going to be what the price said it was online and when my brother went to pick it up it was ALOT MORE it doesn't mention anything about a coupon online or to mention anything at check out so they can apply it its just a deal but no coupon codes . Weird I've order once before at the the location in Phoenix and they've applied the deal without even asking.
