lR4ybrBnCkWI-BMeDrJwFQ My girlfriend really loves this place....I mean really loves this place. It's a great little Italian restaurant that serves up large portions for a great price.

The lunch crowd is usually hopping here so try to get here early or late during  the lunch hours. It has a good amount of seating though, so the line will move pretty quickly. They have your regular Italian food, so expect all of your favorites here. But the serving sizes here are pretty large & will fill even the hungriest stomach in the room. I'm a big fan of the meat ravioli, along with the lasagna. You really can't go wrong here with any dish as it's all pretty good.

The prices here are great, with nothing too expensive to where lunch hurts your wallet. It's a great place to grab a great Italian lunch, because who doesn't like Italian. Walking in, you'll think the place may be too nice for lunch, but the decor really doesn't match up too well with the place. Maybe for dinner, the decor fits well, but for lunch it's really just too much.
But I like Milano's for lunch, especially when I'm in the mood for great Italian.
