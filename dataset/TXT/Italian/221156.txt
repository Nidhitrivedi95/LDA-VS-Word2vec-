SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg I feel so torn about this place. First the good:
-minimal and geometric decor. Very spacey/jetsons meets Vegas dining. Hostesses have a space dress and you half expect a hostess with green skin or a third boob to come flying out of the kitchen doors
-love that you don't feel like you are next to the casino and the large windows to see the bellagio fountains
- great menu variety and reasonable price points
- my favorite dishes: (1) octopus with squid ink cous cous. It will dye your mouth but the best octopus I've ever had. Had a lobster claw consistency (2) gnocchi in lobster sauce. Very light and flavorful (3) panna cotta. Just really light and refreshing (4) salumi platter.

The bad:
- the scallop crudo dish. This thing STUNK. And yes the flavor was not as fishy but the smell itself was so offensive that I could not forget about it the entire night
-steak. It was not my choice to order it. This was not a restaurant that had great land options. This was over cooked and had a strong char taste. 

All in all, I feel like the good was really good but it was just too hit or miss and inconsistent to give it more stars. I'll try again and choose dishes that I want next time.
