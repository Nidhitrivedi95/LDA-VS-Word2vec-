0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw I've been twice now and enjoyed it both times.  The flies were a little out of control last time, but I don't think this is always the case.  

I LOVED my fontina burger and the sweet potato fries (and pineapple dipping sauce) are divine! I've also tried the Bleu Cheese Burger and it was REALLY good.  I'd order them both again.  I don't think there is anything on the menu that I wouldn't try. 

We waited in line once for about 5 minutes (the line moved fast) and the next time there was no line at all.  Luckily when there is a line they have menus for you to look through so you are completely prepared when you get to the window.
