Thank you Marco for a great first experience at OTS. 
We dined at OTS after a 2 day convention while in Vegas, and were starving, but of course on a business budget. I found a few things on the menu, but the meatball sliders really stuck out to me. I'm a total baby when it comes to anything spicy, and always ask before I order to prevent having to send anything back.  Marco advised me (when no one else would have) that the sauce COULD be considered spicy, and insisted on bringing me a small sample. As someone who used to be in the restaurant industry, I would have done the exact same thing, and I really appreciated that. 
When I told him it was "doable" (and delicious!!!) he advised to order the sauce on the side, so I could control the bit of spice it had. We also ordered the upgraded truffle fries. 
The food arrived in a timely manner, just in time for drink refills, and everything was delicious. I mentioned that the truffle fries were really tasty, but very mild and he had the manager discount the extra charges (just added to his tip). Then the manager came over to apologize, and chit-chatted with us for a few minutes.
I already told my boyfriend next time we go in town for leisure, we'll be visiting OTS at The Linq Hotel.
Thanks again Marco for your great service. If you plan to visit, be sure to ask for him if you want A+ service:)
