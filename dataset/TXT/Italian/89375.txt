Each time I visit Wynn Encore, Sinatra is a must. Whether it is with locals for a drink or a full blown dinner or friends, family or business visiting from out of town, I always point us towards Sinatra. The bar is a memorable event with great drinks and ambiance unless they have some lame college sporting event on the tv that plays no relevance in the sporting world... go back to old Sinatra flicks. The design of the bar from floor to ceiling is interesting and great talking points. The colors and fabrics are all cool! Then there is dinner... that hits it out of the park. It may not be traditional Italian fare, but I love it all the same. The flavors are "close your month and see it" good. Can't wait to go back next week. It never gets old.
