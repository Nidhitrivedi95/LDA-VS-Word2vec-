oRRU93M-gYqcnes16GuZTw This is not the Nick's Diner Two, on Waddell. While the menu is almost identical and the portions are generous, the service left a lot to be desired.  My buddies and I tried all the Nick's breakfast specials, the omelette, the scramble, the chicken fried steak and while portions were large, flavor was not.  I chose the scramble with gyro meat and found very little meat or taste.  Service was prompt but our server was a bit "uninformed".  A decent breakfast, but not necessarily a place that I would go back too.
