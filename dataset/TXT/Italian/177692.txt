NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA Visited on a Friday night around 6:00.  There was a 45 minute wait for a table at the bar but luckily there was bar seating to have a drink while we waited.  No reservations for parties less than 6 either.  

Overall, the place is pricey for both the food and drinks that they serve.

The pizza's are 10" and cost about $17.  The size is barely enough for two so you do have to order something else unless you are not that hungry.

As for the taste, the pizza is supposed to be brick oven what was way too soggy for the brick oven pizza I'm used to.  The topping and combinations were just okay.

I would not return here.  There are plenty of other pizza places in this city:
