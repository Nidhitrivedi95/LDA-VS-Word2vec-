TVKenh65WwJX3zEr36zKCA The Oyster Bar, located inside Sunset Station, is a fantastic spot for fresh seafood dishes of various kinds!  Having been visiting this spot for 10+ years I can attest to a cool homey vibe in a quaint setting.  Most people would figure anything inside of a casino wouldn't have a homey vibe, nor a quaint feel.  Oyster Bar has both with a cool facade, small interior, and located inside my favorite local casino!

The one "must have" here in my opinion is the NE Clam Chowder!  A bowl will run you $8 and when it's delivered to your table you'll think it's a bit overpriced.  It's deeper than you think, really thick and rich in flavor, and extremely filling!  The side Caesar salad is really large and the equivalent of a regular salad!  The two together is a full meal for a large eater!

Oyster Bar does it well, and they certainly feel like a small local hangout....inside a casino!
