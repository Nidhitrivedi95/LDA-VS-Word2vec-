Q1L_Nb1QsD0S9pbng5-kMQ I am so glad we have better Portofino's in Greenville. We were hoping for the same dining experience considering it is located in Charlotte. The service was good but the food was not as good as the one we get in Greenville. The dinner rolls was just bread sliced with butter for us to smear instead of the mouth watering dinner rolls dipped in garlic and olive oil. I ordered for Shrimp Fradiavolo and hubby went for Chicken Marsala. My entree was good but Chicken marsala was just bland. Next time we are Charlotte we are going to try other Italian places for sure.
