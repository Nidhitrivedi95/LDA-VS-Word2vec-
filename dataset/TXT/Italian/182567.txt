oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw Came here for dinner after the 2014 Licensing Expo. It was recommended by a friend of ours. Overall I'm not too impressed by any restaurants offered in Vegas so far as most of them are overpriced with sub-par tasting food. Lupo is not as bad as most of them considering their price range, decor, location and service. All above average. But most of the dishes we had that night were certainly lacking in flavor and overly salty except for the veal meatball. It's a hit or miss.
