dNHDXn2ot4mFc2YfIFBNhQ My husband and I decided to give them another try last Sunday.  I wish we didn't.  My husband found a hair in his salad, when he told the server she continue to say she couldn't understand how it got there.  Well I can tell you it wasn't ours and it already made me sick.  I did attempt to eat my Fettuccine  Weesie $15.90 but couldn't finish and asked to have it boxed. It was good but could used more sauce  The server decided to stop at another table with dish in her hand and have a full conversation.  Well the end product was my pasta was put in the garbage.  My husband had the Lasagne $14.50 was good but could have used a lot more sauce.  The servings were very small for the price.  Unfortunately, our selections in Surprise are not many.
