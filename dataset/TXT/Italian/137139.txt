j1xqz2w3wjVpvxYJi3t5IQ Ciros is a good family Italian restaurant.   They have many good dishes from the basic pastas to the more inventive dishes.  

I usually get the Chicken Parm which is always good.  The sauce is a little sweet and is great.  Pasta ala Vodka, Lasagna and The Seafood Pasta is great.  

The eggplant appetizer is very good and the cannolis are not to be missed.
