BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I wanted to try something new so I went on local dines and found a deal for Local Bistro. The good news is that I would have been happy here even without the deal but it is always nice to have one to try a new place! Amazing selection of wines. The drunken bread was my favorite part. It was very tasty and I will go back just to have it again! The pizza was good, a little on the salty side for my taste but decent. The manhattan clam chowda was really good as well. I really liked the environment and the patio looked really nice for this fall. Great service as well.
