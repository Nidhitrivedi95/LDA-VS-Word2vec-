rziLQ_IrRbZMPb3QxCIWUA Sometimes has decent food but most of the time things are messed up. Ordered the chicken taco pizza, pepperoni and mushroom stuffed crust, and cheesy bread. Cheesy bread was awesome as usual but they only give u enough sauce for two pieces. But they give you 5 sour creams and 5 salsas for a chicken taco pizza that's gross. Pepperoni mushroom was ok but crust was soggy. Pretty disappointed. If we do order from them again since there is no dominos we will only get the cheesy bread. Oh and not to mention the last time we ordered from them my husband got sick off their pizza. I guess that's our fault for thinking we could give them a second chance though.
