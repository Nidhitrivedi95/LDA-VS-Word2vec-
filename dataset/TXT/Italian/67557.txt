BQqwIYQuo2W94smjrBjy5g Who would have thought that the best Italian food in Vegas/Henderson was right down the road from me. Why it took me so long to get in here I do not know, all I know is I've been missing out on incredible food, perfect ambience, and the most friendliest Chef (Chef Rudy). We 1st had some very good bread that we nearly filled up on because it was that good. I was served the best Chicken Piccata I've ever had in my life. My daughter is a tiny little thing that never finishes anything, let's just say she didn't need a to go box for her Chicken Parm dish. My pasta finished off in a cheese wheel (that was so yummy). The Tiramisu was on point and they had Spumoni ice cream that my daughter loves. Overall we had great food, great service, and a fabulous Chef.
