Why 3 stars?

Well one thing really bothered me about this place. I came here with a rather large group (I think there was about 11 of us). I completely understand having to split us into different tables, but why charge us for the gratuity of a large party? 

It wasn't as if we were split to two different tables, we were scattered through four different tables. Considering this, and the fact that there was a bill to every table, I felt that we should have been treated as four different smaller parties.
