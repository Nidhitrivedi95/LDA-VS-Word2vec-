C2HKdN-Ft1JJY2xDj-3gxw I've only tried the bakery here. Came in quite late in the evening at around 8pm or so and still found that the pastries were quite fresh. It was still soft, although I was hoping for more varieties. Taste wise, it was decent, nothing too overwhelming or sweet. The restaurant itself seemed a little empty during the time while there wasn't much flavors in the gelato counter but I'm assuming that's because it's winter and really cold out. I feel like the pastries look visually more appealing than it actually tastes.
