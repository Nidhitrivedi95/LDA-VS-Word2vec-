As a die hard, Mellow Mushroom fan, I knew I had to lower my expectations for Revolution.  I did not realize they would need to be THAT low.  Revolution kept the full bar and the outdoor seating, which would be the only reason to come here.  No upside down furniture from the ceiling, was rather disappointing.

I ordered an Italian sandwich, which was revolting.  Literally, regurgitated it into my napkin.  OK, my first selection wasn't great.  Our waiter was friendly and brought me a slice of plain cheese pizza to hold me over.  This should be good, they are after all, known for their pizza.  Pizza was luke warm, and tasted like something that I could have just heated up out of the frozen pizza isle.

Go to Revolution for BEER ONLY.  I repeat, BEER ONLY.  They have a wonderful beer selection, and they are good about letting you try samples if you are overwhelmed by their inventory.  If you are hungry, don't waste your money on Revolution.  Grab a pint and walk over to Cabo Fish Taco instead.
