fWhs5KYwHcRFKmJ5siNNdA Absolutely great food. The starter, insalata caprino, was a wonderful combination of subtle salt and sweet (greens, goat cheese, dried fruit, delicious balsamic vinaigrette). The salmon with tapenade and tomatoes ditto, with a generous assortment of vegetables - including summer squash, rapini, briccoli, green beans -- beautifully prepared. The grilled tiger shrimp ordered by my dinner companion were enormous, and the restaurant happily substituted a generous dollop of spaghettini with a very nice tomato sauce for the greens that ordinarily come with the dish (as we'd had the salad starter). No room for dessert, sadly; but superb Italian coffee. (Also, good selection of wine by the glass.) Far superior to the comparable places in the neighbourhood, blissfully quiet and pleasant place to sit, excellent obliging service. It is our new go-to place for an indulgent dinner where one can converse.
