Pp93J9-VPxgEyMBB-NhUog Amazing pizza and an amazing Bufala "salad" (really it's just cheese and tomato, let's be real, but that's heaven). We arrived late and were seated quickly, service was quick, and price was reasonable.

It's a little loud, and I don't love the TV screens in the restaurant, really distracting - but I think that's the vibe they're going for. There were birthday parties, drunk teenagers, couples, an old man alone reading...it's a good people watching spot. And the decor is cheesy and great.
