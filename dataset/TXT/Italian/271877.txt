xsFeeqZS6PoVvwseEefzEw Hmmmm, interesting. Such a wide variety of reviews here on Yelp! Honestly, I hadn't looked at the reviews for a while when we finally decided to try out this place. I had been avoiding it, mainly b/c seeing $15 for entrees then $8 for sides was nothing that I wanted jump into right away. 

Regardless, on our way to Actors Theater we figured that we'd do a nice dinner. 

If you're looking for the standard run-of-the-mill class fare, stay away. In fact you're better off going to pizza hut across the street. If you want to push the edge of your comfort zone, you've found the right spot. 

Case in point, I went with the evening's special, which was not pasta, but rather long green beans doing their best impression of pasta - creative? Risky? Wacky? Yes, yes, yes! Delicious- absolutely. Especially the prosciutto based sauce.  The wife had the Orrechiette con salsiccia - very flavorful and fun. (in fact, picking at it this am it was even tastier). 

I also recommend the plate of fresh vegetables for an app. It seems to rotate, but last night's was solid - kale, butternut squash and fingerling potatoes all rocked. 

The downside was my meal was a little saltier than I'd prefer and the red sauce for the side of meatballs was a tinge "bar-b-que"-esque. Not bad, just not expected. The meatballs themselves were solid. 

Yes, the wine list is Italian focused, so buck up and take a risk away from your suburban merlot (see Paul giammatti in sideways in fact) and live a little! In fact, I see similarities with the list from Cibo and no one is complaining about their's. 

Go, have fun, take a risk!
