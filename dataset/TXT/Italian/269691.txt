xJKVVTSIAwmSiY3cGJYwfg Meh. Overpriced restaurant that was both hit and miss. For apps we had the polenta (good for polenta, decent otherwise), diver scallops (I've had better and it's hard to mess up naturally sweet scallops at a half decent restaurant), and a pile of over fried tower of seafood and various veg (awful. Bland. The shrimp and calamari were sad little lumps and shreds. Can't believe the waitress recommended it). My main of duck & fois gras saved this from being a two star review as the dish was truly unique, rich and tasty.

While the atmosphere is classy, the ambient noise and the acoustics from the high ceilings make it difficult to have a conversation.
