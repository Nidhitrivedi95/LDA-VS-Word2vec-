L8W83-wPFLMs457cAu60Eg Ate there Saturday night - 8:30pm reservation - ate at the bar. Very friendly staff - busy vibe - small restaurant. Bright fun atmosphere. 

Food - ordered the orecchiette - with shrimp and chorizo. You'd expect that the pasta might have some shrimp and chorizo in it? This restaurant should be embarrassed by what they served - deeply embarrassed. It was as if they took 1 small shrimp and 1 slice of chorizo - and then diced them up into tiny little pieces. It was barely noticeable. Never have I ordered a shrimp and chorizo pasta with such a skimpy cheap portion of ingredients! Bland - boring - bad.

My friend ordered the salmon. It was overdone. Over cooked. 

The place gets good reviews and maybe it was an off night. But it was a disappointment.
