E9b73ETPw0VYUJ2_YSJJdQ YUM!  My favorite meal that we had in Toronto.  

Things are definitely cozy in here during the peak dinner hour--lots of people at lots of tiny tables--but the lively, warm atmosphere was just right on a chilly, dark night.  

The pizza was fantastic--I went with the house special, the Pizza Rustica.  The crispy thin crust, fresh ingredients, and general non-greasiness reminded me of pizzas I ate in Rome.  Since we had a huge calamari appetizer (it was pretty good; not the best I've ever had) and each ordered our own pizza, SK and I thought we'd be carrying out some leftovers.  ....oops.  Didn't happen. 

This place hits a nice balance of being both trendyish--crowded, lively, lots of young, sophisticated urbanites out mingling--and warm, comfortable, and pretty reasonably priced.  Would definitely go back, but....to have the same thing, or try something new?  

Hm--guess I'll have to come back at least twice.
