gZYt10Kn-eHpo3n4lx3iBg We come here often.  The place is sporatically busy then not.  I don't get it as the food is super.  The home made fettucini is wow, as it the Bolognese sauce.  Garlic shrimp over pasta, yum.  Chicken dishes are good as well.  I have sampled most of them and the chicken is moist and well prepared.  My cousin had a veal dish last night and loved it as well (veal parm).  This place needs more customers!  Try it!
