MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg I have been a few times now and I will say the food has always been very good. This visit however they were out of my first two options, the chicken salad and tuna salad. This is not the end of the world but for some reason it drives me crazy when restaurants are out of one item, much less two. Then when we finally got it they served it to us in to go bags when we were dining in. Again, food has always been very good but this last visit had a couple annoying  instances that ruffled my feathers.
