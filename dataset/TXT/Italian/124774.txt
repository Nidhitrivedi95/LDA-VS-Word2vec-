Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ My daughter just moved to Vegas and so we wanted to try some places close to her and we are so lucky to have found this gem! This is by far the best pizza I have had. Everything is made fresh there in this family owned pizzeria and everyone was super friendly. The place is small but can get take out if needed. Will definitely be back when we come back to visit our daughter!
