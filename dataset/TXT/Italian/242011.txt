uLdJrH2rJwULKLopi0XH4Q Ate here last night for the first time and it definitely won't be our last. This is an amazingly friendly family run restaurant.  Our server Crystal welcomed us and asked where we would like to sit, which with our very active 2 year old a table works better than a booth for us.  

I felt like we were visiting my adopted Italian grandparents house with a few distant cousins who had stopped by too. Eating out with a 2 year old is always a roll of the dice...perfect little guy or.....well....we have all seen that kid that you feel bad for the parents or yourself for having to eat near him. 

Anyway, the food was lovely.  The pasta was cooked perfectly.  They made a "side" of whatever pasta I wanted for the little guy with whatever sauce I wanted--not on the menu--but they were happy to do it.  Everything was delicious. Hubby & I both had carbonara....yum!
