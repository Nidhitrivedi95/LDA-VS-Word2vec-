Everything I've tried at this restaurant has been outstanding. My husband and I went here for our anniversary and have been there many other times before. We had the Sarpa salad and arugula and warm mushroom salad with buffala ricotta and both were delicious. Veal Marsala and veal saltinboca were both melt in your mouth. I would highly recommend.
