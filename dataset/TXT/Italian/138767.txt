jcasci3gjbsSuTEVzvDQKg Mama's is solid Italian food.  Great wine selections by the glass & bottle. 

I love their Tuscan Salad & add shrimp.  The small is plenty for a meal.

They have a great patio with a fireplace table that is cozy.  The patio can be enclosed & heated so they use it all year round.

The servers are always friendly and helpful as are the staff at the host station and mgmt.
