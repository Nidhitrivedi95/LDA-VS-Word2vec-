tYbK94fl50os3h_RjpY4gw We tried this restaurant one night and went back again a week later.  Definitely some of the friendliest staff we have had service from and we got out to eat frequently.  When you are paying, you can try samples of desserts!  The first night we got garlic knot sliders and stromboli and maybe something else and the next time we got stromboli, garlic knot sliders and a couple other things.  So far we have not tried the pizza, but give us time.  Everything was exclellent and both times we got garlic knots while we were waiting for the food.  Portions are large and all was very tasty - love the garlic knot sliders!!  They have a lot of specials and prices are very reasonable.  We found out they deliver to our area, too - bonus!!  and let me just mention again, excellent customer service!!
