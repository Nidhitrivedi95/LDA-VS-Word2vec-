MJHSWSh9Ixusz8t_VdL3qA This place is so good, I am craving it  just writing about it.It has been here a long time, although this is my first time here. I came with my friend Sherry, who had her rehearsal dinner here 24 years ago. So it has been here awhile.
It is Family owned and that must be why it is so good. They care about what they serve and how they serve it!
We came here on a week night. We were greeted by the owner when we came in and were seated right away in the dining room. 
Service was very good even though they got quite busy.
Dinner was magnificent! I got the FantaSea. I loved it!! The portion was huge it is Seafood and in a White sauce.  My friend Sherry got the Eggplant Parm, it too was fantastic!

We had an appetizer of Calamari. Of course with all this food we took a lot to go. We were far too full to have dessert. Will have to try it another day.
Ladies room was clean and lots of parking in the huge parking lot they share in the strip mall. This place is well worth a try.
