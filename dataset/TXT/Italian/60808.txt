AWJhMTYsIYzCIYAIUA-waA I arrived here at 11:55 and asked the hostess if I could sit at the booths by the bar. She said yes and assured me that someone would wait on me shortly. It us now 1:15. Not so much as a glass of water. No service of any kind. 

California Pizza Kitchen is right around the corner. Guess where I'll be going?
