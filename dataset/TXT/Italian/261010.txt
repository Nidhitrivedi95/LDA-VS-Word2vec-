WPV0ucYjnb2HOrNxSopv6A I live down the street and visit this location often for takeout and sometimes to eat in.  Great patio and bar area.  The pizza is always solid.  I normally order the Elizabeth Special pizza.  For salads the chopped is great if you like green olives.  I prefer the Hawthorne salad with those awesome and sweet pecans.  A great pizza join that I am happy to have in my neighborhood.
