UUlp5Pkpq7w5pOiX6esJ9Q Their pizza tastes pretty good. However, I'm going to give them 3 stars because they are way too stingy on their toppings. When you order a large "Create Your Own" pizza and choose various toppings including chicken and bacon, you will literally get like 3 to 4 pieces of the meats. Seriously, 3~4 pieces of meat chunks on a large pizza?!
