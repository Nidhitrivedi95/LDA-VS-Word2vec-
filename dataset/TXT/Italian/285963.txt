ZfPcpbZssIMrYBSg9jXNdw I am basing this review on one trip for dinner, and on two pizzas, so I could be missing a lot.  That said, Vito's was simply not fun, nor was the food scrumptious, so why would I go back?  I can think of two better pizza places within 5 minutes of this location.  

There is a dining area, which is dark and uninspiring, although clean and in good repair.  There is a large bar area which is noisy, even on on off day, and the noise cascades through the dining room.  No problems with the service, but the pizzas, which most reviews seem to say is their best point, were just okay.  Typical thin crust, unremarkable cheese, and average toppings.  I ate it, I enjoyed it, but the next day I can't remember it.  

Maybe I'm just too old for Vito's.
