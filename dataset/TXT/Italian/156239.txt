L6ZPG8lO1tMGmHimSjuEMg Was recommended to check this place out by my bartender at Tranquillo bar at The Clarendon Hotel, and I'm glad I did. Went on a Saturday evening and it was not crowded at all. Food was delicious. Beer on tap was great.  Service was speedy and friendly. 

As an avid ramen lover from NYC with some of THE best ramen spots, I was pleasantly surprised and would recommend this place!!
