Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA I can't tell if it was high expectations from all the hype that caused my disappointment or the food in general. 

After hear a lot about how good this place was I decided it would make a good spot for date night. Came in at 6 on a Sunday and were sat immediately. 

Having previously stalked the menu I asked about the Mister Mister appetizer. Was given a vague description describing it basically as a veggie plate with some dipping sauce. What came was actually pretty good but it was cheese sprinkled crispy veggies (I think lightly fried) with 2 dipping sauces it was pretty good.

As for the pizza we got the Casanova and Manifesto. The casanova was fine but I felt like the dates had over powered the prosciutto (which seemed to be lacking some flavor) and the combo wasn't anything special as I feel like every place has a bruschetta just like this. The manifesto was also okay but I felt like the sausage was very bland and plain and the goat cheese didn't mesh well with the other flavors. The mushrooms were the star of that pizza by far.

On both pizza's i felt like the crust was good but soggy in center. I think overall it was somewhere between thing crust and regular which is a no mans land for pizza crusts. The flavor was good but not amazing.

Dessert may have been the most disappointing thing. We got the Lil' tripple which if you have ever had jello chocolate pudding with an oreo and some cool whip you have already experiences. I was expecting some more unique flavor from this but really oreo pudding snack packs have the same taste.

Maybe my expectations were too high for this place but I walked away feeling like for the money there are other places I would rather go and it isn't even in the league with Bianco. For me it also isn't somewhere I would being making the trip to go to again except for maybe a happy hour if other people where there. There is nothing wrong with the pizza but I think the place is overhyped.
