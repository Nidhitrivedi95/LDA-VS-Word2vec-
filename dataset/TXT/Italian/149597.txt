KkgnBZj3jRVjCY2H49JRaw I came in to Angelinas Pizza for a 14" pepperoni to go. What better way to end a week than a bit of your favorite pizza and a beer at the very nearby Putters.

I was psyched when I saw Angelinas open up here. There used to be a couple others in the area that are either a new place or simply gone. This has been some of my favorite pizza for many uears now. The crust is thin and and chewy just the way I like it. The sauce has good flavor but is not as spicy as some sauce I've had. There is an average amount of pepperoni (I wish there was more). The cheese is super gooey. And the pizza as a whole is never overly greasy. I love it.

My visit to this addition of the Angelinas family was a good one. A 14" pie for less than $10 and I got two meals out of it. Service was fast and friendly and the pizza was 100% correct. And it took exactly the same time to make my pizza as it did for me to enjoy a pint while waiting.
