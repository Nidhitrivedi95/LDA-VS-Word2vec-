eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA i went here will not go back. went with a party of 12. really lousy servixe i ordered veal parmesan it was greasy taisted bad was really a thin slice and the sause taisted canned. we also order seafood fettuccine and it taisted good but  uhhhh where was the seafood? also when i asked the waitress why she kept walking away and not take my order. she said because she didnt like me. Id like to add to this review i received a call from the manager it was sort of strange and hanging said he would call back but never did. I pray i never have to spend good money at this place again. Portions were just cheap.
