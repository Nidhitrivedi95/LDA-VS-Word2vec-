9xdVIIzHp12Zrox5aFaaHA I was here for an early Saturday dinner, and found it really enjoyable. 

The pizza's flavour was excellent, although the combination of super thin base and lots of toppings left the center part pretty soft and wet - not something I would have an issue with, but I know it's a deal-breaker for some people. I got lavender creme brulee for dessert (I was torn between that and an orange and chocolate tart, the server recommended the creme brulee), and it was good. The lavender came across stronger in the smell then in the taste, but the custard was excellent. The sugar on top was a tiny bit burned in places, but it's almost impossible to find a creme brulee where that's not the case, so I can't fault them too much.

All in all, a good meal with fast and friendly service. I'd definitely recommend it to friends.
