g9iIBuh-g4ld3w3kUWLMqw This is our second visit to this place. Unfortunately the service was so bad, it forced me to create this account and allow people to know how bad it was. The waitress acted high and inattentive to anything going on around us or her, completely oblivious. Food is good but waiting 30 minutes after getting our drinks with only five total tables full to get our order taken.
