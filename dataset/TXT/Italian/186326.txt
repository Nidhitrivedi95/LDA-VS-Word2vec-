OpNrObgtHgYijZYOU0yF-Q In town for a night, walked by cute, eclectic 50s diner look - but then what Italian food?! Fresh ingredients in salads, tasty marinara sauce, crispy calamari, giant meatball! Should have asked for dressing on the side of my blackened chicken pasta salad - kind of drowning the lettuce. But all ingredients were fresh and yummy. Hard not to fill up on home-made focaccia. Polite and knowledgeable wait staff, cute inviting atmosphere. So far, it's one of the best parts of Pittsburgh!
