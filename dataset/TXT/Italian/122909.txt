HhPVzZYQI-akaXRK_A4dKQ I hadn't been to Del's before their TV makeover, but was eager to try it after seeing their "transformation" on Restaurant Impossible.  I'm not overly critical of most places I go, but to be succinct, I was not impressed and won't be going back.  The decor was the restaurant's strongest aspect.  However, the waitress seemed to have an attitude from the start.  Later, I had to ask her to refresh my water, the only thing I was drinking.  It wasn't a bustling night and I've had better service at Denny's on a midnight shift. 

The house salad I had before the meal was forgettable- seemingly a bagged salad a few days old (brown on the iceberg lettuce), with long, awkward carrot sticks and hard-to-fork, chopped red onions, alongside a plastic cup of runny bleu cheese probably squeezed from a Ken's Steakhouse packet.  For dinner, I had the stuffed braciole topped with red sauce and pine nuts.  The beef was dry, the stuffing bland, the pine nuts lacked a crisp crunch, and the red sauce was mediocre.  My friend had the fettuccine alfredo.  Her family owns a restaurant, just like Del's-- family-owned, and while she said she liked her dish enough, she added that the white sauce tasted like it was from a can.  For the quality of dishes we had, $16 and $12 respectively, it  was overpriced, as well as the $3 house salad.  Because of this, we didn't even bother with experimenting with dessert.  

What's more telling about the restaurant, was that when we walked in around 9PM on a Saturday (03/31/12), it was moderately busy.  Yet, by time we left, around 10, (mostly because we had to wait for the check), the place was almost completely empty, bar and all.  I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend.  Tessaro's (also on Liberty Ave.) or Kaleidoscope Cafe (43rd St. in Lawrenceville) are much better options.
