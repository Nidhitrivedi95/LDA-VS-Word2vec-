dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw We waited 30 minutes to even order drinks, waiter was nice but not attentive at all. It wasn't busy in the restaurant so there's no reason to have bad service. 
Food portions were very small, over priced and misleading. Party of 13, and only 2 were happy with entrees. We were not ONCE checked on or made sure we were taken care of. Honestly not impressed at all. If I'm spending that kind of money,  I expect good service AT LEAST. I won't be back and would not recommend. Ever!
