The service was impeccable, the live music was perfect to listen to while still maintaining a calm ambiance, and the food was delicious. All for a great price! After my meal the owner even came and greeted me since it was my first time, made sure everything was up to standard, and gave me a 15% off coupon for my next visit! I had high expectations and all were exceeded. Definitely try this place out!
