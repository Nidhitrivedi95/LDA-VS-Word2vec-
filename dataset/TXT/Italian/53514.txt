a4MVM9E9022sYFrrYWy9DQ Went back for pasta. 

My DC ordered off menu and asked for a cabonara-- not a problem. And it was delicious.

I ordered the spaghetti with cherry tomatoes, sausage, rapini, and spicy tomato sauce.

Hugely generous portions, great service this time, not busy on a week night, and each dish was ~13$. Outstanding!
