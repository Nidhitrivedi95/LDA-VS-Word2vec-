FfF8XGFf8_BSlWSjIgqeQg Very very average. 

Not worth the price $20/dish. 

We got the mozzarella ball appetizer and the mozarella was small and very hard - did not live up to the hype. 

I got the vegetarian pasta and it was again, mediocre. 

If the menu items were less than $10 then this would probably be a 4 star but for the price, it's definitely not worth it. 

You're probably off at Canyon Creek or even Moxies in the area.
