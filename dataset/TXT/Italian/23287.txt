3QS2Wgedv3jjKC5vJXJTcA My partner and I stumbled upon Osteria while hunting for dinner one Saturday evening.  We didn't realize that this petite diner is also run by ... surprise, Terroni!

The prices are steeper than its sister locations and I felt out of place; the clientel here reek of money and it shows.  Boccaccini, artichokes and minestrone were all fantastic.  I'd like to give Osteria 5 stars, but the two of us left a bit inebriated from half a litre of red wine and my memory was a bit fuzzy ...

Definitely a good secret to be kept for the die-hard foodies.  Just wish I could afford to come more often!
