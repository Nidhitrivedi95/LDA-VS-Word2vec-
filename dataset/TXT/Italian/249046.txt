VgfqjXetLMxn5X5_uomBkg Just drove by, saw the sign and decided to stop. Had out of country friends and we are out of state as well. 
Excellent service, great food, and very reasonable prices. Plus, the owner Michael Zistatsis came by and talked about the great state of Arizona, the wonderful things to see and do, and offered advice and help & directions. All of us were very surprised and pleased with the food and the experience. Highly recommend a visit.
