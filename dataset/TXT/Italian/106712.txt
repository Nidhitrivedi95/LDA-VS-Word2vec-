fuBpjG-lsD94_BdpjHxbuQ 4-4.5*  Definitely a pleasant surprise, better than I anticipated!

I was looking for an Italian restaurant that served pizza, wasn't $$$ with snooty 'tude to boot, had great reviews, and I stumbled upon Lo Zingaro.  And I'm soo glad that I decided on this restaurant...even though there aren't a heck of a lot of reviews.

Atmosphere and décor was modern, intimate, and quiet for a Saturday night on Queen West.  Restaurant has a dozen or so tables + bar, but only a handful were occupied.  So not sure why this place was quieter than I expected, but it worked out. :)

Menu is a do-able size, consisting of Antipasto (Apps), Pastas, & Pizzas.  I ordered Insalata Caprese ($14), and 2 pizzas, Pecorella ($18), the classic, Margherita ($13), & Tiramisu ($8) for dessert.  I also ordered a Negroni which was more a martini than a sweeter cocktail.  No biggie, I drank it anyway!

The Caprese was saltier in some spots than others, but was beautifully presented and fresh tasting!  Loved the buffalo moz.  And although the Pecorella sounds and is fancier, I like the more simpler Margherita better.  Pizzas are a fair portion and I was only able to eat only half, above my app.  Crust was thin and it was not overdone or soggy (esp. towards the middle) at all like other places!

Staff were chill and seemed genuinely happy to work there.  All of the staff checked in throughout various stages of our meal.  Loved the non-pretentiousness of the entire place.

The food was great, but the service was even better!
