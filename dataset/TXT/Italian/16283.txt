They started us off with garlic bread with a side of marinara and a side of chopped tomatoes with basil. IT WAS SO GOOD! Then, I ordered the ravioli with caprese sauce. The food was so fresh and delicious. The portions were crazy huge- my plate could have fed 3 people. I ate lunch at noon and six and a half hours later, I am still full (even though I had skipped breakfast).

I wish I had a place like this in Dallas!
