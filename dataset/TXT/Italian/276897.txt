yGd87bkFijZ6YHrHtW5maA Get delivery here a few times out of the month when I'm too lazy to make food at home. I use the Eat24 app to order from them and haven't really had problems except for the first time. (they just forgot forks and spoons, not a big deal)
Their delivery is pretty speedy and usually arrives close to or before the time they say they will. The food is pretty decent but I'm kinda annoyed by their idea of "spicy" for their curry. I always ask for a 5 and it always tastes like a 3, maybe this place just doesn't do super spicy curry. Other than that, the wontons, eggdrop soup, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli are all good.
My favorite thing is the Thai tea though, I always get it in my order and you can order it without ice too.
