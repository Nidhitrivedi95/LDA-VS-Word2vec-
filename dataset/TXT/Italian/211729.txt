r03BNov4Uyul5bJzlgWdJQ We went there thinking it was very good based on the Yelp reviews.  The feel of the restaurant is almost a fast food/take-out delivery ambiance with a sit down area. It's nicely decorated with very friendly staff.  The arugula salad was yummy as were the pizzas, however the crust wasn't the thin crust we were hoping for (kinda bland too).  We were talked into getting the fresh spaghetti but it was VERY al dente.  Very undercooked.
