07HZ70wpawSANXKK4CkqpQ Bella Vita is the restaurant located in Presidio Residents Club in Estrella Mountain Ranch.  While the menu is small, the food is consistently tasty.  They offer food such as pizzas, paninis, salads, cheese plates, bruschetta, etc.  I find the service to be good and the staff is very friendly.  Even when I have dined in on busy evenings I have never waited long for my meals.  I recommend trying the Build you own Bruschetta board which allows you to choose 3 out of 5 flavor options.  My favorites are as follows:
Brie, apple, andfig
Cucumber, feta, and balsamic reduction
Apple, mascarpone, honey, and almond
