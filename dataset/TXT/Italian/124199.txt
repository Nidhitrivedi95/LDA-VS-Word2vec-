HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ #277. Topped our last night in Vegas with a fancy dinner. If you're not going to a buffet, you gotta make it worthwhile with something classy. We sat next to the window and the view was amazing. If only the food were up to par.

First off, if you're a vegetarian, be aware that there is nothing kosher for main courses. We perused the menu the night before, so we knew about this before our reservation. We decided to order a bunch of appetizers:

Burrata and heritage tomato: Burrata was great, heritage tomato et al. not so great, The veggies were too soggy to appreciate anything. 
Butternut squash velouté: My favorite for the night. Love butternut squash. I wish I got more of this because everything else was pretty bland.
Potato gnocchi: Chewy but tasteless. Wasn't a fan.
Roasted panisse: Basically fried chickpea sticks. A bit too salty. Tolerable when you have it there, different story when you have it the morning after.
Tomato and basil tigelle: No no no. Way too dry.

+1 for service. Probably one of the best I've ever had. He knew his stuff and was able to explain the appetizers and drinks to the finest detail.

Overall, the place is worth the pampering and the view. Wouldn't come back for the apps, but maybe for the main courses. After all, how often do you get to enjoy a meal on the 65th floor?

My 2¢:
- RSVP ahead of time. Especially for window seating.
