7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA I went on a Sunday morning on the recommendations that it was vegan friendly. The best  part of our brunch was spent outside waiting for 45 minutes for a table. Inside, the noise was ridiculous, my ears were ringing, and conversations were not possible. My friends enjoyed their tofu scramble. I had the 2 eggs scrambled, which looked and tasted like it was cooked in the microwave. The bread was good. The servers were friendly but stressed out. The crowd was mostly 30-somethings.
I would not go back. I would not recommend it for an ejoyable brunch.
