The prices are going to hurt Postino's. You can get comparable food for a fraction of the cost, you just have to order at the counter. 

I had soup and bruschetta and everything was delicious. The white bean soup was super  flavorful and fresh, not out of a can! 

Bruschetta had a generous amount of mozzarella along with sweet tomatoes, basil and balsamic drizzle.
