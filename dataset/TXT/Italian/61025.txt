Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg Authentic Italian restaurant right here! Having a craving for some pasta, decided to Yelp some reviews around the area I was in and this was the spot! 

The customer service was great and our waiter enjoyed talking to us. He refilled our glasses even when it was half full and packed our left overs for us.  

Order: 
Calamari - Delicious! 
Braised Pork Chops with a side of pasta
 
My overall experience here was warming and enjoyable. Plenty to choose from and yummy food too! They have a store side/deli and a dessert section too -- I will be trying that side during my next visit.
