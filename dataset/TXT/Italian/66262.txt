bNNF6Z91L7Omfdi8QSo2_w My friend and I split courses here for lunch and it was way more than enough food. Our waitress was such a lovely person! Amazing service for sure (Bernadette! Loved her). 

We split: a glass of wine (recommendation by Bernadette, stellar); the arugula and endive salad (great esp for hot weather); and the daily risotto, which was super good (english peas, ham, marscapone, pecorino romano), and then, because Susie couldn't resist, topped it off with a creme brulee. 

Sitting on the patio with a fan, views over the pools, relaxing on a lazy Monday was lovely.
