HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q Horrific service. Paid $9 for a bagel sandwich and was offered no choice of bagel. The cashier decided I was having sesame. When my order came up, along with my husbands (he was only allowed a plain bagel) and some other dude's, I tried to ask which one was mine. She just screamed "ARE YOU TOGETHER OR NOT??". I had to open some strangers coffee to try and figure out if it was my latte or not. $19 for a latte and a bagel sandwich, neither of which was very good.  I'm telling you, never again.
