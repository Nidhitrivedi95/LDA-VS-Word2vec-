s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q Our biggest problem with Bacio was the inexplicable length of time it took from when we ordered our meals to their arrival at our table. An hour and fifteen minutes, despite being only one of TWO seated tables in the entire restaurant on a Thursday night.

Our waiter, whose name I wish I could remember, was amazing: attentive, polite, personable, and honest. He did the best he could given the other let downs we experienced during our dinner. 

As for our meals, we were all very divided. I ordered some sort veal dish, which I really enjoyed BUT I have had better veal on numerous occasions. It was a forgettable albeit filling meal. My father-in-law had veal prepared in a different fashion that was too salty for his taste. My husband had a surf and turf combo on special and it was decidedly the best meal on our table. The other two members of our party had a salad and lobster ravioli, which were "fine" and "good" but again, they've had better. It was a mediocre experience, and when I'm in Vegas I like to kick it up a notch from mediocre. 

Bacio exudes an upscale modern vibe but falls flat in the taste-bud department. This is not a Vegas-must.
