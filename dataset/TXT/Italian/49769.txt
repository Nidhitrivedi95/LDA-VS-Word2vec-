The restaurant is a very nice cozy mix of a pizzeria, a ski lodge and a patio bar.  It has a very unique and fun feel. It's also located in downtown Phoenix.  It has a very Northern California house type of feel. The wine selection was excellent and it was served chilled. The service was excellent and they were very laid back.  

However, the pizza was disappointing.  The crust was soggy and it could have been much crispier. It definitely did not taste baked and there was no substance to it. It felt you were just picking up slabs of cheese with sauce. The cheese was good but not great. It almost passed the authenitc test but it's still lacked the texture and flavor of authentic mozzarella. Normally, I wouldn't criticize cheese so intensely but this place is trying to compete with the likes of authentic "Italy" Italian pizza with the likes of pizzeria bianco yet it failed to measure up. Nonetheless, Pizzeria Bianco is incredibly hyped in my opinion too.

Still, I would recommend this place because it is fun and unique. And people should check it out. It's not a cookie cutter chain that Phoenix is known to have. Furthermore, you will get the same experience as Pizzeria Bianco without the hype and the 3 hour wait.
