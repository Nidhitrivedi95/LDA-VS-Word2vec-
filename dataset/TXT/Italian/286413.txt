zHdMSjk9viL2MjCTT0l3Tg This is my closest Pizza Pizza, so whether I like it or not - this is the one I get delivery from.

First of all, I like Pizza Pizza.  That helps.  People who review Pizza Pizza but don't like the pizza from here - you're not going to have a good experience!  There's a lot I like about it - I like the topping choices, I like the price point, I LOVE that you can order online and make all the customizations you want online.  I even like their pasta and chicken nuggets.   So I'm a fan of the product.

The actual service is hit and miss.  I've had creepy delivery men who've asked if I was home alone.  Don't even get me started if they're past the 40 minute mark - then you're basically going to get killed in your home (the delivery man pays for your pizza if you get it for free, so they get VERY MAD AT YOU if you try to enforce this policy).  One time the cook called me and asked me to pick it up because his delivery man got into an accident, and I was like, "But the whole point of ordering is that I don't WANT to go pick-up?....."  seemed strange.

I still order from here because, Hell, they're open really late and sometimes you crave a creamy garlic sauce base on your pizza.  But it's not without annoyance.
