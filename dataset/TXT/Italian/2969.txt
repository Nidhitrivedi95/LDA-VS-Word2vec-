-xbQQR_ydEJGqYzHSF4DnQ I own a home just up the street from this restaurant and have given them multiple try's because of the convenience.  Unfortunately every time i have dined in the service was very poor and food was lackluster.  Even getting takeout I found the staff to be very unfriendly, food over priced and wait times to be outrageous.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time here.  Go up the road to smiths and get yourself a frozen pizza.
