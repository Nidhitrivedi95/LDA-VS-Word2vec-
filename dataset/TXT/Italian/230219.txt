Tc511yME8axDPq2J6woxkg Delicious food, good wine selection, and the absolute hands down most delightful hostess and waitresses I've ever come across. I travel the country for work so that's tall praise coming from me. The calamari appetizer was unique and delicious. It was large and we split it three ways. The scallops with the cauliflower mashers were absolutely superb. The home made spaghetti and clams special was delicious. I had a cappuccino and raspberry sorbet for desert which was excellent and just perfect... Not too sweet. The complimentary valet guys were very nice as well. We had a great experience. Don't pass it up!!!
