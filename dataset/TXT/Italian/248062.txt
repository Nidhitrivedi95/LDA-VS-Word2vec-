VeBNqe1pI5QBxVbquv0uoQ I was craving Oregeno's After Dark Alfredo is normally fantastic. I was unable to drive there, so I ordered it through door Dash.I also wanted to order an appetizer so I picked homemade guacamole which came with pizza chips. I had never had it before but it sounded fantastic. It was quite expensive, but I understand that you pay more for a delivery service, And guacamole in general. When the food came I was shocked that the pizza chips for the guacamole had chosen baked with a crap ton of raw onion. The chips were described as pizza chips, and never described a crap ton of raw onions on top. I would never ever order that again, and it still smells disgusting in my house with how many onions were on that pizza chip.The Alfredo was fantastic but the appetizer pizza chip with raw onion thing would never make me get delivery from them again.
