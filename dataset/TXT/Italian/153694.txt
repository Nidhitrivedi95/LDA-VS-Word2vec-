kYZJ94hdzbhZIIXhIZU5Dw I quite like this place. The combination of the converted warehouse setting and the comforting Italian food make it a winner. The menu is short and simple with a heavy emphasis on the pizzas. As mentioned in another review, the pizza is comparable to Libretto without the over-hyped wait times. 

I have been back to Strada a number of times since it opened and I see no reason why I would not continue to frequent it regularly.
