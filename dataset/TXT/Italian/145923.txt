K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ I've only ever been to Hyde between 5-10pm when it's in Lounge Mode as opposed to Ooontz Mode, and since the majority of the 1-star reviews here are filled with nightclub-specific complaints, I still feel comfortable with my 5-star rating.

It's best to make a table reservation a few weeks in advance, and it's key to note your preference for a seat on the terrace (which only has seven tables).  As of my last visit, there's a $50/person F&B minimum during lounge hours, which is *easily* met after a few drinks.  And if that still feels like extravagant pricing, have your server bring you a bottle service menu from Ooontz Mode and be thankful you've not paying $30,0000 for a bottle of champagne.

This place is class. Doesn't matter if it's 105 degrees in August or 40 degrees in December, the terrace stays mild and comfortable, thanks to an army of heaters and misters.  And there is nothing more Vegas-magical than having your Strip view completely obscured by a wall of illuminated fountains only a couple hundred feet away, feeling the after-mist rain down over your table, and knowing that you and perhaps 20 other fellow loungers are having this experience.  Yes, we've all seen the fountain show from the scalloped decks on Las Vegas Boulevard, but it's *completely* different and massively more impressive from Hyde.

The noms from adjacent Lago are overpriced and a bit under-delivered, yes, but the drinks are imaginative, the servers attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere....unequaled. I know people who visited Hyde *once* three or four years ago and *still* wax nostalgic about it.  This is the definite place to bring people who don't like Las Vegas.

They won't magically *love* Las Vegas afterwards, of course, but I guarantee that all of their future "I hate Las Vegas" rants will perennially have the exception "except for that one place...."
