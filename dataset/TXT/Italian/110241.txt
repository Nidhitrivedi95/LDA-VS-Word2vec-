G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q There are definitely a mixed reaction. Personally I loved it. I went there on a business trip, but there few times I felt like it would have been best with my husband. It has such a romantic and sexier vibe. The service was great, and we'll taken care of. I've heard many compare here with others on the strip, but I really think you have to take it as its own restaurant. It's warm, and I felt lots of delicate touches that you'd expect from Giada herself. I'm definitely coming back with my special date.
