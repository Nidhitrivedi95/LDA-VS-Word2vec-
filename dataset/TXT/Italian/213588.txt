r6jbUGiyoN05mZ13apQGgw Went to mama's today and I'm at a 50/50 stand still! Although the pizza is great the owner is a joke! I was sitting at a table next to the counter and she is on the phone taking an order. After what seems to be the caller not finishing the order because she couldn't use a $100, the owner precedes to complain to the other worker about the caller! Um 1. It's not polite to complain about people that pay for your services and help keep your business alive! 2. Although she said she was tight on money that's none of your business! 3. If you are going to complain, make sure your In Store patrons can't hear you "the owner" complain!
