Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A We got in line about 10:25 to catch breakfast which ends at 11:00. There was only approx. 17 people in line in front of us. There was plenty of open tables in the restaurant. We got to the register 2 minutes before 11. There was 7 of us in our party. 4 of us got charged breakfast price, the other 3 charged lunch prices. The food was just ok. The sevice at the tables was just ok. For the price and quality you're better off going to one of the Station casinos for a better price for the same quality of food. Plus the Station Casinos have a larger variety of food.
Just to add, we ate here twice in a two day period. Both times were just ok.
