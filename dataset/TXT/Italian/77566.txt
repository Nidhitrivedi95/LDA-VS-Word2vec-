The good news: The meal was fantastic. Carpaccio and the mozzarella and tomato appetizers were fantastic. The pasta gnocchi and the scallop entrees were delicious. Easily the best Northern Italian cuisine in Charlotte.

The bad news: The service was atrocious. Our waiter was arrogant, unfriendly, inattentive, unknowledgable and lacking the desire, or perhaps the ability, to engage and establish a rapport with us. It was like he was doing us a big favor by gracing us with his presence.

Its always amazing to me when people who exhibit those attributes find themselves employed in a fine dining establishment, where service is as important as the meal itself. I just don't know how people can survive when they earn a 3% gratuity.

I don't see myself returning to the restaurant again to dine. Perhaps I'll pick up something to go next time.
