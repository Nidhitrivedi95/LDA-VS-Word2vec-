GZBDLIO4fElNeyGHlsu6Hw My sister in law picked this restaurant for her birthday dinner, so we reserved a table for 10.  Good was mediocre but overpriced; service was extremely slow. 

Nothing on the menu looked enticing. I thought lasagna would be a safe order at an Italian restaurant, and boy, was I so wrong! The lasagna was overly salty with a few crumbs of ground beef. Also ordered lamb meatballs as our appetizer, cost us $13 for 3 little meatballs. Hubby had a pizza which he said wasn't bad. We ate fairly quickly but this meal lasted 2.5 hours. There was easily a 30 minute downtime between courses. Server was pleasant however did not check on us as frequently as we'd liked. There was a big party the same night and they were not staffed adequately. Will never come back again.
