TFftsYkRIUtdo6ZhRwJ2lQ I always have a great meal at Terroni. This was my first visit to the Queen West location, since I normally go to the Adelaide one. The Adelaide location is gorgeous, but this one is warmer and more intimate. 

We ended up sitting at the bar because the wait was extremely long, which is to be expected, but the service was good enough that this did not detract from the experience. 

We got a bottle of prosecco and some pasta and it was an awesome dinner. I don't even need to recommend anything to order because I end up getting something different each time, and it's always good.
