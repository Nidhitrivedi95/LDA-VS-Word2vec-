UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Oh Brio, I wish I met your happy hour sooner. 

For your dining pleasure (during M-F, 3 to 7 & M-Th 9 to close), TUSCAN TASTERS FOR 2.95! Woop woop! Good quality food for such a little price. 

The service was great despite the fact that the server was by herself (or so I overheard). Sarah was her name. She managed to keep a smile on her face and was very polite.

The best plate from my happy hour was the Spicy shrimp and eggplant. The crusted eggplant had a sligh crunch and paired nicely with the black pepper cream sauce. However, the shrimp tasted spicier than the eggplant for some reason. 

The Brio Burger was decent.. Go for the other tasters instead. 

I also enjoyed the sliced steak bruschetta. The tender pieces of steak were topped with yummy gorgonzola.

I wish there was drink specials on the menu... ::sad face::

The seating area in the bar was very nice. There was two lounge areas complete with a love seat and arm chairs. Luckily, I got there in time to bag one!

The mini desserts looked so good but I choose just one. The vanilla creme brulee. The strawberries tasted so well with the vanilla custard. I which I ordered three of them! One was simply not enough!!

Brio! I've never been to Italy but I think you just gave me a small taste of it!
