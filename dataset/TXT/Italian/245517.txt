UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ went with a co-worker, nice warm evening so we sat on the patio. It was a nice atmosphere, but right next to the airport, so you'll be chatting enjoying the outside lights & warm breeze, then a  plane is directly overhead & you think a wheel might fall onto your table...
food was good, liked the non-booze drink options, free refills, service was very good. 
I would go back.
