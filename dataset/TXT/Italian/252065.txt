VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Visited Lavo on Valentines day, w reservations booked through their website about a couple weeks prior. 

Got seated about 5 min after our reservation time. Food was OK, drinks were OK, service was OK, everything was just OK. 

was seated towards the end of the restaurant, i preferred the outdoor seating towards the strip, but outdoor seating is closed during the winter. :-(. 

not sure if i will be back to this spot. i felt like the waitress just wanted us out of there quickly, our food was brought and taken within 15 minuets. 

On the flip side, Music was cool, pretty loud but i wasn't expecting anything other. 

I've experienced better, and probably wont be back.
