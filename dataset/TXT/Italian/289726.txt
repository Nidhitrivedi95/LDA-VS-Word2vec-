zu7DiVAX0wO4f8rGPU8URg Sincerely impressed with this little strip mall Italian joint. Service was excellent. Perfectly times meal with great suggestions from the staff. The spicy shrimp app with polenta was as advertised, very spicy and outstanding. I've had the seafood pasta special, the lasagna and the meatballs. All were above average. They have a nice little wine list and their by the glass selections are stored and served at the proper temp. Menu prices are very resonable. I plan on being here a lot. So should you.
