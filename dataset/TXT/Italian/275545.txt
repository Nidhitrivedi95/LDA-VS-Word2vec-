We were in old town late last night and looking for a place to eat. My father-in-law decided we step in to try the place. First impressions: The place is extremely dated and has an odd artsy/Italian feel. The waiting staff was nice and had good attitudes but they looked sloppy; shirts untucked, baggy clothing, etc. Our table was wobbly but our waiter got down on his hands and knees to put some towels under it to balance it out..

The menus need some refreshing and updating. We were handed paper menus with food stains and torn edges. The prices were ridiculous. Most entrees ranged from 21-34. We all ordered pasta, which was mediocre at best, and a whopping $14 per plate. I get that it's Scottsdale but come on, I could get far better tasting food at Olive Garden.

There was a gentleman sitting at the bar who I'm guessing to be the owner? Having a little much to drink, he was talking loud and flirting with customers while ordering drinks and refilling water glasses. Several employees were babysitting him during our visit attempting to control him. We won't be back.
