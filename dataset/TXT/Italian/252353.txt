VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w I've been to LAVO nightclub like...3 years ago and my only memory of it then was how tiny and dark it was and having to weave in and out of the crowd.  I've never been back aside from now, but for their "Champagne Brunch" on Saturday.

I'm still confused why it's called a Brunch at 2PM, but whatever,  Everyone got in free, including dudes, if you have a good promoter. Only the bottom room is open where they have all the tables set up.   It was open bar for the girls as well from 2-3PM and the bartenders were not stingy about that AT ALL.  There's an indoor dining area, the bar, and an outdoor patio area.  They play loud club music with the windows drawn, but there's no dance floor if that's what you're looking for.   Inside seating is reserved for table service.  Outside is first come first serve.  Nice place to chill and get your (Free) drank on.  

Crowd was kind of bougie looking to be honest, but then again, it is Vegas.  It was a nice pit stop before hitting up a buffet.
