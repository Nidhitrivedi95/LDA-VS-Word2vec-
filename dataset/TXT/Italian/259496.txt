wkZ6P5fDw0G_iFRU-hzBhQ This is another one of those places that I've had a review drafted for quite some time, but haven't pulled the trigger as of yet. So, Pizza Peel. The pizza is quite tasty and it's a quaint little spot for a casual lunch or dinner. As Todd W mentioned, we noticed that a) it's pretty dark in there (even during midday) and b) their beer list is almost unparalleled in Charlotte. Nice start!

Staff was pretty friendly, albeit we didn't need too much attention during a late lunch. While they do have a $7.50 pizza lunch buffet Mon-Fri, 11-2, I went with the small (8") Red & White Pizza. This delicious 'za included ricotta, mozzarella, bruschetta and sun-dried tomatoes. It was well cooked but a bit heavy on the sun-dried tomatoes. I can only handle so much! Plenty of cheese though! I had a slice or two to bring home for leftovers and I exited happy & full. 

And due to Leanne C's nerdy, but correct, engineering & math skillz, I now recall the reason why the 16" pie costs more than twice than the 8" pie. You see, folks, using the formula A=pi*rsquared. Yes, that's pi * the radius squared, an 8" pie has an edible area of 50.24 sq. inches and the 16" pie has an edible area of 200.96 sq inches. Therefore it *does* make sense that their 16" pie costs more than double their 8" pie. Although...you typically don't see this on menus due to extremely high economies of scale at pizza joints. Anywho. That is all.
