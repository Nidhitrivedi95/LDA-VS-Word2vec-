gjATEWAllTfxfxhGqJ93sQ Coming here for lunch during the week (especially a Friday) is not a good idea because it gets super packed.  When you do get a seat it also feels like you are crammed like sardines.  

However, the pizza is decent but a bit overpriced for what you get at 14 dollars on average.  It is very oily so if you are a bit of a health freak then i would recommend you dab your pizza with your napkin first before eating it.
