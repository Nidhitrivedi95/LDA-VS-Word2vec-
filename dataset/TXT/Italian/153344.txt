kXf-SBVDlZXEdv9RupkN7Q I had the pizza. They said it was "all made there". Average tasting- edible but nothing really special. They put basil and olive oil on it before they serve it to you, which does not help much to rescue what is really a big slab of bread with ten grams of vegetables and a microgram of cheese on it. Seriously if they put less on the pizza it would be a Samuel Becket play called "Waiting for Garnish".  

I'd normally give three stars for edible food, but they charge crazy prices ($11.50 for pizza and a San Pellegrino, which they mark up too $2.50) so two stars it is. Also the guy at the cash is a little bit off-putting, verging on rude. If this place dropped off the map it would not make much difference to me. The baked goods looked good, but their prices for those were pretty crazy as well.
