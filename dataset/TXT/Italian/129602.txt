i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Went for lunch today. My boyfriend had the roasted chicken salad and I had tortalini with Alfredo. The portions were large and the food was fresh and delicious. We will definitely return. Only giving 4 stars due to it being very hot inside. Otherwise it was 5 star service and food.
