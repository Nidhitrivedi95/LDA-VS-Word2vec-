I have been to Piazzetta Trattoria twice, I guess it is time for me to write a review.

The dinner room is quite small, so make sure you make a reservation if you want to dine here on Saturdays.

I have sampled the following items:

Caesar Salad ($8)

Veal Scaloppine Limone ($20)
- one of the worse veal I ate, rubbery and chewy

Spaghetti Bolognese ($15)
- Great meat sauce and the pasta was cooked al dente

Linguini Pescatore ($16)
- Tons of Seafood and the tomato sauce is light, good value at this price point!

Pizza Affumicata ($15)
- though it supposed to be a thin crust pizza, it tasted soft and doughy

Services were so so! One of the waitress reminded me not once, but twice that I need to tip the amount before the voucher and in a really condescending tone that I found offensive! And that's even before we started ordering!
