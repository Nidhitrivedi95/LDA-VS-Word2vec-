There is always a wait but they turn over the tables really quickly and you'll have your food in no time. The food is delicious and the portions are big. Service was fast and friendly!

We didn't have lunch but the lunch menu looked delicious! Can't beat that Greek food! Yum! I'll definitely be returning.
