u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Long time patron. first time reviewer. Hard to believe I haven't given my two cents on this joint! I have been here a small handful of times. The service is good and so is the food, but from a noise perspective (I'm a noise nerd and acoustician), I cannot deal with the acoustics in this joint. I believe this shares part of the old post office but damn if it wasn't filled with hard surface decor making all that noise reverberate even more. 

I'm a social eater so where's the fun if it's too damn loud to hear your dining companions? Structural criticisms aside, the food is as good as my preferred location on Central. Just like the location on Central, though, I do not care for forced valet. Blocking off all the spots and not giving me a choice with what to do with my vehicle  really grinds my gears!
