mDiFWhywAziq9SKnj6am_Q You go to a restaurant for a few reasons,: great food that you cant quite duplicate in your own kitchen , enjoyable atmosphere and a nice drink..at least that's why me and my friends go out. Il posto delivers when it comes to these key elements. I find it interesting reading some other reviews on here because the service has never been an issue for me (and ive been quite a bit). sure its not always the absolute best every time, but having working in restaurants a large chunk of my life just because servers aren't running around doesn't mean they aren't working hard or caring. Beside the point anyway, for me. The food is fantastic, especially their seafood dishes and the PIZZA,  love the thai pizza. Atmosphere i great, cute patio area with a bar, not to hot later in the evening. They have specialty cocktails that are all great and  unique. Servers are generally knowledgeable about wine (after all it is an italian place) anytime they may not have the answer the bartender is never too far away with a recommendation. For the price this is truly one of my favorite spots for dinning out,
