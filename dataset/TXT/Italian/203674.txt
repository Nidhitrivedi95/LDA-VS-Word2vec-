Q6DIU2OnvBUo7KJ3rdjM-w This place is right by my house and I order pizza from here a lot. It's an order at the cash register, laid back pizza joint. I love their pizza crust. I order a veggie with no cheese or I order a pizza with no cheese and just olives and mushrooms. Their pizza dough is vegan and they won't put any butter or anything on there if you just let them know you have an allergy. They're good for dine in or pick up. One time they got our order wrong (not surprisingly). My mom asked for a jalapeño pizza bur they gave her a plain cheese pizza. I had already gone home before I noticed. I called back and the manager gave us the option to remake the pizza or give us a voucher. I liked that they made up for messing up the order. It's a great pizza spot if you're vegan and like me don't care for vegan cheese.
