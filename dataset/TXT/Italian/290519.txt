ZvtELJTUOh0yRrPxyyiakQ Its Tuesday, day after a holiday and we are just slammed at work, so some coworkers and I thought ahead and picked a place or order lunch from and pick it up and bring it back to the office .

Today the vote was for Oregano's, I personally had not tried them up until now, but I always see that the place is pack! 

I looked at the menu we had floating around here at the office and I saw they have Midday Rush Menu items from 11am to 3pm Mon to Friday, and I have to say they have a nice variety to pick from. 

I went with the Bollo Pasta; it was a bowl of pasta, crazy right??  It was angel hair pasta cooked perfectly paried with a spicy marinara sauce, and it came with a slice of garlic bread.  It was a perfectly delish lunch, guess I now have Oregano's to add to my lunch time list!
