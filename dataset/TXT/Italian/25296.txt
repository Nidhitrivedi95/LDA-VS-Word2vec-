I went for dinner here a little while ago. I loved the calamari; it was perfectly crispy with a delicious sauce. i would have preferred my gnocchi al dente but still the flavour was delicious. My sister ordered the lemon cheesecake and i the tira masu for dessert. Both were delicious and amazing (we kept stealing bites of each others'). My sister commented on the appropriate portion sizes, which we have always considered to be the downfall of Jawney Bakers.
Best of all, the staff and owner were so friendly and welcoming. The whole atmosphere was warm and lovely. Makes me wish I was Italian!
This place is definitely a new family favourite. Strongly recommend it.
