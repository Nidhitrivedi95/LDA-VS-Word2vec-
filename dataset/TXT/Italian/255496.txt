VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g My wife and I came here to kick off our Valentine's Day weekend, and we weren't disappointed. The service did a fantastic job, the food was paced perfectly and brought to our table at the right time. Also, it tasted fantastic and the portions were significantly larger than expected. 

Check it out! We enjoyed it greatly!
