FmraE2CWt65VRnEqCAqNEg We arrived a couple minutes before 6pm to the happy surprise that Happy Hour went until 7pm. I enjoyed very tasty carne asada tacos for the HH price of $5. My friend had a turkey club sandwich. It was huge and served on a pretzel bun. While tasty, it was so big it was hard to eat. The cocktails were good (margarita, blood orange margarita and...something we no longer remember the name of). Our service was very good. Christian was wonderful plus two others would stop by to check on us. We enjoyed the pub ambiance and were pleasantly surprised to learn everything (including pasta) is made in the kitchen. We will definitely be back!
