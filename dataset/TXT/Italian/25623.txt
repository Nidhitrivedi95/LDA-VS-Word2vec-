4jW0WayNHn1BDLYn7JbL_Q East Coast Italian eatery with no frills, all flavor, damn good food. 

Me and my hubby stopped in for dinner tonight, he got the meatball sub, I had the calabrese  lady- we came hungry, left full, and feeling like we had just returned from Brooklyn. 

What makes Calabria stand out is the quality ingredients they use, and the neighborly service. You get the feeling that the owner, Carlo, has been a family friend for years. 

Homemade meatball sub is outstanding, and super yum. House marinara sauce was slightly sweet (turns out they use carrots) so quality, and seriously savory! 

The Calabrese Lady was equally impressive. Fresh baked chicken straight from the oven? Yes please! With fresh mozzarella and oh-so- tasty roasted garlic and red peppers. In love. 
 
Downright delicious Italian grubs. We will be back.

P.S. Foodie tip: you must try the the arancini (Italian stuffed rice ball). This dish is dangerously addictive, not even kidding. It's not on the menu, so just be sure to call ahead and see if they have any available that day.
