pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw The UGLY:
I got my name on the list (for two) at 6:39.  Had to call every hour to make sure I was still on the list.  Didn't get seated until 9:30.  Didn't get pizza until 10:15.  On a TUESDAY night without any other major downtown events going on.  We said no to the appetizers and only later realized that the bread plates (1/4 baguette sliced) did NOT come with the meal and had to be ordered separately (for at least $5).  

THE REWARD:
It was heavenly pizza, but maybe only because I was so starving that I was about to kill someone!  I lived in Italy for nearly two years and have never had pizza even close to this authentic in the US.   I ordered the arugula/goat cheese pizza ("somethingbianco").  

Food is the top.
The wait is almost unendurable.
The service is suboptimal.

If you really love food, it might be worth all the other difficulties.  I don't think any food is worth all of the hoops that you have jump through just to get this pizza though.  Because of this, I am giving it only three stars.
