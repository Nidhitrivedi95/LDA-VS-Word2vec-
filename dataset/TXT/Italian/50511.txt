9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw I like Cibo better than Bianco as a restaurant, but Chris's pie is still better by a nose. Cibo has bad parking, nice ambience, spotty service, good menu, fresh, high quality ingredients, and good value. Translates to hit the off hours, get a pie, order the antipasto, and have a Nutella desert
