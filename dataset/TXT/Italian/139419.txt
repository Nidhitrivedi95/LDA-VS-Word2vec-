jG1jcAeDw0pZTHCNC5kw_w Passing through Scottsdale while moving with my wife and we decided to stop here because is was walking distance from our hotel. Absolutely amazing place. The Chicken Parmigiana was outstanding. My wife got the Napoli pizza and said it was "the best pizza she has ever had". Service was great. Laid back atmosphere. Wine selection was quite nice. Definitely a great place!
