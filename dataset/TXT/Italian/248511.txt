VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ First time impression was decent. Table shared a couple of appetizers which tasted amazing. Wait staff was very knowledgeable about beers/spirits so way to go on the training. 

Only con was sitting outside service is a little slower but the inside bar was very busy. Will try it again because I'm eager to try more from their menu.
