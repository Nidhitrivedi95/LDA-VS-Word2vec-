PFt0wew2GqfPpesuUC9-cg The drinks and burgers are awesome. The appetizers (perogies) were perfect. I advise trying any of the drink specials and their tacos (tues and thurs after 5). The waitstaff are friendly and they can really do excellent custom orders. I would prefer a little bit more flavor in my food but even that could be worked with enough sauces and spices. (See what I did there?)
