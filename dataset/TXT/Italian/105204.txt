FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q This was a GREAT place for us to eat at. It had something for our whole family to enjoy. 

I had a basic tomato and basil angel hair pasta so I could share it with my daughter and my husband had one of their specials, lobster ravioli. Talk about RICH! It was SO GOOD!!! He gobbled it all up. I had enough left of mine to save for dinner the following night :)

The salad with the house dressing was great and I had the soup which was also very tasty. My daughter loved it too. Garlic bread would have been better if the outside wasn't burnt, but overall we enjoyed the whole experience. The smell and warmth of the restaurant was welcome compared to the cold and windy outside weather and the staff was very friendly and we were seated right away, which was a bonus.

This is somewhere I'd like to come and eat at again as there are so many things to choose from!
