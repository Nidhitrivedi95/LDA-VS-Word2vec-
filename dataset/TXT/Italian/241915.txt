UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA I had a sandwich here a few months ago which was just okay.. I decided to go back and give it another chance. I was going to order a breakfast burrito before going into work.. I got to the counter and the lady was going to help me, but a man(seemed like the owner or manager??) was yelling at her about her bad work ethic and comparing to the other girls who worked there. I was standing there for almost a minute without being acknowledged at all and I couldn't believe he would talk to his employee like that in front of customers so I walked out and went to work hungry. I wish Someburros opened earlier!!!
