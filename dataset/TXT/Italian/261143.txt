WpZkK951tqHONywmKLmhQw I have tried to go for dinner 2 times in the past, but the wait for a table was over an hour, & knowing this is not a 5 star restaurant, and assuming there would not be 8 courses, an hour seemed to long. so I decided to go for lunch on Sunday@ 11:00am, when they opened... there were only about 10 customer's when we got there, & The wait time to get a seat was still 10_15 minutes, ( not sure why, since there were many open tables)the waitress Jordan was awesome, she kept us hydrated with refills, while we waited for about an hour for a thin crust pizza& a meatball sandwich, the food was decent, not worth the wait, but it was OK, then we ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut dessert@12:15, then @1:05 the waitress told us there was a mix up and the dessert was put in a to-go box, but said it would be about 5 more minutes, while we waited, we did see the cooks burn multiple pizzas, (both thin crust, & deep dish), and throw them in the garbage, @ 1:30, I went out for a smoke, at 1:55 the dessert showed up..., that is 100 minutes for dessert!!! ( I know 1st world problems), it was an undercooked 4 inch circle cookie about 1/4 inch thick, with 3 scoops of ice cream, it was good but again, not worth the wait, total time at the restaurant= 3 hours, now I know why the wait time for a dinner seat is over an hour.
