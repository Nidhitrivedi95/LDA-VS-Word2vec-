jeTfL2kCyBtmFGSrSQHqVw I don't see what all the fuss is about. I lived in Chicago for many years so maybe I'm spoiled. I don't mind paying $27 for a steak but the steak I had was average at best and one of my friends had a rabbit dish that was just okay. Third friend had a seafood risotto that was the best of the three entrees. The entree selections were very limited and tried too hard to be different or unusual.

Waiter was nice but new I would guess because he seemed nervous. 

Not rushing back any time soon.
