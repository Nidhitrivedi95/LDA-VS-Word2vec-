7iZYl52Gtica73shRYsuMQ Definitely need reservations on a Friday night because it was BUSY. Even without reservations, it didn't look like the wait was too long though. Lively place as soon as you walk in. That's a good sign, I suppose. 

This was our Italian dinner do-over after a disastrous night at Lombardino's a few days ago. We were greeted warmly and seated promptly. We sat for what felt like 10 minutes before someone came up to us and offered water. Megan, our server, was great throughout the night. 

He had the Linguine alla Puttanesca con Pollo -- YUM YUM YUM! I had a small amount of it, but that alone made me like it a lot. We're not huge fans of black olives, and he forgot to ask them to leave it out, but it didn't take over the dish so we forgot it was even there. The cherry tomato sauce was tasty--a hint of sweetness. Definitely will order this for myself next time. 

I ordered the Pollo Arrosto alla Romano, which is pretty much roasted half chicken with roasted potatoes. When it first came out, I didnt expect that it really was just the chicken and maybe a handful of potatoes. It was laying on a  bed of sauce (garlic, shallots, rosemary, lemon, and olive oil) and looked kind of blah. But I was wrong. The chicken was juicy, even the breast which I ate the next day. I used the bread they offer when you sit down and dipped that baby in the sauce. I'm a little sad there wasn't more. Potatoes are potatoes, nothing fantastic but still complemented the dish.

No desserts this time. Didn't really feel like it since it seemed like they were so busy that they were trying to get people to get out of there. They boxed our food before we can fully comprehend that they were going to box our food to go. 

Overall, definitely one of our new favorite spots for Italian food. Fish fry was on the specials menu that night and I almost ordered it. There's a hint of regret for not doing so. Next time, for sure!
