KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ Rao's in New York City is notorious.  It is not clear how good their food actually is since no one is able to get a reservation at the restaurant.  Seriously, the wait is measured in terms of years, and at the end of the day, they primarily serve pasta like most any other Italian restaurant in the city.  In Las Vegas, it is a different story.  One can freely walk into the restaurant with the hope of actually getting a table.  Short of that, a seat at the bar is almost always guaranteed.  I believe the menu is the same, and the owner was at the restaurant on my visit, so I felt like I was able to have roughly the same experience as I would in New York if I had somehow managed a reservation.

I ordered the gnocchi bolognese and had a glass of Montepulciano.  The dinner began with a bread course served with a plate of olive oil and vinegar.  I was happy with this beginning with the tasty bread and the good quality olive oil.  The gnocchi were beautifully presented simply dressed in a deep dish.  I had an impressive amount of pasta before me, and the gnocchi were not heavy at all.  I thought the texture was great.  The sauce was very flavorful and balanced.  Simple and good, exactly what I wanted.  The wine paired well.  More generally, I was pleased to have a nice selection of Italian wines available by the glass.  

The restaurant itself was fairly busy and very dynamic.  The interior is dark and nearly every square inch of the walls was decorated with photos of the celebrities who have visited.  I know that can be kind of cheesy, for example at the Carnegie Deli, but here I was getting more of a Minetta Tavern kind of feel.  I think this location of Rao's is a wonderful place to have a glass of wine and a plate of pasta.  It definitely gets my vote over places like B and B Ristorante which charges far more for less.  Recommend.
