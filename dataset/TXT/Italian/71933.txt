cbddL2q8uRA38RwycB0FJg Wonderful restaurant! 11/10 would recommend. I walked into Alexander's and was immediately greeted with a wonderful server, Jonathan Bright. Within no time at all we were served with bread and beverages. We were waited on at precisely the right moment and I was never out of water. The food was absolutely superb! Couldn't have asked for a better plate of pasta! Can't wait to come again!
