rsjrcxOIJm9VdkSNpkXZ9Q Was craving Italian my entire trip to Canada! So many different Italian places, but Cibo was a constant recommendation! So glad I gave it a whirl before I left. Their menu is packed with traditional Italian recipes and more! Their pizza was cooked perfectly with an airy crust, just how I prefer it. The portions were perfect for sharing and their family meal was a steal! If you love causal Italian, but the flavor of fine dining, you'll love Cibo!
