dulgBrNtDCGjYcbQa2E6uA This place has quickly become my favourite spot in the city. From the incredible ambience and decor, to the exquisite selection of alcohol and the best steak in the city. I have yet to try a dish on the menu that I don't love. Love the live music, DJ's, and the incredible bartenders. What makes this restaurant truly great is the level of service provided. The servers are beyond compare to any other place - knowledgable, gracious and accommodating. The owner is always there, he is always very welcoming and even bought us a round of drinks to thank us for coming in. I recommend this place for any occasion! There are walk in tables available, however I recommend making a reservation as it gets quite busy at dinner time. 5 stars!
