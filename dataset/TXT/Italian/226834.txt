SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Location is awesome, with "outside" seating in the Forum Shops area as well as in the restaurant itself. Service was excellent and attentive. The food however, left much to be desired. We ordered the carpaccio as an appetizer, which was good, but the presentation seemed a little sloppy and unappealing. For dinner, I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs (a rare choice for me) and my husband ordered the chicken marsala. The spaghetti, was reminiscent of my younger days of Chef Boyardee. Honestly, not worth $18. The Chicken Marsala kind of reminded me of salisbury steak based on presentation. The chicken cutlets were cut thin and tasteless. The bread and oil dip was really good and had great flavor. Overall, the location was perfect for someone looking for a reasonably priced meal with the forum shops. The food is ok, but nothing to brag about. The food presentation is boring, and I considered the food to be just sustenance for a hungry person. If you are looking for tastier food, this is not your restaurant. If you want ambiance, go here.
