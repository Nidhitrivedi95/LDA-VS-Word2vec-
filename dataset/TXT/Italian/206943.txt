qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA I go to postino at least once a week, and the food is always consistently delicious. Their panini's are all very good, although I sometimes wish they would switch up the menu once in a while. The service has always been great, but Christian is by far the most friendly and attentive server I've had. He always makes sure everything is tasting good, and that our water glasses are full.
