KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg I loooove the pizza at Libretto!! Best in Toronto, hands down. Yes, the pizza IS better than Terroni's and so is the service!  Unfortunately I haven't had a chance to try the pasta because I can't seem to overcome my addiction to their Cremini Mushroom pizza. Ask for extra roasted garlic...you won't be disappointed! I've been to both locations and both experiences were fantastic.
