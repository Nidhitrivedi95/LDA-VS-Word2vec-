B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw I never thought I would love a pasta that had no meat or seafood in it, but the Mafalde ai Funghi mushroom pasta is amazing! It is a simple dish with portobello, porcini, and oyster mushrooms. The truffle cream sauce is really good and the pasta was very fresh and al dente. The decor and ambiance of this restaurant are also very nice. They also have decent house wine for $1 per ounce.
