Came here for restaurant week and they had their entire menu available, awesome.

Crabcake had tons of crab, very little filler, which is good, but the crab didn't taste very fresh. Grilled artichoke was nicely flavored. Gnocchi was bomb, super soft with a lot of flavor. Swordfish was overcooked, but the flavoring was nice over a bed of arugula. Had hazelnut gelato (nom), pistacho gelato (nom), and cabernet sorbetto (different, kind of grows on you after a while) for dessert. And I tried the hazelnut cake thing, delicious. 

In conclusion, if I skip the seafood next time and stick to my vegetarianism, I think I'll love this place.
