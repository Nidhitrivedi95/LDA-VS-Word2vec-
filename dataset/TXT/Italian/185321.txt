OKGfGPx3AJOw6ohrIXM-yg We live relatively close to Tano's and have had their pizza a number of times.  For a small town pizza joint, they make a pretty mean pizza.  They have a great list of specialty pizzas including a white garlic pizza (that my picky brother-in-law raved about), veggie pizza (that my in-laws loved), and my favorite, the Southwest pizza that's made with barbecue sauce and some kind of amazing white ranchy type sauce. The first time I had it, it was the weirdest pizza I had ever eaten, but after I ate it...I couldn't stop thinking about it! It's very different, but very, very good. I can't really rate them on their "regular old pizzas" (aka: pepperoni or a plain cheese) because we've really only tried the specialty pizzas - all which we have been impressed with.

The one big downfall of Tano's?  They are busy. Really busy...probably because they are the only pizza place in a small town. But, they seem to make mistakes a lot.  They are always very gracious about it and offer to fix any issues right away, but definitely check your order!

I think Tano's is doing a great job. We now choose them over the "bigger name" pizza places in the Middeton area and other than the occasional errors with our orders, I am a fan.
