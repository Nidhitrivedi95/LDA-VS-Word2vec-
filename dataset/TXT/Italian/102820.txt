FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw This review is based on Toca's Sunday Brunch buffet. 

There are two sittings 11 and 230 - we had the later one and were served til the very end . 

Unlike a traditional brunch buffet the selection is smaller but the quality of the food definitely exceeds anything I've ever been to. The service is outstanding - if there is something not on the buffet that you want they are more than happy to bring it to you. Bottomless mimosas/bellinis and Cesar's are constantly flowing and my glass was never empty. Even towards the end when the buffet and service was closing our server told us not to worry and that he would make sure the prosecco was on hand for us 

If you're a seafood lover this is the place for you. The seafood area of the buffet is outstanding, as I was waiting for them to refill the server asked if I wanted a lobster tail, instead of giving me one he gave me three. Absolutely delicious, our server even gave us warm butter for our seafood. 

For the price ($89+tax) this isn't something I would do weekly, maybe for special occasions but is 100% worth every penny. 

Will definitely be back!!
