Huo1lJmVkdqvFuLtA74Nhw Gluten-free review:

I came here for dinner before a late night movie at the move theatre across the street. The staff are really friendly and wonderfully welcoming. I'm not Italian and I felt like they treated me like their extended Italian family. It was lovely. 

They have gluten-free pizza and gluten-free pasta. It's stated at the top of their menu and not next to the individual dishes, so make sure you read over the ingredients to make sure they don't have gluten. I ended up going with a gluten-free pizza with mostly veggies and it tasted great. The sauce was a little light for me (I like a thicker, saucy sauce) but it still tasted great. The portion size is also pretty substantial. I plan on trying the gluten-free pasta the next time I'm there. 

They also had a gluten-free chocolate cake for dessert, which was very rich and delicious. There was only one gluten-free dessert option though. Still, I appreciated that they could offer me something other than plain vanilla ice cream, like most places do.

TL;DR Gluten-free pizza, pasta and dessert; great service
