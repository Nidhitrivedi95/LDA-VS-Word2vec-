9xdVIIzHp12Zrox5aFaaHA Place was okay. Saw it on you gotta eat here so I thought i would give it a whirl. 

Tried several pizzas, the 504 (meh), chicken pizza (delicious) and lobster pizza (interesting but wouldn't have it again)

The bison meatballs were very good. 

Overall, service a bit slow, pizza was okay but not sure if I would be back. I've had better pizza at several different places in the city such as True Tru, G for Gelato, lambretta
