But today the quality of food I received was not up to par to what I paid. My pizza was missing ingredients that I had paid for, there was so much cheese that my pizza was super soggy. Every time I tried to get a slice, my pizza slices would fall apart in pieces. My wings were disgusting, half my to go box was nothing but sauce and trying to eat was a mess.  Barros is usually my got to place for pizza, but I think this location is not for me.
