FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA This place needs to have a 5 star rating. They have the most amazing bruschetta I've ever tasted and on Monday and Tuesday nights, you cannot beat their deal of $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta. The atmosphere is super fun and it had a great outdoor area. It gets packed here on Monday and Tuesdays but it is worth the wait!
