7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg After reading that this is the best lasagna in Cleveland I had been wanting to check it out for a long time. Finally got the chance. Here are my thoughts:
*Lasagna was very good. Lots of layers, very good sauce. Would have liked a little more meat in the sauce, but overall great flavor. Would not go as far as best in Cleveland though.
*Portion was huge, definitely could share, although good for leftovers too.
*I prefer cheese more golden brown. When I asked, the bartender he said it could not be done as they don't have a broiler, only an oven". Huh???
* House salad dressing was great.
* Waitress was very nice, bartender not so much, maybe it was a bad day, but, still...just did not have a good attitude. 
*The swinging doors to the kitchen  (think saloon doors from an old western ) were super annoying in such a small place. Am sure that could be easily fixed. 
*Someone had suggested they are better for take out than dine in. I agree.
* I'd prefer to go with 3.5 stars, but, of course not an option.
