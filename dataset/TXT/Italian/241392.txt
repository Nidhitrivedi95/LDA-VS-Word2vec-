UHPjDgiEHnTe7-MP-b2kyQ Tried this place with a friend last Saturday evening.  We ended up sitting at the bar for our meal as we didn't have reservations.  But I don't mind sitting at the bar, and Felix (the bartender) was someone I would have missed if I sat at a table.  He was really helpful, thoughtful and makes a great martini!

The food was amazing...I got the Baccala and it was incredible.  Just the right amount of food, and just the right flavors blended together.

If you want a table on the weekends, make a reservation.   But don't skip going to this place!
