nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Eat Fresh Be Healthy...a hidden gem for sure!

One of my coworkers live right at Bay & Dundas and he has dined at every single restaurant in and around this corner. Eat Fresh Be Healthy was THE restaurant he raved about. He told me to look past the restaurant's exterior and just give it a try.

I checked their winter menu a couple of weeks ago and I loved the options (a lot of seafood!). However, they changed their menu recently; my friend and I did not have the chance to dine here until last night. (Their website has not been updated, but you can check out their Facebook page for their current menu.) It was a rainy Wednesday night and they were not busy at all.

Appetizers:

* Crispy Shrimp Cake: I expected it to be more like a crab cake, but they breaded a whole shrimp. It was big and it was cooked perfectly. The breading was a little bitter though.
* Roasted Red Pepper and Cauliflower Bisque garnished with aged cheddar: Mmm...it was quite tasty, and the cheddar was a nice touch.

Entrées:

* Pan-Seared Seafood Platter: Smaller than expected, but for $25, we cannot ask for too much as it came with steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes, too. The lobster tail, shrimp, and scallop were well cooked, but it was a little too salty for our liking.
* Cajun Blackened Salmon with fresh fruit salsa: It was a nice mix of mango, strawberry, watermelon, papaya, and even dragonfruit! The salmon was a good size and cooked well-done. We thought there was a lack of seasoning though -- it was definitely a healthy option.

Desserts:

* Milk Chocolate Panna Cotta: THE best part of my meal. Mmm... It was creamy and silky smooth. I wanted to ask for more!
* Pistachio Ice Cream: My friend is a big fan of pistachios and she said it was too milky, and not nutty enough. There were soft pistachios in the ice cream, too, but I am used to pistachios being crunchy.

We could tell that the chefs put a lot of effort into plating all of their dishes, as they added nice little touches here and there. Each dish is also made to order in their open kitchen. The portions are pretty good, too, especially for a 3-course meal for only $25. We are not a big fan of the other options on the current menu, but we decided that we will return every time they have a new menu. 

The restaurant is run by a friendly Indian couple, who are very kind and welcoming. The environment is fairly laid-back -- what I would call "comfy fine dining". The restaurant could use some decor (even just a few framed pictures), but seriously, don't let the exterior or the interior of the restaurant fool you. Walk in, have a sit, take a look and taste their food! You will be pleasantly surprised.
