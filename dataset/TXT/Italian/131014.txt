ifEHr-ZnGFSKgJVsywiAFg Love the Enomatic wine system they have here. You fill up a credit card like card with money and then go from wine to wine paying and tasting as you go. The food is great and the servings are huge, so feel free to share. I go here a lot with friends for happy hour and we always find a seat at the bar and have a good time. I don't know the bartenders name who's always here, but he's very knowledgeable and always offers up suggestions on food and wine when I'm at a loss on what to choose.
