USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg When I drop $150 on a meal for 2 people, I expect something very near perfection otherwise I'm disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good (filet and lamb chops), but I really just don't understand the cost.

I like the craftsman style structure of the restaurant and the intimate feel.  The service was descent, but nothing really to write home about.

I can easily say I will not go here again unless someone else is paying.  There are too many excellent, reasonably priced restaurants in Charlotte for me to want to re-vist the Fig Tree.
