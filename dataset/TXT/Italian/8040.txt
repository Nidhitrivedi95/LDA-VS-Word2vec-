0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw My family and I were so excited to try Joe's Farm Grill after the reviews, hype and waiting 30 minutes in the line out the door. I went with some of the items sampled by The Food Network. I had the Fontina Burger and the onion rings and figured, why not, let's try the dark chocolate shake too. I don't like mushrooms so I added avocado and took off the mushrooms on the burger. It was a very tasty burger. And they made substitutions with no issues. The onion rings were crispy and good, but not to-die for. The shake was average. It was just chocolate not dark chocolate in my opinion and not worth the calories. I think the favorite item by consensus in my group was the ribs. 

The outdoor seating is beautiful. I loved being surrounded by gardens and sitting under a gigantic tree. Very tranquil, peaceful setting. So after our nice pleasant dinner I got up to ask where the recycle bins were for the plastic drink cups. I mean, come on, this is Joe's FARM grill adjacent to Agritopia's organic gardens and their own 24-hour "FARM" stand where you can pick up items and pay via envelope. And the answer I got was, "WE DON'T HAVE RECYCLE BINS." Are you kidding me? How can a place like this NOT have recycle bins much less a composting bin? Which leads me to believe that Joe's is all hype and slick marketing. I didn't expect them to be cooking with solar ovens, but seriously? Any place that is going to have FARM in the name and advertise organic ingredients should at least offer one fricken recycle bin. I will never return to this place. I'll stick to places in the valley that really believe in farming and sustainability: The FARM at South Mountain, Essence Bakery, Hillside Spot and even Chipotle. So utterly disappointing.
