0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw Went here on a whim, after hearing such positive reviews. The line to get in was ridiculously long and we waited about 30 minutes before we got to order, but the food came up really quickly after that. Downside: it's pretty pricey and the burger that I got (Southwest) was actually a little bland. But everyone else in my party got BBQ and said it was awesome. I tried their garlic fries too and they were really good - very garlicky but what else would you expect? All in all, I'd come here again but order something different. And be prepared to stand in that long line!
