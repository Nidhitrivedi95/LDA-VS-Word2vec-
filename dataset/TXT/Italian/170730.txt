MWYJl-bIxhtQ-4Kg3ENUxA I've ate here a few times and have always enjoyed my lunches. Last time I went I had ordered the Italian Beef Sandwich. Boy was that puppy good! I ordered the Au Jus sauce on the side and it was an absolutely delectable combination. 

I've also had the Chicago Dog's here and they are fantastic as well. I enjoy this place since it's close to home and work!
