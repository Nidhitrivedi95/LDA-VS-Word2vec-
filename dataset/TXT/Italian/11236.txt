We ordered the signature cucumber infused cocktail and it was horrible. We sent them back and ordered a beer and a glass of wine. The wine was hot and the beer.. well how can you screw up a bottle of beer. We ordered a pizza and some pasta it was just okay. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
