i4Jb_b28YAphS9_jPPzwkQ Ordered the fish (cod) and shrimp combo with a side of calamari rings.  I placed my order for takeout.

It was just one guy working both the counter and kitchen in the evening.  He was competent and cordial.

Calamari rings were very tender.  The calamari itself had a slight sweetness to it.  I wish they would've included marinara instead of tartar sauce.  I will be sure to ask next time.

Fries weren't bad.  I appreciated the seasoning salt on them.  The taste reminded me of Red Robin's fries.  A few that were nestled next to the tartar and cocktail sauces (which I didn't eat) were a little cold.

Shrimp were very crunchy (Panko breaking?) and a decent size for the price.

Cod was breaded very lightly so it was more like a "skin".  No crunch.  Fish pieces were large and fully cooked.  It was served piping hot.  I would hesitate to reorder this though as I like a nice crunch when I bite into my fish, not the squish of what I liken to the basic original recipe coating on KFC chicken.

I do miss the clams that the previous fish and chips restaurant here had.

They need to get rid of the broken chair, but it was very clean inside.

I definitely got a lot of food for around $15 after tax and tip.  It's a deep fried calorie bomb, but the  food wasn't greasy to the touch at least (though the container liners were definitely soaked through with oil). You do get that very full "I just ate way too much fried food" feeling afterwards though.
