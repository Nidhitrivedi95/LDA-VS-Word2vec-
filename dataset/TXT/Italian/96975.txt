esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA Great friendly staff! Especially the server Moon, the dude from Korea!

The food is so fricken' salty though my god I'm dying from salty mouth as a write this!! 

I still have a full table of salty food to eat and  I'm not excited to eat it!

The oyster shooters are good though!
