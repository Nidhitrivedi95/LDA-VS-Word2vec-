wVsyfuWkYs0np4or31_j1w I really wanted to like this restaurant and went on 3 different occassions.  Fettuccini Alfredo was bland.  Pasta was overcooked.
  Bottom line, mediocre food at best.   
Service is spotty.   The waiter on our second visit was fantastic.  Our waitress today was snotty and seemed bothered we were there.    
Il Fornello is right in our neighborhood and a short walk from our home.  Sadly, I will never go back.
