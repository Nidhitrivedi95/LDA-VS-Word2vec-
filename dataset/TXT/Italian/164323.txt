LXheNwqZPoXuXNNeP1sNew Had the chicken, potato and rosemary pizza, it was kind of bland. Friend had the spaghetti and meatballs and said it was nothing spectacular. Pizookie (don't know what they call it here but its a cookie pizza) was the best part. We came right before the dinner rush and as people started trickling in they wanted us out. No refilled water glasses. 

Food is nothing special, kind of over priced, service was rushed. Won't be returning probably.
