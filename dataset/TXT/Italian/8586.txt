0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ Very disappointed in this place. Haven't been in a while. Service at the counter was Terrible. The girl didn't acknowledge me and just starred at me like I should greet her. I wasn't sure if she understood my order or not. Once she finished she just moved on like next. 
Got my first pizza. I couldn't believe how dry it was. It was a Margherita and when I asked why it was so dry I was told because if not it would be soupy. They did offer to remake it. 
The way the pizza was cut was unbelievable. 3 small pieces and 2 huge pieces. Basically attention to detail has been lost. 
Second pizza tasted great. 
I will give credit to the young lady who was there on her day off and over heard everything. She came over and apologized and offered to have it remade 3 times. 
It is almost 10pm and kids are ready to go home but thank you.
