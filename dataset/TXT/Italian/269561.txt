xjjxHavx4RIiW6zS6rasGA The atmosphere and ambiance is chic and modern. Everything is clean and prim without seeming to hoity toity. 

The services was great

The food however...sub par. I'm not into rating a place amazing based on how cool or "hip" it is. I'm 27, my BF 43...we like good food but don't have ridiculously high expectations either. I convinced my BF to come here after reading the reviews. He had the Tommy's Amazing Pasta Trio and I had the chicken piccata. The food was honestly a little above that of a frozen dinner. The trio was bland and not very flavorable. My piccata was paired with a red pasta ziti and a steamed vegetable medley. The lemon sauce seemed like it was made from a gravy packet...

It wasn't HORRIBLE, but it wasn't great it was average, with a price tag. Not that price is an issue, but our meal was $100 with tip and we left feeling let down...my sparkling wine was the highlight of my dinner sadly. Also, they do not carry coors or miller light...but they carry budlight. 

We also had the steamed mussels for an app...we usually get steamed clams, but those weren't on the menu. We aren't huge fans for fishy flavor, and these tasted like eating a bite of ocean water...not sure if that's how mussels are suppose to be or not.

Anyway that's our experience and take...I wouldn't go back sadly...
