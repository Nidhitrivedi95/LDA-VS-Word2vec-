9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg Was okay nothing too different. They didn't mark boxes the calzones came in so we had to finger them until we figured it out.... Also I forgot to pack my vacation silverware and asked if they could provide and they agreed. However when the items arrived there was everything under the sun accept silverware. 

FOOD: Calzones have ricotta cheese in them which isn't listed on the menu. They give you a generous size pie but its greasy as hell. Yes yes i know its pizza greasy is to be expected but I never have had a calzone so greasy before. Crust was nice and golden! If it wasn't for the silverware I'd give it a 3 stars... Also missing was 2 sides of ranch. Overall poor experience
