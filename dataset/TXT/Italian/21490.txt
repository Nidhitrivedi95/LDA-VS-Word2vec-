38-sjGYYVcQEKrZe5Nu47A This one is for you Jer.... Mr. Mac I hear migrated from the mother land of wings(buffalo). Now I like pizza, I have been a long time conasaur of wings. I have sampled a good 100 or so wings from the Anchor Bar. The establishment that claims started this delicacy. Johnny could use bat wings battered and dipped in his wingy sauce and I would still think they are taste o' licious. Some sauces are meant to be sopped up with your left over pizza crust and Mac's is on that list. I travel a good 30miles round trip to partake on his wingy dingies. Make sure you ask for extra sauce on your babies because the secret is in the sauce when it comes to wings. The meat is meaty also, you rarely ever get that bastard stepchild of a wing all small over crisp and retarded. Mac's is on my list when I think of purchasing wings for myself or chowing down with the guys. Shalom Johnny Macs.
