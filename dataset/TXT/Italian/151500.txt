kp-FRmyPxjsAoEK1-21rSQ I had a chance to visit a few days before the New Year and had mixed feelings after leaving. 

First, the place was incredibly busy when we walked in...don't mind waiting.

Took a while for our waters to come out...not a problem. 

Waited a while for the waitress to take our order....ok, i had great company so we will let it slide. 

However, the waitress communication with us when she did take our order was a bit choppy. When she did give us attention it was very minimal and I felt a bit unsatisfied with the experience. 

Calamari was solid along with the pizza we ordered.

It seems like they have their regulars and it maybe a family run establishment so we will give them another shot in the future but will keep this at a three star "average rating" until proven otherwise.
