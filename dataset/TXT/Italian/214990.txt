ro69vDxjgaDIIdRgTrSE_w Wow!   We were visiting from California and had a late night craving for pizza.  Checked out a place close by but wasnt too crazy about paying $12 for a 12" pizza. Came across Vinny's  and saw they sold pizza  by the slice.  Here we Are!  Wow!  2 slices plus a drink for $3.99!  $10.00 for 2 people!    Slices are HUGE, hot and delicious, and not too greasy!   Server was a doll!  Very friendly folks and fast service.  Cant rave enough about this place.  Only sorry they don't have a Vinny's back home!
