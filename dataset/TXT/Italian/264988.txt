wzfQBvE_VAApYqvi_Zrt4g I had a quick bite here while staying at Firesky this past weekend.

I sat outside and Will took care of me.  He had tables outside as well as the bar inside.

He was warm, friendly, and attentive.  Someone else (a managerial type) delivered my food which was ok.  I was hungry so I inhaled the Caprese sandwich with french fries.

The bread was a caramelized onion foccacia, with fresh mozzarella, bibb lettuce, and a slice of tomato with a pesto spread.

It was a basic sandwich and the fries were good and it served its purpose to fill me up before a night of boozing.

The rest of the options on the menu which boasts 'coastal Italian cuisine' seemed interesting but not much appealed to me...I was feeling like I wanted more meat free options though I am not a vegetarian.

Overall the food was average, what you would expect in a hotel but the service by Will was outstanding.  

He made sure to introduce himself ask my name and refer to me by that (as opposed to the general Miss, Ms. etc).  He was personable and surely is an asset to the Firesky staff at Taggia.
