wuHPirjfXUCpNL3XO_vHUg Read great reviews and came for dinner with my wife last week. Really nice place interior is well done and thought out well. Menu looked great I wanted to try a pizza and a pasta so I got the pizza with white sauce, prosciutto, and arugula the name escapes me at the moment but it was DELICIOUS. My wife ordered the tortellini, she's a tortellini buff and said it was the best she's ever had I thought it was very good too and the portion size was great value in my opinion.

Overall we had a great experience we recently moved out to Oshawa and this is now the only restaurant nearby my wife wants to go to, well be back and I look forward to trying other pastas and the patio once weather allows.

Well done, great food, great service, great value A+
