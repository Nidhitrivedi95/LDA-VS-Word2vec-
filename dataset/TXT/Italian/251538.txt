VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w I don't care that it isn't in the greatest part of town, or is situated next to a Tiffany or Nordstrom.  What I care about is great food, and this place definitely offers that.  The bonus is the price.  The value was definitely there, and everything was priced at or below what I felt was fair value.

I went with friends, and we shared an appetizer, salad, special, and a meter of pizza.  The grilled calamari was fantastic, and the salad it was on was very flavorful with a house dressing.  The Caprese salad was good, but not great.    The snapper with veggies was the special of the day.  While I am not a fish guy, this was some of the best I have had.  It was served in a tomato broth with veggies.  Cooked perfectly and no fishy taste/smell.  It was served with pasta that had a little heat, and was perfectly balanced (everything was nicely seasoned.  Finally, the meter of pizza.  The cheese and sauce were divine.  The bread was very good, but as other reviewers have said, it was a little limp in the middle, due to it being so big.  The edges were really good, and the toppings (arugala and proscuitto on half of it) were top notch.  

I will definitely be back, even if it is on the west side of Central.  There are many other menu items I want to try, and that will force some return visits.
