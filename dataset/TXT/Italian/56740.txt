AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw I picked out this spot from the great book "Eating Las Vegas." While I am usually satisfied with the recommendations from that book, Circo disappointed me. In one word, bland. My date and I went with their recommended dishes: calamari to start, then raviolis and a seafood stew for the main course. Everything was solid, but none of it memorable. For dessert we had a tiramisu (one of my favorites) that was just as forgettable as the rest of the meal. Additionally, the ambiance is just bizarre. I am all for daring or loud designs, if done correctly. The inside of Circo looks like a gaudy circus nightmare. For the price of the food, I would much prefer to get a meal that has more flavor. If I took value into consideration, the rating would be closer to two stars.
