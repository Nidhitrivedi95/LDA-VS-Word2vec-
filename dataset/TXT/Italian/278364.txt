YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg The decor is very gorgeous, very elegant and spacious. I'd got the Salmone alla Griglia. It was pretty good, I finished the plate clean. Mista dell'Orto was okay, nothing outstanding. Table bread's okay. Crabcake is good. Cheesecake is so so, can't compare with cheesecake factory. Service was decent. But this place seems overpriced for the food though.
