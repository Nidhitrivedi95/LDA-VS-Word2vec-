-httBl6DSZiUtDX4SQWtag Pizza is 4 star.smoky.hearty toppings but disappointed with the rest-lasagna was below average.
Brought the table next to ours breadsticks but not to us???not sure why.it was not on the menu so it was definitely not ordered.
Drop by for a pizza if u like but otherwise nothing special.honestly there are much better options downtown which is 5 mins drive from here.
