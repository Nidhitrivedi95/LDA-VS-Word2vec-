4nLqlBBt6jcvphkIQxz0gQ We came in for dinner. We were seated in the middle of the floor at a table, near an open and clean booth. The bread was dry and bland. Salad had barely any dressing. Waiter forgot wine until after he brought out entrees and was reminded. I ordered lobster ravioli which comes with shrimp. The shrimp was delicious. I found a lobster shell in the ravioli. My boyfriend ordered chicken Alfredo which was incredibly bland. Honestly, I would say Olive Garden is better than this restaurant. This was not at all what I expected for the price. Too expensive for sub par food and service. It wasn't dirty, or anything terrible.
