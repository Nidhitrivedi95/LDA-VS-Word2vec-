Recently came here with a group celebrating some special visitors in town. Absolutely remarkable service. Our table was in a small room to the right of the main dining room and overlooked the Bellagio fountains. The view was gorgeous.

The owner of Circo, Mario, sent us over a bottle of prosecco and it was a wonderful apertif to start our meal.

Two people in our group opted for the prix fix menu (I believe it was $85/person) and that contained five courses.

The remainder of our table ordered off the regular menu:

-caprese salad
-dozen oysters (delicious!)
-duck panzotti (little triangle raviolis)
-mushroom risotto
-lamb chop
-filet mignon
-sea bass (one of the specials for the evening)
-pappardelle with sausage (my selection, yummmo)

Everyone loved the food. We also had several bottles of chianti. It paired wonderfully.

To end the meal, Mario sent over a selection of desserts:

-tiramisu (my favorite of all the desserts)
-creme brulee
-pannacotta
-pineapple mango souffle
-assorted fruits

Dinner took us around 3.5 hours. It was leisurely, enjoyable and delicious. I will definitely come back to Circo for a special dinner out and of course thank you to Mario for making our evening so special!
