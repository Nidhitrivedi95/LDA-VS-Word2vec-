oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw Fantastic service and food!!  We started with their Salumi plate & cheese which had a great burrata cheese and plenty of prosciutto to share.  

For dinner we shared a minestrone soup and bolognese pasta which had the best sauce full of flavor.  Soup had a lot of veggies but still very balanced with great depth.  

I really enjoyed the strawberry sparkling drink with interesting dried strawberry garnish.

The restaurant seems low key inside the Mandalay Bay which is a nice option before the MJ Cirque show.

Only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is the price is expensive even for Vegas standards.
