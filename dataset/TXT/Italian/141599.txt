JogUSDKa1xyG3lLEmD4Xjg I thought the food was very well made and authentic.  The family that owns it are from Tuscany (maybe via NY) but the menu has popular dishes from all over Italy.  There were not very many vegeterian options. There is always a  special ravioli of the day.  I ordered the penne bizanne and and the fennel and orange salad. the salad was good and the taste of the penne was delicious.  It was a little too al dente for my taste but the flavors were simple.  We sat on the patio out side and had very attentive service.  Not the best outdoor ambiance since it overlooks the parking lot.
