yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg We went there during the summer time which is like and off season for that side of town. The ambiance is just horrible there. Its too dark and the color scheme is bad. The food is literally nasty and is way overpriced. I don't even remember who waited on us because they were never around to ask how was the food or a refill.  This place needs to get Chef Gordon Ramsey to help them out. LOL!
