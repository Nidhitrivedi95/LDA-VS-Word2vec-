Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA the food was average.  nothing horrible, but definitley nothing great.  our waiter was the worst waiter i have ever had.  we were served bread right away.  but no water to go with the bread.  after sitting there for 20 minutes, he finally came over to take our order.  20 minutes was extemely long since he only had one other table.  he didn't write any of the order down.  so, of course, my salad that came out was not the salad that i ordered.  he then came out and asked me again what i had ordered.  horrible service.  i would never go here again.
