jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg We've been to Buco twice, and each time it's been a pleasurable outing. We love all of the entrees we've tried, and especially fond of the Apple Gogonzola salad.  God, it's good!   The service has been very good, and the place has a very comfortable ambiance.  I noticed a couple of negative reviews, but we've enjoyed it so much, I'm very surprised.
