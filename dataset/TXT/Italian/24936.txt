We had a party of six and I suggest you make reservations because on the Tuesday at 5 o'clock there was a line out the door. Luckily we did make reservations and it made everything a lot easier for everyone. 

We had quite a few different dishes. The kids meals were simple with mac & cheese, with a gluten-free option. Bonus. I have the spicy Alfredo with sausage and it was good. We also had the Amy's lasagna which no leftovers were brought home. Apparently Monday and Tuesday nights are spaghetti and meatball nights at $5.99 a serving which seem like an amazing deal. I also had the house Cabernet which was perfect with my spicy dinner.

We visit this area often and will be returning in the future
