klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw Our servers name was lina. She was super attentive very knowledgeable on the menu and she gave us complementary pretzels.  Home made they were super tasty.  I had the fish and chips and my wife had the summer bbq plate. Mine was good but hers came with this cute container of delicious bbq sauce. It had the best brisket I've ever had it also came with 2 sausage 3 ribs corn. Jalpanio corn bread and Cole slaw. I really recommend this place.
