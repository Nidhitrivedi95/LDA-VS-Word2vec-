N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg Charlotte from the restaurant sent the attached message to me on Yelp. This was a poor attempt to apologize using a canned message with a offer of a free meal to customers. I'm not trying to get a free meal and did not except the offer. I just wanted to know if I could do something else so I would not have to wait as long if I wanted to order a pizza from here again. She did not respond to my question.
