wp5FAtCGMyU2RnQ-7kxKHQ We heard about this place a few weeks ago and decided to gather with some friends there tonight for dinner and drinks.  We were pleased to see they have an extensive menu that includes just about any Italian dish you could ever want.  There's a great roomy bar with over 30 beers on tap!  I had veal parm and it was absolutely delicious!  Everyone at the table commented how good their food was and that the portions were enormous.  The staff was very friendly and engaging.  The hostess, Tammy, was particularly accommodating when we arrived a little earlier than the rest of the crew.  It was a nice personal touch when Justin, the chef, visited our table to check how our meals were.  Our server, Kenya, did a great job making sure we were taken care of.  She had a nice friendly approach.  All in all, we had a great night out with awesome friends and enjoyed some really good food.  We will be back!
