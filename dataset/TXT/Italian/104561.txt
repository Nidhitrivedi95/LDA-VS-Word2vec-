fOKeVUHC7nb6c8G5sILdHQ When Tony's first opened by my house, it was amazing!!! We had no thin crust, real New York style pizza place. The sauce is good and tangy, the slices are huge, there's just nothing special about the place. Lately (for the past few years) it seems like they're not baking the pizza all the way or something. The pepperoni are never crisp, the crust is kind of pasty and chewy, and the cheese doesn't really get golden brown anymore. It's a descent pie, I think they can do better. They do have pretty good sub sandwiches, fresh salads, and garlic knots that smell amazing when hot out the oven! The offer pizza by the slice but only cheese and pepperoni. I've never been sure of why they can't just throw a couple of toppings on top of an already baked pie and throw it in the oven. They can charge extra! When I order a slice, I usually have to take it home to warm it up or brown it to get the crust crisp. The wings they offer are tasty and spicy even though their just frozen wings, they're not bad. Tony's doesn't have any competition too close by (when I go it's for convience), they're lucky in that sense. And, they close very early on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. If it's after 10pm and you want pizza, don't call Tony's. They serve beer and wine, maybe they should add a tv or two where people can hang a little and enjoy the pizza. It can be quiet and your only option is to look out the window, if you go alone lol.
