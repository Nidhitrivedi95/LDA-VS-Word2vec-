MtvN8vMiKcLkkz_tCvBx3g It was a little "stuffy" in here but the service was great as well as the atmosphere.  We only had one app and sat at the bar for a drink.  I would positively suggest trying the place out but try and dress up a little..  We had the meatball app and every bite was delightful.. Try it out.  

It's also located very close to the Epicenter so you are close to all the action..
