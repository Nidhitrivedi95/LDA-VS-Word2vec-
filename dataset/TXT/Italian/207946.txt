QNCLibxXF1GlOEV-fKzUpQ The 3 stars are based only on the fact that I came here for lunch, If it was for dinner I am sure I will give this place 5 stars
The service is amazing and the food is perfect. I started working near this restaurant. When I first started the job I really thought I was going to starve to death. I come from downtown and the area is relatively secluded with very few if any place around.
This restaurant was a pleasant surprise.
The inly comment i have is, since they are open in a corporate part of the city. a lunch menu would come in handy. smaller portion , faster service and lower prices. 
The price is worth it 100% but it is not affordable for a lunch during work. $18 for a spaghetti meat balls is the price at a prime restaurant downtown for dinner. paying it for lunch in Vaughn is not something i can justify
