hcHaWzM5wfdAbCWs4zmmqg This place is a hidden gem (not so hidden) but for some reason I did not hear about it for far too long. Starting off with the olive oil- I knew it was going to be a good meal as soon as I tasted the olive oil-WOW. I ordered the margarita pizza, and two pastas and loved them both. Shout out to the rigatoni with smoked mozarella- one of the best pastas I've ever had. The portions were big (which I find to be rare these days) and the service was great. Have already returned twice, and cannot stop recommending it.  Looking forward to trying the gnocchi on my next visit!
