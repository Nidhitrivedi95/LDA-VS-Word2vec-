SNJi8rgm_YUX2_iOcfDycw I have been here several times before and always been happy with the place. the food is always been good and the service was good as well. this time I place a take out order at 830 at night on a Saturday I get there at 9pm and the order is incorrect. they didn't put the sausage on the whole pizza. they had no problem charging me for the topping on the whole.pizza though. Their solution was to tell me that they would just get it done in 2 minutes. I don't understand how my pizza took close to half an hour to make but that they tell me that they can have it done in 2 minutes now correctly? their solution was to throw sausage that looked under cooked to me on an already cooked pizza and to them, that was going to be acceptable? so when the pizza came out with what looked to me like undercooked sausage on it witg a burnt crust, surprise when I didn't want to eat that. the server asked me what was wrong with it like I was crazy. I would definitely pass on this place there are tons of pizza places to go to around here that are far better and don't put what looked to me like undercooked sausage on an already cooked pizza? their prices are way high for the product they delivered. I will not be giving them anymore of my business.
