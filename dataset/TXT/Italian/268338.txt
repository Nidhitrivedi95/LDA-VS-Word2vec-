xhCiQt_-pMp1nKDXZ7n7BQ Went here for the first time and for the most part I am impressed. There are a few things that they should consider in order to elevate their food. We ordered bruschetta to start. It was mediocre. By adding some feta and some balsamic drizzle to the top it would have elevated the taste. The canadese pizza was really delicious. For dessert, we had a dessert pizza with cinnamon apples on top. It was good but could be elevated by adding a caramel drizzle to the top. We did order wine and thought that their choice of wine glasses need updating. They only seem to have one type of one glass which doesn't necessarily work with every type of wine served. They should invest in wider base wine glasses. Overall I would recommend. Hopefully these recommendations will be taken to heart.
