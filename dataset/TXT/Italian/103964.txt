FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Love Postinos. 
Decent selection of wines, great food - especially the Bruschetta which is hands-down my favorite in town...and it's a lively fun place to hang out. Great for lunch, happy hour, dinner or late night. 
The only thing that is not great is the parking - I hate being forced to valet.
