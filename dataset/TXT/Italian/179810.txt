nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Herb bread has a very strong flavor. Lots of herbs. Their cheeses on the adult Mac n cheese is out of this world. There is ham an peas in it. I am a vegetarian so I was surprised that there was ham bits in the Mac n cheese. Salad was very fresh and dressing definitely homemade. Spaghetti bolognes was a very generous portion and tastes of Italy! Excellent ambiance!
