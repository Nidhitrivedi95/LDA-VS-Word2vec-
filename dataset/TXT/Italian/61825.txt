azE1DNVQFBU8boVbaJhj7w I went to lidia's for a nice meal before a show downtown. I think if the pasta trio has options you like, this is a great choice. However, if you aren't a fan of those you will definitely be able to find something, but it isn't exactly what I was hoping for. I got the manicotti which was fine but not great. The prices are a little much and I think that you can get the same sort of food much cheaper at another popular Italian restaurant. You can call a couple hours ahead to find out about the trio options, which I think is a good idea. If you don't like those however recommend going somewhere else and saving your money.  It is also frustrating that you don't get any salad or any sort of side with your pasta entrees.
