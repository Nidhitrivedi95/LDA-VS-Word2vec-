LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA It is kind to call this restaurant marginally mediocre. It is 1 small step above a tourist trap. Why? Let me count some of the ways. No wine list on being seated. Feeling of perpetual movement and panic. Our server was more than adequate but I'll bet he was the best. Food is really nothing. Everything is drowned in a sauce of some kind. Cheese on the table in a jar, so I ask for fresh cheese and get some more shredded cheese in a glass. Class is not available in this place unless it is none.  Saltimbocca is on the menu as Chicken. So, I call ahead to get a veal Saltimbocca. They have no idea what a Saltimbocca is. Sounds more like a Veal Marsala.that they serve.. I ordered a baked Ziti, figured what could they do to pasta. Well, the Ziti was not baked. Just regular Ziti drowned in something. Edible but not what I go out for. I do wish restaurants and others would stop putting names on menus that have no relationship to what they serve. I also wish the public had more respect for itself and did not rave about bad restaurants like this one. Well, at least it's terribly overpriced so I knew I was in Vegas.
