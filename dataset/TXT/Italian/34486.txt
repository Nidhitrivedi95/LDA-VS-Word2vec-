6D4L8YpkhAh_YwaLmhoMNg We ate in the bar.  Food was great but service was even better.  Our waitress/bartender  (Holly) was amazing.  Had the chef make us something to order based upon my request. Also extended happy hour to make sure we got another glass of wine with our dinner at happy hour prices. Thanks Holly.
