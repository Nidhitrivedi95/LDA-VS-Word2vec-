w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg I've always been a fan of 'THE' Olive Garden, yes you have to say THE OLIVE GARDEN.  I've ordered take-out from this location and also have picked numerous UBEReats orders from this location as well.  Well, I finally sat down for my own personal eatery visit.  I love the staff at this location, always nice, very clean, fast service, servers know the menu and can describe the entrees available.  That's always a plus to me.

Special treat for me and my team, Team Lunch - OG Style.  OK, so you have to try the Spicy Calabrian Chicken sandwich.  Spicy chicken tenders sandwiched between those DELICIOUS breadsticks. O-M-G, so good, so tender and to my surprise a little heat.  Yes, I know it a SPICY Calabrian Chicken sandwich, but restaurants usually fall short of "SPICE".  Well not this time, it had KICK to it.  Accompanied with fries and endless salad and breadsticks...just take the breadsticks home to the kiddos, your sandwich is a breadstick.  And it's free, who turns down FREE breadsticks...say WHAT, say HUH? You better take those breadsticks home.

This location gets super busy Fri-Sun night, you WILL wait.  Go for lunch, if you get there by 11:30a you will be seated and eating your 1st plate of salad by 11:45a.  

But this is just my opinion, you check it out...
