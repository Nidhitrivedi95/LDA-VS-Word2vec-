N8ArHOgRDI8wOJIOZaEHyg This Olive Garden is just like every other Olive Garden - standard and awesome.  I am the first person to claim they hate chain restaurants, and proudly, but I must confess...The Olive Garden is a guilty pleasure.  It's pretty reasonable, as is any chain, and I always wind up with too much food and a food coma to show for it.
