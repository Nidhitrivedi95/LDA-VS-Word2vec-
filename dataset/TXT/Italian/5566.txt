_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw We went here for the first time last night for a friend's birthday party and left feeling so disappointed. The food was terrible but the service was great. My husband had the lasagna and he had me take a bite. It was worse than what comes out of a can. It was limp and flavorless. I ordered the basciola pizza and the mushrooms were so slimy I almost gagged. Again, no flavor! The croutons in my salad were the best part of the meal and yet the salad was lacking. Sorry to say but we won't be back
