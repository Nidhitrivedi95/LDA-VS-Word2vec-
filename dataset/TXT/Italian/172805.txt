n8fGqb4CCheGyWtr9KM6qw I found this restaurant only through online research and selected it based on reviews here.  It did not let us down!  We took our large group when we were all in town for our annual spring training vacation.  Roma Garden accommodated us in a private, yet festive area.  The service was helpful, knowledgeable and very attentive.  Food was delicious and the Amaretto after-dinner drink was a great addition.  The prices are very reasonable.  All 14 of us had a great time, and it is hard to please all of us.  Highly recommended!
