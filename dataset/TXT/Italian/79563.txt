d1_Ko1DQ4QyB9BjnCFjVLw I have eaten here twice now , you get a free appetizer for checking in here. I ordered the full size veal picatta and the veal parmigiana, the portion size is amazing to say the least , I can easily get 3 meals out of this, and it was very good. My companion orders the lasagna and a couple meat balls on the side and he really enjoys his dinners as well. We got a free order of bruschetta , and the tomatoes were very fresh . Has always been a pleasant dining experience . And good  to very good service , will be back again.
