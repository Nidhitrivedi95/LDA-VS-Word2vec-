As a person who has never tried Greek food outside of trying it at this restaurant (thus having nothing to compare it to), I would still say that this place has delicious foods! I was vegan for a year and eating out with others was very difficult for me, but this place has so many great options for vegans! I usually get the lentil soup and they always ask if I want the cheese off, knowing that it is a vegan dish. :) I also get the hummus and pita bread and its so good! I usually get the trio with my family. The warm pita paired with the zesty-tangy hummus makes my mouth so happy! 

The atmosphere is nice and definitely a good restaurant to try out if you are in the mood for Greek or something different from fast food. (Some dishes may be a little "sour" for people if you are sensitive to Greek yogurt, dill, or lemon. Just order a more savory dish if you don't like lemon.)
