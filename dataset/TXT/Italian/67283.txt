bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg Service was great, thin crust pizza awesome and good red wine for $8 per glass.  One pizza feeds one person for 13-20 cost range plus drinks and a salad or appetizer.  The creamy mozzarella plus pesto was excellent and enough for two to share for $11.  Food quality, service and atmosphere are far superior than a Pizza Hut or typical pizza place and yes you pay more!  I would recommend to them a kids pricing menu with games for $5 range and a family feeds four couple of pizzas and salads and appetizers for around $40.
