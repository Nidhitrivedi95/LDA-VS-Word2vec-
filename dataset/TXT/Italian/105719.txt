fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I came here on Sunday for lunch with a craving for ramen. Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe was bustling and fully packed with customers which was a good sign for the business. 

I ordered the Char Su Ramen and thought it was a solid okay. The broth wasn't hot and the noodles tasted like it was pre-packaged. I may be somewhat a ramen snob because I had ramen in Japan, SF and NY so if you're a ramen connoisseur, I would recommend getting something different off the menu.
