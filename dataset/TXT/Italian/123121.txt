hj051yfX6Op81zZUvoZUfw I rarely give 5 stars but this place deserves it. We love the atmosphere dark and just nicely decorated. Also, on open table you can reserve seating anywhere in the restaurant including the bar itself and the bar area which is awesome.  The wine menu is very unique and outstanding. We werent sure on most of the bottles and then John the asst gm came over and went over and beyond to help us find the perfect bottle. Me being Italian i am veryyyyyy picky about my Italian food and this place is incredible. Chef, keep putting out high quality dishes like that and you will habe the best place in Charlotte. All pastas are home made, they have small plates which are incredible.  We ate there last night and we are going again tonight.  Our new favorite restaurant in Charlotte.
