zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g First of all, this place is waaayy overpriced.  Two pizzas, an appetizer, and 4 drinks cost $107!  That's ridiculous.  That includes $12 for a French martini, a very basic drink, made incorrectly.

 The round New York style truffle pizza was very good and the meatball appetizer lollipop style was amazing.  Their tomato sauce is very good.  However, the square di faro special was really nothing special.  Like another reviewer stated, it's just pizza on a thick focaccia bread.  Although I paid $6 extra to add sausage, meatballs, and garlic, the toppings on the pizza were sparse.  Every bite should have at least one topping on it and this pizza did not.  To make matters worse, we were seated at a dirty table.  When I requested a knife, I was given a very dirty one with dried sauce all over.  Grimaldi's is still my first choice for pizza.
