NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ I'm not an Italian food fan, but I liked it. We came with a large party and the food was lavish. Service was great and it was like we were a part of their family. Service was personalized and I felt like that's the way a small family restaurant should be.  The garlic knots, pizzas and lasagna were excellent. I would skip the seafood pasta next time. Just a little too fishy for my taste. Save room for zeppoles, these are amazing.
