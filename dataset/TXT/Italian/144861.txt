k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ The Parlor is one of my new favorite places to eat.  I've been there a handful of times now and have no complaints to speak of.

The pizza are great with unique topping combinations and really good crust.  Their salads are also top notch - the Parlor Insalada is especially diggable.

The stone and wood decor creates a great dining environment and the staff is always outgoing and friendly.

I'm impressed on every visit.
