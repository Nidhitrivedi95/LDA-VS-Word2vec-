yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg What a nice little restaurant.  Located right on Scottsdale Road in Old Town, this location offers a nice little Italian opportunity. 

The restaurant reminds me very much like a neighborhood restaurant.  There were many at the bar that would appear to be regulars enjoying the happy hour and games on television.  But other seating options offer a nice choice from a quiet booth to window seating that looks out toward the street.  Although too hot to open the doors, I am sure that they would open them during cooler times. 

Meals included the Sea Bass with Spinach Ravioli.  Very good.  Other reviews comment that it melts in your mouth and they are correct.  My friend had the Veal Sorrentino which looked amazing.  Desserts are limited.  We had the Tiramisu and Chocolate Chip Cannoli, but very good. 

Wine list is limited, but the selection is good and pricing is very reasonable by the bottle. 

It will be slightly pricier than your chain restaurant, but it offered a very nice experieince for an extended evening meal and conversation.  Amazingly, it was not very busy and we were able to enjoy an extended dinner and conversation without feeling that we needed to rush out. 

Would recommend it and will definately keep it in mind for a nice change. 

4 Stars only because there really needs to be something special for me to award the 5th Star.  Probably just missed it tonight though!!
