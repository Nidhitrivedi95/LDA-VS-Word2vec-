pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw The pizza here is as good as it is in most fire pizza oven places I've been to in L.A.  I know most consider it the best in the country or the best in the world, and maybe it so for some reason, which is great but it only means that some people don't travel outside of Phoenix as often as they should.  Once again, the food was a solid good food so there is no issue there.  My only issue is the claim that it is the "best" - that I don't get. OK OK if I have to be super picky, I can also add that the cheese was on the stingy side = large patches of exposed tomato sauce were evident throughout the pie.

and the parking, hmm the parking - sucks.  Small parking lot, Valet only (which I don't like at all) + $3.00 for the "pleasure" - really? really?
