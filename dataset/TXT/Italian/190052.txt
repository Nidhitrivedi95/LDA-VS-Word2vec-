P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw MMMMM YUMMY. This is for sure one of my favorite pizza spots to enjoy a delicious and hearty pizza! I love the Guinea pie which is my favorite and I crave it a lot. They have yummy roasted garlic buns that are stuffed with garlic which are Amazing. The pepperoni and pineapple is really good as well. I always enjoy the food and atmosphere and I love tasty pizza and a blue moon with oranges. This is a great place to eat which is always in my dining out rotation!
