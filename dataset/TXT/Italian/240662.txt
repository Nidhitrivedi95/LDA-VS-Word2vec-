UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ After reading the reviews on Yelp, I decided to try this place last night. I placed a to-go order and when I got there to pick it up I was pleasantly surprised by how busy it was and how much it smelled like the little places we used to eat in Chicago. 

The good-

The hostess person who rung me up was extremely friendly and checked inside all my boxes before putting them in bags, to make sure my order was correct. I can't tell you how much I appreciate that. 
The delux steak sandwich was the BOMB. The steak was tender and plentiful and the veggies were just right.
The pasta salad is phenomenal. It doesn't seem to be much more than pasta, dressing, and cucumbers but it is DEEEElish. 
The pizza muffins~ Very good and not was I was expecting, although next time I will skip the sausage and ham combo and make my own. The dude ahead of my got bacon, onions and ground beef and I was wicked jealous. 

The Meh-

We ordered a kid's spaghetti, which was pretty straightforward. The portions seemed a bit small as another poster mentioned. Although I did not actually see a regular sized order of spaghetti, the kids meal was kinda meager. Although if you go on Wednesday when kids eat free, you couldn't complain. Incidentally, someone also said it is busy on Wednesdays because of this... Thursday was packed so I can't imagine what it would be like when free food is involved. 

The bad-

Meatball sub was a huge letdown. Meatballs were just little frozen generic subway-esque disappointments. 
The portions. That pasta salad was to die for but I only got a couple of bites of it, which made me sad. 

Overall, we're down to give this place another try. We definitely wanna try the pizza and antipasta.
