pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Love this place and try to come whenever I am in town.  The service is excellent and very attentive.  Had the antipasto salad and it was delicious. It is big enough for 3 people.  Had the veal Marsala and the veal was cooked perfectly.  My son had the lasagna and it was good as well.  My husband had the veal chop Parmesan and he thought it was adequate.  Will continue to visit when in town
