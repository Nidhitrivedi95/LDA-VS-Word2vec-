wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw Delicious Bruschettas, Great Wine & Beers and amazing customer service. Everyone here is very nice and helpful. I love the building and the area out back of the restaurant. Although I mostly come here to have drinks after work, I have eaten here a few times. The Bruschettas are all good and you get to pick 4 different ones. I have also been here for brunch. Great coffee and the I got the Yogurt, fruit and granola. It was very good and it's perfect if you're looking for a light breakfast on the weekend. Two thumbs up.
