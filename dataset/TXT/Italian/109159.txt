G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Reservation was made 3 weeks ago on open table for Christmas day. We got the best seat in the house. Service was very good. The food was good but not as great as the prices. Two good size scallops and risotto not quite the $32 price. Bacon wrapped dates were off. But the pizza and eggplant were good. The leaning tower was just ok.
