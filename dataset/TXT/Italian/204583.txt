qcmw9NdY-vAoU7En5uic1g We tried Jet's on a recommendation from friends. Ordered an Italian sub (hot) and a Steak and cheese boat to be delivered (2 blocks away).  Well we should have picked it up. Delivery charge was $3.00? WHAT! Sub was toasted but cold, the tomatoes were sour, as in rotting, and was just a mess trying to eat. The steak thing was absolutely the most horrible tasting whatever it is ingredient laden swill to come out of an oven I have ever tasted. To sum it up I was so starved after waiting an hour to get it that I forced down the sub, but the other thing ended up in the garbage. The salad dressing that came with the sub was good though. all in all the worst $20.00 I ever spent. Maybe I should have just ordered pizza.
