wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw Are you Gluten Free?  Are you jonesing for some great bread?  IT'S HERE!  AND POSTINO'S IS ALL OVER THE VALLEY!!!!  Dog friendly too!  Oh yeah, my husband is a vegetarian...This means that me (the GF chick) and he (the no-meat guy) are difficult to please.  Not at Postino's though.  

Extra points for having craft beers and a good wine list!  

I love you Postino's  xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo
