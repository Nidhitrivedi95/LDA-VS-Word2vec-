POzMNUmUWFNDinWrspiBEA I wish I had paid attention to my fellow Yelpers when it came to delivery. As someone who has worn the shoes before, it is UNACCEPTABLE to get upset about a tip. You deliver the order wrong and get nasty when I tip accordingly? This place is a joke, at least the counter girl admitted that everything was frozen/premade when I called to complain. Save your funds and go elsewhere for food, the Taco Bell adjacent is a better bet.
