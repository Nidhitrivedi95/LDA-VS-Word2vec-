k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ We tried this place when I dropped my car off for service at a nearby dealership.  We figured it would be a decent spot for lunch, let me tell you we greatly underestimated this place (but now I estimate it, I guess)!

It is not fancy on the outside, in fact it is easy to miss.  It is also overshadowed in the neighborhood by the Camelback location of Pizza Bianco, but I find The Parlor every bit as good, without the wait and far cheaper.

This is thin and crispy pizza so don't count on the crust to absorb all the oils, they are front and center and allow the toppings to shine.  I would recommend getting one 'regular' topiing (pepperoni or thier excellent sausage) and one of their unique creations.

The prices are decent and the happy hour special makes it a steal.
