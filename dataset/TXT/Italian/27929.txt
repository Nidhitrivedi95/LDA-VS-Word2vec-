4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ Solid South Vegas Italian player located in a really good strip mall.  Service was 5 star even at lunch time.  Had the delicious veal Saltimbocca with prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella with the perfect al dente linguini.  Also ordered a lasagna that was good but not great.  Their red sauce was slightly off, needed more sweetness and spice of oregano and the top of lasagna should have been slightly burnt and crunchy to add that decadent texture to it that would have taken it over the top.  Overall good vibe there, lots of food passion, would dine there again.
