OXrFWgoz533T8tMRemkiww What a strange experience - I travel for business and walked in and asked to see the menu. The hostess wasn't very friendly & I tried to make light conversation about the weather... I'm in sales it always works. I thought she must not of heard me as she didn't respond? I then asked to be seated - the manager or owner no smile & without a word pointed to a table. I read through the menu, decided what I wanted, checked my email, then checked Facebook... when the waitress no smile, no greeting came over and asked if I wanted something to drink and seemed disappointed when I just asked for water. Terrible... I eat out almost every night of the week. The food may be good... It may even be great, but I can't get passed the not friendly part.
