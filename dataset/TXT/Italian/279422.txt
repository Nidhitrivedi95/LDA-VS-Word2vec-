yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w We were recommended this place by friends of ours who were taken here by friends of theirs who live in Vegas, keep up people it's not too complicated.
3 of us rolled in with a reservation and even though it was busy they sat us close to our time. Loved the concept of the menu and the minestrone soup was excellent, they dropped one red and one white wine on the table, the girls liked the red and the white was to my liking except I had to drop ice in it as it was room temperature, but since it kept flowing I didn't care.
Service was spot on and not intrusive and there was a nice break between the appetizers and main course that allowed the garlic bread (which felt like it was made right in the back) and soup/salad to works its way in a downward direction so that you didn't feel like you had to rush to eat because they wanted your table and your money. 
Chicken parm was goooooood, not typically oversized like you find in so many restaurants these days, normal people eat normal meals for one person not 5. Not everything in life needs to be supersized and I think they've found that balance.
I'll be back in Vegas in February and will definitely be returning, for the menu and the cost you really can't beat it.
