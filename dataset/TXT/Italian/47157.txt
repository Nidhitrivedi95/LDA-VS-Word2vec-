8xrwjD-Udv7cm_emVcVo3A I ate here this past Thursday before a show with a dining companion.  Upon walking into the restaurant there is not too much to notice except for the area where they cook and some old booths against a wall.  A closer inspection of the wall will show some nice Pittsburgh sports memorabilia though.

For our pizza my dining companion and I decided upon the plain extra large cheese pizza.  The extra large pizza is a 18" pizza which may seem a bit much for two people but we easily gobbled it all up since it tasted so good.  What makes the Giovanni's pizza incredibly good is the sauce.  It could be described as slightly sweet but is really something that should be tasted instead of described.  The cheese is also satisfactory and the crust is thin but good.  I have been to Giovanni's many times before and it has never disappointed.  The only thing that is frustrating is having to sit and stare at it while the cheese cools down as it will otherwise not stay on the piece.

The bottom line for me is that the pizza is fantastic and even though it is not much to look at, I will be back here again many times in the future as I would consider this the best pizza in the city.
