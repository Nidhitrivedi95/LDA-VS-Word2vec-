MJpn_jUivKSgTtjNon63hA Great place Stopped here one night right before the closed and order a thin crust pizza, half pep and half Hawaii! The pizza tasted great and the service was very friendly!! The original post about unfriendly people is probably just on bad experience definitely come give this place a try!
