Kz4WS00PcqOJgxfZawk4dQ So, after two carry-outs and now dining in I'm due for a review. The pizza is pretty good, thin crust, brick-oven baked. I've had the margarita and the smoked salmon. Both were quite delicious. Drink prices were quite good as well, other than the wine. But I can't say I've found a place with wine prices I've liked. When you check in at this joint Yelp is going to give you a $10 discount on your tab. But, they won't honor it, therefore they lose another star!
