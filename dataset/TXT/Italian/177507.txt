nO7BvciHvf3xWXsTHienVQ Best slice in GTA! Just like NYC. The crust is super thin and crispy with a good chewy consistency. It's almost flakey too! Whole pizzas here are great too but not as good as the slices. 

Owner is super nice and remembers who you are. The only problem is that he's not open more often.
