jeTfL2kCyBtmFGSrSQHqVw Food was excellent but did not have a great experience with waitress. Table of 8, we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings.  Wine came out about 10 min after our food on a few courses which left us unable to experience the "pairing" as you should. We politely and discreetly asked her to bring wine out with or right before food and I think that ticked her 
off. After that, she was aloof, barely explained the wine or the dishes we were being served. Water was slow to be refilled. The real kicker was the 20% automatic gratuity she added after tax on our bill! When we asked to speak to the manager, she told us " he's busy dining with a client". Say what??? I believe your customers are your priority! We asked a different waiter to see if he could find the manager and low and behold, out he came!  Tainted our experience and maybe our waitress was just having a bad day but when you are dropping that kind of money on dinner- you had better train your wait staff on how to properly serve and deal with customers.  It was a shame because from the chef end- he did a great job of making delicious and interesting food- it's just too bad no one explained it well or delivered it professionally.

Just wanted to post an update. We received a very kind letter from owner/ manager apologizing for our experience and gave us a generous gift certificate to try them again.  We definitely will give them another chance. Again- the food is amazing and we want to see them succeed.
