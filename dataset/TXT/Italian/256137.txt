After a few visits here, I've realized that between the waiters that take your order and the runners that bring your food, the runners are by far more helpful. So much so that my friends and I cut the tip short so we can tip the runner in cash. 

The interior itself is not impressive. Some of the chairs are shaky and the decor is not very well thought out. The dim lighting helps to lessen the mediocrity. Would not come here if trying to impress.
