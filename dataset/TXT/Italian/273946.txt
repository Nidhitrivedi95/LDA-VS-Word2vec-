Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A This buffet is on my top list of Las Vegas buffets. It's almost about the same position as Wicked Spoon. Probably people will think I'm crazy, but hear me out. 

The price of the buffet can't be beat. $19.99 for dinner and you get unlimited beer & wine. If you signed up with The Palms' player club, you will get $7 off your buffet price. If you don't want to sign up for anything, they always have offer for it on Restaurant.com . 

The food is so good and cater more to Asian  side. Their cold Crab legs are fresh. Their hot Crabs in Oyster Sauce (too die for!) tasted like how it is in Jakarta. They also have Kahlua Pork and some other Hawaiian dishes which not very common to find. 

The dessert station is pretty amazing. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. No stale cookies or pies here. 

You won't feel like a tourist here because most people who dine here are locals. They know what's good. I'm glad we made the cab trip to The Palms, now I can't wait to go back.
