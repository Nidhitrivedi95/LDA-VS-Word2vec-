a5l5JLVC0_lkz9QNOc5mHg The Search continues for the best pizza in Cleveland.
I ordered over the phone and gotta say I didn't speak to the brightest bulb in the pack.  When she called back to confirm the address, she asked for my phone number again.  Seriously?  Did you not just dial it?  Are you not speaking to me?  Again? 
I opted to pick it up in fear of the driver getting miserably lost.
Same basic pizza.  Cheese & Pepperoni.  
Outcome: we got good pizza.  Not enough cheese, pretty skimpy here.  Decent pie, just not fabulous.
Searching......
