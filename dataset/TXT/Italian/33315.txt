5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA Absolutely wonderful. We went there as a large party for our company's Christmas party and the staff and food was wonderful. We may have caused a lot of noise during our white elephant gift exchange though, ha! Regardless, staff was super friendly. All the way from bread, shrimp appetizer, chicken alfredo, and variety of desserts, it was awesome. Great spot to grab some nice Italian food.
