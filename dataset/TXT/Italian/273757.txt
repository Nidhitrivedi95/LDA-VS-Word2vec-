Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A My group stayed at the Palms so we decided to try their buffet.

I was very surprised on how good some of the items were.  This buffet does not have a big selection of foods like other buffets.  The desserts aren't that great either.  But the meats that day and cooked perfectly.  The chicken and turkey were flavorful and moist.  The meat would just fall off the bone on the ribs.  

I went to the M buffet the next day.  I enjoyed this buffet at the Palms more than the buffet at the M.
