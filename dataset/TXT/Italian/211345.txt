qZZ8VU1Bk-xCruEAZNwm6A I didn't want to venture out far for dinner tonight. It was rainy and cold. I know that Matthew M has discerning tastes and I saw his review for Sainato's, so I made the call. The guy on the phone was a grouch. He could use a seminar on good customer service because he sounded pissed off as hell on the phone. I am usually a nice guy, and halfway through the call, I was also getting pissed in reciprocation. Angry energy multiples off the involved parties. He told me 30 minutes. I figured, Friday night, they are probably busy. I arrive at 30 minutes on the dot. It took 40 minutes total. I am glad I had nothing going on tonight. He seemed a little more polite when handing the pizza off. Maybe he had a rough day. My friend also commented on the dude being grumpy. I said "His pizza better make up for it". It really did. It is a thinner crust cooked in a pan in a classic deck oven. The sauce was nice and balanced, crust, cheese and peperoni were also good. It was really greasy and I needed to dab some of that up. This is way better than Edison's, Big Guys or anything in a few mile radius. I highly recommend this pizza if you live in Tremont, Ohio City, Downtown or the surrounding area.
