They have some spots blocked off out front for basically a "drive-in" type of scenario where you sit there until someone comes to take your order, etc.  The line is a lot faster now since everyone at any of the counter spots are ready and willing to take your order.

Couple things though, the sign also says exit only do not enter facing the other way (into the lot) which may cause some people to take it the wrong way.  The spots out front - at least half should be pick up and go spots where you can just park for a few minutes to get your food to go.  It's awkward to sit there for "full service"...  They offered me a bag this time which is great!  But that again helped me to forget about silverware and napkins...  It should be part of the process to offer silverware/napkins for obviously to-go orders.

They're slowly but surely making some changes in the right direction!  As I've said, I'm a huge fan of the salads and desserts so this really helps in my ability to incorporate this spot into my life!
