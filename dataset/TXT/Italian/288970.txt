ZSCEkqlzZKRrZUz98CXtNw I wasn't too impressed with their pad thai, it was more meh than anything. But then again, I really wasn't expecting anything authentic from Noodles & Company when it comes to Asian fare. I got the shrimp pad thai and there was some chicken in it--good for me, bad if I was a vegetarian. 

I dig that they offer two sizes of noodle  bowls to get and you can get protein added into your noodles but it's the same price across the board ($2.25 I believe) but  I would think it would be cheaper for tofu then steak. Super friendly employees with a quick turn around. I ordered my noodles to go, got a soda, sat down for a minute and bam-noodles were ready.
