vDEf2V-bvRLtwAh2nfkebQ My mom and I love this place.  The pizza and salads are great.  The variety of toppings allow for plenty of ideas.  They even have "gluten free" crust!  The service has a few kinks, they seem to be still working things out with their staff.  However, the Manager is a really nice guy and seems very interested in excellent customer service.  I wanted an Iced Coffee, but of course, they did not have it on the menu.  The Manager quickly offered to make me one, even brewing a brand new pot.  It was excellent!  I will be back and I only hope they have managed to train their service staff to be awesome.  Little on the pricey side, but I don't mind paying if I get excellent, top notch service.
