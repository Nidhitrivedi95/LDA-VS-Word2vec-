_qA2HPqgLiBc-M4wRyml0g Came in to meet friends on Friday night. The place is beautifully decorated,  and the oven is fun. However, for the look, they should have chosen a more appropriate music (walked in hearing Black Sabbath),  and the music was so loud we had a hard time hearing each other.
I started with the salad with the pickled onions and sweet balsamic vinaigrette and it was one of the best salads I've ever tasted! I so enjoyed it!
I ordered the fungi pizza. It came out too soon...I was still enjoying my salad. The mushrooms were tasty, but the dough was gooey in the middle. The edge crust was crispy and good. 
Once we paid the bill our server disappeared so it was impossible to ask for any more water.
Was I impressed? Eh. Will I come back? Perhaps...
