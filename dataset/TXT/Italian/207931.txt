qMyYUz_V9I-jor53xb3bMQ My husband and I had an extraordinary meal from start to finish! The happy hour was reasonably priced and very good with a lot of selections. Our server suggested a perfect glass of wine to go with our selections. We ended up having entrées (we had planned on only happy hour) because the menu had so many appealing choices. We plan to take our guests from out of town here in a few weeks! 

We would recommend the bar area if just having happy hour and the dining room if looking for a quiet, romantic evening meal.
