JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A 7 West was a really sweet grungy vibe. 3 floors and we were able to lounge under the closed balcony to enjoy our drinks and food. The vibe almost felt like a rustic cottage. All three of us chose various pizzas on the menu which were all BOMB. The drinks are a little pricey but they have a great variety of white wines. Really enjoyed my visit and will definitely be back! (24h too? AWESOME)
