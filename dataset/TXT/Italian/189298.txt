Oz4S6OoptmKAZfGBsa5x9g On a Sunday afternoon of a long weekend, the service was slow, potentially the slowest service I've ever had in my entire life's existence.

It took about 2 hours to order sandwiches for a group of 6. If you are in a rush, do not come to this place when service is non-existent.

Service aside, the food was pretty good. I had a vegetarian sandwich - the grilled vegetables were layered and very flavourful. For 11.95, you cannot go wrong.

The bread that they serve in the beginning comes with a side of olives. Best tasting olives.
