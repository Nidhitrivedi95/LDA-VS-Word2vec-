LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Second time here and first time to review. A friend of ours made dinner reservations for Sat evening by the window and within 10 mins of arrival, we were seated right above The Strip facing the Wynn. My recommendation is to bring 3 friends so you can order the "Family Style" meal on the back of the menu. There are three price points and we chose the $30.95/PP. You choose and everyone shares 2 salads, 2 appetizers, 2 pasta dishes, 2 entrees, and 2 deserts. And if you want more, just ask. It is AYCE. :)

My rating is for the "Family Style" experience.
