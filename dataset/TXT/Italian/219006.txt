S5deRiFlRPXdFFMGBGRE1g My husband and I just recently moved into the area and were looking for a great local restaurant. We found Belsito Trattoria from the yelp search and thought it looked fabulous and couldn't wait to try it out. Unfortunately I wouldn't be able to tell you how the food taste because no one ever came to take our order. 
The restaurant hours show that they close at 10pm and we walked in just before 9pm. While we were being seated a waitress stopped us to tell us that if we're planning to order food, the kitchen staff is closing the kitchen. I said if the Kitchen is closed then it's okay we'll come back another time and she said no but they're "closing real soon, REALLY SOON". We assured her that we will quickly look through the menu and order. We sat down and watched as the wait staff served everyone else for the next 15 minutes without looking over at our table.  We made the decision to leave at this point. The lack of service upon our arrival and then while we waited for our (rushed) order to be taken have left a negative impression of your restaurant - which is unfortunate considering we live down the street and would have love to come by often.

We walked a couple of doors down and went to another restaurant. That restaurant closed at 10pm as well but when we asked if they mind if we sit down for dinner they said "there's plenty of time" (what a difference in attitude).

My husband and I do enjoy going out to dinner and we read Yelp reviews on restaurants to understand the atmosphere and get an idea of what to expect. As you can see I don't write many Yelp reviews myself but I really do want others to understand what happened. Regardless how delicious your food might taste, your lack of service really cheapens the place.
