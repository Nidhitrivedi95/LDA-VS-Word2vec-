Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg I agree with Insider Pages, the staff is super rude for either dine-in or to-go, I guess I am not pretty enough or the right color. Beware of cashier 19. 
The manager is controlled by the staff. In this economy with those prices and that attitude: NO THANK YOU! Never again. 
Try DaVinci Pizza down the road, the owner takes pride in his pizza and the taste is almost as good for half the price.
