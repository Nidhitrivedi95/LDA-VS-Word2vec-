dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg Finally gave this a try for Lunch and answered the age old question, "where's the beef?"... the beef is clearly at Parma and it is in the Italian Beef sandwich. I would happily eat this every day and not be mad at myself when I gained a few hundred pounds.
Friendly service, nice atmosphere and great food! Can't beat that. We met up with Mario S. for lunch as he had not tried the food here yet either.
I can't speak for Mario, who ordered the Chicken Parm sandwich, but mine was awesome! By far the best Italian Beef sandwich I have ever had. The bread was perfect and they pack the sandwich with beef.
They had a special going where if you join their text mailing list, you get a free mini-cannoli. Yes please. We each got a mini-cannoli and they were about as good as they come. 
Took home a loaf of bread as well... it's pretty much gone already. Looking forward to more visits to Parma.
