qKButPdfAkVWBMM9oPMU4w Elio's is another reliable staple that appears to be close enough to Petite Italie, or Little Italy.  It's a little west of the main arteries and in a more gruff looking area, but it has been there a long time.  It came recommended.

As for whether or not it is authentically Italian, it is!  Interacting with the waiters will soon enough confirm that.  The other thing is that this is almost more of a pizzeria that happens to be an Italian restaurant, rather than the other way around.  That said, their Italian fare is respectable.  The main pasta dish itself was better than the accompaniments.  

As to why they're not getting a 4, it's for a couple of reasons.  The more a la carte nature of the menu kicked up the price a little more than was expected.  It wasn't overpriced but, collectively, it wasn't a good value, either.  Also, echoing what others have said, the service by the waiters wasn't the best and mirrored what you might see in southern Italy - brusque, punchy, humorous, casual, quick, and indifferent, making you wonder if they just got off the boat last week.

If in Petite Italie or thereabouts, I would default to Tre Marie, which is more of a restaurant than a pizzeria.  Having eaten at Tre Marie twice over the years, I still dream about it.  I hope they still make mouth watering meals.

Let me end with a quip about these guys, much like there was a quip about the Pope and sexual matters decades ago which went: "If he no play da game, he no make-a da rules."  For Elio's, I'd say, "If dey no watch-a da hockey, dey pay-a more attention and do a betta job."  But ok, I get it - "Go Canadiens!"
