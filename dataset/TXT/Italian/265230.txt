wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw I like their wine and food. That's why I give it 2 stars.  If you go there be prepared to wait for 1.5-2 hours on a weekend.  I went on a Tuesday night once and waited for an hour after they told me the wait would be about 35-45 minutes. Their website says they take reservations of 8 or more but when we called they said it had to be 10 or more and didn't seem to care what their website said. (This must have literally just changed because we were there with a group of 8 last week and had no problems getting a reservation)  I certainly don't mind waiting but with a large group I'd rather not.  I agree with another reviewer... They are getting the "we're so awesome we don't need customer service"  attitude and that has definitely turned this girl OFF!!!
