Nothing is wildly standout, but nothing is ever bad either. Really good portions (especially considering the area), super reasonable prices (tough to find ten dollar things around there) and really nice staff. 

They also have some interesting specials sometimes... I most recently had some kind of curry omelet that was definitely different, and I love that you can order half salad / half fries as a side for no extra cost.
