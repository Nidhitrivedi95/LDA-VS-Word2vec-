bCrMHwCLZzyKsAUOiAL0OA I've been coming here for years, and I feel like there has been a drop in quality. I still drop in from time to time, and have relatively good service, but the food has gone down a bit. Apart from a few misunderstandings with the workers (due to heavy accents or other reasons), they are generally helpful and nice. I still vastly prefer Rays to other pizza places, and would recommend it to others.
