eTmy0-h4tTEpfbDVAue0MA This is a pretty cool place, especially if you love Frank Sinatra! His music is often playing overhead and I love it!  

The sauce they make has a bit of a sweet flavor to it, but it works! They also make their own italian sausage and it's wonderful. The ravioli is quite tasty and the thin crust pizza with spinach, sausage, garlic and mushrooms is to die for!  I'm a true pizza snob because I generally only like Deep dish, Chicago Style Pizza from The Windy City, but this is a pleasant place for pizza!
