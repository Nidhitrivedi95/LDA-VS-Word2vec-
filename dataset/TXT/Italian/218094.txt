rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ Elements is an upscale, yet very personable establishment located at Rainbow and West Tropicana. I have been coming here the last few months with my senior at work for after hours drinks. 

The staff is excellent, I am most frequently served by Kevin and he always remembers my drink and is super friendly. They offer weekly specials ( IIRC) but the true gem of this place is the deserts. 

Jose & Katheryn are always bringing new ideas for desserts and will make you something special if you ask for it and most times for no reason at all. The deserts this place offers is truly SINFUL. You will not have a better desert this side of I-15/South of Summerlin PKWY.

The only reason I cant give this place 5 stars is that I have never actually eaten here on my own without my bosses around. I feel like I have to in order to be fair and truly unbiased. I hope to update this listing soon.
