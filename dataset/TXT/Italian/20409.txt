30TxDt2V8G7FWXsKaEKA9A We tried Marco Pizza in place of their neighbor which has been our long time favorite. However over time they have gone down hill and the search began for a replacement. We ordered a medium thin crust for pick up up and were told it would be ready in 12-13 minutes. Just long enough to drive over. The pizza was ready upon arrival. The crust was crisp and the cheese and sausage tasty and juicy. I think we have found a new go to pizza place. Sorry about that R you used to be great.
