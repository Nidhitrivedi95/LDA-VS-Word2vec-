yXiDD18UV49-7UhA6dWjAw All five of my stars are based on PIZZA. 
A group of us tried the wings once and I wasn't a fan. We also had the fried mozzarella and it was good but served in a few large pieces (which makes it kinda hard for sharing). But forget all that....I'm here to talk about pizza.

The pizza is so good! It is flavorful and a perfect NY pizza. Despite a recent move, we still drive across town once a month to get pizza from Giacomo's because no where else compares for us. The employees are always super friendly and welcoming. We normally do take out so I can't really speak to the dining in experience, but everyone seems very nice. I definitely recommend this place!
