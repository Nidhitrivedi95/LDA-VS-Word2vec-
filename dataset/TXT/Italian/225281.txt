It was a little busy and we didn't have a reservation, but luckily they had an open table for us. The ambiance feels very old school and cozy. It's a popular spot for visitors, but the service was still quite good.

We ordered Linguini Luciano and Gnocchi. Both dishes were very very good. Some of the best Italian food I've had in Vegas.

It does come at a price though. Expect to spend a little more than you would at Olive Garden.
