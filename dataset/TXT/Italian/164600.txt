Lzj-_QdzL2bLeHd_bC88Fg Went here for VDAY and loved the atmosphere.  Very cute place.  I had a special VDAY cocktail which had no price listed but I figured it'd be 8 or 9 dollars.  To my surprise it was $15 which was a bit ridiculous IMO.  As for food I had the wild mushroom ravioli and it was AMAZING.  The most tastiest pasta dish I've had in awhile.  Usually ravioli from Italian places consist of 5 pieces of ravioli but this plate had more than that which was great haha.  The warm flour-less chocolate cake for dessert was great as well, not as amazing as Terroni's but still delish!  

Great spot for a date :)
