lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ Had my first dinner in Vegas here and it was my late-night go-to throughout the rest of my stay at Mandalay Bay. From the specialty pizza to the pasta, garlic bread, and wings, everything was good... not AMAZING, but def good if you're looking for a reasonably priced menu of comfort foods. The take out was also a life saver for when I just wanted to relax in the hotel room for a bit!

Other than that, the ambiance is fun and if you're into that sort of the thing, they have plenty of vegan options!
