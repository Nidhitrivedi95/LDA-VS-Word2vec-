clL0-uy-DH0bJgBFEfoxFA As we were unable to eat at another restaurant in the same complex, my boyfriend and I decided to try out this location of Alice Fazoolis (loved the downtown location).  The service was HORRIBLE.  First, my table was sticky to the point where my sweater stuck and when I requested that it be wiped, I was sighed at.  It took awhile for our order to be taken, 15 mins to receive oil for dipping bread and the waitress actually cleared the tables besides ours and ignored us..

Not impressed.  Will not be going back.
