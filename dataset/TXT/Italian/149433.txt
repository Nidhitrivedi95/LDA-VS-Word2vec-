KiP4NjelCHqNAf36JxXUQQ The pizza was actually really good. A margherita pizza with an add of hot italian sausage.. Nice.. Went to pay with my AX card and the waiter keeps asking me if it's a debit or a credit?  I said neither, it's an AX card.  But the machine he says is asking if it's a debit or a credit. Soon he's standing at my table, the manager is standing at my table and I'm feeling like I just broke out of prison and stole a hot card.    BTW this is the same card they I used to get my rental car, check into the Westin here in Toronto, buy my meals all week....according to them it was not being accepted.  I threw down 25 loonies and left, pissed.  Kind of uncomfortable the whole restaurant watching this unfold as I was near the front entrance in open space.. btw I called AX, they said the charge was approved, nothing happening on their end..Not sure what this restaurants deal was..
