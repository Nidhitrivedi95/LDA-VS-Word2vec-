XPgurhZwZgNAwHcrpoe3Zg I went to Niccoli's on Thursday, July 3rd, 2014. We order 2 sandwhichs which we ate their, our sandwhichs were good. We also purchased a Jar of Hot cherry peppers , Imported parmaggina reggiano cheese, a package of pasta and our bill total was almost $80.00 . Well both my parents were Italian immigrants and homemade foods were a staple in our house. This is were my expierience went bad. The so called imported cheese was flavorless and it was the worse cheese I ever had and it costed  $27.00 for 3/4 0f a pound. What a descrase and what a rip off. The jar of peppers for almost $12.00 was tastless and already opened. I have never been so upset that people would purposly deseve hard working people out of their money a sell a infarior product and claim its something else. Shame on yo Niccoli's Deli. Maybe you can fool people who don't know better, but you can't fool a New Yorker who is born to 2 Italian immigrants. I will never go their again and would not reccomened that Deli to anyone.
