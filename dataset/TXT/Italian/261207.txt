WpZkK951tqHONywmKLmhQw Went on Sunday with a party of three at 5:30 pm. Told it would be a 30 min. Wait and we went outside to pass the time. After about 30 min. Hostess called our name for a party of two. We advised her that we were three people and she said we would have to wait longer for a larger table to open up. We were seated after 40 min. total. Ordered a thin crust pizza, rigatoni, and another entree which I can't remember. After waiting almost an hour, the rigatoni showed up by itself. The food runner had no idea about the rest of our order. ( why does a thin crust pizza take an hour to make?) At about 7:15, we decided to leave as we were really tired of waiting and things weren't looking good. Spoke to the manager on the way out.. no apology from her, no offer of a coupon to try and get us to come back again. If this place doesn't get their act together they aren't going to make it.
