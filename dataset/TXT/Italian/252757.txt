VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w we stayed at the venetian, and got comp passes and drink vouchers. didn't have to wait in line, and got served incredibly strong drinks even while paying with vouchers! nice!

the club itself is small, but nice. the decor is really neat, with cool fixtures in the bathroom. the water at the sink comes from above, making quite a splash but still pretty awesome! we went on a sunday night, with a group of nine.. the dance floor was packed, and the crowd was mixed, yet not the most attractive. lots of dudes. 

i had a great time simply because i got so many free drinks with the vouchers. ($50/suite, two suites = 6 top-shelf shots & 2 mixed drinks & a redbull) 

check this place out if simply to see the decor. could do without the mediocre music, and the "whatever" looking crowd. maybe it's better on a friday or saturday night?
