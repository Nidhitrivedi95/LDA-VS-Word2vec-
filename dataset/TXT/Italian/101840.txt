FDxnnImJ-Q0CXRwGVJ1gig My friends told me about this place and we finally tried it this past weekend.  They raved about the salads and they were right.

This is a great family restaurant.  I would describe it as a higher-end Pickle Barrel crossed with Me Va Me or some other Mediterranean-type of restaurant.  The portions are huge!  

As soon as we sat down, our waitress brought bread and dips (two eggplant and one humus) which were delicious (complimentary of course).

I ordered a Margarita.  It came in bowls-sized glass and was delicious (for $7).  It was probably twice as big as I would have received any most other restaurants in the City.  

We ordered the Mediterranean Grilled Vegetable Chicken Salad ($12) with avocado (the avocado was an extra charge).  It was enormous.  The chicken was grilled perfectly and was nicely seasoned.  The dressing was light and delicious.  I would have liked more grilled veggies but I am now being picky.  I couldn't have finished the entire salad anyway it was that big.  

We also shared the Whole Red Snapper ($20) which came on a sizzling place with salad (the side Caesar was delicious and the croutons were homemade and awesome) with sweet potato fries (also an extra charge but well worth it - they came with a large portion of spicy mayo for dipping).  The fish was nice but I would probably order the chicken Shish Kebab ($15) next time or the Rack of Lamb ($24) since other diners had ordered these dishes and they looked and smelled amazing.  The shish kebab came on two skewers and was huge!  

We were in a hurry and were too full to order any desserts this time but I think they are probably huge as well.

We are very much looking forward to our next experience at this restaurant.  I would highly recommend it.
