zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA This was my first time at this local Italian restaurant.  When you walk in there are a lot of things for sale, tshirts, jewelry, etc, which I find lessened my impression of the place.  The rest of the restaurant was nice but when you get seated on folding chairs, again, I am not impressed.  When the bread basket was placed on the table, the bread was hot and full of herbs and butter, and was very tasty.  The Italian Wedding Soup however was bland and needed salt.  The main entrees came out and although it was good, it wasnt great, everything was bland.
