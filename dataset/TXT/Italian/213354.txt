R5SvHm0lJf3hlI9R-TTyAQ It's kind of a hybrid between Italian and American styled food. The interior is nice looking place with a bar, high tables, low tables and a deli-style counter towards the back. I had the grilled fish sandwich ($10 + tax) and it came with a small pasta side dish and (homemade?) potato chips. The sandwich was pretty good and had a nice sauce to go with it. The best part of the meal was the pasta side dish. It is hard to describe but it was cold white pasta shells in a vinegary type dressing. The chips tasted like potato chips except they were moist in grease as if they had been freshly cooked. They seemed to negate my healthy fish meal, however.

Average lunch prices appear to be about $12. It gets pretty crowded at lunch.
