8pmGz3Lg4f_r7HdDZPa4dQ Best pizza I have had!!! We ordered an 18inch pizza, wings, and garlic cheese bread. The garlic bread came out with some marinara sauce. I usually do not like marinara but this... is OMG!! It's fresh. You can see the pieces of garlic inside the sauce. We ordered mild wings. They were perfection! Wings were crispy and the sauce was delicious. It wasn't over overwhelming it was just right. The pizza was next and I was floored. So delicious. They made us feel at home and a part of their family. I can tell the owner takes great pride in this food because it is so good.
