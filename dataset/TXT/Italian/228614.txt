swzPeunsKkTX1iGybOIRFw I came here the other night for dinner and was not disappointed, but not incredibly impressed either. The meal starts with complimentary foccacia with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping which was very good. For an appetizer I got the carpaccio with arugula salad  and truffle olive oil. That I was impressed with - the meat was incredibly tender and the flavour from the oil complimented it very nicely. Best carpaccio I've had.
For the entree I ordered a special which was orange roughy with a mushroom sauce. This was quite good, but I was not a fan of the texture of the fish as it was a bit mushy. However I have not had orange roughy before, so maybe that's just how the fish is. I tried a bit of the whole grilled sea bass, and I found that to be much better than my dish.
Service was great, they were friendly, helpful, and not as slow as I expected for how busy it was and the fact that they were short two waiters that night.  As for cost, it was a little pricey, $135 plus tip for one appetizer, three entrees, some mineral water, pop, and cappuccino - not quite worth it, but not a complete rip-off either. I''ll be sure to return and  try other appetizers and entrees to see how their other dishes are.
