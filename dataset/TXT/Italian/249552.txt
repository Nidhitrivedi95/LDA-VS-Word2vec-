VjaHHmV-rSkFaOAnU3faxg LOVE LOVE LOVE Sal's pizza. It's the best,  not greasy but flavorful and unique options (at least to us). Our favorite is the Fat Uncle Tony or the Underground Meats, we also love to add their caramelized onions, they are just SOO yummy. We've been going to the Sun Prairie location since they opened, haven't tried Johnson St yet.
