9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg Great place! Went on a Wednesday night with a coworker as we were in Toronto for work. Didnt know where to go for dinner so took it to yelp and thats how we ended up there. Overall its a great place. Awesome food, and great atmosphere. 

We got there at around 8:30pm and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table which was disappointing but were able to find spots at the bar and ordered some drinks. When our table was ready we got a text and got seated right away. 

Our waitress was amazing! Everything that she recommended was great and she even recommended other restaurants in the area for later in the week and things to do over the weekend. We had the prosciutto mozzarella which was amazing! Then I had the meatball with spaghetti which was the best meatball I've ever had!! My coworker had the butcher pizza which he said was really good and looked amazing. 

The portions are definitely generous. I had so much left but couldnt take it to go cause the hotel didnt have a fridge in the room. For dessert I had the zeppole which is like some doughnuts with a nutella like spread. It was delicious!

I took a star out because even thought our server was awesome we did have to wait quite a bit in between our meal and dessert and then for the check. It seemed like she was very busy. I definitely recommend this place if you are not in a hurry and are looking for something homemade and delicious.
