LXheNwqZPoXuXNNeP1sNew Awesome pizza place! Love the ambiance and pizza and salad options. Staff are really pleasant. The strawberry and gorgonzola salad has wonderful strong flavors. I had the clam pizza with roasted red peppers. It's the perfect pizza for summer. It's finished off with a fresh squeeze of lemon on top and minced parsley. I've had clam pizza before, but the combination of the red peppers really brightens up the dish and gives the perfect amount of acid and sweetness to balance the clam meat and lemon. I tried the lunch at the Thunderbird location - for $10, you can pick any of the salads from their menu and any of their pizzas (9")! Can't beat that deal. The pizza crust is light, thin and crispy. They also gave us an honors card where you can earn points toward a free lunch deal after about 7 purchases.
