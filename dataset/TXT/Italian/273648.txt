Y_SKyssv8ClQ_p25lCsbAQ Nice little family run place with good food. They are a BYOB with no corkage fee which is nice!
The atmosphere is nice in a remodeled early 1900's building with period correct decor. The wait staff is nice and the chef stopped by to see how our food was. Would definitely recommend.
