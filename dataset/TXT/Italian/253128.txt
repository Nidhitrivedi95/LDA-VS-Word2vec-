VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w No one ever talks about Lavo much. Right now, it's all about Marquee and Surrender. Lavo is definitely not a new club, but it's worth going to for one night in Vegas. We had no problems getting in. In fact, I was there for a bachelorette party and only half of us made it to the guest line by 12 AM, which was suppose to be the cut off before guest list line is void. We happened to meet up with the girls that made it to the line exactly as they were at the front of the line a little after 12 AM, and the bouncers led us right into the club. Not sure if that was pure luck or if they're really accommodating to guest listed group of girls. I'm guessing it was the first one.

They have free drink tickets for girls if you sign up for their e-mail list. Somehow one of our girls got a hold of a ton of tickets, which I think the girl just gave us all of the extra--since they're only good for one night. The lady said it was good for things like wine, beer, and Patron shots. But I asked the bartender which mixed drinks I can get with the ticket, and he suggested Sex on the Beach, which I thought was such a great deal--free? Those are usually at least $12. 

I must admit I can't recall the vibe entirely because it was all a little hazy, but the club wasn't typical Vegas-packed. Likely that was because Lavo isn't one of the newer hottest clubs like I mentioned before. But, I actually think it's better that it's a little less known. The DJ played some of the best top 40 music and never repeated once. We stayed til the end, and had a great time. The best part was that it was in Palazzo, which was walk-able from the Venetian Hotel--where we stayed. 

Give Lavo a try!
