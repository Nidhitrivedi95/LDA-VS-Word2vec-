0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw I was headed out in this direction and was looking for something quick for dinner. Looked up triple D locations and saw this place. My first impression was that I wonder if it's any good. My second impression was, I don't remember watching this on TV. Did not matter as it would have been a place to try anyway.

So before heading out we looked at the menu and wrote down what we wanted. We were driving from Phoenix and I didn't want to eat cold food. I called and placed the order and said it would be ready in about 10 minutes. Well when we drove up we were shocked to see a long line.

I went in trying to figure out what was going on. I saw the window that was for pick up and went is this where I pick up my order? It sure was. I was happy I called ahead and had paid for it in advance and was on my way. I saw the line for food and it was pretty long. I can't imagine the wait. 

Finally at the destination we sat and ate. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and onion rings that were featured on the show as well as a burger. The pizza was pretty good and the onion rings. The first thing that came to my mind was it reminded me of another place I went to that was featured on triple D. Taylor's Refresher in Napa. It has that sort of feel to it. 

Over all it was good, but a long way to go just for food. If we're ever there again we'll place another take out order. Saves the wait time and just as fresh as waiting in lien for it to cook.
