The atmosphere is perfect off-strip Vegas: it simulates some other time & place, but does it so authentically that you'd almost think that this is what a Northeast Corridor Italian restaurant is still like. Which is to say: the locals nay not even fully realize how impossible it is to find a joint like this in the rest of the US anymore. Mostly, it's the most enjoyable restaurant experience I've ever had in Las Vegas.
