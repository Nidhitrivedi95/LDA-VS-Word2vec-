2bK1ng2mnRdtTh_BDNGmIg Ordered 3 pizzas for delivery. All 3 pies had undercooked crust. The sauce was good but the cheese and other ingredients were substandard. I ordered from North End pizza instead of a chain pizza joint because I expected fresh, quality toppings. I was disappointed. First and last time I ordered from North End pizza.
