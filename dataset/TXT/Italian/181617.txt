O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ Not sure what their reservation policy is... We had a very special occasion that we booked two weeks in advance then received a phone call 2 hrs before our 6;00 reservation to tell us the room and table we requested was not going to be available.  To add to the insult the hostess would not confirm  our second choice in seating..at 4:00 .how could you not know if a table was going to be available at 6:00.  We now have no time to make other reservations on a Fri night so wish us well.
