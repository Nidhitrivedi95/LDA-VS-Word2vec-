I was told the there was a steak/arugula salad as an option for dinner. I am not a fan of arugula, so I asked to have it on romaine (as they had a Caesar salad on the menu).  He asked the chef and the chef said no. I then said, can you just give me the Caesar salad and place a filet on it. He said sure. The entree came as follows... One plate with a filet (6oz) and one small bowl of Caesar salad. I asked what is this??? The server proceeded to tell me that the chef did not think a filet would go nicely on a Caesar. I told the server that I ordered the meal and not him. This really frustrates me. Cater to the customer, especially when this is a middle of the road restaurant. I also had (2) vodka and soda with a lime. The third one came with lemon. I asked why and where was my lemon. The server said that he did not want the drinks messed up? What?!? This place needs some flavor added to the meals, re-training of the staff and the chef to have a new attitude. I miss the First!!! The First was the restaurant prior.
