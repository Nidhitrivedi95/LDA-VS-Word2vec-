When we first arrived the waiter was not my favorite and was extremely rude, once he realized that we were there during restaurant week. But I spoke to the manager and she switched us to a new server. This guy made our night and I would go back just for him to serve us again. The chicken parm was the best I have ever had and lobster tail dessert was amazing. The only other issue was that we got a child's pizza for my son and it arrived after the rest of us were done with our meals. But the problem was fixed again by same manager and they took it off our bill.
