vxadNrpTY7OHNmWsrEpNnA Food Network Fail. Horrible service, had to ask server FOUR times for SILVERWARE. Meal took an hour and fifteen minutes after being seated. Requested cocktail sauce, received barbecue sauce. Fries were served cold. Fish sandwich was full of bones and served on a stale bun. Very disappointing.
