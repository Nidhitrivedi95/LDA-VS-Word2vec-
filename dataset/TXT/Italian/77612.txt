cYVG7yZaDQb5t_bqzCFSnQ Had dinner last night here after our first choice (Thai) was too busy and us on a schedule. 

The service was good. Very friendly. 

The food was generally quite good. Expensive, but it is a hotel restaurant. I had the gnocchi. My wife had the duck. One son had the ribeye. All were good to very good. The tagliatelle however, was dismal.
