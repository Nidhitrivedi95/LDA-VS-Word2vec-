We always enjoy our dining at this location.  The food, service, ambiance, and friendliness of the staff are top notch.  Our server, Sarah could be the host of "The Chew".  She was knowledgeable of the menu items and gave us the opportunity to substitute sauces and pastas.  On this particular visit, nothing could have prepared us for the wings by Tony!!!  We were literally linking our fingers!  The manager Steve visited our table and thanked us for visiting.  We'll definitely be back!!!!
