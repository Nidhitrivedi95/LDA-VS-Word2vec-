iAdj2sx6LHWt6_zM7U3GLw This place is a disgrace.
You can't even get a glass of water.
The family has their grandchildren come after school,so its pretty much a daycare.
I would normally love something like that,as a family oriented person..but like i said..the service was lacking to the point that water was too much to ask for.
I odered the lasagna..it was the most disgusting SLOP i have ever been served. 
My sister ordered a 'pizza'.it was an overcooked frozen pizza. 
Neither of us ate our food, and were not asked if we were enjoying our meal..
When I compained, it turned into an argument with the son of the old lady cooking.
If this family had any shame, they would let their old nonna retire and rest, and close the place down. 
Truly appaling service, food, and a refusal to hear any complaints at all.
If it was the wild west, I'd have written on their windows in feces after the way they treated mewhen I dared to say the food was disgusting. Yes..i went there.
