pOEL97ld-FJMKO8Ki8JmYg I am giving it a five star because they don't have a 4.75

I have had many meals here because I live locally.  Always reliable for good service (attractive staff) and very good food, if not always excellent.  Reliable to bring business clients. Tables are close but seems to work.

The new renovation since April looks terrific. Upscale.

For such a major city Toronto does not have a lot of 4 pr 5 star restaurants. O&B helps.

Good luck with the business.
