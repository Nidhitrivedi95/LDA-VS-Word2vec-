a-Mo7Ipu_c5y21mmg0-F7g W-O-W.  A 1-man show that really can do it all!  

I am just so floored from last night's dinner...you walk in, and this Asian man is speaking to the table of 3 already seated in Italian!  Then, he breaks out in other languages -- he knows 5 in total.  Then, my own party of 5 gets seated, and I'm thinking to myself -- this is going to be one helluva gong-show with only 1 guy working the front.  Then, we find out he not only works the front, he answers the phone, he pours the water, and drumroll please...he's the CHEF!  At this point, I'm really thinking "what have I done now?"  

THANK YOU, to fellow Yelpers who recommended this place.  For without you all, we would never have found this AMAZING gem of a place.  Don't let anything fool you.  This guy, Marino, runs a tight ship all on his own but that's not the only reason why you come, you come because the food is just amazing.  We all had great dishes last night.

He started us off with some on the house bruschetta, bread and oil/balsamico.  Then all our entrees were all delicious -- the tagliatelle with meatballs, the spaghetti bolognese, gluten-free penne a la vodka, and the sirloin steak with potatos and veggies.  All were just fantastic.  Then he gave us some beautiful tiramisu and creme brulee at the end and it left us all wanting to come back again tonight, and we will come back...again and again!  And his company -- priceless.  Marino is a joy and his wife did all the art in the restaurant.  We all felt right at home there.  Next time, we're trying the lobster ravioli -- just call it in a day in advance and he says it is the best in all of Toronto.  Can't wait!
