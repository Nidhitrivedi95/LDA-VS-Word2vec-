VPSgUyHuxUXhYTcPgGjiDA We're regulars. Great place for a quick and cheap bite to eat and drinks. The Tavern of Stow has a hometown-bar feel, with a very friendly staff. Pretty much everything on the menu is worth trying. Burgers and wings are delicious. It's at the end of a shopping mall, so there aren't many other options around it. If you're heading through town, definitely give this place a try.
