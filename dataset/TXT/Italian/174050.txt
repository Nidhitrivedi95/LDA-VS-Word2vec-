I had made a dinner reservation for two at 6:00PM on a Wednesday evening, and it was already packed with people when we arrived. We squeezed into a tiny table and did our best to maintain a conversation without being drowned out by the voices on either side of us. In fact, it was so loud that apparently my server had to come back and ask me three times what I had ordered before she finally got it right. I had the Bufalina pizza, which was good although I have to say I prefer Pizzeria Libretto (for food, service and atmosphere). After reading all the rave reviews, my dining companion and I decided to share the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and we both commented that it tasted almost exactly like a mug cake that you can make at home in 60 seconds. The vibe at Terroni is definitely a little contrived, and service wasn't as warm as I would have liked. Overall, I found the whole experience to be quite average. I really expected a lot more from Terroni, and with all the other great dining options in Toronto, I don't anticipate returning here anytime soon.
