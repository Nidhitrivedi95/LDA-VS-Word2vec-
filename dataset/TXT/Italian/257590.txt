w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A Overall the food was good but that's about it. There was hair in our stuffed pizza, our server came back one time to fill our drinks, there was three other tables and it took us 45 minutes to get our food. After she dropped of a bill we were on our way out when she stopped us and said she gave us the wrong bill. We won't be coming back. We recommend sunset pizzeria over metro any day!
