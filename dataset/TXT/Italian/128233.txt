HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA I discovered naked city a few months ago and have been eating it at least 3x a month now. I always order the guinea pie. I have yet to receive a bad pie but it was bound to happen and it did last night. I can never remember what they call they're sizes so I've always asked for the middle size and it's never been an issue. Got to the store and received the small size 6 pieces. They were about to close and I was charged for the small as well so I didn't make a fuss. Once me and my family started eating we both noticed our fist pieces didn't have any meat. So we kept eating and more than half of the pizza was like that. Usually you can see whole circle pieces of sausage throughout the pizza but this looked as if there was maybe 3 pieces of meat crumbled across the pizza we were lifting the cheese hoping it was under there too it wasn't. I kid you not it was so bad I literally saved any meat I came across from my pizza and added it to my sons slices. Really disappointed... these are the cheapest pizzas. Still give 3 stars because I love the Arville location and this is the only issue I've had with naked city and I'm not sure if the small order is different than the larger ones as far as meat quantity. Will still be a loyal customer
