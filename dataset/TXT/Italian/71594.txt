c9UmJiX2G7hKMpivZ3h1oQ Bad pizza!  Mess you up.  I visited Pittsburgh last week and, as a pizza aficionado, decided to try a few of the pies along the Murray Ave strip in Squirrel Hill.  While the staff was nice, Pastoli does not even belong in the conversation with the slices of heaven at Mineo and Aiello.  The sauce was bland and scarce.  The cheese did not have a nice melt into the crust.  And worst of all - the crust!  It was too thick and VERY doughy.  Cannot speak for their other menu items, but do not go there for good pizza.  Even the chains are better.
