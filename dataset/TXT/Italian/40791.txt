7iZYl52Gtica73shRYsuMQ I knew i was in for a treat when the only thing i could pronounce from the menu ws "bread". Shit was tight though. They have a bunch of spaghettis. Theres spaghetti with meat, pizza spaghetti, fettuccini spaghetti or whatever. But really who gives a shit about the spaghettis. The coolest thing was that the bathroom had an extra chair in it, like the mens bathroom. I know you're wondering why the hell there was a chair in there. Who knows. Im guessing its the pre shit chair. Like maybe you sit in it and psyche yourself up for the coming shit you're about to take. So visit the bathroom! Its fucking 5 star! Other than that the food is good. Its like yuppie white kid, project manager from some bull shit medical firm food. Like you will care what brand of clothes you own when you leave type shit. Still, the food was good and the people were nice so its all good at francescas.
