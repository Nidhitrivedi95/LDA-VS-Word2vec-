G9UlT-mBMdUwoUGCW405ow 5 stars for service, 4.5 stars for food.

We had 15 people in our group, and our waiter was outstanding.  I give him so much credit for keeping up with us.  Sure, there were a few snafus, but overall, it was perfect.  Not to mention that they created a special prix fixe menu for our party.  Just wow.

The food:

Beef Carpaccio: The BF said it was like eating beef flavored air.  So light, yet oh-so-flavorful.  4/5

Charcuterie Plate: The only disappointment of the evening.  It came with salami, prosciutto, and one other meat, provolone and mozzarella cheese, olives, mushrooms, and artichoke.  Good, but not special.  The charcuterie across the street at Lolita is much better.  3/5

House Salad- Awesome dressing, but otherwise not memorable.  3/5

Caesar Salad- Very memorable.  They serve it as a romaine wedge instead of chopped up. The dressing has a nice kick to it.  Also, there are actual anchovies in the dish, which is pretty rare to see.  5/5

Lamb Chops- I had mine served without the pumpkin gratin, due to a dairy intolerance, and they happily substituted some asparagus for me.  While the lamb chops were quite good, I think the magic of the dish would have been much better with the pumpkin gratin.  This is obviously no fault of the chef's!  4/5

Veal Short Ribs- Seriously out of this world.  The veal and the parsnip puree somehow compliment each other to make a flavor explosion.  Definitely the star of the evening.   5/5

The only gripe of the evening was that some dishes had small portion sizes.  Someone else in my party ordered the chicken dish, and it was seriously itty-bitty.  The salads were small, too.  The good news is, you aren't likely to be disappointed with any of the food, though!
