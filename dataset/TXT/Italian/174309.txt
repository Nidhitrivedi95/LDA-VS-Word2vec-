Nc4uCzuwPbDr3gs6aGru8g It's a chain, so you can't expect too much. But for the price, I would not complain too much neither. Just make sure before going there for dinner, you date is either 1) craving for Italian, 2) you do not have a great budget, and 3) you do not want to think too much. Those were my reason to go - after experiences from other location of this chain.
But for this location, again, it was alright. Staff were friendly enough comparing with other locations, and chef did his/her job well. Will go again if I meet those 3 criteria above next time.
