qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA Don't let the small size and relative lack of crowds fool you - despite the fact that it's not on the main drag, this has the best Italian food on the strip.  We had pizza, pasta and salad and it was all delicious.  The pasta was cooked to perfection and the pizza had a nice thin crust.  We were also given garlic bread which was delicious, albeit very oil/buttery.

For the strip, the prices are reasonable.  Would definitely recommend to anyone who has a hankering for Italian food in between gambling and clubbing :)
