t5Ip9ggWaam6qAUH0WPKVg Nice dinner for my daughter and I. She enjoyed her pizza bites and ice cream sundae! I had the eggplant parmigiana, very good. Every bites was just as hot as the first. I'd suggest ordering an extra side of sauce for the spaghetti side. Tatum our server was good. We will continue to come back.
