1bYtt80iwckHNPJyIl4qQg I've been going to Oliva for a while. Not a regular but go in every once in a while, a few times a year. I find the mediterranean options good but aren't my favorite. The dining experience is very professional and relaxing. A lot of people had negative experiences with the servers being rude I see but I have not found that personally.
