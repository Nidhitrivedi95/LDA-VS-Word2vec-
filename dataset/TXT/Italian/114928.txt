GnODIDJz09LecpudDoynCg Super cool bar atmosphere and great drink list!! We got there around 5pm and sat right away but within 30 minutes it was packed and stayed that way all night. As an avid New Haven pizza style enthusiast, the thin crust pizza hit the mark well. Another in my party had the thick crust and also enjoyed it. The small salads were enough to share 3 ways but other than that the apps were just okay. 

As for dessert, cannolis were $5 a piece (really?!), not 75¢ as some reviews state. We were given cinnamon cannolis instead of the chocolate chip we ordered. Be warned, these cannolis are not the same that you will get in New Haven.
