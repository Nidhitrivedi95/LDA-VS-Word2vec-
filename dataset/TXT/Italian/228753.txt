SXgVJz5aIvbeCXWvg0ZuNg Love the atmosphere, and the pizza is good. It doesn't have the yeasty crust with thin crispy base that I prefer, but still perfectly fine. The toppings were delicious but much too sparse. I had a veggie (caramelized garlic, goat cheese and artichokes) pizza and added caramelized onions, sundried tomatoes and blue cheese crumbles.  The flavor was excellent but only 1 sundried tomato on the whole pizza and just a few onions. 

What made this a 3 start experience was the lack of service during the second half of the meal. Our server was great until the food was delivered but then she disappeared. We waited for 20 minutes with a very antsy baby for the check before taking our credit card to the bar to pay. 

I might try this place again, but to indulge in pizza calories, it really has to be a stand out experience.
