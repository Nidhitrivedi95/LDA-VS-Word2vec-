mbPaXByWZBZUGqvh8ewmTA AMAZING homemade pasta! Family owned & run which makes it very comfortable and pleasant. Highly recommend!!! If you are a pizza/pasta fan then definitely check it out. I will definitely be returning to try the pizza next time! Love that you can carry out and dine-in. Very comfortable and good sized place in a convenient plaza in Chagrin! Love love love the food and the atmosphere.
