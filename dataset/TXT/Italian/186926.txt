oRRU93M-gYqcnes16GuZTw Well, we just had our worst experience this past weekend! Has nothing to do with the food! Food is really good, their service was really bad. Wife, daughter, her friend, and myself had lunch there this past Saturday! Even though their food was good, Again! our waitress was really bad, Wife order their cheeseburger well done! I had to send it back because it was really pink. Daughter wanted extra bbq sauce and ranch dressing! Never got the ranch dressing. I had to keep on top of her for refills! This is not going to stop us from coming back, but now we will consider other options now.
