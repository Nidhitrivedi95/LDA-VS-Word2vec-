wUqqq1nUFA8Fn-3vYYFyWQ I've loved this restaurant since I was an undergrad at UW. I was worried because some of the reviews were quite negative. Nothing could be more wrong. Calm atmosphere. Efficient staff. Well timed meal. And on Varsity Band Concert night. I had the roasted veg & Gouda ravioli. Wonderful. My son had the lasagne, just as I remembered. Check this place out, you won't be disappointed.
