G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I was in Vegas on a business trip so grabbed a seat at the bar at Giada, honestly not expecting too much. I was totally wrong. The service was great and the food was fantastic. I had the eggplant parmigiana and the mushroom pizette - it was filling and tasted great. Topped off with a glass of red for a great evening out.
