mY9tk1ZVMf9Zco9SaXMk6Q Great food and atmosphere. A bit loud that's why it's 4. Otherwise the service has always been great. The wait is not too bad. The food has always been good. The lobster bisque is a bit too oily but other dishes are great. Would definitely recommend it. In fact among all the restaurants at Crocker park, I would recommend Brio for quality. 
Oh by the way the happy hours is also great. They have the most amazing burger.
