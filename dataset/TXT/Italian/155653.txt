L2VXZ7_Ohzp7pr1otj7WoQ Came here with co-workers for dinner right after a flight from San Francisco and we were starving! I'll be damned if US Airways is going to charge me $7 for some cheese and crackers. I held out and wanted to save my appetite for Coco Osteria and I'm glad I did. The food was good. The stuffed mushrooms were my favorite. Not the best but it hit the spot. The entree portions were plenty. Service was good. The restaurant is tiny indeed! There were four of us and we were running out of space to put plates on the table. Prices are reasonable.
