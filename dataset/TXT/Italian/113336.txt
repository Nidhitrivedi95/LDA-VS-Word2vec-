Gh-qmVwvibLnNdqEZXcQHw I saw Romeo's on "Check Please" with my parents and they wanted to give it a try. Based on the Yelp reviews and the massive menu I was a bit skeptical, but I am so glad that we took the plunge. 

We went for lunch and we all split an appetizer, 2 pitas, and fries for the 3 of us. The appetizer, the Feta Dill Fritters (gyro meat, dill, and feta deep fried and served with a yogurt sauce) were sublime. They make their own gyro meat and it shows. The feta gyro pita (gyro, feta, and artichoke hearts) was similarly exceptional as was the pastrami cream pita (cream cheese, pastrami, avocado, and provolone). What shocked me, however, was how good the fries were. They were double fried steak fries that had the perfect balance between crispiness with a little potato flavor on the inside. Served with feta dressing and big enough to share, they were a surprising star. Finally, while we were too stuffed, there is a massive dessert case that tempted us to change our mind and try to fit it in, but we couldn't do it. I highly recommend sharing due to the large portion sizes so that you can have room.

Overall,  it was a great experience and we will definitely be back!
