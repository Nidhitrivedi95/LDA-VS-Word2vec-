30TxDt2V8G7FWXsKaEKA9A I watched as this new building was being built and wondered what it was going to be.  So far two food places with a third to come.

I received a flier in the mail with coupons for Marco's and decided to use one of them tonight.  I called and ordered a White Cheezy which is listed under their Specialty Pizza section.  It's topped with 4 kinds of cheese including feta and has  onions, bacon, and garlic butter sauce on top.  I ordered the large which is a 14" pizza.  The person who took my ordered said it would be about 13 to 15 minutes and I drove the mile and a half to pick up the pie.  It was almost done.

I paid and then brought the pie home.  It was large enough to serve two (cut into 6 slices), and there's one slice left for morning.  This will be my "hearty meal" before going to give platelets.

The pizza was good.  It had a taste from the feta that made it different from other pizzas I've gotten.  There was a fair amount of oil on the cardboard box but the pizza itself didn't taste oily.

The restaurant serves other things and they make pizzas that you build the way you want.

This is a national franchise with several locations in Las Vegas.  

Not the best pizza I've had but not bad either.
