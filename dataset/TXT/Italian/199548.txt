As one of Phoenix's popular restaurants, I had to check out Pizzeria Bianco and see what the fuss was all about!

Known for their thin crust pizza and long hour waiting period to dine here (minus a star), I came one Friday evening with the parentals. Parking was very limited. You either valet or head across the street by an underground garage parking (which can be validated 1 hour off from Pizzeria Bianco). We ended up paying $7 after validation from our 3 hour stay within the vicinity.

As I walked in, the hostess greeted me and took my name and party #. She mentioned the wait would probably be about 1 hour and 30-45 minutes. After expecting a 2 hour wait time, she recommended to head next door in their waiting lobby which also has a bar and offers small snacks. We had a bottle of wine and insalata dish.

After waiting for a little over an hour, we were summoned by our waitress at their waiting lobby area. We were able to transfer our food and drinks next door. 

The venue is very cozy, dim lit and rustic. About 35-40% of the room is taken up by their kitchen/bar, while the rest of the area is full of tables for diners. Since it's a small area, it can also be quite loud and difficult to hear a conversation.

We were kindly greeted by our waiter, who was able to answer all of our questions and recommended items on the menu that was quite popular amongst the diners and himself. For service, we were well taken care of! (**4 STARS**)

OVERALL THOUGHTS
I think Pizzeria Bianco is a decent place for some thin crust pizza, but it was NOT worth waiting that long. You pretty much waited 2 hours, but once seated, your pizza comes in like 5 minutes. The pizza wasn't bad at all, nor was the best I've ever had. Consider it satisfying if you were to dine here, but was not memorable. I do love the fact that it is home made and the products used to generate their pizza pies are of substantial quality and of local products, but I have had better pizza in Portland and San Diego who play the same game.

Is it worth visiting if you're in the area? Yes, if you want to say you've been here.
Is it the best pizza you'll have? No

I hope that helps you out if you choose to dine here.
