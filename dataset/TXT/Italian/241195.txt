UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ I have been coming to NYPD since I first moved to Az. I am originally from queens NY. I grew up working in pizzerias. I know a good pie. 
This is the best pizza. Johns on bleaker street in the village comes pretty close, but NYPD makes a tight pie. 
The other end of the equation is the service. Mat the manager has made a good staff here. Every time I come in he is friendly, and his staff is on point. 
I give this place my highest rating.
