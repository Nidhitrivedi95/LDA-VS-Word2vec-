Bs8AvNO3xWoURWpqiGd_4w Food and quality was fantastic! Alfredo was perfect. Management was awesome! The service from the waitress however was sorely lacking and very poor. With only 4 table occupied she looked as though she was slammed, making rare passes by our table, and ignored one part of the table or another each time she did grace us with an appearance,  which again was sparce at best. 

I sincerely hope that 3:00 on a Saturday is not just a bad time to go here if you want adequate service from the wait staff.
