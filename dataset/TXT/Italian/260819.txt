wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g Canaletto offers what most Strip eateries dont or can not: Value

From the salads, to the appetizers, to the risotto, to the grilled poultry, Canaletto offers flavors and presentation on par with all but the very elite of Italian eateries on the Strip at 80% of the price.

Service is fine.  Ambiance is great for people watching.
