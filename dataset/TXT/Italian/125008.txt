Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ i may not love pizza as much as other folks i know...hubby, ahem!  
i may not be able to eat pizza every single day for every single meal like other folks i know...hubby, ahem!
but i think i can safely say that i've had enough pizza in my time to know when i'm having a good pie.
and, boy, does OSP just tickle my pizza pickle.
that made no sense but i digress.

the dough is definitely the best i've had in vegas to date.
it has the perfect flavor, the perfect consistency, the perfect perfect perfect...it's perfection.
the garlic knots with that ricotta cheese whatever dipping sauce, i could probably eat a dozen by myself.
i've only had the pizza and the knots here but that's really all you need to have here.
i'm sure the rest of the food is great too and i'm sure i'll eventually get to other parts of the menu, but until then, i'm happy with pizza and knots.

now...when are they gonna open up more locations???
i think it's time. =)
