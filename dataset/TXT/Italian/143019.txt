jspgVJaiyobeUq6EMhmO-w Came here on Saturday since we are new to the neighborhood.  The wings were great. We had the smoked honey-hot and they were perfect. Lots of smokey sweet flavor.  We also tried the Hawaiian pizza and it was also delicious.  The pizza had a light and crispy crust and it was perfect.  Our server was very friendly and did a great job taking care of us.  We will definitely be back.
