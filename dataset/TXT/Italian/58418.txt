We visited for lunch with three toddlers, and one baby, the wait was long and they would not allow us to preorder in order to keep the kids happy.

Also, they only had one working high chair, we had to use a belt on another  since the strap was broken and they have to stack three high chairs to reach table level. We had to place the baby in her car seat on the floor, there was nothing to accomodate her.  And, there was another toddler next to us with no high chair.

Only good thing is that they gave the kids dough to play and that kept them all happy even when not necesarily safe.
