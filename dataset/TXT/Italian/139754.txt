JH3zKlfslbSVeA_KsAaRRQ A night of amazing indulgence. 

The first series of dishes were raw fish all pared with sauces and flavours that sparkled.

A couple of vegetable dishes and only one meat dish - but possibly the best steak
I've ever eaten.

Dessert to die for...even though I normally prefer cheese.

Wine pairings...well all good, all chosen perfectly for the dish.

Do I sound impressed? One of the best meals I've ever had!
