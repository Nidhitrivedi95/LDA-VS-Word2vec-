G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I had made a reservation through my hotel only to find out when I arrived that the Sunday I thought was booked was actually 2 weeks later!  This was by no means the fault of Giada's, rather my hotel but when I explained to the hostess what had happened, she was very understanding and empathetic and did her best to at least get us in for a look and quick tasting!
I was highly motivated to visit primarily because my 3 daughters, 6 year old twins and a 7 year old, have gotten me hooked on Giadas show.  They are avid fan and with all the great places to eat in Vegas, it had special meaning to experience it for them.  
While I only had time to enjoy a mixed appetizer plate and dessert, I found both to be exquisitely presented in a wonderfully enjoyable and comfortable atmosphere which certainly captured California casual with an elegant Italian experience.
The bacon wrapped dates were incredible, all of the food was amazingly tasteful and light while certainly satisfying.  We also tried 4 of the deserts, each wonderful and I dont think we could have gone wrong with any of the choices.
I would like to add that while Giadas entire experience was enjoyable, there are plenty of wonderful restaurants happy to take your money.  What was truly as notable as the food however were the people and especially, the Manager, Avi.  Even as busy as this newly opened place is, he made it his personal mission to great every guest and sincerely wanted to insure we had a wonderful experience, even though we werent really "officially" there for the entire course.  A final thank you also to Avi in that after I had explained the details of our visit and evening, he personally insured I had a great story, and more, to share with my daughters.  Now really, who does that any more?!
Thank you Avi and Giada's.  I look forward to returning soon and staying for the entire experience.
