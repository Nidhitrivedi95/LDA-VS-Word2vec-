LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw Rarely am I always pleased everytime I go to the same restaraunt-Oregano's gets it right every time.  This is one place that is the best Italian and Pizza you will ever have; the best locally owned eatery in Arizona. Nothing is bland, and you certainly taste the oregano in their pasta dishes.  If you don't mind the 30 minute time to cook it, their deep dish pizza is the best.. Other favorites are their anti-pasto salad (dinner size salad will feed 3 or 4 people, literally), Big Ole Ravioli, and of course, the famous Pizz-ookie dessert. Only complaint is every location is busy and there is usually a wait.
