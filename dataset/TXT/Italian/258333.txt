w67o_AhcSU_fjVOTlbquXg I like Gennaros. Standard pizza hole in the wall kind of place. They're never busy and the staff is always grumpy but the pizza taste good so I keep going back. Prices are middle of the road and the same as pizza Sola and sals. If your looking for a local pizza place that serves decent food go here.
