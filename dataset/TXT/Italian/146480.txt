k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw I didn't see much of the restaurant, seeing as I had a private wedding dinner in their Vegas Room.

Our dinner, for 15, was delightful. We went with the cheapest group dining package and selected spaghetti and meatballs, meat lasagna and fettuccine Alfredo. The meat lasagna was definitely the best dish of all three, but none of them were bad by any means. The bread before the meal was also delicious.

Our waiter, Danny, was also amazing and kept up with drinks and food for all of us. He also noticed we didn't have a wedding cake and brought us a slice of chocolate cake on him! 

Location is a little away from the strip, but it was nice because of that. Next time we're back in Vegas, we'll definitely dine in the main room!
