H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g My boyfriend and I had lunch here on a Wednesday. The place is beautiful, right inside the shoppes at Venetian. You'd think you'd be getting superb service but no, our waiter didn't even greet us when he got to our table. He just said "you ready to order?" And throughout our dining, we barely saw him like once. But asides the crappy service, the food was great and there was an opera performer outside and we loved that!
