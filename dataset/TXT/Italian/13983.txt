1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ My first impression of Maggiano's was in Bellevue, WA. wow that was a nice place. Wait staff was professional , quick, plentiful, etc, and it just seemed like a place that was a little better than most nice places. Never had to wait more than 3-5 mins for anything or anyone there. 

The staff at the Scottdale M's was fine, but the whole vibe there was "we're going to do just a little better than Olive Garden". The food was good, but not excellent.  The 'killer' was the 'ol' "would you like some parmesian cheese?

Bellevue location - waiter came out with a cheese grater and block of cheese immediately after we received our dishes and scraped away as long as we wanted.

Scottsdale location - had to ASK for it.  When it came, the waiter just slapped one of those glass shaker thingys with the parmesian cheese, which pretty much validated our opinion of the place.

Oh well, I probably won't go back - it's still better then Olive Garden, but just by a little bit.

Oh, one more thing, we ordered our stuff off this particular section of the menu and were given a choice of 2 more dishes to take home in to go containers. Kinda shows they're more into quantity of food rather than quality.
