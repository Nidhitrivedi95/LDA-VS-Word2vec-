And now for the nitty gritty, 
I have been ordering from this location for almost 3 yrs. It is one of my go to places for really good pizza. The size and price for the pie is just right. The crust.....OMG! Yea I used that word, is really, really good. On the day that we went to eat in and the time this photo was taken was April 30th 2016 around 2pm. Our server was very friendly and polite and was attentive to our needs. My needs were making sure the Corona's were never empty (It was a long day with the little kids and one has to unwind :) Don't worry, I only had two!) anyway, The pizza was awesome as was the service. I would knock a star off but this is a rating on the food and service which were both outstanding. Oh, the knocking off of a star.... well, If you have T-Mobil as your service provider, be prepared to be thrown back to the days without a cell phone as you cannot get service inside. I spoke to the server and manager about this and they both agreed. I told them having a wi-fi service in this location would be a great idea. I hope you enjoy the pizza as much as me and my family has for over the past 3 yrs.
