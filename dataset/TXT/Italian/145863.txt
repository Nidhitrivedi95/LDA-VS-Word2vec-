K74HYkFjYwhEpJt8HTOxnQ Definitely my favorite restaurant. I can't begin to describe why this is my favorite restaurant. The food is the best I have ever had from beginning to end. The sausage stuffed pepper appetizer was delicious. It was a great way to begin the meal. The salad had a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Just talking about it makes me crave it. It is one of the best balsamic vinaigrette dressings that I have ever had. For the entrée I chose one of their featured dishes...a ribeye with a homemade sauce. The steak was perfectly prepared and the sauce was deliciously sweet and tangy. Surprisingly though, the food was not the best part of the experience for me. The best part of the dining experience was the waiter. He made the dining experience complete. Because of this, we always dine here for special occasions and to make lasting memories.
