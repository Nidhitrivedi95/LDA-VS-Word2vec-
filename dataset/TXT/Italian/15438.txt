1RgX-EAQrGoPMvy9ntEXsw Just had a craving for pizza and this was the next place on my list to try. I called and placed a pick up order, and was given a time of 20 min.

I decided to try the New York style pizza. When I arrived i was a few min early, so I paid and sat to wait. I was offered and drink, and ask specific questions about my pizzas, whether I would like to have it crispy or different. The staff was friendly even though seemed busy. I even heard them take a large order close to closing time. 

I couldn't wait to eat my pizza on the way home, but I made it, and was not disappointed. The pizza was nice and crispy, and the dough tasted home-made. It had a nice sweet taste to it, soft and crispy on the bottom. The sauce could have been more flavorful for my liking, but it was still great. The cheese was just starting to be crispy, and the pepperoni was nice and crispy on top as well. 

Overall, a great experience from beginning to end. I don't think there was anything that made it extraordinary, which is the only thing that kept it at 4 stars. But as I try more of the menu hopefully that will change! Bottom line is great pizza, great experience at a fair price.
