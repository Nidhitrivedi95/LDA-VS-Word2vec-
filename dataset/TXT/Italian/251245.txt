vQWVP7MtpgXFwUMvxCj9Tw All I wanted was some damn pizza. Tried to order it to the hotel room and they said they would not accommodate my specific order. I wanted something that they make on their menu, the Margherita pizza, but they said they would not make it for me for delivery. To which my reply was that makes no sense, you can make it and if I come down there in your store and get it I can have it but you will not deliver? They replied yes, we just won't do it for a delivery order but you can build and make your own pizza. 

So wouldn't I just be able to build a margherita pizza? 

Huh? What in the world? man people are idiots.
