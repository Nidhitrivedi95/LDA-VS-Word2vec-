2KooqK40Nd80sgIPE2ScyA Came here without much expectation because we were just in the area and there were less people in this patio versus their neighbour. There was a $25 prix fixed menu that looked pretty enticing but knowing that I was getting gelato down the street steered me away. I ordered the fungi risotto, and man was it delicious. It was hot and so fresh when being served. With a little bit of fresh pepper and I truly felt this was authentic. While the patio was nice and enjoyable, when paying inside it seemed dark and slightly too warm inside. But I'm not too sure if that changes come the cooler months when the doors are closed. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area !
