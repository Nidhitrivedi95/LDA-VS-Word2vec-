6jDD-Z8QcsKTdIDWwM8gog I went to Anna Marie's when they first opened. My group and I enjoyed the food and ambiance very much.
Just left there and was very disappointed because they have raised their prices. A glass of wine is $12 - which for an off strip restaurant and an ordinary glass of wine is too much.
We decided to order a bottle which was $30. They did not have that bottle and tried to upsell us to a bottle for $50. Really?
In all fairness they did offer us another bottle at the $30 cost.
Also previously with the entrees you could have either a salad or pasta. Now only pasta.
Additionally I ordered a small  house salad to go with my pizza which  was $6 for the smallest salad I have ever been served.
Needless to say I will not be back and the others in my party agreed.
