1rURUVztowOl0lMoVHyNpw It must have been written in the stars that we (4 foodie, boozy Bostonians) would find this place. The food was amazing, the service impeccable!! It didn't hurt that the entire staff was gorgeous. Silvio, the owner, took SUCH good care of us. We've never experienced such warmth, generosity, and sincere care. Our late lunch experience was so fabulous that we had to repeat it. The food far exceeded our expectations - wowed us, in fact- and the wine selections were lovely. We will be coming back again on our next visit to Montreal. I can only imagine that the hotel services are just as fabulous.
