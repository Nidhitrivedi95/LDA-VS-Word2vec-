z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ My best friend and I chose Andiamo after much discussion as to where to dine in Vegas on our last night in town. I reluctantly agreed to eat here, even though I was hoping to eat at one of the Italian restaurants located in a swanky hotel on the Strip. I am soooooo glad that I listened to my dear friend and dined at Andiamo. The food? Fabulous! We are both Italian and very picky about the Italian food we eat. The service? Perfection! John waited on us and treated us like longtime friends of the family. Since our return to the LA area, we have recommended this restaurant to many friends and family. We will definitely be back next trip! We miss you John!!!!
