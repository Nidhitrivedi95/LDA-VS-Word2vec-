klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw Great service and even better food. I had a ribeye that was one of the best I've ever had. My wife had the asparagus crab salad that she thought was good but nothing to write home about. The ambiance was five star (it's in the Encore) and the calamari appetizer was the best both of us had ever had. Mindblowingly good!! I'd give it five stars if my wife's dish was killer. 

I would go back in a minute.
