Ms. D and I were busy running errands in the area and didn't have time to cook so she suggested we turn to Yelp and have dinner out.  A quick look in the area and we decided to try Federal Pizza (noticed Federal was near our favorite Postino).

We arrived in casual clothes and although it was a 30 min wait we were seated quickly.  I was starving and we got on our orders of The TLC Salad and a Big Star pizza.  For a first visit we nailed it; the salads was fresh, crisp and flavorful while the pizza was amazingly wonderful crust with fresh ingredients.  The sauce was the only ambiguous part of the meal as it didn't really come through; not that this is a bad thing just that the fresh toppings and the wonderful crust was so overwhelmingly good.

Ms. D enjoyed her Home made cooler and I thought the Primitivo wine wasn't especially great.  But did I mention the crust on the pizza was tasty (LOL).  Parking is a bit weird and while they have complimentary Valet which only allows one way entrance I did not really want to check my car that evening.
