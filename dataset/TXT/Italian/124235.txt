HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ Absolutely a 5 star experience and I would let anyone influence you otherwise. Not only is this place absolutely beautiful and cannot be matched in all of Las Vegas, but the service and food are exceptional. The waiter was VERY well versed in wine and created a pairing for my meal with my price range. I ordered the gnocchi which was above average, but the bison was absolutely delicious and so tender. Was perfectly prepared.
It was pretty quiet the night I was here, so once you get over the fact that it's not always jammed packed, it's just a great meal at prices that are actually reasonable for what you're getting when you look out the window and experience the level of service that you're getting.
Enjoy!
