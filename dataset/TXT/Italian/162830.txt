Lu5hB_5YtX5Re2067Zf3cg Well my wife and I won't be able to comment on the food, as we never made it to the table.  We arrived around 7:25 for a 7:30PM reservation.  The waiting area was uncomfortably small and filled with people.  It took 6 minutes just to check-in because the host was actually at the host stand for about 10 seconds every 3 or 4 minutes (and this continued the entire time we waited).  The rest of the time he was wandering the restaurant looking for tables.  Even though we had a reservation, the suspicion was we were just put in line with all of the others waiting--the majority of which were walk-ins.  In 20 minutes of waiting for our reserved table, we received no communication as to the problem or reason for the wait.  The host didn't seem to understand or acknowledge the service he was providing was poor.  So we left to eat at a great restaurant in the same complex.  If the service on the way in is this bad, I don't care how good the food is--the experience is already ruined.
