-L88B-PrtzwujhLuYc2k_g Food was fantastic and was actually surprised as we were ready to sit down to a fairly average meal given we had no expectations blindly walking into the place.  Service was great and decor/atmosphere was nice.
Very convenient as we were going to the ACC right after.
Though I would probably come downtown just to come here to eat.
