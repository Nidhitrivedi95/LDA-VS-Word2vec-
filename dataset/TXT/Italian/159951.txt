lH1WyBjyrIlWjYvKmaKctg I was looking forward to trying a new restaurant downtown. I had one of their ramen bowls which had great flavor. I was disappointed in the amount they give you in the bowl. It was half full and they give you plastic small spoons to eat with. They need to have different utensils to eat this soup. The sides were overpriced in my opinion . They didn't have any hot sauce. I was hungry after I left .... I will try again in a couple of months.
