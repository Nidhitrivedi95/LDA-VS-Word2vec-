jW4-bGuymLGlB9OBsTq3TA My family and I were pleasantly surprised! We're Italian and hard to impress, but we all agreed the pizzas were pretty good. I can't vouch for the pasta, though, as we were all in a pizza mood.  The place had a nice atmosphere, but was pretty empty for a Tuesday night dinner; I'm assuming the word hasn't gotten out yet.  Our only qualm was that the pizzas were pretty tiny for $12-16.  They're 10" cut into 8 slices, which isn't enough for even 2 people.  Overall, a positive review!
