qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA Food was awesome! What a cute date spot. The tables are in the middle of the walkway of the grand canal shoppes, which is loud... But we enjoyed ourselves nonetheless. 

Hubby ordered calamari- for $15, the portions were HUGE, and he said they were cooked perfectly! I got the marinated balsamic basil chicken salad for $16, which was one of the only gluten free items on the menu. It was delicious! The olive oil is some of the best I've ever had, and I couldn't stop pouring it on everything. The rolls that come out gratis are hot and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Hubby also got a moretti beer- his favorite!

Amanda our server was so sweet and accommodating. I really appreciate how knowledgeable she was about the menu, especially with my severe gluten allergy. She made sure I knew exactly what was safe to eat, and what wasn't. I truly appreciated her concern. 

Unfortunately, the other waiter working the lunch shift yesterday, a tall thin man with spiky hair, was so rude to everyone, yelling at his tables and then yelling right next to our table when the hostess seated a couple in his station, screaming that he couldn't handle any more tables and that someone needed to help him! It was so sad! I'm so glad we had Amanda as our server and not him; he would have ruined our meal. 

The espresso is illy but it's watery and not worth the $4.50 price point. It does come with a mini cantucci though. 

The other disappointing thing about the restaurant was the horrifically rude floor manager/hostess, in a brown striped top with brown hair. She yelled at us when we asked about gluten free options before sitting down, as if she couldn't even waste her time talking to us, and told us to leave- thankfully Amanda saved us and said that yes there were gluten free options, albeit few, and that she'd be more than happy to help us.
