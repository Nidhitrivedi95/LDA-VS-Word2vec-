7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw Dishes were very small. We got a salad that the waiter said should feed 2-3 people and we received 1 small bowl size of salad which ended up feeding one person and not ge. We ordered a Caesar salad and pasta bowls. The spaghetti dishes we ordered were underdone and not very appetizing. Not worth the hype nor the money.

Service was okay and desserts were phenomenal. We ordered the Carmel desert and the dark chocolate tart. However, we will not be coming again.
