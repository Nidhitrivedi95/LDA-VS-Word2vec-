-PUPEpMsjBjk_rX5lFaWng My wife and I have tried a lot of different pizza places in the valley area.  Everything seems to be thin crust and I just don't like that.  This is just standard pizza, but being here it makes it seem pretty thick.  The price is reasonable.  We had two calzones and mozzarella cheese bread and were very impressed by the flavor.  The size is decent compare to other restaurants.   The dining room is very loud. If you're hearing impaired, probably not a good idea to go during peak hours.  Overall decor is meh... The staff was very attentive to our table and was fairly informative regarding menu options.  Extensive wine selection will cost you significantly more although they have a selection of some reds and whites from $12-15 a bottle.  We managed to eat for 2 with an appetizer for ~35.
