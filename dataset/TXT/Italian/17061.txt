29o-qEDIRpXmVmSPNsH4sA We fell into Vin Santo on a busy Friday night before a recent marathon that the PIC was running in.  Despite the wait (45 minutes) the owner (a sweet and thoughtful English woman) made every effort to accommodate us and move us up the list, even asking other patrons if they minded waiting just a couple more minutes.  

As for the food, none of us could complain about being short-changed...especially the PIC who was carb-loading.  The plates were absolutely delicious and huge (I thoroughly enjoyed the Salsiccia Rossa--pasta with so much homemade Italian sausage that I had to take it home without noodles!).  We all walked away thinking we couldn't have picked a better spot nor gotten a better deal.

The decor was very nice and clean and the staff as mentioned previously was very helpful.  We'll definitely be back.
