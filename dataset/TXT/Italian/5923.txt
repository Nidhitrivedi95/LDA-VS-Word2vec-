_tp3EVUdGPBsHdzQgKaS0A Busy lunch spot in Newmarket and with good reason. Their sandwhiches are delicious! I had the meatball sandwhich the other day and it came with 3 huge beatmalls with cheese (add-on). It wasn't as hot as I like so I ended up heating it for a few seconds in the microwave and the cheese just melted. It was SOOO GOOD.

Today I had the veal on a bun. It was tasty but the veal was a bit hard so not good for eating in a sandwhich. Would probably be better if it was eaten with a knife and fork. Finished my lunch with a san pellagrino orange soda. Yummy! 

Their pizzas also look delicious, fresh and loaded with great topping combinations. And yes like others have mentioned, not much "pastries" here. They do have some bulk breads for you to buy but that's it.
