The new owner sat down with us and planned out the catering and it was all very good, even after being delivered to Mandalay Bay. My only complaint is that when my friend who was handling a lot of the day of affairs called to pay, the woman he talked to wouldn't let him pay because it wasn't his name on the catering order. I had already informed them several weeks in advance that that day they would be dealing with him, not me. I think he eventually got the owner on the phone and everything was fine, but whoever he initially dealt with that day caused some unnecessary stress. 

In the end it was all good and we had more pizza, pasta and salad than we even needed for about 60 people for a couple hundred dollars. Seems like the transition between owners has been a little shaky, but glad they've brought the pastas back on the menu.
