AZlnpvILz5cEWJifjr2CSQ This place is good. I have been twice now and the food is just so good. I had a parma sandwich and pasta. The bread was kind of hard on the sandwich but it was very good. The meats were imported and had great flavor. The pasta was good but I will probably try a salad next. they are sort of expensive it was $15 for just my meal but as a treat who cares right?
