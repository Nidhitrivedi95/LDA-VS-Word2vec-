u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog Now aside from homemade spaghetti and meat balls at home and a pizza from our favorite pizza parlor,  I'm not much for Italian cuisine. That being said, while staying at the hotel my wife and I decided to give Martorano's a try as an alternative to our usual steak house, seafood, and buffet dining. We had a bad experience, first they gave us probably the worst table in the house, right at the restaurant entrance so parties waiting for their table were standing right over our table. Ok we didn't let that bother us to much. Now the food. My wife ordered the Linguine in white clam sauce, what she got was Linguine soaking in olive oil that taste a little rancid. Neither of us could eat the Linguine but she did eat the clams they were ok..  I ordered the Rigatoni with Sunday gravy recommended by the server. A big chunk of roast pork that was fairly tasty but there was not enough gravy to satisfy my taste so I asked for a little more gravy, the server said he could do that for a  5 dollar cup of gravy as a side dish. ( WHAT ) I did not pay the 5 dollars simply out of principal. I could not finish my plate.   I'm not someone that makes a big deal about bad food or service ( service was ok ) in a restaurant because it makes for an uncomfortable situation for all. I just do not return.(  later that night I picked up a couple slices of pizza at JJ Boulangerie )
