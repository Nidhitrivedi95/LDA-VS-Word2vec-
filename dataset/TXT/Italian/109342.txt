G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Beautiful view for a romantic dinner with my love. I was disappointed with the fritto mesto: calamari and shrimp; it was so salty. Had it redone twice and it was still salty. I recommend the arugula salad. It was good but could use more pancetta. For the entree, I ordered the tomahack chops tasted very good but had a lot of fat in the meat. I think the chef gave us the fattiest meat since we had the fritto mesto returned twice. Haha. My hubby had the rock of lamb and he said it was the best lamb he tasted ever. It was very tender and juicy. We also had the palenta and it was just ok for me. It had to much butter for my taste.
