KtUuxN2gZXeC7WpJ_w9hNg Great food & service. Brilliant for a casual meal. Very big menu, so it takes a while to decide and I always end up ordering too much. They're good with wrapping up your leftovers, so it must be a common thing. 
I love the fact that there is always plenty of toast with the pate!!!
The coffee is slightly dissapointing, but over all a brilliant place.
