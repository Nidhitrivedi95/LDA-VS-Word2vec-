u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Went to Postino last night. Had a great time, well with the exception of the crappy service. We had at least three waiters/waitresses. We had 2 glasses of wine, one of which was Brent's pick. Pretty awesome. Also had some Bruschetta. You just have to try it! Lots of unique offerings. Also had the salted carmel ice cream dessert. Yum! 

Would have given it 2 more stars had the service not sucked! Really recommend their waiters and waitresses spend more time at the tables, check up more often at the tables, and do a bit of up selling. Not once were we asked if we wanted anything extra. Hello? :)
