ZSCEkqlzZKRrZUz98CXtNw Grabbed a to-go order of Thai chicken soup, potstickers and a pad thai.  Loved the food, just the right amount of flavors that goes easy on the palette.
The soup was rich and creamy and a must try one.  Potsitickers (dumplings) are my most favorite food item and it was delicious with the soy sauce on the side.
Pad thai felt a bit dry, especially the chicken because it was grilled and place on top of the noodles as a topping or something, but overall taste was good.  It wasn't too oily or saucy which is how I was used to eating pad thai before.  this version of pad thai did feel "healthy".
Interesting thing about this place is they put the amount of calories beside each item on their menu.
