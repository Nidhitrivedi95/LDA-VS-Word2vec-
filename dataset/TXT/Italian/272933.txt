XxXJat55Oep1BMzQ9yJJhQ After an amazing intro to the world of Negroni Panini at the Yelp Elite event, I have come back a number of times. The regular panini's are so filling, I haven't had room in my belly for more nutella and strawberries.  At the elite event, I tasted the salted cod puree. I haven't been able to get this out of my head. On the menu, they serve the cod with polenta. But, the other best thing at Negroni is the bread. So, last time, I asked, politely, for the cod on crispy bread. The wonderful waitress made me a salad on the side so it was more like a meal. The lemon peel in the cod rocks my world. I hadn't noticed it the first time I tasted this spread.  
The mozzerella, pesto sandwich is decadent, as well. 
Great wine selection by the glass- forego anything special, though the House red is amazing.
