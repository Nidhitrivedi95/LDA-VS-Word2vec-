9NGXZyn-GHYB-vKC63gOag I can summarize our dining experience at Cerino's this evening just by sharing the quotes overheard from two adjacent tables. 

"This is the best Italian I've ever had!"

"I'd come here again in a heartbeat!"

The dinner service was busy, about a 20 minute wait, but well worth it. We checked out the new Campbell's Sweets store across the street while we waited.

If you dig Italian fare, you should definitely give this place a shot. Great food, good service, overall very positive experience. 

Look forward to stopping by again.
