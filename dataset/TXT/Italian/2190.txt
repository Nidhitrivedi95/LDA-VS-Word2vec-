-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g One of the best meals my husband and I have ever had in our lives!!! This restaurant came as a recommendation from the concierge at the W Hotel.  We would have never known about it otherwise.  Fun contemporary vibe.  Fantastic service.  Prices were very reasonable.   We hope to come back to Montreal just to visit this restaurant!
