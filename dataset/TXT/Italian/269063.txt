xJ94FRxbFwkmpi1hjuWlaw Can't give this place anything but 5 stars. I'm a pizza fanatic. I mean hey it has all 4 food groups!  Rocky's pizza was quite frankly some of the best Pizza I've ever had. I grew up in New York so as you can probably imagine I know what good pizza is.  You can tell that this place uses quality ingredients.  It's easy to tell they didn't go cheap on the cheese either. Most pizza shoppes go cheap with the cheese they use.  This place uses high quality which I absolutely love. Unfortunately I was just passing through Charlotte so I won't have the ability to go back again any time soon but if you're in the area this place is a must try.  If you see the owner make sure you tell him the guy with the black Acura CL says hi.
