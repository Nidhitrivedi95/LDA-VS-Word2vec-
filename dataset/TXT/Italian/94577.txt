ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA My experience here started off okay, we arrived at about 5pm it was my first time. I didn't know you needed reservations so they only had two tables available (although 6 stayed empty through our whole meal). If you go do the grilled vegetables...cauliflower and brocolli they are amazing best you will have. I was so excited about my entree but it was downhill from there...the pasta is homemade but just not good I could say a whole lot but both dishes we ordered none of the three of us at the table liked. I ordered the chicken. I took one bite the flavor was great, second bite I saw pink flesh so that ended that. Our waitress took a while to check on us so we sat chatting hungry still. She sent the manager over, he seemed offended or uninterested or something but he offered nothing...we didn't want to try again. To not give up we ordered dessert...chocolate cake in pie crust and the creme dessert with pound cake bites, the chocolate cake is amazing, the other not so much. I actually probably would have gave it 3 stars but the manager sucked, the other manager went around checking on tables asking how everyone was doing and skipped ours. Our waitress was ok...
