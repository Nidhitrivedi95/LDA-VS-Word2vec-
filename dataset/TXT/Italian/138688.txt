The food is wonderful, particularly their Penne Alla Vodka and their humongous calzones. Service is always friendly and prompt, and the covered patio overlooking the Greenway is a great spot in warm weather. There are better Italian restaurants in Charlotte, but for the price, Mama Ricotta's is consistently on target.
