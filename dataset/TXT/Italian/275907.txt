yBGqf8l9NOM3vZFnlxcgzQ I liked this place,  it had good pizza and a very nice patio. The patio along the street was noise with delievery trucks that parked right in front of where we were eating , but thats not the restaurants fault! The rooftop patio is nice, kinda cool to see College street on a rooftop! I wouldn't say there was anything wrong with this place, but I wouldn't say there was anything particularly special about it either. I enjoyed my lunch but nothing left me wanting to come back. The food options were typical to most of the italian food fair found on College. 

Also the wait staff was very boring, no engagement or interaction with us at all. They we not busy, it just didn't seem like they cared we were there. 

Overall. if your looking for a decent pizza you got it!
