N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg I had never been a huge deep dish fan... then I tried out Lou's. Great staff and ambiance, INCREDIBLE pizza. I'm not sure what is unique about their sauce but it is the best I have ever had. Highly recommend the sausage( with pepperoni added on). 
In my experience they overestimate the wait-time by A LOT. (Each time I've been told it's a 50-90 minute wait, but have never ended up waiting longer than 10-20). Really appreciate being able to pre-order while waiting for a table. Thank you for branching out to Arizona!!!
