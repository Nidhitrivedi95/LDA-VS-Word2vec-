H13m2H3HlSsiId_UcJfmQw This place is ABSOLUTELY GARBAGE !!! Save your money and don't waste your time. Since the change from Mr. Greek to this new place Krystos...this place has gone down the toilet...which is exactly what your experience will be here, crap!

Besides the food being overcooked, terrible ingredients and awful...The waiter was new, so I don't fault him. But the "manager" is a complete @ss. He is actually also the guy cooking your meal. Seriously! We had a party of 8, they brought out 6 meals...and the other 2 when the first 6 ppl were done. Lol When I went to ask for the manager, some young short Indian dude behind the grill came around the corner and said "what"...I explained to him the situation...and he game complete attitude and at the end he reluctantly said "fine I'll take %10 off"...I wasn't satisfied with that but went back to the table...only to find that the seafood platter they had FINALLY brought out was missing the shrimp that was supposed to be on there. I went back to tell the manager I went to the manager to tell him I wouldn't be paying for the late, incomplete meal, and he turned to the waiter and said "OK fine go and take the plate off the table"... instead of making the situation right. I wouldn't go back here if they were giving the food away for free.
