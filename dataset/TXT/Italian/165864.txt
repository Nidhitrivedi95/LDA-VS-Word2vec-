mAhu38hHUQyOatamyQsOww Me and a friend went for their first Sunday brunch. Besides a few hiccups at the beginning everything was great. The food was fresh and delicious as well as reasonably priced. I had a pizza and my friend had a prosciutto sandwich both were good sized portions and tasted great. Even though there were some mistakes made by the servers you could tell they were doing their best trying to figure out their new roles and were extremely positive, energetic and apologetic. As a former server I know how crazy opening a new restaurant can be while all the kinks are being worked out but you could see everyone working together to do their best. At the end of our meal I'm assuming someone who was the manager or owner came to our table and others around ours asking if everything was ok apologized for any mistakes and asked what we thought of everything. Over all its a great spot and I'd go back again.
