91sdZ0d-5RMXNcBYB3uU0g I've been wanting to check this place out for a while and today I finally did. The food was delicious! I can't make one complaint. We had the mushroom bruschetta for starter, followed by the carbonara and gnocchi. Sure the restaurant is a bit pricy but the food was very good. I've read some of the other reviews and from this one experience I must disagree with most of them for now. I will definitely be returning here!
