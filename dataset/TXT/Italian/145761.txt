K67pkQljTFTW_P-7xUQrFw Service was ok. FETTUCCINI CON RUCOLA (wild mushrooms, arugula & goat cheese) was terrible which was sinful as those ingredients should have been a slam dunk. Pasta isn't fresh despite what their signs say, only SOME of the pastas they offer are fresh. In this case it was dried pasta purchased elsewhere that is served. ROQUEFORT mussels were fine, the sauce itself is just cheese and cream so clearly delicious.Saving grace is that it is BYOB but from where we sat we could see a small, more family style looking BYO just across the street. We'll probably end up there next time.
