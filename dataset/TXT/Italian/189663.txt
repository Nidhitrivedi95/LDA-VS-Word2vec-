p_22wrx3GmAzlbrGA6LyYg I have to say I would have rather ate a Totino's frozen pizza. This pizzas was worse then school pizza. Crust tasted like it was pre frozen, sauce tasted like tomato sauce with sugar the cheese no flavor tasted fake or really cheep and the pepperoni was OK at best. Will never  get this again not fit for pigs.
