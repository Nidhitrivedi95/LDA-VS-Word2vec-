w3PwDEbI0EDx4YI_BkFhIA After ordering from Portofino's three times. I'm ready to review the two locations I've visited!  I've first ordered from this location but the providence location is closer to my home.  I always pleased was pleased with my meal.  The chicken Parmesan is always consistently good.  Delicious thick Parmesan cheese on top and tasty sauce that's not sweet or bitter.  Today I ordered the cheese tortilini from the providence and it was amazing.  I had the exact cheese sauce on a pasta dish some months ago at an Italian restaurant near University City.  I missed that sauce son bad although the chicken was tasteless.  Portfolio has that same sauce and the dish itself was delicious to be meatless.  The pricing was fair for what I wanted.  Next time I won't be so skeptical to try some new.  The service is quick and a good use of space inside.
