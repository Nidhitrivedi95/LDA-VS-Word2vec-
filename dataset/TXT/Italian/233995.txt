tpesKzKbcPFekdThYZ4UpA I had lunch here last week and it was good! The spot itself is pretty cool - one part 50s dinner/restaurant, one part stylsh. Black pleather booths line one side and benches with tables lines the other. The servers were lovely and even hung up my coat! 

It was about $20 for lunch, with no apps or drink. But, as someone who is very sensitive to onions... the salad came laden with them in the dressing.  It's okay to pick them out when dining with friends, but this was a meeting so it was sort of embarrassing! In my humble (and onion hating) opinion.. something as aggressive as onions should be mentioned in the description!
