AKQbrvRBZvU5kB9Ut4gVkg The appetizers are great (calamari,  mussels, buffalo mozzarella,  meatballs)!!!

BUT the pizza for being a certified member of the American Italian AVP Napoletana. WAS PATHETIC... it was soggy, floppy, and no taste... (should be soft, flavorful, etc...)  this was my 2nd attempt to try at their downtown location, compared to Mt. Lebanon and same result....disappointment.   Pathetic and why have a brick oven if that's the final product.  

Great selection however for a simple menu though.... veal, chicken, fish..... stick with those and the appetizers. :)
