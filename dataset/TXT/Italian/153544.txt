Kykw3ho8wHtLV6gr9qbWTg We have been going to the paradise valley Picazzo's since it opened and it is one of my favorite places for lunch or dinner, any day.  The salads are exceptional, and the pasta (especially the mushroom!) and pizzas are wonderful.  I like the fact that it is organic, and that you can pretty much design what you want.  The servers (with one remote and fortunately gone exception) are very responsive.  This place is successful for good reason.  I hope it remains open for a long, long time.
