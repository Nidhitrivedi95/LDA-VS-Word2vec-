H3cMcV9KK3g2pi68lDNsng Ate here recently, and it appeared some sort of street festival in taking place.  Luckily, we must have arrived after the rush.

Service: started off poorly.  My wife and a friend were dropped off to secure a table, which they were able to do quickly.  However, they were moved three times (for some unknown reason), and we did not have a serve come to our table until my wife decided to take matters into her own hands.  The good news is that the person she snagged - Adam - apparently knows what he is doing.  He came over to our table within a couple minutes, and not only got our drink order, but told us our first round would be on the house.  For the rest of the evening, Adam showed himself to be helpful and a little playful with a good sense of humor.

Drinks: interesting Greek mythology-themed drinks, and the drink I ordered was pretty good.  They are a tad pricey, however.  Good microbrew beers on draft (except for the quickly getting old PBR), and my wife enjoyed a couple glasses of the Spanish cava.

Food: I would give it six stars if possible.  We ordered three apps to share amongst our table.  The triple frite threat was severely overpriced for what it was (the only bad experience food-wise), the beer cheese fondue was very tasty (just a bit cool), and the duck spring rolls were fantastic.  My wife and I decided to split a couple items for the menu for our meals.  The hard salami pizza was amazing, and the fried egg on top was the coolest.  Continuing with that theme, we also split the fettucini carbonara (again with fried egg on top), which was so good my wife was sopping up the sauce with some bread.

We are looking forward to returning and trying some of the other items on the menu, although it will be tempting to repeat our experience.
