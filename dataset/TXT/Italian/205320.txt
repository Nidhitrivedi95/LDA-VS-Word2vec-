QEqMHowTTj5GKvpiKheGlQ Simply 5 stars for the food, one of the best restaurant which serves authentic Punjabi dhaba food. Been there 2 and it's been consistent with taste. 
Waiting time is long and by the time food is served it could be a while. But the wait is worth while on the first bite. Even for take out they recommend 40 - 50 min wait
Definitely will be going back.
