aqrTv6QiU0J9Sxm_T--c5g Excellent. The menu was so traditional Italian it felt like mama was cooking. Cocktails and wine pours were generous. The bread and seasoned olive oil along with the stuffed mushrooms to begin was excellent. 

Eggplant parmesan was very lightly breaded and the sauce was sweet and light.

My clams and linguini was perfectly cooked al dente and the clams in a light wine sauce was superb. Its easy to over salt sauce and food with the first taste being ok and by the 4th bite you are sick of salt. Not at La Torretta. Everything was nicely spiced. The suggested dessert of lemon sorbet with mini cannolis was the perfect finish. Very refreshing. Service was excellent by Maria and the soft Italian music allowed for conversation rather than yelling at each other. We couldn't ask for a nicer evening and look forward to returning.
