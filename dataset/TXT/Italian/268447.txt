XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ Solid brunch. Bottomless really means bottomless here and service is complimentary and continuous. The food is interesting as it's more Italian (I.e. many pasta offerings rather than traditional hash and waffles) but still enough options for a brunch aficionado. I had the shrimp and lobster omelette and the person I was with had the salmon pasta. The pasta was devoured in a tasty vodka sauce and could have been a suitable dish for brunch, lunch, or dinner. The omelette seemed a little empty outside the seafood, but was good once the toppings of avocado and tomato were sort of mixed in. The bottomless was top notch and worth all $19 for sure. And the prosecco they use is very sweet so be sure to ask for additional prosecco for side pours to make the brunch more memorable. Prosecco is solid and with the patio seems a nice leisurely Sunday on many occasions.
