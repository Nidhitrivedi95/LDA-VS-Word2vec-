BlrvqjGanZvjlNsnIyvAXQ Came here on Friday, after a long week. My girlfriend got the Spaghetti Carbonara (My cooking specialty, but I wasn't too offended) and I opted for the Gnocchi in Cream Sauce with Gorgonzolla. 

The Pasta was good and the sauce was very creamy and strong, which I like. The Gnocchi, while not the best I've had, was certainly passable. The Portions were a good size and a fair price.
