FdiZDOs8LbSnBpA_e5R5HQ I don't have too many quick, good pizza options for delivery/take out in my neighborhood... so when Jet's opened, I was super excited! My favorite is the 8 corner pepperoni pizza with their "turbo" crust. Pair that with a nice beer at home, and I'm a happy camper! I've tried their round pizzas, and am not quite as happy with those, just my preference though(round was still good, deep dish 8 corner is just my fav!). If you haven't yet, give them a shot. It's a tasty alternative to all the Pizza Huts and Little Caesar's they have all over south Chandler/Gilbert.
