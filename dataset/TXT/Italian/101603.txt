FdiZDOs8LbSnBpA_e5R5HQ Horrible. Placed an order online, called an hour after to find where it was. Was told it was not received, I told them just forget it. Got in my car and left, as I drove out guess who was coming down the street, and stopped at my house? You guessed it Jets. The order was wrong, food was cold, and was told basically hey we are short staffed deal with it. 

I went on their corp website sent a request for a call and left my feedback. To this day more than 3 months later they have never called! It's not hard to pick up a phone as an owner and call someone and make things right.
