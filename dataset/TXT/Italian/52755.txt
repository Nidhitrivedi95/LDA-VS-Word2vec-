9XLH_grfIYKR7d5ZT9ZX_A Despite living very close by, I've just eaten here for the first time. I was there for dinner with a group of 6. Luckily we had made a reservation as it was quite busy.

I had the special which was a pork chop stuffed with asiago cheese, with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans and cheesecake for dessert. Oh.... and a bottle of the house red. It was all delicious! 

The service was great, we took forever to order, changed what we ordered and the server was very accommodating.

The decor is quite neutral, overall a casual feeling to the place.
