Times Square Italian Restaurant is a newly opened Italian eatery close by the Ace Hardware Store, in Litchfield Park. Times Square is very clean, has great parking access, plenty of srating, and the service is very attentive and genuine. 

Times Square has a large menu offering breakfast, lunch and dinner. On both my visits we opted for take out, and ordered large pepperoni pizzas and cannolis.

I have to be honest the pizza was just okay. There just wasn't anything special about it. Maybe, I was expecting more. In my opinon, the pizza could use a boost in seasoning and a little more time in the oven,  on both occasions the pizza was a little soggy. Even though the pizza was just kind of average; I do have to say that the cannolis were pretty good. 

Maybe, I will revisit soon and try something else maybe a pasta dish.
