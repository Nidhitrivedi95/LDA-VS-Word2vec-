NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA This place has the best aroma of any restaurant I've ever been to!
I was there on a Saturday night and it was packed, but we were seated shortly. The pizza was great  -- a great menu with lots of options. The vibe is fantastic! 
The only downside was that we were seated fairly closely to the neighboring table, but that seems to be the case in a lot of downtown restaurants, and it was no big deal- we were all having a great time!
