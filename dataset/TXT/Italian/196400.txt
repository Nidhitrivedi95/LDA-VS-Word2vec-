pOEL97ld-FJMKO8Ki8JmYg I came here for the first time last week for a Mother's Day dinner. I had pretty high expectations because most of my family absolutely loves this place. However, I was a little unimpressed, maybe because it was hyped up for me so much. 

I definitely love the atmosphere, it has that bustling, casual market type feel. At some points it seemed like there were more staff than customers but the service was fast and efficient so no complaints in that department. 

The fact that it is a reputable name made me expect a lot more in terms of food, and general "bang for your buck". Nothing on the menu particularly jumped out at me. Shared the caesar salad and onion ring appetizer. As someone already mentioned, the salad was weak....if you're supposed to be a gourmet restaurant at least throw a big tasty crouton on the salad! I make better caesar at home and I don't really try that hard. I did enjoy the onion rings though and it was a really generous portion. 

Everyone at my table really enjoyed their main dish. We all tried the roasted rack of lamb, ribs, sesame seared tuna, shrimp linguine and a pizza, and they were all polished off and enjoyed. The only thing here is that the price points could be a littler lower, I think. Having eaten at places where I've gotten better quality food for less, I'm a little bit more particular when it comes to paying close to $30 for an entree if it doesn't fill me up. Good thing I wasn't paying :) 

I do have to mention that instead of dessert we all got some sort of coffee beverage and I had the most amazing americano ever made! Props to O & B for that. All in all, I had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed my meal. If I think about the restaurant critically though, there are some definite flaws.
