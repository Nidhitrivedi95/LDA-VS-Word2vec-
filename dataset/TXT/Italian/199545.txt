pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Me and some friends were traveling through Phoenix, and read about how amazing this place was. Boy were the reviews right! I am a big fan of thin crust pizza's, most of the pizza there are thin crust, and it was delicious. Highly recommend wiseguys. Its got white sauce, cheese, and amazing sauage! 
The space was small, but seating was spacious. The staff was very friendly. If you're passing through, this place is a must try!
