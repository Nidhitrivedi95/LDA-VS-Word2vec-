yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w I would give it 3 stars for food, 4 for atmosphere,  and 5 for wine. Wife and I shared the lasagne. Comes with a nice salad and bread. $13 extra for sharing. Which is ok because you get an extra salad, bread, cappuccino and of course wine. All the food was fair. Nothing great nothing bad. Atmosphere was old school Italian,  very inviting.  Menus were on the wall.  You get red and/or white a bottle of wine on your table. Cappuccino was definitely Americanized,  very sweet with whipped cream on top. Good but not Italian (breakfast drink in Italy). Accordion player worked a tip out of us. Pretty old guy, didn't really play well but was nice.
I would go back for atmosphere and wine.
