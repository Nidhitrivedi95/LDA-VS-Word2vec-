z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ Had dinner here with my family and it was a very nice experience.  Our waiter was nice and pretty helpful with navigating the menu.  We ended up ordering the 32oz Tomahawk steak to split between 5 people.  They were totally accommodating and our waiter even sliced the steak up for us.  It was more than enough food for all of us and it was delicious!  This is how steak should taste.  The sides we got to go with them were equally delicious.  My mom wanted a nice steak dinner and Andiamo delivered in a nice, classic atmosphere.  I would happily come back here.
