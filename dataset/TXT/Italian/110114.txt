G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q In our party Giada is amongst a favorite Chef, so we came to see if her restaurant could meet her reputation. We were happy to find that it not only met expectation but exceeded. The staff was specifically impressive. We felt at home from Bree (sp), who guided us through our social time to the sommelier to our waiter. Great experience great time.
