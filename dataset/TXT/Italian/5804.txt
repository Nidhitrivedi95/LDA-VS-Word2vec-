_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw We really enjoyed this place!  Nice bar area, inside and out.  It was too cold for us to sit outside at the bar so we sat inside.  Great service from the bartender.  The BF and I shared the 4 cheese white pizza with added pesto and it was soooo good!  We also got these little fried dough strips off the HH menu, but I'd skip those next time.  Everything's a bit pricey, but it was so good I'm not complaining.  Looking forward to going back when the weather is nicer and sitting on the outside patio.
