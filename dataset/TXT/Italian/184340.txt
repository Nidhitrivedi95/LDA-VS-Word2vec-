oHgCHC8a3QNJiB4-Ld0_kg Tonight was the night my partner and I decided to go here. It was okay. He says he would give it a rating of 3 out of 10, so a 2 out of 5 star rating is generous. 

Seats are taken as per what seats are available, and of your choosing. Orders are placed at the counter. Our orders were the spicy Italian Sausage Penne (full), Caesar Salad (half), a West Coast Salad (half), Tettrazini penne (half). Plus the $.99 1/4 of baguette with olive oil and spices. Thats actually expensive if you think about it in relation to a full size baguette one can buy at the grocery store, for the same price. 

The salads were cheap quality....the "fresh greens" in the West Coast Salad equated to the cores of Romain lettuce leafs, with few leaf component, very little chicken (for the West Coast salad), The Caesar Salad had barely a tablespoon of bacon bits and was more or less the same, not satisfactory. Thankfully we only got the half sizes. 

The pastas: My boyfriend's pasta was essentially the same size as mine and he got the full size, whereas I got the half size. This was extremely disconcerting. He was not happy with how spicy the Italian sausage was. Perhaps rating the heat level of the sausage, on the menu would be a good idea, as some prefer mild spice. I know there are different variants of heat to the Italian favourite. Options here would be great.

My pasta was incredibly flavourful; however, the sauce, was overly salty... My main qualm was the chicken.... on the menu it says "Chicken Breast". When I see and read "Chicken Breast" on a menu it usually implies there will be a large quantity of chicken and there was not. Disappointing. 

The man who greeted us was friendly and welcoming, thats a plus. 

Paying over $30 for a meal that was lacking in areas was unfortunate. First time here so... one lives and one learns. We certainly have.
