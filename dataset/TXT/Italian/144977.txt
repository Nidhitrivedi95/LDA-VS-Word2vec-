k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ We decided to try this place on a whim, after hiking squaw peak.  Upon entering, I felt a little awkward in my hiking clothes when I saw many of the patrons dressed casually but more chic, with many in business clothes.  The ambiance is exactly that.  Casual yet chic.

We ordered the Fritto Misto to start with.  It is crispy calamari and shrimp.  I found it very tasty, its something I would order again.  For pizza we tried the procuitto cotto.  I thought it was okay.  The flavor was good, but the kind of good that was just passable.  It was borderline bland.  Perhaps it was overcooked because the crust seemed a bit overdone and was pretty tough.  I looked at the pictures other yelpers have posted, and their pizza crusts look wonderfully light brown with slight charring. 

Service was efficient.  No problems there.

My first visit was just okay, but if I come back I plan on ordering another type of pizza.
