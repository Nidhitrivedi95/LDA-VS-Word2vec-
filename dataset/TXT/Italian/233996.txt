tpesKzKbcPFekdThYZ4UpA What does one do to reward themselves after hours of moving in and out of apartments? Go to Bar Italia, sit in the sheltered-yet-still-outdoor patio, press your palms flat on the white marble and have a great meal. That is just what I did, mother/moving partner in tow. 

Bar Italia's got the whole patio thing figured out. I'm pale, I don't want to sit right in the sun but I would love the breeze and outdoor feel. That's just what I got. 

The meal started off with a warm mushroom salad with walnuts, celery hearts, and parmesan cheese (the real deal, shaved slices, not the powdery stuff).  It was such a nice and refreshing start with a glass of white wine to top off the experience. 

Onto pasta. I seldom go to Italian restaurants without hitting this carb up, in any form. I got the fettuccine with chicken, sundried tomatoes, fresh basil and parley in a cream sauce. Perfectly cooked pasta, a generous offering of all the above components, and sheer creamy-but-not-too-creamy deliciousness made this one a winner. A waiter even came over thinking I was done, but there was no way I was giving that last bite up. I finished it. I love that it didn't come in ridiculous size. Still a good portion, still more than enough, but edible in one sitting unlike the heaps upon heaps of pasta I see in other places. 

Ah, I feel more relaxed even as I write this review. Who needs yoga? Bubble baths? Long walks on the beach? Go here.
