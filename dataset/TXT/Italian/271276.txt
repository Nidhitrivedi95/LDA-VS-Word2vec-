XqSN1PtZkJ6QorOUa9AAdA We came here years ago and thought we would have the same experience. We almost did until we realized we were charged twice. This is not a cheap place to dine; so you can imagine that although the food was exquisite, being charged twice is not the way you want to end the night--on a weekend. I give them 2 stars due to the lack of attention to detail during check out. For almost being a 5 star restaurant, I expect quality customer service from the moment you walk in and through check out. The food was amazing and the gondola ride was very romantic but I will not be returning. Tip: baller or not--check your online banking before you leave.
