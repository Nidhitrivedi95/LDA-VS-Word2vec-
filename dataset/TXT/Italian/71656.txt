cA9LmSotIsN3C8zCI94--A Very tasty but way too expensive. $18 dollars for a personalized pie and $10 for a drink. I'm rebelling towards all pizza places charging so much for a personalized pizza. The cost on that is so small. Unfortunately I have strict guidelines on my star rating system and I can not go lower than 3 stars.
