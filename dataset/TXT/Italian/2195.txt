-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g I have been to Le Serpent for lunch several times because it's close to my place of employment. I love the look - high ceilings, clean lines, minimalist décor. And it's sort of hidden so it's a bit mysterious. The service is impeccable. The menu is small but diverse. I think it's a great option for a lovely lunch. The lunch menu prices are reasonable!
