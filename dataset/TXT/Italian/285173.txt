zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g My friends who own Metro Pizza in Vegas told me about DiFara's in New York and how much they admired his pizza there.  I wonder what they think about  DeMarcos in Vegas, which I think is supposed to be related to the famous DiFara's.  First of all let me say the wait staff at this place was great and they had Coke which I like.  I tried both types of crust with just cheese.  The thick short crust tasted like there might have been some rancid oil used and it had a burnt taste.  And the other New York style crust had very little watery sauce.  Imported tomatoes can be good but you have to do something about draining the liquid out or they will make the crust soggy.  Overall I would give this pizza a B-.  I am sure that DiFara's in New York is fantasic pizza, but this Vegas version didn't do it for me.  This pizza isn't even close to Metro or Grimaldi's. Nice atomosphere though and I am only about the pizza so they might have some other menu items to enjoy.  The Napoli crust was not good at all.  I even heard people complaining in the restaurant about the taste.
