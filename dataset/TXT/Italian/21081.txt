366FaRQ1MWEHBhaEKTcriQ My fiancé loves this place.  He really likes the sweet sauce and it seems like all the people who love this place rave about it.  The quality of the food is excellent and the pizza was delicious, but it is just my personal preference that I don't like super sweet pizza sauce.  If they had an option for a less sweet sauce this place would probably be my favorite, hands down, like it is my fiance's.  It's just my personal preference, but the quality is there folks!  Also, we got our order to go and everyone was super friendly and attentive and we got complimentary drinks while we waited.  Definitely worth checking this place out!
