aal0SiXVRmUoM20A1m7xDw Have been here twice, great experience both times. Great service and great food. Salmon was delicious, perfectly cooked and the side of cauliflower gratin was crazy good. Boyfriend loved his crab cake over dirty rice. In fact, he said it was the best meal he's had in awhile, which would be insulting if I had cooked recently. Luckily that's not the case. 

Great live music every Thursday.

Great experience, super confused by all the negative reviews.
