Cr5CLpmVrmzFyz_RfQ6rmA This is NOT italian food. I feel like anyone who rates this place well obviously has never had good pasta.  After having been to italy several times and having mouth watering ravioli in paris, I can assure you that Scaddabush is does not know good food.

I had the zucca ravioli (Butternut squash ravioli, grated Grana Padano cheese, hazelnut butter cream sauce, fried sage, poor man's Parmesan ). Yes, I know it sounds amazing, but it was not even close to that.  Not only was it cold when it was served but it was also HARD (not in the al dente sense).  They claim they make their pasta fresh in house daily and honestly after my dinner here last night I find that a little hard to believe because the pasta did not seem fresh to me.  

Please do not come here. ever.
