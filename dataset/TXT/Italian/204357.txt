QBN_TcWQ1mZrzekFM4p0LA Came here this evening with the intent of using an advertised coupon.  Well, they would not honor the coupon even when I showed them in the app it was not giving a code.  Then the pasta dish was horrible. Chicken tasted boiled and unseasoned.  Had it replaced with something else.  Oh well.  This will be my LAST visit here as even the manager was unwilling to override and apply the coupon.  She was very unhelpful and another reason not to return.  I say avoid this place and find a better place to eat.  Maybe Va Bene. Cost more but superior food and management.  And leftovers the day are even worse.  Run fast away from this place
