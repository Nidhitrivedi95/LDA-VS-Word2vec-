CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA I go to Venezias almost weekly because I love their under 10.00 daily specials. Last Sunday I ordered an online special for take out and I accidentally over ordered two dozen wings. The manager, (I think his name is Jerome)was so kind, patient  and professional. He is a true gentleman! The rest of the staff and pizza & wings were great as usual.
