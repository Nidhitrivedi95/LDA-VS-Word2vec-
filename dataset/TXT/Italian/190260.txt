P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw Probably the only thing keeping me from giving five stars is all the phone numbers I could find to order delivery didn't work. We ended up ordering through ÜberEats which is a cool service. The special meatball pizza (can't remember the name) is awesome! We also had the steak and cheese pizza which was good, if you like jalapeños. The seasoned fries were not bad but didn't survive the delivery well. 

Next time I'm in Vegas I'll go to the restaurant and eat in, and no doubt will give a five star rating.
