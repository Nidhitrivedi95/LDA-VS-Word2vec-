zCqpHq-eDSRqXn9VBtoVcQ I've walked by Quattro e Quattr8 so many times over the last year that it seemed inevitable I'd finally walk in one of these days.

We stopped by around 7:00 on a Friday night and sat in the almost empty patio, where our waitress quickly brought us menus and some water.

We elected to start with an order of Suppli (classic Roman tomato & fior di latte rice ball). I'll be honest and say this didn't exactly blow me away. The restaurant's take on arancini contained mushy rice, a fairly bland tomato sauce, and a very tiny amount of cheese. It was edible, sure, but not the best way to start out the meal.

Faring far better was the main course, All'Amatriciana (spicy tomato sauce, crunchy pork cheek & sprinkled w/pecorino cheese. Mandatory served w/Bucatini). The dish, which annoyingly arrived a few minutes before my dining partner's main, does indeed boast an irresistibly spicy sauce that's augmented with slices of pork cheek. (Said slices were not even remotely crunchy, however.) Bucatini remains one of my least favorite pastas just because it's so difficult to twirl, but it worked fine in this dish.

I suppose I'd be willing to return to Quattro e Quattr8, but given that it's located in an area teeming with Italian restaurants, they should probably up their game if they want to stay competitive.
