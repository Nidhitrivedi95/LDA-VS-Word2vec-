HhPVzZYQI-akaXRK_A4dKQ Plentiful, but pretty awful. This place is for you if quantity but not quality is important. Don't go if you don't like kids, the place was packed with 'em.  
The service was good but there was no silverware on the table, had to ask.
I ordered the pork chops which came with salad & sides, apple sauce and corn (veg of the day). 
The salad had a gummy cucumber slice and a rotten, flat, moldy grape tomato. After removing these and a few bad lettuce pieces, it was a salad, nothing special. 
The entree was hot, that's all the good I can muster. The chops were tough & way over done in spite of my 'medium' order. I ate what I could, but they were terrible. The corn was screaming hot, and canned. The apple sauce was fridge cold and tasted like nothing.
My friend ordered the lasagna. The size of a brick and plenty hot, but the worst I've ever tasted. Boxed frozen is better. The sauce was flat and metallic tasting, really bad. The noodles were cooked but I don't know what the filling was.
Dessert did not save the day but was a brighter spot in the meal, apple strudel. 
For $50 (only one draft beer, no other alcohol), I'd rather take my money anywhere else.
