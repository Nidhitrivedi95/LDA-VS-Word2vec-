ow3oP3cfmhlfmSsGaXe25Q Drinks only - we ordered the Lime Margherita's. 

FIRST: We weren't asked if we wanted them frozen or on the rocks. 

SECOND: Instead of tequila, lime etc (It's pretty hard to f**k it up)- we got "Palmolive" soapy tasting syrup, blended with water and some crushed ice. My taste buds couldn't locate the tequila. The soap syrup was strong.

THIRD: SO SOAPY TASTING! WTF??? Feels like i was going to burp soap bubbles.
