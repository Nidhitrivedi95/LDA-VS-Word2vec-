lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg Been to Chicago's Giordano's this place does not compare. Maybe it's because we decided to sit at the outdoor dining, but 45 minutes to get one small pizza is ridiculous. Once it finally arrived, by the food runner we still had no silverware or napkins. The crust was over cooked and the server only felt like being attentive when we were waiting on our check( his top time)I have been in the service industry and am knowledge of good/ bad service this was not good at all. Will never come back and won't recommend to anyone.Oh did I mention the gross crusty table?
