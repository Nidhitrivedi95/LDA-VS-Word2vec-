MqJCtE12yfzQZCg8KGzNTw I've ordered twice from here and both were pleasant experiences.   Also, the fact that they have halal pepperoni is a HUGE plus.  First time I ordered was a halal pepperoni pizza.  The crust was good and ingredients were good quality.  My only complaints are that the pizza was extremely salty (though I'm blaming that on the pepperoni) and my god were they heavy with the oregano.  

Second time I ordered a calzone with chicken, peppers, and onions (on the suggestion of an employee as they were out of the halal pepperoni).  It was delicious!  Again, way overboard with the oregano but delicious nonetheless.  

I'd order from here again, but in the future I'll ask them to skip the oregano because then it's pretty much perfect.
