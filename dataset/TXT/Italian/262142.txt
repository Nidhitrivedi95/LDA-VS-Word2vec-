wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg Review soley on customer service. Went to celebrate my sisters birthday tonight. It was my sisters and my first time at North.The waitress from the start had a snobby attitude. When our dinner was brought out one of my sisters had ordered pizza and no plate was given to her. She passed us a couple of times and never really bothered to check up on us. However, when we were just finishing up dinner our waitress brought us the check. I told her she didn't offer us dessert. She offered a quick "sorry" and took back the check. We had just barely finished eating. She did go and get menus but our birthday celebration was ruined. We felt rushed and couldn't enjoy the rest of our time there. Wish this night would have gone different for my sister. However, overall the food was ok, maybe it had something to do with the way we were treated. Don't think I would go back if this is common for North to have service that makes me feel unwelcoming.
