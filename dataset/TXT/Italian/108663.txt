G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Went with high expectations.  We love Giada and really looked forward to this experience.  
First - didn't like the use if the ipad.  

Also, didn't understand the family style dinner for $120 with a signed picture of Giada.  Just thought that was being too commercial. 

Food is good but WAY overpriced even for Vegas for what you get.  We had the chicken marsala  meatballs, burrata,  ricotta crostini, lemon pasta with shrimp and the salmon.  All were good but definitely not worth the prices charged.  Really no standouts here. 

Overall our service was great..didn't have any issues with the wait staff on timing of meal and service.   Hostesses were great.

Probably will not go back but glad we tried.
