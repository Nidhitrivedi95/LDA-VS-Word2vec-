GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA his food looks great on TV, but apparently not so great in person. nice restaurant in the venetian, good service, great wine, but the main courses were underwhelming.

started with the tripe. it had a spaghetti sauce that had a hint of prego to it. not that it tasted bad, it was pretty decent, but c'mon, i felt like i could've bought tripe at some asian store and added spaghetti sauce to it myself. 

2nd was linguine with clams. pasta was cooked great but the sauce was just way too salty. did they taste this before sending it out? finally finished with veal chops which was cooked great and was flavorful. i'd say this was the highlight of the meal but alas, too late for anything but 3 stars.
