ixGb4NLfgD90wZHlw94rLw I ordered online for delivery and received an automated confirmation.  I waited 1 hour.
I then called 4 times (to check on my order) and got the voicemail every time.  I left a message.  I asked the hotel front desk to call the same number; they answered.
They said they never received my order (I have the email confirmation to prove it) and that they don't deliver to my hotel anyway.

Horrible communication and customer service.
