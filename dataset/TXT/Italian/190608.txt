P9LAh1yahQqntqTlXIVPnw Ordered: NY Style Large Pepperoni and Steak Deluxe Hoagie
Delivery Total: $33.68 including $2 delivery fee

The pizza was good but does not invoke memories of NY style pizza.  It reminds me of multiple pizza places around Pittsburgh, not NYC.  4/5

The cheesesteak was just your average lackluster attempt to put frozen minute steaks into a store bought hoagie roll and charge $12 for it. It says that it comes with fried onions. That is false. They may have thrown the onions onto the grill but they were still raw. The bun was your typical store-bought hoagie roll from Restaurant Depot. Lastly, the mushrooms are from a can and were just as uncooked as the onions.

I see absolutely nothing special about their food.
