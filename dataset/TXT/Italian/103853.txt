FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Amazing food! 

My boyfriend and I went for lunch on a Saturday after going to the art museum. I was happy to see that wines were only $5 a glass. Pitchers of beer were only $5! We got almost four glasses out of the pitcher. And it's not bad beer, either; the four choices on tap were ones I'd never heard of. Our wait was only about 20 minutes, which was fine considering that it's a small space.

It would have been nice to get the bruschetta before our entrees, as when we ordered we said "to start," but all the food was delicious. You could have a light meal of just the bruschetta. The four we chose were: brie and apples with fig spread, fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, warm artichoke spread, and burrata bacon arugula & tomato. The brie/apple/fig spread was by far my favorite-- such a neat combination of flavors. My boyfriend said that the artichoke spread was some of the best he's ever had.

I only had room for half my giant panini after eating the bruschetta, but it made great leftovers. My panini, the Nine Iron, had chicken, arugula, dijonnaise, tomasto, thick bacon, and mozarella. High stacked and wonderful. My boyfriend got a panini with roast beef and onions, and he enjoyed it.

The service was the downside-- the waitress came over once when we first arrived and we asked for a couple minutes to look at the menu, but 10 or 15 minutes later we were still sitting there waiting for her to return, and it's not a big restaurant. Luckily another employee (maybe a manager?) noticed us waiting and took our order, and apologized for our wait. The hostess was also really nice, asking us where we were from and what we liked to eat. 

The vibe is hipster and laid-back. Most customers seemed to be 30 and under, but there were a few middle-aged couples. Would go back if I'm in Phoenix again.
