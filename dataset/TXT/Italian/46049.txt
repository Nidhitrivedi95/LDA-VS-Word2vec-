8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA Hadn't been in here in awhile so we thought we would come and get some pizza, we'll let's just say the service started out good, then it went downhill me and my family felt like stepchildren, other tables were getting more attention, the wait staff would stay at tables of people that they knew and talk for long periods of time, the most helpful person there tonight was the girl that took our drink order, and then we sat by a group that thought they were entitled to have everything right away and there way, won't be back for awhile and the pizza finally came almost an hour later and it was just ok
