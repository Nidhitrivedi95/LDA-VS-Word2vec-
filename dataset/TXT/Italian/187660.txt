OThAF-lt6d7jY-pB1ajWPg Love ,love,love this place. The food is amazing and fresh...  (My favorite is penne vodka). Everything is homemade. You come here,you feel like part of their family. John and Jen are great people, very personable and always coming out to talk to you .  If you're in the area,give this place a try. You WILL NOT NE DISAPPOINTED!!!! I would eat here 5 days a week if I could.
