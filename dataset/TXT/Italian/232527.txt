tKi4OvAlckcVzeP92InsOQ Theater is phenomenal; nicest one over been to. Seats were clean, projector/screen were high quality, and the sausage pepper pizza was delish. We'd love to return, maybe we'll use our pogo pass for some bowling before the movie next time. Ps. $5 Tuesdays for movies and free large pop corn with online coupon!
