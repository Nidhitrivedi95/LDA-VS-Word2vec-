I've tried the pizza here once, but the last couple times I've been here I've gotten the chicken parmesan sandwich. When I had gotten pizza, I ordered a small pizza with chicken as a topping, which cost about $10. I personally thought the pizza was not bad - nothing amazingly special, but satisfying for when you're craving pizza and also a pretty filling meal for the price you pay. The chicken parmesan sandwich is pretty tasty and satisfying, and I do enjoy ordering this on the go but it is not that big of a sandwich. They do also have a dinner combo with the sandwiches/pastas that includes salad and bread, which I imagine is more of a complete meal and would be more filling. 

It does take some time for them to prepare your food here, so do expect a little bit of a wait when you order here. I don't have any complaints about my experiences with the staff here though. Overall, Valentino's is definitely a convenient place to stop by for some satisfying food on the go!
