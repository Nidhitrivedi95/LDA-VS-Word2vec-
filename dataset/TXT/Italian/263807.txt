WwSwuMu_menj4BzTdrKUdQ If it wasn't for Uber Eats I likely would have never tried this place, not for any other reason than the location is a bit awkward to get to and if you need to think on parking longer than a couple a minutes (and you're like me) you typically keep driving in search of another place to dine.

That all said, having ordered through uber eats twice now, I'm converted and I cannot wait to dine in with them in the near future.

The location, while hidden, is between Lakeshore Blvd W and Marine Parade Drive in south Etobicoke, literally a stones throw away from a romantic walk along the water which provides one of the best views of the Toronto skyline that I've seen.

My first order from them I had the steak sandwich and I was a little concerned that it wouldn't travel too well but the bread was still crisp and the steak was cooked perfectly and was incredibly tender. The toppings were also great - definitely a must have for lunch!

My second order was today and I went with the caesar salad and added grilled chicken and paired that with the eggplant parmesan. I like that the salad came separate from both the dressing and the chicken so the heat of the chicken didn't wilt the lettuce. The chicken was great and juicy and the caesar salad was a run-of-the-mill cream dressing, not fresh made so what you would expect from take out. The EPP was FANTASTIC! Top 3 I've ever had, including my Italian mothers homemade version - wow! Best of all hidden beneath is was a pile of spaghetti in tomato sauce! 

Definitely a quality joint to deliver such great quality even for take out. Looking forward to trying them out in house one night soon (oh and apparently they do brunch?)
