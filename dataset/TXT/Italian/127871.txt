hX3qKoTnpzxTGiPuO2YVTQ I flew to Winnipeg this morning and had breakfast at Boccone Trattoria Veloce before my flight.  I usually go there for lunch as they make delicious pizzas when I'm at the airport.  Today I was too early for the lunch menu.  I'd had breakfast there a couple weeks ago and it wasn't a great experience (everything was cold).  Despite saying I'd never go back for breakfast, I thought I'd give it another chance.

I ordered what I ordered the last time ... bacon and eggs and a large milk.  The potatoes and eggs were warm.  The bacon and toast were cold.  Like the last time, I didn't have time to send it back and to be honest, I couldn't be bothered.

My server was also cold ... he had no enthusiasm whatsoever for being there.  No more breakfast for me there!
