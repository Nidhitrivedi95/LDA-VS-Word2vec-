igU-mCXzyn-gmwSzJgeMEQ Super nice kids that work there, but OMG are they slow ! Lunchtime is busy- should be ready. You should have an assembly line. Be efficient. Everybody standing around watching the same thing happen. It's maddening! Same thing 3x's now. Pizza good, but might take an extra 10 min drive to competitor at this rate.
