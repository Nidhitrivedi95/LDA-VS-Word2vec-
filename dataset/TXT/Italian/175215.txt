ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw We came here on a Sunday night with a group of 20 people. We called in about an hour ahead to let them know we were coming with a large group, and we're told that they would be able to accommodate us. When we arrived, it took some time to set the table, but we were seated in about 15 minutes. 

Everyone sat down, pursued the menu and our waitress took our drink orders. After returning with our drinks, she took our food orders. This is where the trouble begins. 

We are still here, 1.5 hours AFTER we placed our food orders, and still NO food for the majority of our party. Several other tables that were seated had after us have already received their orders.  The food that was delivered to the table after 1.5 hours was luke warm at best.  

A member of our party finally asked for the manager and we were told the kitchen "forgot" our order.  To which I ask, how does the kitchen "forget" a 20 person order?  I understand that the food takes a while to cook, especially for a large group, but 1.5 hours is completely ridiculous. 

We all were very excited to try this restaurant as it came highly recommended by someone in our party, but we will not be returning to this restaurant due to this incident.
