0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q Was so excited to have dinner at Sirio during a recent trip to Vegas.  We were staying in the Aria and had tickets to Zarkana that night so we were looking for something close.  We made a reservation and our table was ready for us when we arrived.  We were given the wine list right away.  The wine was definitely overpriced.  The prices on their wines don't seem to match the prices of their food.  Because it was so expensive, we decided to skip on the wine.  Once we told them that we didn't want any wine our service went from good to bad.  We placed our order, and didn't see our waiter until the food came out.  They dropped off our food then we didn't see them again until we asked for our bill.  The food was not bad, but not great either, and the portions were very small, especially for the price.  If you are looking for Italian, I would skip Sirio and try something else.
