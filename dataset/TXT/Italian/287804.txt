Zmp2_b2gpSloz4Dv2VsVNg Came here with 3 of my girlfriends for dinner. We were staying at the GVR and had a $50 dining credit to use.

We were greeted by a very nice server named Eric. He explained the menu and and was very helpful.

Our table ordered 2 app's which were calamari and beef carpaccio ( which is my favorite) both were excellent.

As for dinner, everyone ordered something different from pizza to pasta to salmon. I opt for the grilled salmon which was perfectly cooked and to my liking. I tried a bite of the pizza and it was so light and crispy, not all that heavy dough and thick crust. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone especially guest of Green Valley Ranch.
