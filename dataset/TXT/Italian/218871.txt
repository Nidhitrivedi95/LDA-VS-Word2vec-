S5bNE4Pmin8OQUMOFod8bQ Located in the heart of Yorkville, this is a sophisticated and busy restaurant and wine bar.  The interior is very pretty with visible wine rooms and rustic decor.  Their service has always been great - they have friendly, helpful and doting servers and hosts.

They offer a plate of foccacia to start with pickled olives and peppers.  The bread is very delicious with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  It's a good start if you've ordered one of their Wines from their extensive Wine Menu.

Spaghetti Carbonara - it's definitely our favourite there.  There's just the right amount of sauce vs. noodles.  So yummy!

Their pizzas are delicious as well.  I like to try new pizzas every time I go and I still have yet to try all of them!  This time, I got the Patate + Salsiccia, which has mozzarella, gorgonzola, potatoes, and spicy Italian sausage. I've never had pizza with potatoes in it, but it was cooked to perfection so the potato was not too much on the pizza. The gorgonzola was very strong, which I loved, but if you're not into that, stay clear and get their Quattro Stagioni or Pollo Pizza.

The only time I wasn't happy with the food here was during Summerlicious 2012 with a few of my friends.  My pizza was surely delicious, but they really fell short on their sandwiches.  I suggest going here for dinner or for a few drinks and ordering from their Pasta & Pizza sections.
