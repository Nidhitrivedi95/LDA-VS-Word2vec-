76u0BfurPWxXTEUdkRTefA Actually the food here is quite good the bread is really yummy the Caesar salad is well done &  I am super picky when it comes to dressing. However....there always seems to be some little issue when it comes to customer service & The staff seems to be frustrated perhaps they are not getting what they need? Not sure but today I was informed that according to corporate policy??? (whatever that means) they will no longer be able to pre-mix my to-go Caesar salads that I often order so that I can eat going from my job in Carefree to my next class in Scottsdale. I order them that way because let's be honest it just doesn't turn out the same when you do it in your car. So there I have my reasons and I'm sure they have theirs but I will be taking my business to macaroni grill Bye-eeeee:)
