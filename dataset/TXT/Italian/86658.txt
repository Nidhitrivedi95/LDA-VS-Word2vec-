dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg I feel bad giving Oreganos a poor review because I have been to most of there locations several times and it is always pretty good. Just a don't try to pick up food for take out. I waited one hour for take out food and they apparently lost my order and never prepared it. Unfortunately I waited exactly 1 hour for the food and then they told me I could wait another 15 min and they will actually cook it this time. I was to frustrated to wait any longer so I just left empty handed. Just dine in when you eat here and be prepared to wait for a little while.
