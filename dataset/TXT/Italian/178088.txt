nOkSC1GtMUJ_I70sb0SaeQ Even if the food had been terrible, this place would've gotten 3 stars just for the service. Very friendly staff, made us feel very welcomed. Not much room for indoor seating, since they were renovating. We were the only ones eating.

What about the food? It's pizza! Takes a lot of work to mess up pizza, but it also takes a lot of work to make it stand out from the rest. Nice crispy crust and no holding back on the toppings. Great tasting sauce as well. Their pasta dishes were very good too. Hot wings were nicely fried with just that right combination of tangy and spicy. Chased it down with a salad, to try my gut into accepting all of that yummy, greasy goodness. :) 

Found this spot because of a Yelp deal and decided to try it because it was down the street from the South Point casino were staying at. Great find. Will definitely be on our list of go to's when we're back in Vegas.
