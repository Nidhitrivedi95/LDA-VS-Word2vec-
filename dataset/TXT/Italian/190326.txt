P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw My husband and I were at the outlets downtown and wanted some quick yummy food on the way home. We'd driven by Naked City more than a few times and decided to stop in. The place smelled awesome. I had the tri-tip on kimmelweck with garlic mayo and cheddar. I've eaten a lot of sandwiches (in some great sandwich shops) in my life and this one ranks right up there. The meat is incredible, but the kimmelweck is what really won me over. We will definitely be back soon.
