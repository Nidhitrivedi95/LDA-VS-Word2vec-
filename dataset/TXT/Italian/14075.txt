1Bc4KYox4Fux-aLV4OfFnA This was a great pizza place! Unfortunately, when I went it was on a Sunday. This was unfortunate because 3x my husband tried to Order something and they were out. Then I tried to Order the Ruben and they were out of bread. However, they gave us free pepperoni fries to make up for it. Their potatoe skins were so delicious that even though the waitress didn't bring the sour cream we ate them all before we even noticed which my daughter thought was hillarious. The pizza was huge and so delicious!!! I recommend you try it, but don't bother going on Sundays.
