JPmu9-2jd7nGIuTXEqT9zg Food is consistently good.  This place has been in business for more than 20 years and it is easy to see why.  Meals are individually prepared and are delicious.  Servers have stayed for many years.  Service is friendly and good.
Expect crowds at dinner time, as there are repeat customers, in addition to "newbies."  The garlic rolls are to die for, but are only served at dinner time.
