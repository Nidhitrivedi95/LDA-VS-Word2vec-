oUvqwPJkorOnYZFKRt0oEg I need to start off by saying Italian food is definitely not my favorite but it was my Uncle's birthday and he wanted to come here. We met for dinner Friday night and the place was packed so be prepared to wait for a table. My sister had to wait about 30 minutes. You could tell our server was new but she was very attentive and friendly.  

We ordered the bruschetta before our meal which was very scrumptious. The portions were massive. My Uncle has the Chicken  Parmigiana which he loved. My sister and I had a salad. She has the Shrimp Caesar while I had the dinner salad. Both were also quite large and very yummy. We topped it off with chocolate cake to go and called it a night. Great food and service! We will be back.
