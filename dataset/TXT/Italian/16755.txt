21sGRVR7HEs_t6PdB9tGMw When I called to place the order the woman who answered the phone was nice and pleasant but had to repeat my address several times (english wasn't her first language) and I was a new customer. 

I ordered the 14" pizza with 2 sandwiches special for $21.99. They said it would take about 30-40 minutes - I called them after waiting for an hour and she could only tell me that the driver had already left. They finally arrived at 1 hour and 19 minutes after I ordered. 

I ordered sausage mushroom pizza, tuna sandwich and Philly cheese steak. The pizza wasn't hot so I heated it in the toaster oven and was still pretty good. The tuna fish was really good as the bread was fresh. The cheese steak filling was sparse and after sitting for awhile got a little soggy. I'm pretty sure it would've tasted good if it didn't take them so long to have it delivered. 

Based on my experience from other Angelina's I'll order from them again but will suck it up and pick it up from the Angelina's on Post Street.
