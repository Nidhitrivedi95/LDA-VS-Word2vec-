jcasci3gjbsSuTEVzvDQKg Old south Charlotte standby ... this is just a great option when you want something comfortable ... but not TOO comfortable (meaning you will eat well here).  Short of fine dining, Mama's is right there with Ilios Noche (now that is SOUTH Charlotte) for our favorite pasta options in town.

The management staff changed over within the last year or so, and the new crew seems to have even stepped it up a notch.  This place seems to be humming along at least as well as ever before.
