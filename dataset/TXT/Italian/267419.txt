XD0LjNuPPwJPsTAHecUh7A Bad reviews all over, sooo people are saying they wont accommodate simple requests, then i dont care how many ppl say its good. Bcoz if even 1 guest is not treated with respect means its a bad place to go, no matter how fancy the decor. 

I always wanted to go here but after reading bad service n bland food reviews, i will rather go to so many amazing Italian restaurants in our beautiful city TO!!
