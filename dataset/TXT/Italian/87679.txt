dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg We have been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience until today. We decided to take my mother-in-law (who just came in from NY) there. We were excited because we hadn't been there for awhile and had bragged about how great the food was. Well we got a totally different experience. We went inside and only 2 other tables were there, but it took the waitress over 10 minutes to give us our bread basket and drinks. When we ordered dinner, I had ordered the red snapper. I took one bite and it was NOT fresh. The taste was awful. We never send food back, but did because it was inedible. We let the waitress know and proceeded to look at the menu to order something different when the owner Marc came to our table with a raw red snapper. He told us that the fish was fresh and had just came in. I politely told him that our fish did not taste fresh, but very fishy. He walked away while I was in mid-sentence. My problem wasn't so much about the food, but how we were treated.  Rather than coming over to our table and apologizing and seeing if we were interested in something else, the owner was defensive and insinuated that we were lying about the food. We spent over $100.00 on lunch and I didn't even eat! For that reason I am giving the place a 1star and won't be back there again. It's a shame.
