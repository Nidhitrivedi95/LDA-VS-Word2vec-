liCPyfxs-CYXAV_zAmB9dw Ordered dinner for two from the Summerlicious menu. Sat outside on the patio, which was nice. Service was prompt and friendly. However, the food was disappointing. I ordered the scallops for apps, pizza for main, and gelato for dessert. My date ordered soup, fish & risotto, and tiramisu. The scallops were good, the margherita pizza wasn't bad, and the rest seemed like it was out of the frozen section of a supermarket. Both the desserts were incredibly bad and of low quality and we took two bites of each and left the rest. 

They are apparently known for their fancy drinks menu. I asked for a non-sweet drink that the waiter could recommend and got something so sweet and sugary that it had  a gloop of sugar at the bottom of the glass. Told the server. Didn't care. I didn't bother going for a second drink at the risk of wasting another 12 dollars on overpriced fruit juice.
