TPvVGmT4AY1mloktV-2Dpw Grabbed some lunch with a few coworkers at La Famiglia. 

The food was pretty bad. Everything tastes like it came from a can. The prices are very reasonable, but the food quality reflected this heavily.

I also found it strange they would play the walking dead on the TV's during lunch hour. The young kids in the front were loving it, but I prefer to eat my food without the sounds of flesh being consumed by zombies. Call me weird, just a preference. 

Overall, this place is a pass for the future unless I am behind on the walking dead and need to catch up quickly during lunch.
