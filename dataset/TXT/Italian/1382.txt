-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q Coming from New York Queens, and Chicago wicker Park, I must say I have a high standard for pizza and Calamari.
I have been going to many places here in Arizona,  and to say the least I am always complaining and disappointed, I was on the verge of moving out of Arizona and giving up on this beautiful state because of my love for food.  

I decided to give this establishment a try, and Oh My God!  I did not only like it,  I am in Amore! This pizza and calamari is SoooooO delicious,  and the marinara sauce is to die for! Nom Nom Nom!

I am staying in Arizona thanks to this place,  yes it's that good.
