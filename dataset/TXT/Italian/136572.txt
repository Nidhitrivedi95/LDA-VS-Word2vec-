j00iBr6uYnwgFs_J5y9f0w Where do I start... So the place was a wreck! Not clean at all, the people working there were not the best at what they did and were slow.  We were over charged 0.83 cents. We noticed they rang up the wrong pasta and wrong size sandwich and we the customers corrected it before they started to make our food and then They brought out the wrong sandwich for me twice and the wrong size.  The small order of six garlic knots only came with 5.  Even though all of this we were determined to not let it ruin our night.  Because we could tell they were trying hard.  Then we saw this girl with a face tattoo taking an order over the phone and how she was just sassy and rolling her eyes on the phone.  That was when we decided to write a review. We got a sandwich. Pasta, garlic knots and one small soda.  Total was $38.93.  We would not recommend going to this place.  Spend your money elsewhere you will not feel happy after you eat here.
