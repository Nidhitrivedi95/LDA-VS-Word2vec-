The food is delicious and freshly made (at least my dish - the ravioli - was great and fresh).  The service is prompt and very professional.  There are not much things to say about the place because it is one of these places that you will definitely go back because your experience was nice.

Also keep in mind that the classification on Yelp might be a bit misleading; the place is an Italian restaurant rather than a (general) Mediterranean restaurant (but this is fine).

Only one down side for the place that the cork fee (because it is a BYOB) is 6$ (I find this rather unrealistic when a bottle of wine is $10-$12 :) )
