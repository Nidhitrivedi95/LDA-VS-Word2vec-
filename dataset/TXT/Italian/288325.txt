ZPAnqqAKLjg9uCN6Rk1lfg What a great addition to downtown! I haven't worked downtown in almost a year and decided to spend the evening down there.

 While waiting for our table at another place we stopped here to check it out and grab a snack. The shop was so bright, welcoming and clean. 

I ordered The Suppli Amatriciana which has  bacon, tomato sauce and Pecorino-Romano. For under $3 it was a great snack and tasted great. The wait was a little long but the counter girl explained whenever she delivered it that he first was burned. 

Other items that they offered were pizza. Maragrita pizza was about $8. A good size personal pizza or could easily be split. I believe it was a 4 cut. They also offer calzone.. Fried or baked. Plus a half calzone half margarita pizza item.

Decor is chic with black and white.. Adorable pops of red and trendy seats and accessories.  Kudos to the designer. Love it

My rice ball was great. I intend to stop back for pizza!
