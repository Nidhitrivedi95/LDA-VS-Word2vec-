wQMw6kc24uUQqqUGxe3Ztg Cute little restaurant located on Queen Street East. We picked up a groupon for this place and to be honest, would not have known it existed otherwise. It was a excellent surprise! Good service! Good food! Only minor negative was that you should expect to be seated for a long time. The appetizers and entrees took a long time to come out. I guess the positive is that your food is made fresh :). So don't come here if you are in a hurry, we stayed at this restaurant for more than 2 hours. 

Onto the food!
I chose the grilled calamari for my appetizer. Generous portion size! Well cooked! Lots of rings of yum!

I ordered the spaghettini carbonara for my entrée. The pasta was al dente, not overcooked at all. Sauce was just the right amount of creaminess and lots of bacon! 

Dessert, I ordered the tartufo ice cream, which was pretty standard.

Would come back again! Was a great surprise find! Make sure you make a reservation, this place is very small!
