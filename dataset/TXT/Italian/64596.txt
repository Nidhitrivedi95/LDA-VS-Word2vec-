bgCHcGeOBNQxDT95XvzNFQ I came here for lunch with the Network of Executive Women. We all got the buffet and had our own private room. The room was a little dark for a work lunch, but if I was here on a date it would have been very romantic. 

I've been to the Villa Antonios off South Boulevard and didn't really care for their buffet. The same story held here, where I could find much that I liked. I ended up with meatballs and wild rice soup. There weren't many choices and I left just wanting more. 

Hopefully dinner is better because I bought a Groupon.
