8EvgKu_VpVXJ0KUvrxS7BA Lets start off by me just stating that I work very hard for my money, as most young women without parents do in order to make it in this economy. So I hardly ever order delivery. Yesterday I was at home sick and decided delivery would be a great help since I was too sick to cook.

Well, Sarabella's seemed to have good deals so I went with them. To start the whole bad experience, the lady who answered already had a bad attitude when I asked if she delivered to my apartments (I'm new to the area so I didn't know my cross streets). She was beyond annoyed with me. Then gave me that "You're wasting my time" attitude. I believe her name was Nicole or something. Not sure, but she wasn't worth my time remembering her name so we're even.  

After the very frustrating experience trying to put in a simple order, I hung up on her. Then my food arrived and it seemed it was just sloppily put together. To make it worse, every thing was stapled! What the hell? Like literally, I had to pull apart TEN staples just to get to my food! 

I ordered the spaghetti w/ Italian sausage, 5 wings, and a slice of pizza. I planned to have the wings and pizza for lunch then spaghetti for dinner... but then it turns out the pizza was as hard and cold as Nicole's soul, so of course that went into the garbage...

The wings were okay...not as good as Streets of New York, but okay. The spaghetti was pretty good though. A little on the sweeter side, but the Italian sausage made it all better. :) 

The only reason why I didn't give this place 1 star was because of guess who...the delivery driver. That's it. He was pleasant and had my delivery to my house 15 minutes early. Go Glen Coco! High five. 

Won't ever get food from here again. So I'd advise you to beware of poor service and the risk of being humiliated by the Wicked Witch of Sarabella's.

...Yeah it was that bad. No exaggeration needed.
