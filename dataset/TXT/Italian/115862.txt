I came here with my daughter and son in law because my daughter is a huge Mario fan. I wish I could have left here being a fan of his food but it didn't happen. We ordered the pasta tasting menu and I was very disappointed in the cooking of most of the pasta.  Most dishes were pretty chewy, Flavors were just ok. Service that night was "eh, I showed up for work doesn't that count for something"
