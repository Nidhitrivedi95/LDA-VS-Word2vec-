6okGKL2PA7kkc-GjZzNHnA I've visited Johnny's on multiple occasions while in town for business. The food is okay. Certainly not bad, but not really remarkable either. Given that, I do find it to be overpriced. The Parmesan crusted steak is unique and good, but again, not something that will stand out as a must have again.
