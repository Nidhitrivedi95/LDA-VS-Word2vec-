rtYKSdUHpQO2Nyqy1-uAsQ I wish that I had more to say about this establishment, but since I didn't even have a chance to eat, I'm afraid my complaint will be brief. I passed it on my way to the bank on my lunch break and thought I'd give it a shot. I was intent on something fast, yet filling since I only had about 15 mins left. I could see that the staff weren't very engaged and there was no order in terms of placing an order. I waited a few mins while some people chatted amongst themselves in front of me in line, and another customer cut in front of me and proceeded to order. Now, I am not a confrontational person, but if there was some more order, I don't think that would happen. There were people waiting to order amongst those that were just waiting for their food to be ready. Annoyed at the poor service, I left and decided not to order anything. I've seen some bad reviews on this place but thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt...well, I doubt that I will be back.
