F73T-N5lRNL2Gcpg0Q4KKw The other night I went to Fat Ox for the first time and my oh my was I impressed! The concept is modern, yet so classic at the same time. I have to admit, I was a little uneasy about trying this place... But thanks to their stellar staff, my visit could not have been better. The idea here is to break up your meal into five courses. If you miss this key point, your experience will certainly lack. With that being said, the prices on this menu can add up fast if you don't share with those at your table. My friends and I chose to share with the table for the starting courses and "buddy up" with one other for the entree portion of the meal.

Many told us we HAD to try the table side caesar salad - so that's exactly what we did. The gentleman making it for us had suggested that we don't take the anchovies out like we requested. We went out on a limb with this one and we were all so glad that we did! It was ah-mazing! Next, we ordered the bellwether farms ricotta board for the table... Truly an excellent choice. Being a HUGE fan of all foods involving butternut squash, I made sure to continue our dining experience by ordering the casoncelli pasta dish. It was sweet, light, and super tasty! Like I said before, we all agreed to "buddy up" when it came to choosing our entrees. My friend and I shared the short rib dish which came with broccolini and an addicting special sauce on top. I knew after the first bite that I had found one of my new favorite restaurants... It was THAT good.

I truly cannot wait to come back to Fat Ox and explore their menu further. My biggest advice if it is your first time going - keep an open mind the entire night! Many things on the menu may intimidate you, but don't let that happen or you'll miss out on the unique dishes this place has to offer. And last but not least, if you are unsure, ask the staff questions! Our server and wait staff was SO friendly and willing to talk about our wants and concerns!
