ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A The food is very good. Nice selection. Quickly prepared. The servers are very attentive as is the host. However, server and host can be over the top with their friendlieness and trying to engage in conversations with you. Servers tend to "not know" the price of the specials and push too hard to get you to order extras, e.g., drinks, desserts, appetizers, salads. We have had two bad surprises when getting the check as things cost much more than we were led to believe. The attitude in the restaurant is first class luxury and if you are worried about the cost, then maybe this is not the place to go. Nice to see all the customers dressing up to go out for dinner. Comfortable atmosphere,
