XjAb0mxgCtq96pWWJjUBAg The food is fantastic tasting family style Italian fare. That's where the positive review ends, however. Dining in here is simply not an option for our family. We tried eating here once and waited 35 minutes after being seated to simply place drink orders. After deciding to give it another shot, we waited 25 minutes after being seated before giving up having never seen a server. The manager in this establishment simply has no care for her restaurant and the wait staff is inattentive at best. There is no reason to dine in here when you can get more reliable service elsewhere.
