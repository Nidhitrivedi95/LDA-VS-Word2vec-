xjjxHavx4RIiW6zS6rasGA Who doesn't like Italian?... I mean really... the food in this culture is fresh, flavorful though it can be unhealthy if all you eat is pasta...

It's refreshing to go into an Italian restaurant that knows how to do it. Everything from the people, the ambiance, the decor, the food, wine selections, etc. The half booth half table seating along the wall was quite comfortable and gave us a great view of the whole place. I also had the pleasure to speak with the owner for a bit and he is a genuine kind-hearted soul who really has passion that is hard to find in people now a days (Zoran Klisara). My baby got beer, I ordered a Sangiovese and my friend a peach cocktail.

We began our culinary journey with the calamari and I enjoyed it because the sauce was fantastic and it was not too greasy or salty like some places choose to fry up their seafood. My friend ordered the bucatini amatriciana, my baby ordered the braised short ribs and I ordered veal marsala. We shared a bit of each others and they were all fantastic dishes especially mine. It is actually quite easy for one to ruin a good veal dish (chewy, rubbery, no flavor, etc). Then when it came time to satisfy our sweet tooth, my friend ordered the highly recommended Amaretto dessert and I shared the sliced chocolate ice cream with nuts and strawberries.

It was simple and flavorful... all of it... not too over the top by trying too hard. Thank you for a great culinary experience!
