jcasci3gjbsSuTEVzvDQKg I crave Mama Ricottas! What a great place. Went tonight for my birthday dinner and it was delicious as always. The servers are always sharp and on point, salads are cold and pastas are piping hot. I had penne alla vodka (because I can't get that sauce right in my own kitchen!), my date had spinach fettuccine and his Alfredo sauce was light and delicious without being overly garlicky and thick as is the case some other places. Shrimp was juicy and perfect- also a struggle some other places (and in my kitchen... :) ) Tiramisu was perfect for dessert and enough to share. Manager Laura stopped by to check on our experience and she was lovely, as was our server and food delivery staff. Thanks Mama's!
