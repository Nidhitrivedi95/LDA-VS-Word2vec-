fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w The food here was a lot better than expected! Went here for a very late dinner and shared the chicken tenders, fried shrimp, and waffle fries. Y-U-M! The tenders were even better than I was expecting; delicious, enough crisp, and, yes, quite tender - not dry at all. The shrimp were big in size, the sauces paired delightfully. Fries were seasoned just right. 

I definitely recommend this place and might even make it a must go to when in Vegas.
