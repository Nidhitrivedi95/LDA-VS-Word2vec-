EsCpkEQo_3wFw5gP-Pz6GA I ordered 2 medium Pan Pizza's and an order of Chicken at 6:52 PM, and waited until 7:55 PM to call and see where my order was. They said that their driver was out on the road with the delivery. We live about less than 10 minutes away, so after another 15 minutes of waiting, I call them again, only for them to transfer me to two different people. One of them told me that once the pizza was done cooking, they would get it out to us ASAP. I told him the last time we called, they said it was already on the road to which he had no clue what was going on, but was told to wait another 15 minutes before calling again. What a bunch of crap. I guess it's better to just pick it up from this location because clearly they have no clue how to manage to go orders.
