Impossible to get anyone's attention to order a drink. Was "scolded" by the underage waitress because we had to finally WAVE from across the restaurant while she hung out with one of her co-workers. When we finally were served, NO ONE could be bothered to clear anything from the table unless we stopped them, stacked dishes and begged. Delivered the bill before delivering our last drinks..?? Definitely will NOT return unless management gets a clue and trains this staff. Just because you landed a job at the "new hotspot" does not entitle you to give lousy service with an attitude. Way, WAY too many choices in the area. Get it together Postino or this place will be like so many in N. Scottsdale... collecting dust. People return for atmosphere and SERVICE more than anything, trust me.
