I go to the turf more often than I'd care to admit and I've always wondered what the food here was like.  I'm really picky when it comes to pizza or italian food as most places tend to put way too much sugar in their marinara.  

A friend and I wanted to try some place neither of us had been and I'd heard good things about this place from some friends so I decided to give it a try.  We ordered a salad, pizza and a couple drinks.  We were both blown away with not only the service but the food as well.  

There are a couple of artisan pizza places not that far from Pomo that get a lot of attention but I'm honestly not a fan.  Pomo is hands down my favorite pizza place in AZ.
