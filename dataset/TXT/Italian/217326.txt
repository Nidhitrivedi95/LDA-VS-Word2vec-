RXyM7VrCiEFthJxQ4bGmBg We had meals from the prix fixe menu. The salad was crisp and fresh with goat cheese. The tomato dill soup was flavorful but the dill was quite subtle. The entrees were plentiful and delicious. The Spanish paella included 9 mussels surrounding the rice, chicken, shrimp, sausage and mushrooms. The Angus steak was cooked to order with a nice seasoning on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes.
Dessert was a pleasant surprise. The chocolate lava cake had a white vanilla creamy center. The creme caramel was quite good, very similar to a Mexican flan.
