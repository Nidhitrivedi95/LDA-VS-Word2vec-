srIy6x9Z_6hEHuGPE6L0dw Absolutely the best sole I've ever had in my life!  The restaurant is just lovely, the waiter could not have been any better!  We thoroughly enjoyed the bread and the white beans that came with it.  I have a birthday coming up and will have my party at Rudy's!  Just a fabulous dining experience!
