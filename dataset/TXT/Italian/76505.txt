They have a wood burning pizza oven.  Tried the margharita pizza and it wasn't bad, but a bit on the doughy side. Overall cooked well.  I also had the campellini w/ garlic shrimp pasta.  The pasta was a complete mush and looked like it had been sitting under a heating lamp for an eternity.  It broke into pieces when sticking my fork in.  Far overdone, although I don't doubt it may have tasted better fresh.

The waitress did let us know they are completely revising the menu to a more tapas oriented style, so there is still hope.  There isn't too much choice in liberty village and they do have a nice patio, so if you end up here in the near future stick to the pizzas and booze.
