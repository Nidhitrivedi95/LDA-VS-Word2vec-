53BSdnhzcCBfBH_6TgX63Q This originally started out to be a less than one star review. Last night I ordered a pizza to be delivered to my house less than a mile away. It took about an hour, no complaint there. When my pizza arrived the guy seemed in a big hurry, so much so that he didn't even check to see if I had given him the right amount. I had also given him a tip. So I took the pizza inside and opened it to find it was a scrambled mess. Part of the pizza was stuck to the top of the box and the rest was all piled in a heap in one corner. I was not a HAPPY CAMPER and was ready to give them a bad review but decided to call and give them a chance to redeem themselves. The lady was very appoligic and offered to have my order redone and delivered. About 30 minutes later my pizza was delivered by a different driver who was very apologetic. He took the scrambled pizza, appologized again and left. 
The pizza was very good and the Customer Service was excellent. I "may" even order again but maybe next time I will pick it up myself.
