A7waf6G3cvnLfAqKeLL8DA OK finally made it here after having this place bookmarked for eons. The buca bar experience helped expedite this I suppose. I didn't have much time to explore the main menu beforehand so spent a bit of time exploring while seated and waiting for the DC. There were some interesting options but the tasting menu seemed like the best value proposition. Unfortunately they wouldn't sub stuff on the tasting menu so ended up getting the vegetarian tasting with a wine pairing. 
Here goes: 
Fragole: Decent start but didn't wow IMO. 35 year balsamic should have been a stand out but I couldn't find it
Pamodor e Ricotta: just too sweet and would have even passed on as a healthy dessert (whatever that means)
Fromagi: Cheese course hmm another ho hum offering and wine choice was poor IMO sparkling red just didn't go with this course but does it go well with anything?
Gnocchi: Strong cheese with a good wine pairing and brown butter added to the body of this dish. 
Parmigiana Di Melanzane: Very good. I have been liking my egg plant dishes lately and this one fit the bill. Nice combo of tastes and textures (the crispness on the eggplant really stood out IMO) 
Amuse Dessert Granita with yogurt. Didn't have the tang one associates with Granita IMO
Ciambella di Pistachio: Good hefty dessert. Lots of pistachio flavor.
I would say 3.5 overall. Two of the wine pairings were decent while others were just OK to what the! (I guess its very hard to pair wine with vegetables) Service was decent though they need to improve a few things. They should have more lighting in the washroom area as one has to just wander in the dark to find the light switch. The entrance is very hard to spot if you haven't been here before as with construction going on next door one you wouldn't know where to go.
