aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ The reviews are true. If you're looking for a fantastic dining experience in Arizona, NOCA is your place. 

I have to say, I was a little surprised - in a good way - at the vibe. I was expecting something smaller and a little more stuffy. This is not at all the case! It was packed (on a Wednesday night) had great music playing and the lighting was just right. There's was a mix of people too which was nice - not the older demographic I was expecting. (I wish it wasn't next door to a Safeway or Great Clips, but once you're inside, you completely forget about that). 

Besides the amazing food ... complete with cotton candy for dessert (how fun is that?) the service was FANTASTIC. Probably the best we've had in the Valley. Every person in there was working hard and it really made for a fabulous experience. We were treated to "tastes" of various menu items and even though we splurged, the bill was not bad at all. Totally fair for the food and experience. 

I'd HIGHLY recommend the cocktail with a jalepeno in it - I'm going back to their bar (yes, they have a small bar inside too - who knew?) JUST for that drink. Yum. 

Nice, work NOCA. My only wish is that we would have met years ago.
