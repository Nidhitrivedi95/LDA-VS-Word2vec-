q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Sandwiches are good.  However, the choice of the two sides available leaves much to be desired.  With the sandwiches, which were all about $10, one side is offered from only two selections....pasta salad or fries.  No choices of substitution are allowed; someone in our group with dietary restrictions asked if she could substitute anything else....broccoli, a side salad, cottage cheese, coleslaw.  No substitutions are available.  She was told she could just not get the side if she wanted.  Same price.  The pasta salad was awful, as were the fries.  The fries come with some kind of weird sauce on them.....a mayonnaise based sauce that wrecked the fries.  One person ordered the fries without the sauce.  They were average at best. I feel this restaurant should expand the selection of the two sides that no one in our group of 5 liked at all. The house salad was basically lettuce that was not good.  There were a few microscopic pieces of tomato...not bigger than 1/2 of a square centimeter.  With so many choices in Las Vegas, Capo's needs to serve better side dishes.
