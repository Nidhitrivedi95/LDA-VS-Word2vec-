Os1NdWfFCpz9FWa4gDOLRw My daughter wanted to go here because the one in Denver was supposedly wonderful.  I was not impressed with the food at all.   The wait staff was nice.  The restaurant was just "okay."  It wasn't horrible, but not good enough to eat there again.  Save your money and go to Olive Garden!
