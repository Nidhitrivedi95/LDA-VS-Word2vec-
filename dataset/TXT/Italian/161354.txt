lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ This is the Las Vegas spot! Great happy hour, super cheap drinks and 2.50 slices of pizza. What the heck, a diamond! So glad we found this place especially since we have been cashing out this whole trip. Brandon was our server and he was great.  He paced out our apps, salad, and entrees.  He suggested great local draft beers and was super informative about the happy hour menu!  Loved his service and the food was tasty af. If your in the luxor/Mandalay bay area stop in for a cold brew and smiling faces.  High marks!
