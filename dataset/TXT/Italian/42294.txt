7qo6rqDjlHds8ObxzxBD4A Garlic knots were excellent, as was the marinara sauce for dipping.  I would say the pizza wasn't anything super special but it was tasty for sure.  The hot wings were good as well- the sauce was very good- the actual wings could have had a bit more meat on them. We ordered a 7 count and recieved only actual wings- no drum sticks, but they weren't the puniest wings I've ever had, so all in all they were more than decent.

We ordered online through Yelp and it took about an hour for delivery, which was a bit longer than the original quote but not outrageous.  We will definitely be repeat customers!
