qUWqjjjfpB2-4P3He5rsKw The pizza tastes like cardboard. Please don't waste your money on their pizza. It truly is disgusting.

Their pasta on the other hand is half decent. I used to frequently order it on uber eats for lunch at work. I liked it better before they raised their prices. They used to charge $11 for plain old pomodoro pasta and now it is $14. 

Their desserts are mediocre at best. 

This place is an okay lunch place but I would never want to be taken here on a date. The food is not worthy of sharing with somebody else.
