366FaRQ1MWEHBhaEKTcriQ My job frequently gets catering from this place and there are never any leftover slices within 10min of the entire floor being aware. It was so good i decided to go there for lunch one afternoon. The location is very strange as it's down an industrial drive so you can almost miss it. 

I will just add to the overall sentiment shared by everyone that this is the best tasting pizza there is....in Arizona. I haven't had the pies from up North but I can't imagine them tasting much better than this. A solid 8.
