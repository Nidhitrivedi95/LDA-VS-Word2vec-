lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ Too bad, I had to give them a star!!! IF I  would have a choice... NO STARS, at all! They said they were busy,  to receive our appetizer one hour later!! Like fricking seriously... I wanted to get up and leave, but my party said give them 5more minutes. Ughhh... food sucked!! Service was slow!!! A couple came in 20 mins before we left and got their appetizers 15mins after. WTF!!!! Sorry, I'm still furious because I paid SO much money for food I can cook at home and be done in 30mins.
