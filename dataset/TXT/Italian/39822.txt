7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ we were staying in the palazzo in vegas last so we decided to grab dinner at carnevino..i was excited since its a mario batalli's restaurant. we all ordered something different. but since i had my wisdom teeth pulled just 2 weeks before i tried to stay away from the beef and lamb so i ordered the duck (medium) which was served over roasted beets and farro (never found out what that was though)..the duck was good and tender and i was so happy it had beets because i have been craving it recently, i wish it had more beets though. my friend ordered the lamb chop, and OH MAN, his plate came out with 3 big thick lamb chops..it was tender and juicy, it did not have a very gamy flavor either..my other friend ordered the veal..again OH MAN it came on a HUGE bone (looked like some Flinstone caveman stuff!) but it was so tender and melted in my mouth! the others ordered pasta and steak which i did not try...my friend ordered the gnocchi but i did not like it very much..the sauce on it kind of reminded me of hamburger helper?? but i think it was because it was more of a red/tomato sauce base on it which I am not a fan of so I may be bias here...but definitely it was a good experience because our waiter was very friendly and we were also the youngest group there ages ranging from 24-32 dressed in shorts and tees etc...and we were joking around with him...but if you want a nice meal that's not too fancy I say come here but you better be craving meat or want wine..hence the name of the restaurant...definitely good eats!
