FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA First time today for lunch with a dear friend.  Wonderful place.  Had the vegetarian panini.  It was served on either focaccia bread or ciabatta bread.  I chose focaccia and it was the best!  You can't even tell that it was a vegarian sandwich.  Wonderful flavors and the accompanying salad was delish.  Salad is tossed with pine nuts in a flavorful vinigrette.  Our friend had their mixed green salad and it looked fantastic.  Appeared to have honey roasted pecans mixed in.  Hubby had the turkey panini on ciabatta bread.  He paired his sandwich with Yukon potato chips, which was very good.

Overall, this place gets my vote for several return visits so I can try other menu items -- like their bruchetta.

A must visit and dine place if you are ever in Phoenix.
