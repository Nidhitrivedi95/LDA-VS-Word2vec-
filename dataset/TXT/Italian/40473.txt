7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ I had the chalk hill cab.  Our party had steak tartar and filet.  It was good, but the waiter ominously announced that because of the size of our party (6), the steaks would be cooked medium or well done only.  I left shortly after this announcement.  A steakhouse that can't accommodate a rare steak for a small group cannot be that good.
