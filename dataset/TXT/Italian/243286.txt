UQiUVCtG-rJxoriuEv1RRQ Me and my wife went here for valentines day with our two daughters, let's start off with our server "Amanda". In the beginning she was very friendly, well spoken thought she was very nice young lady. After she taken our order is like she forgotten we were there. She never came back to check on us, WORSE !! Server ever took a long time for everything. My word of advice is to avoid her, Food was good  just can't believe I paid 30 bucks for a tiny steak and 3 small portions of side. The owner needs to really focus more on new first time customers than cheat chating drinking her ass off.
