Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag My fiancée and I grabbed dinner here and it was one of the worst dining experiences we have endured.  We ordered drinks and the meatballs immediately and waited 20 minutes for my wine and another 30 for the horrible - worse than frozen - meatballs.  They brought us drinks we didn't order, and a simple margarita pizza took over an hour.  Our server avoided us so she didn't have to explain everything.  

The pizza finally came and was the best thing we had.  It took well over an hour.  

There are too many great restaurants in Vegas to put up with bad service and so so food. Wolfgang should be embarrassed.
