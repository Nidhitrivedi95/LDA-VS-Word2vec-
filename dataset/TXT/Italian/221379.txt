SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg An interesting evening to say the least!  My reservation was for 6:15 and I was seated quickly at a small, inappropriate placed, highly dysfunctional table.  The saving grace was that I could watch the fountains at the Bellagio during my meal.  My waiter was attentive and I was served my salad fairly quickly, however, it went downhill from there.  As my main entree I ordered the Risotto with rhubarb and cooked prosciutto.  It was an interesting choice, one that didn't turn me off as I kept eating, but one that left me not knowing what I thought of it.  During my meal, it was over an hour before anyone stopped and asked me how I was doing.  I flagged my waiter to ask for the dessert menu, another 15 minutes before asking what I'd like, another 15 before it came, which wasn't worth the wait.  I could have gone home and made it myself, and it would have been a lot better.  The Tiramisu was DIGUSTING!!!  When you're with a group, I understand you can spend a couple of hours enjoying a meal but dining with just one other person, it shouldn't take 2 hours and 15 minutes for one person. I read some of the other reviews and I most certainly don't agree with them.  This is one restaurant I won't be revisiting!
