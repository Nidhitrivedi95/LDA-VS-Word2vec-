RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ I love their pizza!  Ordering take out is so easy.  I have yet to experience a long hold or an inaccurate order! I also like that they don't bombard you with "would you like to try" questions before you have a chance to order.  The wait to pick up your pizza has ranged from 15-30 minutes, 30 on a weekend night.  My dad has been stopping by to visit me more and making excuses to order pizza!!! So he drives 45 minutes just for this pizza!
