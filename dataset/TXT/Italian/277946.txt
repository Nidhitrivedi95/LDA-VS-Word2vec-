YJS7cXGLAvWw9DUDXpw84Q I was too tired to cook and I wanted to have spaghetti and meatballs so I decided to give Babbo a try...

I ordered take out online. I ordered Garlic Cheese Crostini appetizer ($6.95), a child's spaghetti and meatball with milk ($6.00), an adult spaghetti and meatballs (online $10.95 but only $5.95 when I picked it up) and a side salad ($3.95). Total bill was roughly $26.00. It was ready by the time I got there in 15 minutes so that was good. They gave me the discount price on the adult meal, so that was good. I thought the crostini was rather bland. The spaghetti sauce was not my favorite, but the meatballs were really tasty. I grew up in an Italian family, so I know tasty balls of meat! My salad was okay. I ended up getting too much balsamic vinegar on it so all I tasted was vinegar, but it looked good before that happened. I would say the biggest issue was that they did not give me the milk that was ordered with the kids meal.

All in all, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't outstanding either. I would probably try it again in the hopes I found a dish I really liked.
