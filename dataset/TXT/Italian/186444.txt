or4yipilbCkKIFnF1RP5Ow My wife and I just got done with a lovely evening at Skye Bistro.  We were celebrating our 45th wedding anniversary. Our waitress was Lisa and she was fantastic, very professional and accommodating to our needs.  She checked on us frequently to make sure everything was prepared correctly and to see if we needed anything else.
My wife ordered the Dublin Lawyer and I had the special, A fillet on top of portobello mushrooms and spinach.  My steak was prepared perfectly.  
The Dublin Lawyer however, was a little disappointing, as there was only  two tiny lobster claws in the entire plate.  I have had that dish twice before, and  if memory serves me, there was more lobster than the two small claws that my wife was served.
Other than the disappointment with the Dublin Lawyer, we had an excellent time.  We shared a bottled of Howling Moon wine which was great and finished the meal by splitting a flourless dark chocolate dessert.
We ate outside, even though the temperature was still in the 80's, we were bathed in shade and had a nice breeze.
