As it was the last week to have my dad in town, we decided to try this always-have-fancy-cars (Aston Martin, anyone?) parked outside steakhouse. It was not busy at 6:30 on a Thursday night, we both felt the restaurant is too dark and too loud!

Food was delicious! Medium rare filet was juicy and nicely cooked, the steamed asparagus on the side was very fresh, and the Alaskan king crab legs, wow, a lot of them and very salty!

While we enjoyed the food, served with excellent service, we just felt like it was missing something, but can't really describe to detail. Personally, I just didn't really get the outside to be all so fancy swanky, but no peace to be found anywhere inside, and what's up with the metal-ish decor?

I will just say, yeah, I tried, for a better quality of food and price, I would much prefer J&G.
