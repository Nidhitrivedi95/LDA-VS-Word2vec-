Toux3q1WwY2vNV5AhbR6wQ Really didn't love it, and really REALLY wanted to since it's within walking distance of our home.  The place seems to be having an identity crisis- upscale vs. neighborhood spot, trendy vs. homey, fine dining vs... Olive Garden?  Cold (ie refrigerated, bought elsewhere, couldn't even be bothered to pop it in the oven for show) bread in an Italian restaurant left a bad taste from the start, and the food was over-salted and heavy- nothing you couldn't make at home.  The corkage fee has been commented on but bears mentioning again- totally over the top.  This review is a bit late- we tried it in the summer- so we're going back for another shot and hoping for better.
