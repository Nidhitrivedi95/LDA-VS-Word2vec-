TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag Not sure why other Yelpers are complaining about service, but we had no issues and no waiting (maybe because we had a 9:45 reservation on a Thursday night). My friends and I agreed on the dishes we were gonna share beforehand and ordered the second we sat down, also letting the waiter know that we'd appreciate the check ASAP as we have tickets for the 11pm show next door ;-p
We ordered the my standard spaghetti frutti di mare which was delicious and seafood-filled as always, and a salad. 
After paying our check, we left the restaurant and realized that we were so efficient with dinner that we still had time to kill! We spotted a happy hour which offered $5 sangria, so naturally we went. We then realized that we're just in the bar area of the the restaurant. The sangria glasses were huge and it was delicious. 
I wouldn't go out of my way to come here (Excalibur eek), but good option for dinner if you are at this end of the strip for some reason
