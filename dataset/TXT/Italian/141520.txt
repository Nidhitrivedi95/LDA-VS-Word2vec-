jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg There comes a time in nearly every chain restaurant when something goes wrong. You can tell a good restaurant from a bad one by the way they handle it.  We experienced this first hand a few weeks ago.  We ordered the Bucatini Ala Enzo, Pancetta, Prosciutto, button mushrooms, peas and pasta.  Well while eating, I discovered wax paper still on the prosciutto.  I informed our waitress who apologized and went to find out what it was.  While she was gone, we found several more pieces.   The manager came out, apologized, explained what it was, offered us a replacement entree and comped our meal.  There you have it, a well handled mess.  We love Buca, the portions are worth it, the prices are value for the amount of food you get, and usually the quality is above average, especially for a chain.  They handled this situation very well and we were left satisfied that it would be safe to come back again.  Till next time...
