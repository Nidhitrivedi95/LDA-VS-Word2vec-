YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg It has been a couple of years since we were last at Panevino and were extremely happy we took our friend there for dinner. They have updated their menu since I was last time, and there is a full section on the menu dedicated to vegetarian/vegan/gluten free from appetizers through desserts.  We all had wonderful meals and I was over the moon with my organic "Meatloaf" 
(which was mixed legume, wild mushroom and herb "meatloaf" on a bed of garlic and rosemary mashed potatoes in a fresh tomato and Kalamata olive sauce). It was absolutely delicious! The setting is very nice, especially during the evening hours to watch the airplanes taking off & landing at McCarran Int'l Airport. Service was exceptional from start to finish. I can't wait to go back!!
