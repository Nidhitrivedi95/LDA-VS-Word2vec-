q4mx-ff4_LvU3NnMvNIrZA Sammies was a great spot for some happy hour apps where some are half price. I did find the mussels to be a little overdone, but the flavor was good and the bread was very fresh and warm. 

The fried mozz was really good and a nice portion size. The wings were also tasty. They were decently crispy and the sauces were great. The parm garlic was straight up melted butter and a lot of it, with some parm and garlic. I was worried when I saw that much butter but it was actually really good! 

The service was excellent too.
