DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw When I'm in the mood for Italian food (which is pretty much every day), there's no place I'd rather go than Ferraros.   I've been a regular since I moved to Vegas three years ago and my girlfriend even gets frustrated because it's the only place I ever want to eat.  For a great lunch join Nina at the bar.  The "love your lunch" specials include soup or salad and a delicious entree!  Free for happy hour?   The small plates happy hour menu is the best deal in town.  Ask for Anna, she's the sweetest waitress in the lounge.   If you are a Vegas local, Ferraros has AMAZING local deals every night....just ask your server.  If you sit in the dining room you need to ask for Kimberly. Not only is she knowledgeable about the menu, but so funny and makes for a most enjoyable evening. My favorite dishes include  all the homemade pastas, the osso buco,  carpaccio,  the dover sole.....and I always save room for the pistachio passion!  For a romantic date night,  dinner with the parents,  or boys night out.....Ferraros is the best restaurant in Las Vegas!
