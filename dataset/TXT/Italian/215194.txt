RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ My wife and I were excited to try this restaurant as it was recommended by a couple of dealers and the hotel concierge. It was our anniversary and were excited to sit down and try something new and kid free. We are from Colorado and like to eat outdoors when ever possible. We made a reservation and hostess was kind and fun to talk to on the way to the fun and unique patio. But thats about it. After 25 minutes and an overwhelmed server who came to use multiple times saying that he would be with us shortly. We left after near 30 minutes of waiting just for a drink. We did not care to stay and see the performance. The server appeared overwhelmed with 8 tables. Two others were floating around but did little to nothing.  This place was just a diaster and we left.
