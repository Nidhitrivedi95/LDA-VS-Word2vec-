bRR4gsjHv0F_RnRGjQBqlg I grew up in Philly so water ice and rita's water ice were common place. My wife and I often talked about finding a good place for water ice.

Well we found it! 

We have tried most the flavors, Right now the mango gelati is my favorite. 

We have gotten CJ's 4 times in the first week or two since it opened.

With summer right around the corner I'm sure we will be back many more times.
