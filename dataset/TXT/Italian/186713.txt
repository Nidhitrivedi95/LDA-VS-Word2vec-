Orgm9nmcClxnAUva4nOKyA Soooo I was downtown looking for food and came across this place.. 

A few things to highlight:

Food was average...  I ordered the hot house penne...  It was spicier than I thought it would be...  But perhaps I'm just a Lil panzy...  There was a robust amount of sausage in my pasta which was good but there was so much more meat than pasta...  If rather have more than less but there needs to be a nice balance...  Was still a decent dish.. My gf got the sicilian gnocci which she said the pasta was a little too mooshy...  Her pasta was pretty heavy... 

The nachos were good.... Portions here were pretty good especially since we had to pack up all 3 dishes lol... 

Our server James was pretty friendly Imo.... 

Service in general was a little slow but not as bad as some other yelpers have received...  But we went at like 6 pm... 

Ohhh one thing that can be improved is to provide complimentary bread...  That should be standard at a place like this... 

Overall I wouldn't mind going back and perhaps try something else... 

So congrats Hot House Cafe you are TooTuff approved!!!!
