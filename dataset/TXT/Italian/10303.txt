While on another trip to the sin city;) my bf and I chose to celebrate our 3 years anniversary at this restaurant after many yelping, looking for the perfect spot for this occasion .
We set at the bar area and arrived just in time for happy hour, which means we could enjoy multiple dishes and cocktails at a very reasonable price.
We orders almost the entire happy hour appetizer menu, as well as another main course from the regular menu, and were taken by every single dish.
Started with burrata crostini, short rib agnolotti (which we later ordered again since it was so phenomenal), the sea food dish, creamy polenta and the Tagliatelle
fall vegetables, truffle zabagalione & guanciale.
We finished with the most amazing Nutella mini donuts- to die for!!!
Our bar tender was ok, not very verbal, but it didn't matter since we enjoyed each other's company and the food was amazing!
If you are in Vegas, and looking for a delicious meal, don't skip this place!
