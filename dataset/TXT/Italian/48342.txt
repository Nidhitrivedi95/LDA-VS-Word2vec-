93FVxoipAIYG07gisMOQhw I recently found this restaurant when I was having a hankering for some good spaghetti and meatballs. I work in East Mesa and am not terribly familiar with mom & pop places nearby. I was blown away by how good this to-go order was! The pasta was al dente and the sauce was absolutely delicious. It also came with a generous portion of bread and a salad, all for a very reasonable price... about $10. 

My next trip was only a week later (today) when I ordered the prosciutto and arugula panini. This sandwich is to die for! If you're a fan of this salty meat, you will not find a better one around. It is topped with provolone cheese, roasted red peppers, arugula, and a red wine vinegarette. I also received a side of potato chips which taste and appear to be homemade. Total came to $9.29 after tax.

There are many other items on the menu I would like to try. While some items are more expensive than others, keep in mind there is a lunch specials menu to choose from. 

This will definitely be a new go-to place for me!
