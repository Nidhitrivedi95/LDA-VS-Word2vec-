anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg This is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Las Vegas and my personal favorite. A hidden gem that has a speakeasy feel to it. A lot of scenes from the movie Casino was filmed there and I'm sure that the mob has eaten here at one point haha. 

I've been here 4 or 5 times and every dining experience was phenomenal! I don't think I've ever looked at their menu because I've only ever ordered off the verbal specials. My boyfriend and I almost always order the Garbage Caesar Salad,  Osso Buco, and the Bone-in Veal Parmesan. Once you have the garbage Caesar salad, every other salad comes second. This is the best Caesar salad ever! They have somehow made a simple salad taste exceptional. The Osso Buco has been a house specialty for forever now! The meat is always so tender and the bone marrow is always a delightful treat. The Veal Parmesan is so yummy and just melts in your mouth. It's really flavorful! 

It's definitely a fancy pansy place but they don't have have artfully plated dishes. What's more important? Food that looks good or food that taste good? Definitely food that tastes good! I'll definitely keep coming here for years to come and I will recommend this restaurant over and over again! 

Other than the great food, the service is also outstanding so go try this place out!
