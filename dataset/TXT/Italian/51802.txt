My first dine here I had a good sandwich and said I would come back for Pizza!  So I checked out the Pizza and I'm a fan (kinda).  I liked the Sauce being sweet and I liked that the sauce was not thin, there is quite a bit on there!  The Cheese has good flavor and I liked that they do not put as much on as most places.  I liked the thickness of the crust though it lacks flavor, was too plain and a little too dry!

This Pizza has good flavor though I drive a lot further to get the Pizza I love most!  If it were not for the competition I would chose this place every time, there are just a few that I enjoy better!

The Desserts: Rainbow Cookies and Shell Dipped in Chocolate Cannoli were three Yelp stars A-OK, meaning I wouldn't recommend them.
