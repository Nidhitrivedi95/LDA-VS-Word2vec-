2Zd3yaOcmUTYhIcI2DNfDA First time at this location. However, not a newbie to Barro's. I had my first time a few months ago at the Barro's in AJ, near my boyfriend's dad's house. We went there because I was craving wings and my boyfriend suggested it. They serve freshly made pizzas, pastas, and wings. They have this promotion where you can get 24 wings and either a Large or Extra Large One topping pizza for either $26 or $28 depending on the pizza. We got that deal and it is so much food for the two of us BUT it is beyond delicious. After my first visit, I had dreams and cravings to go back. It's that good. 
For the wings, we normally get a dozen Honey BBQ and a dozen medium because you can mix and match. For the pizza, we get the pepperoni; can't go wrong with that. They have won awards for their pizza and the restaurant. We once sat down and ate and I overheard these bikers, who sat next to us, came from across the nation and found this Barro's on YELP and said to the workers "It's the Best Pizza in Arizona". 
To me, it's really good. I am sure there are great pizzas and wings elsewhere but this place needed to be mentioned. Will be back VERY SOON!!!
