wp5FAtCGMyU2RnQ-7kxKHQ I have been here about a dozen times. It is the only sort of fancy restaurant in this area. Last night I ordered from the the "Valentines" menu. I ordered the Surf& Turf /8 oz fillet (med. rare), and Turf/7 oz Lobster tail. What I received was a med-med-well filet, and a 4 oz tail. When I brought this up with my server, the manager came back, insisting that it was 6.5 oz, but at the same time offering a second 4 oz tail one to make up the difference. About 6 months ago I ordered a prime rib for lunch, and was served a sirloin, as I wouldn't notice? The manager "Fred" said that the cook probably opened the wrong pouch as that's how they receive them. Another time I was there on Sunday night which is "Prime Rib" night, and had to explain to my server what an end cut was, she had never heard of it? Maybe I should stick with the Hamburger which most people seem to get and it  looks good!
