TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag Ate at this location last Sunday with my wife and daughter.  Very good food and huge portions!!  We ordered the "Bucca Small" size lasagna and still had plenty to take home with us, and I'm a plenty big eater!  We also tried the sampler appetizer with fried raviolis, cheese sticks and calamari.  It was also excellent, the calamari was particularly good and prepared just right to be tender and not tough.

The meatballs are a Bucca signature dish as each one is 1/2 lb.  They are a must try and are very good and taste homemade.  The prices are a little higher than you would pay in an family restaurant like Olive Garden, however it is an excellent spot to celebrate Valentine's Day, a birthday or special occasion.  Very excellent Italian cuisine, we will definately try it again soon!
