eQCYur0033RkZdh5VjbF8A This place should not have the O&B name associated with it. I ordered a pizza and pasta for myself and my friend. As soon as the pizza came out it looked wrong, thick cheese in the middle, greasy, like something from Pizza PIzza. The pasta was nothing special either.

At the end of the meal when the waiter asked how everything was, I told him the truth. All he did was apologize for us not being satisfied. It would have been nice if he had sent a manager to get some more info in order to do better next time, but no, nothing.

I did send an email to their head office and received a missed call from the manager, but that was it. I expect more when I'm paying that kind of money for pizza and pasta.
