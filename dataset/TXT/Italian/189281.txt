OyiOg9GYKzHI19EbnWqL8A The food here was pretty good.  My pasta primavera was nice, and the soup special we had was delicious.  The wine, though, was a tiny glass for $5 (a special price), which was a bit of a disappointment.

But I have to say that the decor here is pretty ick.  The music was from 5 years ago and the zebra print and chandeliers... well, I guess I wasn't really prepared for the Jersey chic ambiance.
