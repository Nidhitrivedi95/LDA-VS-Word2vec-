JK_DiDwbl7HX5OhCAh3h4g Café Diplomatico is a Toronto staple.  Back when my sister used to live in this neighbourhood (and street car stops were announced by living people instead of sexy computer voices) the street car driver would call out this stop as "Café Diplomatico" instead of the actual street name ("Clinton St.")

The Dip celebrated its 40th anniversary this year, and it's not hard to see why.  Their food is delicious.  I've enjoyed their veal sandwiches, their bacon and egg breakfasts, and most importantly their pizza.  Oh my goodness their pizza.

Now granted, this is no Chicago deep dish pizza (very jealous of Chicago about this) but as far as Pizza in Toronto goes?  Delicious.  It's just the fact that it tastes like what I imagine pizza is supposed to taste like.  It's the opposite of the processed cheese of pizza.  It feels like its made with love.

Unfortunately, their popularity has interfered with me enjoying some pizza, veal, coffee or whatever many times.  To get a seat you either have to be prepared to wait in line, or you have to be lucky.  There's really no two ways about it.
