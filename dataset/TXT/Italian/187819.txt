OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ I was in search for something authentic and amazing.  Authentic I guess but unfortunately not amazing.  I can't really put my finger on it but overall was not overwhelmed.  I have had better and I have had worse. They do offer specials by the slice and of course a yelp check in which they forgot to pack in my bag .  Catering deals seem a little pricey. I would suggest decide from your self and give it a try but don't expect too much.
