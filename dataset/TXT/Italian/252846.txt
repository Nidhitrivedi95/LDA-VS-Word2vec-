VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Dined at Lavo friday night aug 23rd. What an amazing experience! The food was as usual outstanding. Atmosphere always killer. But I want to mention what great service we had from start to finish. Being that it was the usual busy friday night we were being "navigated " to our table where on the way a very pleasant waitress smiled  as she stepped out of our way and wished us a great dinner! How nice! Turns out the same waitress is going to be our server. Off to a great start. Jojo was still just as pleasant and enrhusiastic as she started off w some wine and cocktail suggestions all of wich we took and loved. As dinner went on our whole table became enamoured w watching this pro at work. A table of older customers laughing smiling..clearly a bachelorette party of all girls joking about having an enviable little party w her. After encountering so many snobby money grubbing servers in vegas and all over it was so refreshing to watch a true pro at work. Everything else was secondary. She even escorted my wife to the ladies room! Wow! Blown away. Will be back again and will always request jojo!
