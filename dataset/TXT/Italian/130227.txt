iAD5r5vNOzc1AP6UA5yFiQ This was my first time here yesterday! My mom was with me and we had amazing food! I ordered the lemon garlic chicken with roasted potatoes and mom got the calamari. Both dishes were awesome! I got a cappuccino and a small marscapone gelato afterwards. Those were awesome as well! I will say that the restaurant wasn't too busy, and my mom kept getting frustrated when she needed her wine glass filled. That's not going to stop us from coming back!
