FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA I love Postino. I live a few blocks away from the Arcadia location but go to Central probably one out of every four times. My boyfriend lives downtown and it's more convenient sometimes. I've grown to enjoy this location slightly more than Arcadia due to the airy atmosphere and large, open bar area. Don't get me wrong--I still love Arcadia very much.
Like everyone else, I love the bruschetta, but I tend to come for brunch more often now. The french toast is probably my favorite menu item. I admit that I might indulge in a glass of wine before the clock strikes noon. Usually, it's a Mimosa for me, though. Here, they are made the way they should be (more champagne than orange).   ;-) 

Yay for Postino.  :-)
