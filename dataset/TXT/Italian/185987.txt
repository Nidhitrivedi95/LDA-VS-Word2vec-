oNptGQ-jHp4NG1HzO8I4_A Had dinner here last night.  The food is very basic Italian fare - but not too bad.  If you are looking for something like linguine & clams or frutti da mare - do not come here.  The problem is really not the food - it's the attitude they give off.  Very brusque and uncaring.  They all really seem as though they don't care if you ever come back!   And they succeeded - because we won't be back.  They rely on the fact that they have very little competition and that most of the residents of Sun City, Sun City West and Sun City Grand are unwilling to drive off the "reservation".
