klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw I'm surprised that the ratings for this place is all over the place.  We had a great experience here.  

After an awesome day at Wet Republic and returning to Encore to get ready, we realized we weren't going to make our 6:30 reservation at Mix all the way across town at Mandalay Bay, so we called concierge and got hooked up with an 8 pm reservation right down stairs at Society with their $36 prix fixe.

We got ready, headed down and looked at the menu.  To my dismay, the prix fixe menu didn't have the petite filet that the concierge mentioned (which sold me on choosing this place in the first place).  A quick inquiry with our super cool waiter Todd later, we found out that they changed the menu cuz they don't have that size filet anymore but the chef was going to accommodate us with the regular size filet (which retailed at $36 per plate).  Win!

So for dinner, 4 girls all picked Mac and cheese bits and almost all picked the steak (Connie had the triangle shaped penne pasta which was DELICIOUS *she was barely eating cuz she was having a hiccup-giggle problem* ;P so Betty and I helped her out with her meal)

The Mac and Cheese bits with truffle oil were definitely the best mac and cheese I've had.  The filet was perfectly cooked, but one fingerling potato cut in half was more like garnish than a side. The donut dessert with caramel and chocolate sauces tasted like french toast.  The caramel dipping sauce was great but the chocolate was weird.

The staff was great.  We also got to talk to the assistant GM for the restaurant (Patrick?) who was super friendly and had a kick ass sense of fashion.
