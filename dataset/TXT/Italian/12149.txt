0uwQIGlKICIYuRtayVnh7g I love this place especially when i am in a pasta mood or i just want something healthy. If you are new to this place i recommend trying it more than once until you figure out what kind of sauce and meat you like with your food. You can get a bowl or wrap and you can get it stir fried as well. I like mine stir fried when i want all the ingredients mixed together but if i want it more of a salad i just stick with the bowl. I always get double chicken which their chicken is extremely flavorful. I also add their grilled zucchini and mushrooms and their peppers. The next step is figuring out your sauce. My favorite is spicy diablo which by any means it is not spicy. I also recommend the pesto as well. Then i add lettuce which you can choose spinach as well if you like, but i don't think spinach goes well with the pasta. I also add onions cucumbers artichokes and whatever vegetables you like. It is really flavorful and delicious.
