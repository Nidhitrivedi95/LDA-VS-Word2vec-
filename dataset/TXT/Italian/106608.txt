FTVDICd-uxoEGYh4pU0pcw My husband, a New Yorker, and I ate here for dinner tonight. At this point we expect to be disappointed with each pizza place we try. Either the dough is too thick, the sauce too sweet, or the cheese doesn't seem to melt quite right. Well, I'm happy to report that we LOVED our pepperoni pizza at Joey's! Everything about it was delicious from the first bite to the last. Can't recommend it highly enough. If you like real NY pizza, this is your place. And no matter how full you are, don't skip out without trying the cannoli. Heaven, seriously, they are pure heavenly bliss!
