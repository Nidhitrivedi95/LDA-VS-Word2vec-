-wXyBph4d0IQlQrS8H1rDw Visited there with a few girlfriends and all of us enjoyed it very much. The food was all delicious and no one even left enough to take home a doggie bag. Our waitress (Marissa? Can't remember her name) was great. Attentive but not intrusive. The restaurant is very nice. Sleek and modern. Definitely worth another visit soon.
