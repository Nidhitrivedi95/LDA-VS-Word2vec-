SNJi8rgm_YUX2_iOcfDycw Great food, great service but the mixed drinks were way to strong. .Yes... I said that.  My husband couldn't even drink his but he is whimsy.  Beer, ice cold and the jalapeno bloody mary was excellent.  We tried the tempura green beans for the first time... interesting and very good. Who'd a thought?

Todd was our server and was extremely pleasant.
