Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag Went for a bachelorette dinner before a night out on the town. Our server, Tony, was PHENOMENAL! So personable, quick witted, and so attentive while juggling multiple large groups. Funny enough the manager, Moon, was a past coworker and was truly a gem as well. They not only provided us with a tasty dinner, quick service, and clear communication on the timing of each item coming out, they also gave us some free desserts to sample. From the hostess to the bussers, everyone was so gracious and pleasant. Excited to go back again and try more!

The sorbet dessert plate was our favorite, great light ending to a plate of pasta for most of us.
