tgjbQEtZ_bvQBJOlfiK1OA We happened to be there when Summerlicious was taking place. We are not even sure if we could have ordered from the regular menu since it was never offered.  
My calamari app was actually very tasty even though very tiny.  Literally 3 bites.  My husband's ceviche was too salty which took away from his enjoyment.  
The short ribs were very disappointing.  The flavor was decent but what an awful quality of meat.  All pieces were full of fat, which meant that for most of the bites, you were mostly tasting fat.  
The Israeli cheesecake was okay except it was literally two bites.  
Definitely would not recommend Summerlicious but not sure I want to go back to try their regular menu. 
Our waiter was nice, but he was absent most of the time.  Not sure if they were short staffed that night.
