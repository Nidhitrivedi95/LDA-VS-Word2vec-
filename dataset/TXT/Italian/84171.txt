DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw Very nice bar area & dining room. The deli was nice also pick'd up some goodies for later in the week~
   Started off with prosciutto & mozzarella very pretty presentation and quite tasty too! Followed up with a really salad of baby greens, walnuts, apples & blue cheese. Very nice light champagne vinegar dressing . 
    Ordered pizza  which was good, but not great~thin crust which was nice, topped with olives, artichoke hearts &  proscuitto. The sauce was not to flavorful~ 
   Out server was nice & attentive. SUMMERLIN is a bit far for us, however if in the area I would DEFINATLY try Sienna again and go for the pasta
