ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA WOW! I can not rave about this place enough. The use of worldly flavors and local produce really make this place a must see in the downtown Phoenix area. 

Great architecture and layout, beautiful dining room and fun community beer garden. We sat at the bar while we waited for a table to open up. We had two signature cocktails, a play on a banana daiquiri and a grilled pineapple infused vodka martini. Both phenomenal. 

When we sat for dinner our server started us off with a couple appetizers, one was a roasted Cauliflower with an Aleppo pepper vinaigrette. To die for! For our main course we decided to do family style per our servers suggestion, allowing us to try more than one dish. My favorite was the whole crispy sea bass. Two thumbs up!!

Ocotillo is one of my favorite spots in the Phoenix area, And I love bringing new friends to show off this place.
