72_6srKAdZPSHCGNwK2Hfg We visited Eden a few times over the summer and enjoyed every visit.  The food is excellent and the atmosphere is great.  We had caesar salad, pizza, seafood pasta and mussels - all were perfect.  I must note that the wait staff could be a bit more attentive...it seemed like we had to flag them down for refills on our drinks.  We enjoyed a nice walk along the lake before and after dinner.
