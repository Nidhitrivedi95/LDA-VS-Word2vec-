0uwQIGlKICIYuRtayVnh7g For $10, I received enough food to feed myself for at least 3.5 meals. If that's not a win, I don't know what is. Their Wednesday $5 student discount deal is fantastic. However it only applies to the build your own bowl and not the new menu items, even though they took pity on my hungry, haggard appearance and gave me the deal for the menu items as well. It's also limited to one bowl per customer, so don't try to load up... I'm looking at you fellow hungry students! 

I love the Chipotle style ordering as other reviewers have mentioned. However, I also love that you can order bowls and piadas that have been expertly crafted for you. I have often fallen through the cracks at "build your own" type restaurants, and appreciate some hand holding when it comes to concocting meals. 

Fresh ingredients, fast service, and excellent sauces--this place is fast food done right. Must tries include the meatballs, the spicy red sauce, and their chicken fritte piada (but beware, it's on the spicy side). 

Also, if you're looking for a deliciously scented place to study, I'll admit that I have spent a few good hours lounging here with my bowl. It's not your average chic coffee shop, but it has lights, nice seating, lots of windows, and a seemingly endless supply of noodles--what more could you need?
