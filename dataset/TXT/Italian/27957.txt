4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ What a great little spot. I'm not a huge fan of Italian, however places like this make me love it!

I ordered the Chicken Alfredo. The noodles were prepared perfectly...you could tell they were fresh. The sauce was rich and buttery, very good.  The chicken was a little disappointing...tough. Not thinking this was because of the way it was cooked, but rather they maybe started with a lower quality chicken breast.

Fix that and I'd go 5 stars on this place! 

Not a fan of the chairs, but that might just be me. I recommend trying the place.
