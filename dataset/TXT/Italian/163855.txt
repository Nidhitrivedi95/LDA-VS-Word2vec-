lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg Hubby and I have been big fans of this chain ever since visiting one on our way between MI and MO. We love to share a small, meat-filled deep-dish Pizza and eat the whole thing by ourselves. I think the dough is perfect - very buttery and almost flaky, never burnt or crispy. It's absolutely FILLED with sauce, toppings and, most importantly, CHEESE. 

The only downside to deep dish? A very long wait. You might wait for a table if it's busy. Then wait to order because people can't decide what to order. Then you wait about thirty minutes for your pizza to cook. So imagine my husband's happiness when I informed him that this location has person size deep-dish Pizza to-go. No waiting. They ready before you even place your order. Perfect. 

Personally, I really prefer the full Size pizzas because I feel they have a better relation of dough to fillings. But it's nice that this location can get be you either depending on what you want. 

I've also tried a couple thin crust pizzas. The BBQ Chicken definitely stood out and I would absolutely order it again!

This place really does have friendly and helpful service. Stop by!
