lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ This was the second time I have eaten there.  The first time was great, over a year ago.  Now, I was there with my family on a night that was'nt very busy.  Too start, they tried to cram us into a small booth, then everytime we asked the server for anything (i.e. ex-napkins, condiments, drinks...etc) she would disappear for twenty minutes.  The food (which was all supposed to be fresh) was dry and unappatizing.  Overall a very bad experience.
