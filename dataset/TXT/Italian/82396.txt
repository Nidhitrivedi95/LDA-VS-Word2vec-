DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw We came to Ferraro's on the suggestion of a Whole Foods wine guru after sampling amazing Sagrantino wine. Ferraro's has been a fine Italian restaurant in Las Vegas since 1985 and it is obvious how and why they're still here 30 years later. The food was amazing!! We were a party of 4 and used 2 Yelp deals to get sampler appetizers. The chef whipped up a "sampler" of ravioli and a stroganoff. What?!? Appetizer?? Yes, for an appetizer and both were delicious. The risotto with black truffle was unbelievable. They also offered "white" truffle on any dish for an additional $50. Not cheap, I know. We did not indulge, but the fact that they offer it tells you how much this restaurant and its owner loves Italian food and loves making really good Italian food. 

I will definitely come back to Ferraro's and try anything else on the menu.
