5p5YW_5bMOSuLIQjkJPO3w What an incredible experience.  Eating here is like you are extended family coming for dinner.  Salvatore made a great evening for our group of nine people.  My Partner called ahead of time to make the reservations and Salvatore made sure that our experience was great, he asked about any food allergies to make sure that we all enjoyed our meals.
He shared with us why he created this restaurant and where here sources his products, he was so friendly it was like coming home for dinner with family.  The wine selection is great and had many wines from Italy.  He made the evening one of the best was have had in our dinner group.
The food was great as well, we all looked at each others appetizers and entrées, it was a feast for the senses.  The Margarhita's Pizza was delicious.  We are going back just to try that and some other pizzas as well. The appetizer "Gateaux alla Napoletana" had potatoes and prosciutto, it is to die for, I'm having that again.  The creaminess of the potatoes and the salty prosciutto is a delicacy.  Since there were 9 of us there was quite the variety of dishes.  I personally had the Scallops Diaz which were served with roasted garlic, hazelnut oil served over paccheri pasta.  I loved it.
You have to admit that It is a very special restaurant where the chef/owner takes the time to meet his guests and makes you feel like at home.
Give Naples 15 a try, you will love it!
