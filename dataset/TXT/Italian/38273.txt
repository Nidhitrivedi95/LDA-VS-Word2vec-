7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ Some of the best cheese on a pizza I've ever had. The sauce is very good and the oven-baked pizza is very tasty. 

Negatives: an insult to the word 'parking'. My 1st visit, I had some of the WORST service to date. We were taken to our table, and we waited, probably a good 20 minutes until somebody came to take our drink order. Should of ordered our food at that time, because we didn't get our drinks, nor anybody to take our food order, for ANOTHER 15 minutes or so. In addition, if you get soda, you get a can, so NO FREE REFILLS. 

The Caesar salad was pretty good, but came with a bit too much dressing and Parmesan cheese for my taste. The little shops next to the pizzeria was pretty cool. The ambiance of the restaurant was cool, and the pizza was good, but with horrible service, its hard to support this place.

I'll go back one more time to see if my experience improves.
