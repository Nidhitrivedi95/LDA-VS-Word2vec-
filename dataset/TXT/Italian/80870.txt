dcFMlXIEun1ax2ebW_Y7-w Very nice location and the staff here is very friendly. The pizza itself is very good. The crust is cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crisp. The toppings are plentiful, fresh, and good quality. I especially like that they have Dr Browns Root Beer.

Tasty all round.
