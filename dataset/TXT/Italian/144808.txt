k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ If you're about to post lyrics in a Yelp review, ask yourself, "Is it worth it?  Let me work it.  I put my thing down, flip it, and reverse it."  Oh Missy Elliot, how I love you.  I also love Meghan L. but she's leaving us...  At least The Parlor is here to stay.  Let me eat my emotions!

It was a fabulous dinner tonight filled with a parade of pizza, alcohol, and dessert!  Majority of us [excluding me because I suck] arrived on time at 6:30PM and seating was prompt.  Food was ordered and suddenly the table was a blur of slices being exchanged and food was being consumed.  Noms I got to try:

-The Funghi  which consists of roasted mushrooms, goat cheese, truffle oil, and chives.  Thank you Yuko H. for exchanging a slice with me!  The goat cheese gave it a creaminess that melded well with the chunks of meaty mushrooms.  

-The Market Pizza, which changes frequently so I don't know if this will be helpful but it had golden yellow beets, a beet puree sauce, walnut pesto, spiderella, feta cheese, and added bacon.  I'm not a fan of walnuts but I was seriously digging the walnut pesto.  I never had spiderella until tonight either and I gotta say that the earthiness of the greens was amazing against the sweetness of the beets.

- The Summer Corn which is made of roasted summer corn, chiles, a corn puree, spicy crema, cilantro, and added goat cheese and bacon.  This one had the boldest flavor.  I had originally thought that this would be a sweeter pizza since it had corn but the spicy crema fights for dominance.  I like the added bacon which adds more saltiness to the otherwise spicy slice!

- Tiramisu, we all know what's in it but they added something extra in theirs:  pine nut brittle.  This was probably the dish I'd skip.  The pine nut brittle was so overly sweet that I could do without it completely.  There was also this weird moisture at the bottom that wasn't espresso.

The atmosphere was absolutely lovely and intimate and our waitress was amazing.  She took the time to go over the menu and seasonal items with us in great detail and never made us feel like a burden.  She packed our leftovers, the busboy took our photo, and the staff here is just really awesome.  Even the valet made for pleasant company!  

You are what you eat and I am pizza.  I also need to live in Meghan's pocket because I'm already getting separation anxiety.  Help.
