w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg I used to love Olive Garden for their pasta, soup, salad, and breadsticks. Prices have gone way up and quality has gone way down! Service at this location was great but the food was bland, lacked sauce and the bread sticks were hard. We ordered dessert and it came still frozen and they didn't have any that wasn't. I ended up having to take it home and wait for it to thaw. I won't be returning. There are so many other Italian options.
