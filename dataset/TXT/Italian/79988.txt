d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew If you like eggplant, you must order the eggplant rollatini.  It is fantastic.  The sauce is just right and the eggplant is not breaded.  YUM! Pizza is great too!  Family atmosphere.  They can be a little slow on service sometimes, but for the most part they are great.  Delivery is great too and my orders are always right.
