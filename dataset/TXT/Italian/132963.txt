iL2-xJ4-eMsJk88PsbivbQ Amazing and kind staff. Affordable price for extremely delicious food. Our first time there, I brought my cousin from Australia, her friend, and my little Sister. We ordered a whole lot of food. Pizza was divine, garlic knots, wings,fries and chicken finger. All GIANT portions under $60 for enough food to feed 6+ people. Affordable but great quality and flavor. I must visit this place anytime I go to Vegas now. Thank you for existing. I wish you were in L.A. so that I could visit you every week!
