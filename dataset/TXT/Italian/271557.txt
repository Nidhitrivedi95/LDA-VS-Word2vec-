The selection of bottles is top notch for such a small pub. The run specials often and have plenty of events and even do fun things when downtown Glendale is running an event. They recently started serving app style food but I haven't tried anything yet.

If you want a nice casual hangout for a couple of friends after work, this is the place to go.
