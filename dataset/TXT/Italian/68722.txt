BsvCTCVG7lrzXZ68VyyIcg Lago provides a modern and chill atmosphere. The presentation of the restaurant and food was on-point and staff team members were pleasant. I'm not sure what's Lago's demographic target is, but what I can say is that it's not me. 

I live for food. While most people talk about orgasms I'm all about foodgasms. I care about quality over quantity & overall harmony and complexity. I wish the food tasted as great as it looked, or tasted as good as it was expensive. The highlight of my night was the bread and seasonal pistachio mousse. 

(Beef/ veal/ pork)MEATBALLS- heard that it was a must.. personally, unimpressed and wouldn't get it again even if it were half the price. Yet, it is worth a try!
CAULIFLOWER- whole roasted, dominated with parmesan. I saw herbs, but couldn't taste them. Honestly, I could have made it better in my kitchen with a preferable nutritional fact sheet. 
TROUT- the only thing that I liked on the plate was the burnt lemon, and haha, only for the idea. I think a lot of people don't know what fresh seafood is like. Let me explain it this way, if it smells fishy it sure seems fishy. Bro, it's not suppose to smell like lake erie.
CAVATELLI- I guess it's kinda like adult Mac n cheese. I really liked the well-seasoned baked cheese on the top but that's it. The white sauce mixture was unpleasantly rich, the mushrooms were few and weak.

Overall this experience is why I hesitate to branch out and try new restaurants. When it comes to food I conclude that Lago cuts corners that food snobs will notice.... but damnnnnnnnn, look at that wall-art!

Cost-benefit analysis: .... nahh, enough said. I've made a huge mistake. Should have picked the steakhouse. Save yourself!
