8dSIAoz_UphMGpZr_uMing Well the pizza is delicious, the service leaves a lot to be desired. I called in an order for pick up and was told 20 minutes and it would be ready. 50 minutes later I finally get my pizza. No apologies, nothing. They had one customer in the sitdown part. Staff were joking and laughing with each other quite a bit, but that did not get my pizza done faster.
