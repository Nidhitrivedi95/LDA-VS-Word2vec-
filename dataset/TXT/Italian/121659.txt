The menu is overwhelming with good options and the wait staff is extremely nice and accommodating. As vegetarians, we found plenty to choose from and loved our picks both visits. The garlic knots and olives are such a good starter. Their salad, pizza and calzones - all wonderful! Make sure to save room for dessert!
