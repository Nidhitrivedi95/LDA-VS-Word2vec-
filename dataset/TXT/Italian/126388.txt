HSoKTWnsu7f3yvywWvBQ4w Tried classic crust for the first time tonight and have to say it is a pretty solid pizza. Grabbed a large pie with 5 toppings for take out and at 6:30 on Saturday night my pie was ready in about 15 minutes. I like that your pie is the same price for up to 5 toppings although i can see some folks being pissed if you only order cheese or 1 topping. Got the pizza home it was nice a hot and the ingredients were fresh. The crush had a nice chew to it but not rubbery. All in all I will check it out again and try some of the other menu items
