DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw This is my third dinner in the past year and it is the best. Top rate service and food   Wine list is top shelf with wine for anyone's budget.  I rarely write a review but this place is special.  We brought our foodie friends from San Francisco and they were impressed too.  Our waiter Virgilio is a hoot.   This is my local go too place for a special dinner.  

The som Paolo also made a great recommendation. Introduced me to a Kerner from northern Italy which I would not have tried without his rec. 

It can get crowded and noisy so rec going before 6 or after 830 pm.  I will have to try a late lunch or happy hour one day. I bet this will be fun 

Oops. Almost forgot.  Don't miss the Mimmo Salad.  Just amazing  The rabbit was also superb but my wife complained about the ribs showing on my plate.  I have also had the Oso Bucco which is as good as it gets.   My wife is a vegetarian and the menu always has something for her.
