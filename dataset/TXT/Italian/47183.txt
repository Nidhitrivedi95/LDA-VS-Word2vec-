8xrwjD-Udv7cm_emVcVo3A Not sure what happened but these pizzas seem not to be cooked properly(too many orders to fill?)  Ordered the Hawaiian and it was as though someone mixed the cheese, ham, pineapple and whatever bacon, if any, in a mixing bowl with a fork and slopped it on some dough for an unsatisfying mess.  Undercooked.  Fell apart.  Unedible.  Thirty bucks with tip for a large and a two liter and I ate 1.5 pieces.  My last order from Giovannis.
