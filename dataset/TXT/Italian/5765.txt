_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw Food was really great and the overall atmosphere was nice.  Our server however was awful. He was more interested in the NBA game than serving us. We had to ask him to fill our waters and our appetizer and salad came out after our pizza. We ordered vodka sodas and it seemed as though there was very little vodka and they were $7 each. Very disappointed.
