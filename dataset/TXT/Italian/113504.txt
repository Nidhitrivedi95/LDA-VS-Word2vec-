gHDlF6Dc-4EmxdsBsinygg The first time I had food from this place it was brought to me at home. I tasted the lasgna and almost puked, it was a very bad reaction to the sauce. We have been back several times since. I enjoy the pizza and on occasion spaghetti as well as the salads. Not having had a bad reaction to any of these other foods we continue to patronize Sabatinos.
