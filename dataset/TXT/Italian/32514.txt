5XLuRoXqafFY_GAQ0D8dWw Came at 4 o clock with husband and 2 kids. Was told I'd have to wait 15 minutes because theu didn't have enough servers. Although there were 7 people standing behind the welcome counter. Only 2 tables had guest.they were slow. 

Took over 8 minutes to get water to the table. Window seal covered in dust. 

Waitress was polite and friendly. Fair prices. Good food.
