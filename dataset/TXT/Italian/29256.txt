5CeizAHfOQJOI6sSh0kJmw One of the worst places for overpriced pizza or subs! Don't waste your money. 

Crusty/toasted probably day old small roll for a sandwich with 2 slices of meat and 1 slice of american cheese for $8. Slice of pizza was over $3 and medium drink was $2 (one refill allowed). 

Nothing tasted authentic or worth another visit.
