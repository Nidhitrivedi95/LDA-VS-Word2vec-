5nZVVPO_cYH9aQeClTP9zA Generally I come here after a mall visit for cheap accessible food with a cute atmosphere. Today however was unacceptable. I ordered a turkey feta salad to go and had to come back because my turkey was not included. Once I started eating I found short hair in the bottom of my salad I can only assume was from the male cook. 

Due to the location and the great service I know there will be many more years to come for sauce on camelback. I only ask for improvements in the kitchen area and competence.
