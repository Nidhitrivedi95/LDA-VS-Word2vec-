fzxvmA3Ygu3yrQQ6-cEpTw We had the antipasto pea salad and heirloom tomato salad for starters. Both were good but not great. Flavors were nice but bland.  For dinner we shared the pomodora pasta and the mushroom fettuccine. Again both were nice but not great. The mushroom fettuccine was by far better than the bland pomodora pasta. We loved the atmosphere and our waiter Mikhail was very nice. I think it is very expensive. The two of drank water and our bill with tip was $80. No dessert. No appetizers. Just salad and dinner.
