or4yipilbCkKIFnF1RP5Ow Went here tonight for dinner with a group of six.  We made a reservation which turned out to be wise as it was a busy Friday evening.  Several ordered the lobster Mac and cheese, one ordered the chicken Marsala, my wife had pulled pork and I ordered one of the specials that consisted of shrimp, scallops, mussels and Snapper on a bed of rice with asparagus.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals (the special was outstanding), the atmosphere was pleasant and the service was excellent.  This was my first visit here and I definitely plan to return.
