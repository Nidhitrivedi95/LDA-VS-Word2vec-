pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw On a vacation to Phoenix to visit my girlfriend's family, a friend said I had to check this place out, likely after he saw it on some Best Pizza list. 

First off, it's in a rather difficult to get to spot.  It's on a pedestrian walkway near the Arizona Science Center... I could have sworn it was on some sort of campus, but whatever it is, it's blocked off from street traffic.  My girlfriend and I had to look for parking for about 20 minutes, and walked 4 blocks at 1pm on a Tuesday, which I thought was kind of absurd.  Not necessarily the restaurant's fault, just saying. 

So... yes, this is a traditional wood-fired pizza place, close to actual Italian pizza, and not the thick chewy Americanized dough many of us are used to.  What that will mean is, thin pizza, possibly burned in patches on the bottom, little cheese, little toppings, and small selection of ingredients.  From what I can remember, the menu is almost entirely their 5 different styles of pizza, and 3 or 4 salads and a few other appetizers.   There was complimentary bread and olive oil, which was crusty and tasty. My date and I ordered a caprese salad and the margherita pizza, which was a mistake on our part because the margherita is basically just the same ingredients as the caprese salad on top of bread, and cooked, so our meal was a little redundant. It wasn't bad, but nothing I would write home about. 

Depending on your personal taste, this could be a plus or minus.  It's a small room, with what little seating there is set very closed together.  We could hear the entire conversation of the couples on either side of us.  Service dragged a little, and our waters were only filled once our pizza came out.  We were in a hurry to catch a flight, and they obliged us by bringing our check and a to-go box out in a timely fashion, so I suppose I'll give them points for that. 

All in all, very "meh" and comparable to any other brick oven type pizza place.
