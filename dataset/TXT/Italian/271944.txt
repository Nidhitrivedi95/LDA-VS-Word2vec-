xSIkiqB2tuiyJwFmPyNR5Q I LOVE Italian food.  With that being said, it's kinda hard to mess up a good pasta dish with marinara sauce and generous use of garlic.  In this respect, Romano's doesn't dissapoint.  Yet with a million and one places in town to get good Italian food, this place ranks about halfway.

Why you ask?  I visited yesterday for lunch and had a decent meal.  I began their bread: warm, "rustic", and served with olive oil.  Then, I had a salad with house dressing (a balsamic, Greek-ish tasting concoction) and Chicken Parmesan.  The rosemary on top was a nice touch that other chains don't do. The sauce was good, but no different really than Bertolli's chunky marinara in a jar. Otherwise, it was as predictable as any meal at Olive Garden or Carraba's.  For $12, I was a bit dismayed at the portions.  The service was virtually non-existent during our meal; the water glasses were not refilled. The service alone brings the rating down to 2.  

Though I would return to Romano's if invited by someone, I'm shocked (or perhaps lulled into apathy) by its mediocrity.  I suppose this place makes a nice lunch destination, but don't expect to be "wowed" by it.  Its neither elegant or authentic, its just another Italian chain.
