Een2yret0IwJUpHLwcxtRg Not only is the food pretty darn delicious (and affordable) but the owners and workers are so friendly and awesome! Arancini House serves up Italian fried rice balls among other Italian items like pizza and rolls. You might have a hard time finding it because it's in the basement of a building. However, just look out for the signs and arrows. 

Came here on a Friday night with the hubby and the small dining room was completely filled except one table. Perfect for us! The space is super casual and you order and pay at the counter. We ordered the Sicilian pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms and of course we couldn't come here without trying arancini (rice balls), which we got the stuffed hot pepper. One bite of the arancini and you are in heaven! Crispy outer shell, but the rice is so soft and moist and the flavors of the filling are absolutely perfect. Next time, I will get several and not just one! The pizza was also great; crispy outer crust yet soft and thick. Pizza wasn't too greasy. My one and only gripe is the mushrooms seemed like they were canned. What I loved most about this visit was the "secret" Calabrian pepper infused honey the owner brought out to us. This item is not on the menu but trust me, you're going to want to ask about it! The owners were inspired by Mike's Hot Honey so they made their own with Calabrian hot peppers. The honey is mildly spicy yet still very sweet and it's perfect on the pizza!! 

I just wish they had late hours everyday. They are only open late (until 9 pm) on Thursdays and Fridays. Any other day, they're open until 5 pm except they're closed on Sundays and Mondays. Otherwise, I love this place and I will definitely be back!
