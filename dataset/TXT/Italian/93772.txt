eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ Ambient lighting is great but not when you cant see your hand in front of your face let alone the menu. I also think it is inexcusable to be out of ice in June because your ice machine is broken. Go across the street to the gas station and get some ice, geez. These two things pretty much set the tone for my dining experience. First impressions can be turned around with some good eats but unfortunately Grape Street couldn't turn my frown upside down...

Service: 3 - just ok - wait times were not impressive, server was disingenuous 
Food: 3 - just ok - the brie appetizer was pretty good
Ambience: 3 - gets an extra point due to the patio seating
Value: 2 - overpriced

With all of the great options in town, I can surely say I will not be back to this place.
