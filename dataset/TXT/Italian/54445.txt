abA0s0uxoeOn7zNm-1dDxw Things I felt upon visiting Za's for the first time:
- overwhelmed at the number of options for lunch (pizza, pasta, paninis, and salads comprise your choices that you'll fill out on a custom form)
- impressed that there are 200 meals you can put together at less than 500 cals!
- comfortable in the spacious upstairs dining area
- healthy after eating my 1/2 salad-1/2 panini lunch combo
- elated I found somewhere that includes edamame in some of their salads

Unique lunch spot!
