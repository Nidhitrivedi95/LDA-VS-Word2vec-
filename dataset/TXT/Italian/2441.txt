-PUPEpMsjBjk_rX5lFaWng Pesto's was good, not great. We stopped in at lunch time but were underwhelmed with their lunch specials. So we went for it and tried mozzarella sticks as an app and the Mediterranean Pizza as a shared entree. The cheese sticks were yummy, fresh and the bread coating on them was just perfect. Even though the pizza used fresh ingredients as well, it was VERY oily. The crust was nice but it wasn't any better than Rosatti's or even Costco pizza for that matter. Our server was quite friendly but our experience at Pesto's will probably be a one-time happening. And for the expensive price, I can think of several other places I'd rather spend my $$$$ at.
