The oysters were pretty good, but it's not like I could fill up on it so we ordered a bunch of other appetizers. The tuna roll was not very good, but the crabcakes dipped in the sauce were good, and the deep fried oysters were pretty good. It's also in Harrah's which you can easily miss if you do not know how to get here. We ordered key lime pie for dessert that tasted like cheesecake with a hint of lime. Not bad for key lime pie for the first time.
