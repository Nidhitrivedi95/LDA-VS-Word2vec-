UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ I'm really not sure what the fuss is all about. We probably made the mistake of getting the margherita pizza which was pretty much cheese pizza with tomato slices and a little chopped basil. I expected slices of mozzarella and full leaves of basil. The breadsticks were bland and disappointing. My husband said papa johns is better and he hates papa johns. Even the bread pudding was just okay nothing special.
