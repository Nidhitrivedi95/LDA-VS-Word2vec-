FyKefsWq62xeXpje0Flcig A real hidden gem in the Scottsdale area.  Been to New York's Best Itailan Bistro multiple times over the last year and have never been disappointed.  Great Italian food, and there are always multiple specials each day.  I almost always get the chicken parmesean, which is the best I've ever had.  The employees are always very nice and happy to serve you as well.  All in all it is my favorite Italian restaurant in Phoneix.
