xko9a0myoKffQMzz96O2jA What do you do when you have $9.00 chicken breasts that need to be cooked, but it's too hot to cook inside and too hot to cook outside?  Look for cheap take-out since you've already thrown $9 away.

Pizza turned into pasta, and Little Chicago fit the bill.  I had chicken parmigiana which came with a side of spaghetti and garlic bread.  The dish was nothing out of the ordinary, but it was well prepared and enjoyable.  Certainly something you could make at home if it wasn't so dang hot, but that's what I liked about it.  Pasta dishes come in two sizes.  Order the small unless your closet is well-stocked with stretchable fabrics.  It's more than enough for even a big appetite.  And at just over $23 for 2 dinners, appetizer, and 2-liter bottle of soda, I didn't feel so bad about the chicken...only that he died without realizing his potential.
