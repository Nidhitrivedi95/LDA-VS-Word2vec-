4OlIwqXEEXr6YvE3Nz2tTw My family and I love this place. My kids don't like Pad Thai, or Bangkok Curry or frankly anything exotic at all. I on the other hand get tired of chicken nuggets, etc. 

Noodles & co is the perfect solution - Mac and cheese or spaghetti for the kids; other more interesting carbs for my wife and me. 

Everything is tasty, if a little bland, and served fast and cheerfully!
