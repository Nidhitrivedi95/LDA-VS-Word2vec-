ZfPcpbZssIMrYBSg9jXNdw We were looking forward to trying this neighborhood restaurant since we heard good reviews about its Mesa location.

We were incredibly disappointed.

There were 4 hostesses at the front desk, none of whom could care less about actually greeting us.  We felt as if it we were an imposition to take our name.

After waiting for our table, we were seated about 20 minutes later.  The service just went downhill from there.  The waitress, Angela, was slow, inexperienced, and not particularly knowledgeable about the wine list.  She even kept apologizing for the poor service and acknowledging her responsibility for it.

While I have to say, the food was very good, we will not be back because the service was so poor.
