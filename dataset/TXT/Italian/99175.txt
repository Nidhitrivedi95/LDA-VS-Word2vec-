EZrkg2mrQLGaXdsiuRnBgQ I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. Came here for a company lunch.  Atmosphere was nice and the staff were friendly. Ordered the braised short rib risotto and a seafood pasta I no longer see on the menu to split between a coworker and I. The risotto was cooked well and the short ribs were so tender! The pasta was also very tasty and noodles were al dente. The place got busy as we ate so it seems they have a pretty busy lunch period. Would come back to try other items on the menu!
