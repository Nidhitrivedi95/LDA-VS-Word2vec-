cOWXtCz7F9GQhPIks8gm6Q We tried this place out for the first time for dinner. We sat outside, which was nice because the plaza has string lights, making it a romantic/pretty setting. We started off with the pork belly brûlée, which was delicious! The house mustard sauce made the dish! The brûlée added a twist to a traditional pork dish but the mustard/orange zest brought it all together. Must try!

I wasn't too hungry (we went late at night) so I just ordered the margherita. It was ok/not very good. I can't say it was terrible because it wasn't, but I wouldn't ever order that again. I didn't care for the taste of the bread and the cheese tasted like something you'd get at a chuck-e-cheese. However, I'm giving this restaurant a 4 because (well, for one, the service was fantastic and the ambience was great) but mainly because my brother ordered the Chicken Marsala, which he let me try, and it was AMAZING! They got the flavor absolutely right! I honestly can't say enough about it! We all kept eating his plate because it was soooooo great! I'm already salivating at the thought of it. I was actually very bummed I didn't think to order it because I kept wanting more, but didn't want to devour a plate that wasn't mine :).

We also ordered dessert (CHECK IN because YOU GET A FREE DESSERT!), I ordered the tiramisu but they ordered the chocolate lava cake. The tiramisu was ok. *Disclaimer* this is my favorite dessert so I try it everywhere I go that offers it, across multiple countries, so I tend to be extremely picky about it :). The chocolate lava cake was good. Overall, it was a wonderful evening and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend the pork belly brûlée and Chicken Marsala! Don't stick to the simple choice of pizza!
