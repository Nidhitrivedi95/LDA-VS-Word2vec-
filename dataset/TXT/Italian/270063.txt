xly3K2HgsjvZs5Mu9kSFxg I came in for happy hour and was the only one at the bar. Both TV s were on something like nothing. I asked the bar tender to put on  espn. She did. She put espn on one tv and her daytime show on the other. Then she cranked up the volume on her show. Guess I should go home to watch my channel. After all, she is at work, so she must be entitled. I'm just a customer....
