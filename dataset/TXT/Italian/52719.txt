9xdVIIzHp12Zrox5aFaaHA Wandering around hungry on Roncesvalles, a friend and I decided to try this spot. Something about maple and bacon on a sandwich board was very alluring. 

The place had a nice atmosphere and smelled delicious. It was kind of empty but it was a cold Tuesday. 

We sat down. Service was very friendly. The 2 staff we met were both passionate about the food there. It's really nice to see people get excited about the menu items. We went with the special pizza of the day which had 2 different types of bacon, basil, cherry tomatoes... I think. There was more, too. Anyhow... Absolutely delicious. It came on a nice, soft dough (which was recommended over the hard dough). This pizza was amazing. 

The pizza fed 2 people nicely for $18 before tax and tip. 

The pizza here is better than most, if not all, pizza I've tried in Toronto. I really enjoyed the scotch bonnet oil; I thought that was a nice touch!

I would recommend this place for pizza for sure. It's affordable, has a nice atmosphere and friendly staff that are passionate about their food. Most importantly, it is delicious!

They told us how they won an international pizza contest in Vegas and that they were entering again. Congrats and good luck, may the best pizza win!

I'm still thinking about that pizza I had there...
