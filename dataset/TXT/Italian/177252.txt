nkM9exy9vHB65VZH8k4FKw I've never had a bad meal nor bad delivery.  And they deliver to my part of Upper St. Clair! Thank goodness!  

Common ingredients, but the quality/price ratio serves it's purpose and is better than most.  It tastes like central PA.  And I like it more than enough to skip over closer places such as my darling Parma - frequently.

We really like Salerno's Stromboli.  Seriously considering teaching them the secret to My Place (in Mechanicsburg, PA -see my review of My Place) so that I can have the central PA style to which I am accustomed.  In the meantime, I just order ham, capicola and pepperoni and add my own yellow mustard.  I'll have to send a sample for them to replicate the super thin "My Place" Stromboli crust.

Overall, superb value, reliable delivery, very tasty pizza, Stromboli and calzones.  I haven't tried any of their hoagies, meals or salads yet.
