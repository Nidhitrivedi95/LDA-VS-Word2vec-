N8ArHOgRDI8wOJIOZaEHyg Last weekend my wife, 14 month-old son, and I had soup, salad, and breadsticks lunch.  We were seated in the family area but got great service.  The server even brought unoiled breadsticks for my baby son to eat.  She took such great care of us and baby.  Thanks Olive Garden.  You made us feel like family.
