DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q So, I am trying to eat a little healthier because I have been gaining weight lately =bad.  I grabbed the spicy chickpea lettuce wraps a couple mayos and ketchups thinking they may need some help... Boy was I wrong!! Didn't need either the ketchup or the mayo.. Would've been a total mistake. These things should be called spicy Umame Bombs! Holy Shit! It's all  going on in there! Spicy, savory, sweet (sweet pickles... Genius!!!) Fresh, crunchy. My mouth is on fire!  Totally satisfying (good quantity and weight). Oh, I forgot to mention the avocado... Brilliant!  Such a great value,  too at $8,50.  My new healthy diet is rocking!!  Thanks to the Big O!
