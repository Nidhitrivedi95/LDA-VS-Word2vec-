ppT0Rbx0-_W0W8DqY2fPiA If this is great New York Pizza I'm not that impressed
no doubt its got a lot of things going for it 
1. its huge
2. lots of toppings on the combo
3. it does have flavor
Bad things 
1. kinda drippy
2. very thin crust
3. the store itself is kinda "cheesy"

big menu lots of things I would have liked to try
its a pretty good pizza
