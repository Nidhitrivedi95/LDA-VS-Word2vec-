q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas! I always thing I'm ready to try a new dish but I can't help it. I LOVE the Vinnie Alla Vodka. The best Vodka Sauce in Town. 

If by any chance you save room for dessert (don't be afraid to pack your meal to go) I prefer the Creme Brûlée. Although the lady fingers in the Tiramisu have the best hot of rum. 

Oh and for an appetizer the Ravioli is Amazing!  

I just love bringing new friends here. The live entertainment is also the best. Enjoy!
