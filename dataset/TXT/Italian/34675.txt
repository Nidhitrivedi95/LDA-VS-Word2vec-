6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA I was very satisfied with this place.  Didn't quite know what to expect from a Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant, but went for it!

We got the prix fixe A meal.  Really, you can't go wrong with that.  I ordered the octopus carpaccio and the shrimp/mushroom spaghetti.  My husband ordered another octopus appetizer (I can't remember the name) and spaghetti carbonara.  The prix fixe also comes with a beer (PBR only) or glass of wine.

Octopus Carpaccio: Sooo good.  Chewy, flavorful, with a spicy aioli type of sauce on top of it.  I liked it a lot.

Other Octopus App: These were little WHOLE baby octopus fried calamari style.  It was kind of cool to see a whole octopus in that form, since I'm used to the little rings of calamari.  Those were fun to eat because I love me some tenticles, and they had tons of them!

Shrimp/Mushroom Spaghetti: This is going to sound weird, but this dish tasted like Pasta Roni, which was fine by me because I love Pasta Roni, so I was very happy with this dish.  You could definitely taste the mushroom in the sauce, and it was a very generous helping also.

Spaghetti Carbonara: I thought this particular dish was bland, but my husband enjoyed it.

Overall, I liked the appetizers more than the entrees, but enjoyed my entire meal as a whole.  I would love to come back and try some of their other appetizers and get that octopus carpaccio again!  Nakamura-Ya is a very interesting restaurant concept well executed.
