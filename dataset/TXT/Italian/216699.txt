It hadn't been my first choice in the neighbourhood because I thought other restaurants in the area had better ambiance looking in from the street, but after a recommendation by a friend we tried it and it was lovely.  My server was impeccable - polite, friendly, checked in at all the right times.  The house red is well-priced and not at all bad.   The caesar salad is very creamy, which I like, and the pizzas were delicious.  I had a margherita and my partner had the Siena (with bacon!) - perfectly done, great crust.  I highly recommend for an easy (perhaps weekday) dinner out!
