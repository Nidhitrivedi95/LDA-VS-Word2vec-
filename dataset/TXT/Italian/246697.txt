v2xh5qtrlRJSU3OnixJH2g Thoroughly enjoyed my pan-seared scallops with spicy truffle cauliflower mash and wild mushrooms. The flavors worked  perfectly together and created what,  although ridiculous sounding, resembled something like a taste bud symphony. Tasted a bit of the other dishes my family ordered, and all were just as flavorful. The garlic knots are really good too, not overly garlicky and tasted homemade. The Korean tempura cauliflower is a must. 

The owner/chef stopped by the table to say hi, which was pretty cool. His passion for good, fusion food was contagious.
