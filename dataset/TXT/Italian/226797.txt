SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Stopped in during shopping.  Not a big menu, but had enough of what I was looking for.  Had the pizzette as an app.  I had the cheese pizza and my girlfriend had the shrimp caesar salad with shrimp.  Pizzette was very tasty.  Pizza had pizza sauce instead of marinara sauce that so many Italian restaurants use.  Pizza was very good, not great but considering it is 2000 miles from NY, it was good,  Shrimp Caesar salad was solid and huge.  We also had desert of creme broulee and tiramisu, both were excellent.  Had Jennifer as our server and she did an excellent job.  Overall very good place.  Will definitely visit again.
