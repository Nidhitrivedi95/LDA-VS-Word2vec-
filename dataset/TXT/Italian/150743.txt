klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw I think Society aims to please the female population plus health food fanatics. Things are not overly seasoned so that you can add salt and pepper to taste. Well, it was either that or maybe my taste buds were overloaded with all the different foods I ate throughout the day!

My bachlorette weekend consisted of eating, drinking and more eating! One of my MOH made several reservations across town, but we decided to come here because of the decor and vegan options. Now that I think of it, the decor reminds me of something the Kardashians would dig! Very plush, regal and girly.
 
The service was great and the food wasn't terrible. 
Since we ate a bunch of heavy stuff during the day, I opted for a salad. My friend and I split two different versions
1- Steak and Kale. Steak cooked to MR perfection. The only prob with the protein was that it was not very flavorful. The mix of butter lettuce and kale made it a substantial salad though. My only wish was the vinaigrette to have more oomph.
2- Citrus Poached Shrimp and Octopus Salad- This salad had more components to it which made it much more interesting. WIth the jicama, fennel, avocado puree, carrots, cucumber, orange lightly tossed in the Fennel-Pink Peppercorn Vinaigrette. Bam! It was my favorite.
I got to try a couple of my friend's dish and overall thought they were okay. The filet mignon, lobster potatoes and meatball apps were all (again) lacking some sort of seasoning. 

Ending on a high note:  The vegan pasta was excellent! Pasta = al dente. Sauce and veggies were tasty without tasting too healthy.

All in all, I would like to come again for breakfast or lunch.
