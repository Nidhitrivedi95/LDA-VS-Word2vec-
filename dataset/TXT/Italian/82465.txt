DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw What a wonderful restaurant! My first time eating here and I will be back! The pasta and bread are made fresh everyday at the restaurant. Our waiter was "Eric" he made the evening very special with his attention to customer, wine and menu suggestions. You could tell he loved his job and where he worked. Great atmosphere as well, each table had a fresh flower, the restaurant also had live music. Great Italian food!
