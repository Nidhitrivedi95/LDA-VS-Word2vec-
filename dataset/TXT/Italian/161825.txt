LMdUoR00jPxQDWLYRq93FA Oh be still my heart! Quiessence is amazing and offers a one of a kind dining experiences. 

We went last night to celebrate our anniversary and were treated as though we were the only couple in the entire place (which there must have been half a dozen other couples there for similar celebrations).  

We opted to have the farmers feast (I had the wine pairing) and the wonderfulness began.  6 Courses: Each amazing for its own reason.  They were nicely timed so that we could enjoy each course, each wine, and eachother.  But not so spaced out that we started to wonder if they forgot about us.  

So as we sat outside on the patio staring out onto the farm's scenery - like we were in our own little world where decadent plates of food would magically arrive at the perfect time. 

1st Course - Salami, cheese and bread - what is a better way to start
2nd - fresh and clean salads (mine was citrus - his warm beet with goat chees) 
3rd - pasta (his included rabbit meatballs, mine was similar to gnocchi but went by a different name - this was my favorite) 
4th- fish (cod and rock fish . . . flakey sweet  buttery - but light) 
5 - meat (venison - lamb . . . perfectly cooked perfectly seasoned) 
6th dessert - (one was a ved velvet whoopie pie the other was a carrot style cake)

Each course showed up without us placing a single order - just what the chef sent out - and each was wonderful. 

Thank you Quiessence for making this a special evening!!!
