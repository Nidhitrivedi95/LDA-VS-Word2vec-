djKTruHtS4n_vlfOknxjRw I went there today because my husband wanted to eat pasta anyway. I asked for a Caesar salad with shrimps - you must pay an extra of 5.95 for shrimps on your salad, but I was ok with it. 

From the start: I've lived in So Paulo (HUGE Italian community) and I come myself from an Italian family. When I go to an italian restaurant, I expect good italian bread and excellent olive oil as an appetizer. Queen's offered me cold bread and only butter. This was a bad signal. 

When the food arrived, my 5.95 dollar shrimps turned out to be THREE SHRIMPS.  The waiter told me "I'm sorry I have nothing to do with the prices, we pay an expensive rent, etc". Bad excuse. 5.95 + taxes for THREE SHRIMPS? You must be kidding. 

The salad was a default Caesar Salad, nothing spectacular. 

My husband asked for a black-and-white pasta. His pasta was good, but I also think it was not worth the price - almost 20 dollars. It should be an AWESOME pasta, but it was more like something we could do ourselves. 

We decided not to tip after our experience at this restaurant.  Specially after the 3 shrimp thing. That's offensive. You can find shrimp dishes on Bloor for 10-12 dollars, FULL OF SHRIMP. 

I'm not coming back and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
