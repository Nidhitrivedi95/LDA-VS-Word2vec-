SNJi8rgm_YUX2_iOcfDycw This place is in the neighborhood we moved into a few months ago and when we saw the groupon we figured why not?! Just tried to go for an early dinner and what a bust. Yes it was busy due to kids eat free however it was easy to see what is wrong with this place. The host misquoted a wait time (10 mins) as we sat there for 20 minutes we literally saw 4 open tables that servers/bussers/the host just kept walking by and not picking up dirty dishes or cleaning those tables. The servers that couldn't bother to help bus their tables so they could turn them had no problem picking up their check presenters btw. The host also had more than enough time to bs with one of his buddies. "We're busy as shit wanna help?" Needless to say we left and grabbed a pizza at Papa Murphys instead and subsequently cancelled our Groupon. Such a disappointment on so many levels.
