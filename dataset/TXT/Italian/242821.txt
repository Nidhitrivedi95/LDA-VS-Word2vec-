uOJ87zqbU1MtShCSHDkiyw I took my daughter and her boyfriend to Va Bene for dinner on Easter. I would have taken them to a nice brunch but they both had to work until 4 o'clock. I read some great reviews and I read some horrific reviews so I decided to come up with my own opinion. We were created promptly by the waiter who seemed as though we were a bother more than a customer. The food runner and busboy were on point they were pleasant. We ordered an appetizer the calamari it was different it was thin rings with a sauce which was very good. It was odd that the waiter took our appetizer and food order together. My daughter and her boyfriend both ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and I ordered the veal Picatta. 
The pasta was a hit and so was the veal though both portions were very small. The veal was $25.95 and in my 38 years of going out for dinner I never paid that much for so little. The meal was served with mashed potatoes set on the plate with an ice cream scoop and the vegetables were under cooked. I can honestly say this was the first time I left a restaurant hungry. 
To finish the meal I ordered the cheese cake if it was made with ricotta cheese the waiter informed me he was not sure how it was made let me check the box. Really check the box even if it did come in a box don't say it. I informed if it is not ricotta cheese I will have the cream brûlée. Well the food runner brought out the cream brûlée. We never asked if we wanted coffee. The decor reminded me of the Italian restaurants in Chicago in the old Italian neighborhoods not for the food quality and portions but the decor. 
Just a note to the owners don't cut the veal paper thin skip the mashed potatoes and offer a side of pasta and make sure the vegetables are cooked.
