RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ We have a new winner in the Italian food category. From beginning to end this was fantastic. We started with the chopped salad. Not a ton to rave about here but it was good. My wife had the Chicken Piccata. She usually doesn't order this in a restaurant because it usually doesn't stand up to mine. This one did. I ordered a first for me, Branzino. They will serve this whole, filet or filet with skin on as well as Grilled or salt baked. I chose fillet with skin on. I fully expected to remove the skin. Nope; The skin was crispy and the meat was mild and perfectly cooked. It comes with a very light, pesto like sauce. For a side we ordered the spaghetti squash with marinara; so good. We decided to also go for desert. We had the dark chocolate pie with gelato. Food orgasm worth the 9 dollars. With a glass of wine and tip, 120.00.
