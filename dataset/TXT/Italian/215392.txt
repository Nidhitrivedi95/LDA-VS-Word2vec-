I was looking forward to eating here. The menu sounded really good. 

The food was disgusting and soaked in oil. You can see the oil floating on top of their canned tomato sauce. 

A lot of regulars were dining, which is fine. Not sure why. The servers seem to know all of them, running over to their tables and giving them hugs and kisses. The two male servers are too much. 

This place is a racist unprofessional joke. We left the restaurant peacefully, kept my mouth shut as to not create a scene and the waiter came chasing after us. Seriously Guido?! Back off! Unprofessional. 

Will not be back. Food is not good and doesn't make up for the horrid behavior of the staff.
