nS6QENxe6YODNrQ45bpC-A My wife turned to me at 2am and said she was hungry. Luckily, my trusty Eat 24 app let me know what in the area was a 24 hour delivery service, because I had no desire to get out of bed to get her food. I'm on vacation and she's not pregnant. I love her, but no.

We ordered the double Philly with everything, garlic fries and jalapeño poppers. Asked for ranch (not listed as a condiment in the app, you have to ask for it in the special instructions) and they delivered. Poppers weren't anything to rave about, just the usual. The garlic fries? I LOVED them. **Warning** if you don't enjoy a STRONG garlic taste and stank breath at 3am, don't order these. If you're a rebel and feel like making your significant other kiss your stank breath mouth before bed (toothpaste doesn't kill it) then balls to the walls! Do it!

But the glory of the whole meal? That Philly. So, so good. And SO MUCH FOOD! Wanna know how good it smelled/tasted? It literally woke my friend up from an alcohol induced coma enough to text me from her room and ask if I was cooking steak. Also, there was enough food to share between all three of us. 

The only thing I feel shitty about is I didn't tip the guy (because he was 20 mins late) and I was sick of hearing my wife whine. So, my message to the delivery driver:

Sorry bro. Next time, I'll know better and I'll make it right.
