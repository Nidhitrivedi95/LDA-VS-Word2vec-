FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA This has got to be one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. I can't even count the number of times that I've been here (or the original Arcadia location) and it's consistently great! 

The bruschetta is flavorful and fresh (make sure to sign up for their emails, you get a coupon for free bruschetta and they don't bombard you with spam), their salads are delicious and inventive, and I always love their "soups of the moment." 

The wines are a bit on the pricey side, so definitely check out their $5 glasses of wine before 5 pm. I love to go on a Saturday afternoon and get a glass (or two) of their regularly $13 sparkling Sauv. Blanc Emeri. So light and refreshing.

The service is good; it's definitely a trendy, hipster vibe but the servers are not pretentious or annoying. And their patio is dog friendly! I came in one afternoon with 3 people and 3 dogs, thinking that they would look at me like I was a crazy person and turn us away, but instead they sat us on the patio with a smile and even brought a water bowl for the pups. That's definitely the way to get a dog lover to return! 

The only downside is how crowded this place is - but you can't fault it for being so awesome that everyone wants to eat there - so I try to only go at off times. If you haven't been to either Postino location yet, it's a must!
