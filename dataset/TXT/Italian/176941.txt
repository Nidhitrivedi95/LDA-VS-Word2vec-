nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg This was our second visit to La Stalla.  The atmosphere is so appropriate for the menu.  Our waiter was so attentive.  And the food.....wow.  I had the sweet potato tortellini with Gorgonzola sauce.  Out of this world.  My husband had the salmon penne and loved it.  Our friends had two different sandwiches.  So big they took half home.  Thank you La Stalla, we will be back next year.
