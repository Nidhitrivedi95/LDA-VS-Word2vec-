V6MWAv-xv4dgSUrDU1qxaA We decided to grab lunch here the other day and were pretty happy we did!  They have different themed noodle dishes - American inspires/Asian inspired & one other category I believe.  My husband got the mac & cheese and it was really good.  I ordered the Japanese spicy noodles.  I really enjoyed my dish as well - it was perfectly spicy - not too much.  There was a vegetable medley mixed in with it as well.  Overall, we really liked our lunch and will definitely be returning!
