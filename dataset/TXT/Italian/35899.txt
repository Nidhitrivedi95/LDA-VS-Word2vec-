6PQve0oFCLPSh4wnIzvJtg OMG the pizza is awesome!!! The dough was so fresh and the crust was cook perfectly. I have dined in before and had a wonderful experience with the staff and the food was awesome. When I decided I wanted pizza I figured I would they them out since they offered fresh dough from N.Y. and WOW I had 6 people over and 3 picky eaters and everyone was happy. Again this time the staff was very friendly and curtious.
