All was excellent. The service was very attentive and excellent with the exception of two issues. The Wynn is known for their Cable Car martini. It is usually excellent, hey made it water down. Seems they used too much ice. They sent it back to be fixed, but came back almost the same. Disappointing because it's usually excellent. Secondly, we didn't not plan on having dessert because we were full, but the waiter dropped the menu and asked me to pick something out for our anniversary. I took this as something they were offering complimentary. Dessert was on the bill. We didn't say anything about either, didn't want to damper our night or have any dispute.
