Very Asian inspired decor. One side of the restaurant is opened where guest can stand/walk around (lounge sitting). The other half of the restaurant is more quiet, reserved.  

Service very slow at first. I sat at the bar and waited over 20 minutes for my drink order! And my mouth was dry too!  :-( I finally get my turn. The barista is very friendly and apologetic for the wait. I select a glass of Riesling and it came to me in no time.

For dinner, I opted for the tansy salad with chicken. (And the clock is ticking!)  16 minutes...yes!  And it's delicious! They're forgiven!

Oh, and the bathroom is pretty spacious, well designed with big mirrors... You know how we girls love 'checking' ourselves! ;-)
