1U9lgJoEhxaCMP0PsuSJgA We arrived to our hotel a bit late, starving and luckily Barro's delivered to our hotel. That being said I am not sure it is a good thing. Maybe the pizza is better in the restaurant but I was SO disappointed in the cheese sticks as well as the pizza especially after reading other reviews.

The pizza and cheese sticks were greasy (and not in a good way). The sauce and pizza lacked flavor. On a positive note the crust was good and not soggy. 

Next time I will ask what other options for pizza delivery the hotel recommends.
