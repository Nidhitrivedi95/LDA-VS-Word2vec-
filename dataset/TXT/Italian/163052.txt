lvv9Vv_5i4IwvDdofO_rKg I visited Trattoria Mercatto in October 7th, 2014. We were a group of 5. We are tourists  visiting Toronto. The only good dish we ordered was tuna dish. Spicy chicken was very dry. Pizza was not like you would expect in an Italian restaurant, more like fast food, like baked from frozen. The salad!!!! greens were dirty enough that I could not eat my salad. When I mentioned this to the waitress, he did nothing just took my plate, no apology, not bringing a new one, nor saying anything like he would take it off from the bill. The bill paid by my friend, with credit card. He paid cash for the service. He receives SMS for every transaction he makes instantly. In the SMS it said he was charged 43 dollar more than the bill. He asked the reason of overcharge, the answer was quite shocking. Overcharge was for in case of we did not pay anything for the service! They said they would refund it. They do similar insalts to tourists in New York, too. I cannot believe what type of robber they are! Good luck to everyone who wants to eat at Trattoria Mercatto.
