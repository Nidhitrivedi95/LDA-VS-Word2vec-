pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Crazy Alfredo was very tasty, although a bit smaller than i would expect for 25 bucks.  You get 1 basket of bread for free - only got 4 small pieces of bread that was more or less burned.  Waiter spent 20 minutes straight talking to the table next to me and ignored me more or less.  I think he liked the daughter.  Thank God for the bus boy who kept bringing me drinks.  Overall well worth the hour long walk from the strip.
