FA-FJyVkMsgsLsoQWe4QFg I really wanted to be able to give this place 5 stars after reading all the reviews but I just cant. The pizza here is above average but it's not amazing, which is unfortunate because it's priced like it should be amazing. When you are charging $22-24 for a single very thin 16" crust pizza (we had a De Sano) it ought to be amazing. We also had a spinach salad; it too was good but overpriced. On top of that they have the gall to ask for 15%+ tip BEFORE you eat and its really closer to a panera level of service; also like someone pointed out, you don't even get plates, you're eating on paper towels! :( They bring out your pizza when its cooked and that's about it. 15% for that? Our pie was a little under-baked and the ingredients were just ordinary. Don't get me wrong; this is a decent pizza place with friendly service (and they do serve their pizza FAST!), just not worth the high prices they are asking.
