DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA Terrible food. Way over priced. I tried to tip the waitress and she looked around before taking it. Whoever give this place 5 stars must've just came out of prison and forgot what real food should taste like. Items ordered was either very soggy (Burger) or tastes as if it was frozen (pasta). I heard that they were on TV and I should have known they was on show called Kitchen Nightmares cause that's exactly what is was. A nightmare.

    If you want frozen food save your money and get a $2 sandwich from McDonalds at least there you know you get what you paid for. These morons that give this place 5 stars with all these photos attached have to be paid insiders cause the food looked nothing like what I either saw or received. I will never insult my taste buds again. I can probably get a better meal cooked by a three legged, one eyed cat before this place produces anything other than below sub-par. I wont waste time saying staff front house was horrid (outside of the poor waitress who look like she was apart of some waitress sweat shop hoping to be saved from her employment hell). Im sure everyone else already mentioned it right? Yea I know.
