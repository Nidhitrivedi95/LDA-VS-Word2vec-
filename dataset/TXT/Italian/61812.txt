azE1DNVQFBU8boVbaJhj7w i wanted *really* badly to like lidia's, but landed on 3 stars.

-1 for the hours on the yelp site being wrong.  which led to my wife and i walking from downtown twice--once when they were closed, and once more (later) when they were open.  the worker was nice, and explained how changing the hours on yelp was impossible due to a "corporate thing".  i just submitted an edit on yelp, wasn't that hard.

to make up for the mixup, they gave us a reservation for later and seated us at a "table with a view".  it was a nice gesture, but the view was underwhelming (just a window outside).  the worker was really nice about it.

my wife ordered the trio, but only liked 1 of the 3.  we did enjoy how they brought the skillet right to our table, 1 at a time, to serve the trio.

i had the gnocchi with duck ragu.  it was above average, but didn't take the cake.  the duck was tender, but slightly more on the gamey side than expected.

overall, it was a fine dining experience, but "just" fine.  we've crossed it off our to-eat list; we don't need to return.
