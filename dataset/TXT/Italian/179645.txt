nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A This restaurant was okay. There weren't a ton of people and it took FOREVER to get served. Also,there is no bathroom in the restaurant so you have to schlep out into the hotel which is a pain. 
The food was fine, not really memorable. The decor was odd, it was like old home comfort mixed with a modern feel? Either go old home comfort to match your food or go modern? The server was nice and personable.
