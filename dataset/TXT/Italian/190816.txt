PbyUiq4uk7ycJz0QujOQNQ We took our pre-teen granddaughters here before the Pageant. Food was good and generous. Service was attentive. Nice music combo in the background. Have to say, the place doesn't wow me. However, for this kind of venue they do a nice job and is worth it for a convenient before the Pageant thing.
