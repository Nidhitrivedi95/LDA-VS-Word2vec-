JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A The location of this place is convenient. My friends and I have been here twice to grab a bite to eat before heading to the Panasonic theatre.

The first time we went they were very accommodating. One of our friends had a broken leg so they were able to seat us on the first level. There are three levels to this restaurant and the stairs are pretty steep. 

The second time we sat up in the third level. The balcony seat is great, however because of the location its difficult to get the waitress' attention being all the at the back. The portions are quite large and its worth the price. However, they did mix up my order and ended up charging me more for my meal. 

The mac and cheese was large but a bit plain. I would definitely recommend it with some jalapeños or ketchup if you like ketchup with your Mac and cheese.
