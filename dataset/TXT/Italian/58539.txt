aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA I live close to Oregano's, and our family always wanted to try this place out. 
What a better occasion than trying it for my 21st wedding anniversary. It was very packed, so we had the impression it was going to be phenomenal food. We sat outside, and we immediately fell in love with the environment. We sit there for 20 minutes and we order some drinks. Our service was nothing spectacular, and the server fail to suggest any options. We ordered the Big Rig Pasta; a very dry pasta with no flavor whatsoever. My daughter ordered Lady is A Scampi, very dry pasta as well not worth the money. Furthermore, Alfredo the Dark was dry pasta, little sauce topped with tomato.  In addition, the wings were extremely salty. The pizza was good. The only thing we loved was the dessert! Never coming back, I'd rather stick to the regular Olive Garden or Malee's on Main.
