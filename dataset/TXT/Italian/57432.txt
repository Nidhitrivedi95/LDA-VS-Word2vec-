anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg Went here for a business dinner with a colleague.  Great old Las Vegas vibe, subdued lighting, nicely appointed bar and dining room.  We were seated at a booth, had a few cocktails, calamari appetizer was excellent.  I had the garbage Caesar and it was one of the best salads I've ever had.  My partner had the standard Caesar and enjoyed it as well.  I had the rigatoni bolognese and he had the scampi, again, both were excellent.  We finished with a small chocolate topped puff pastry (2 per order- can't remember name) and coffee.  I thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and food and will definitely return.  Big, secure valet lot was nice too.
