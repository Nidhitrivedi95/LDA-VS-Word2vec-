Cr5CLpmVrmzFyz_RfQ6rmA ambience rustic with mismatch decor, cutlery with normal cloth wrap. Mismatch appetizer plates. Ordered appetizer ls very oily(drenched) charity bread small portion good cause also fries extremely oily. For Saturday mid afternoon empty maybe three clients in total. Food arrived fast, service was quick, as it wasn't busy. We ordered appetizers-meal-dessert and coffee. Pictures include somethings we ate. Also I house mozzarella, we asked for taste test. Would I return will do, but would say relax on the oil.
