HUWLnKD5LSZY134amUO2Rg I came to this place for a stromboli craving. I've been here before for their pizza (which was traditional NY style) and knew that they wouldn't dissapoint. My stromboli was ready within a reasonable time considering they make all their foods from scratch. It was definitely proportional to my appetite and loved every minute of it. The meat and cheese is good quality and they don't bog it down with extra dough; perfect meat to dough ratio. I will definitely be coming back when I get another hankering!
