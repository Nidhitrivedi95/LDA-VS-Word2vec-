_7nELtYw3n2DzMN8252lhQ Bought a groupon and decided to try the place out.

Parking:
 First there is no parking lot, it is all on street parking, which was fine because it was after 7 and we didn't have to put money into the meters.

Ambience:
Great design and layout of the location, brick walls, wooden booths, old wine bottles on wall.

Service:
Absolutely terrible. We never got refills on our water or soda. We received the food and never asked if we needed anything. Had to go to the waitress to ask her for red pepper flakes. The other waitress was kissing some guy a few times, and she never came over either. I didn't even try to get management as the lady who looked to be the manager was texting on her phone the entire time and looked uninterested in helping tables.

Food:
We ordered the pizza and it was absolutely awful. Think $5 antoons pizza in oakland. The middle completely fell apart. And the pizza was over topped. I never thought you could put too many toppings on a pizza. But it must have been close to a pound of hot peppers on it, and this pizza crust couldn't manage to hold it all together. 


Overall:
I will never come back to here.
