Y-hmtitiRfg7vmc3N-lTww We decided to visit tonight for the first time in a year. Delighted to find tasteful remodeling of the restaurant, yet the menu contained old favorites and new recipes. 

The portions were generous and tasty. Our waitress recommended the evening specials and I ordered the Italian grill. 

We can't wait to make a return visit.
