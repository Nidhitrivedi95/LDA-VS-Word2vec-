M4aYULZRHDTJVbgcYlFtCw Good ol fashion greasy, italian pizza! The pizza is pretty basic, can get pricey as you add toppings. Their wings are HUGE however last time we ordered them they smelt rotten, they tasted good but smelt like they were waaay past due. 

If you're really craving something delicious; give their sandwiches a try. I strongly recommend their chicken parm or chicken caesar.  

Staff is friendly bunch of guys with not a lot to say but customer service is alright.
