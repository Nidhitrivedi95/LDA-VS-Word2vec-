UBW3Asjmih0nARbBNK3oEA Just happened to pass by this place with my girlfriends and decided to try out this Italian restaurant, and it was a satisfying choice.  I had the fettuccine con pana with a glass of mimosa.  The crispy and savoury pana goes well with the creamy fettuccine. The mimosa was refreshing but the drink was quite small. The staff was super friendly and even offer to take photos for us. The food menu is only one page - some appetizers, salad, pasta, and pizza selections.  Slightly pricy, but the nice and clean decor, the helpfulness of the staff, and the quality of food match the price.
