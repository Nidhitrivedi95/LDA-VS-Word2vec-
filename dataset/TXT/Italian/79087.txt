D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg At the top of Palms Fantasy Tower, it's awesome.  If your group is hot enough you'll get walked up to Playboy/Moon.  Soft shell crab is my fave thing on the menu, sorry to say.  Their entrées were kinda mediocre.  For presentation of restaurant they get 4 stars, food is 3 at best.  Sorry Mr. Malouf.
