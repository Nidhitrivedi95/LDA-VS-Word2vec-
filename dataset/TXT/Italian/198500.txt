pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw So we had heard about this place from the pizza book and we show up and I kid you not the place is the size of my shed and there is a line out the door and around the front of the building..... just to get your name listed. We finally wait in a 40 min. line and get to the front where the snotty little bitch, rolls her eyes and musters up with - It's a 6.5 hour wait. So your table will be ready at 10:30pm. WTF?
So you're telling me i'd get faster service and better pizza if I boarded a plane for Manhattan and even get to eat my favorite pizza -BEFORE this place can seat me?
Seriously I am not sure if this man is a fucken retard or a a genius?

Get TWO sheds !!!! You had SOOO much money walk away that night and I am sure it happens night after night... But no then there are the idiot hipsters and yuppies who insist on waiting around, getting drunk and spending money at the bar......... "oh the bar" ... you say.
YES, the bar is often the place restaurants make the most profit. So perhaps he is a genius, because the place was packed there as well. 

Treat them like shit, tell them no and to go away and wait at the bar for 6.5 hours and see how hungry and drunk you will be at 10:30pm

I know what you're saying italiano.

Oh and with only ONE bathroom for both men and women.... don't expect the line for the potty to be any shorter.

YES WE LEFT!!
