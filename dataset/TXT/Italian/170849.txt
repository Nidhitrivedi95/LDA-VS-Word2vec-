mX9wWpoz1x6-snTvxlIOOg Five of us for dinner and everyone had a great meal.       The house salad that came with the entrees was way above average with different types of fresh lettuce, veggies dried cranberries, candied walnuts and the homemade raspberry vinaigrette dressing was delicious. The manhattan style seafood chowder was very good with lots of chunky veggies, chopped clams and white fish. Our meals were chicken parmigiana, chicken saltimbocca (instead of veal, accommodated by request), Australian baby lamb chops (done perfectly--medium rare, slightly charred exterior), sole francaise and one of us had the eggplant and shrimp mornay appetizer as their entree which was perfect. I tasted them all and each one was delicious. 
Service (Pete) was spot-on. Friendly and attentive. Happy to make a recommendation. 
Topped off the meal with still warm house made cookies offered compliments of the house. And not to shortchange the cookies -- those cranberry white chocolate chip gems were almost worth the trip by themselves!
