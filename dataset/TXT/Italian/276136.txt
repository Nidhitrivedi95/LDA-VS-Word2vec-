YDeN4OHayfKocEo7Tz4jMg Overpriced Olive Garden - unfortunately, the quality of the food is poor and the service is sub par. Veggies are frozen, not fresh - this is a big downer on the pizzas and salads. The servers know nothing about the wine or the food for that matter. To give them a break, the place is brand new. I do not recommend this restaurant and predict it will close within 6 months.
