Jl-NFBNJ0PeIAfO_bDLojQ We splurged and came here for Mothers' Day.  Unfortunately the service was smug; our server seemed uninterested and didn't smile, even when we tried to make chit-chat.  The food was good, but servings small.  We left hungry.  Also, the place is not kid-friendly.  We were charged $2.50 for a half glass of milk.  I wish there were more dining options in the area - on Sundays much of Sewickley is closed - I wonder how stores stay in business.
