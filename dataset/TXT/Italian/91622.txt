EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw We ordered the Mussels tomato pasta dish 12/3/16. The mussels didn't not taste fresh,(I'm from the east coast and we know our seafood) pasta was over cooked and the sauce was lacking taste of any kind. The meal was $22. Very disappointed. Our friends ordered another pasta dish with an egg on it, same thing. The pasta was over cooked and lacking flavor again. The lamb entree dish was ok. The small apps tasted better. Wait staffwas friendly and we didn't have to pay for the mussels pasta dish but the food is definitely over priced for what you get. Don't think we will go back again. Over rated place for sure. We tried 3 different entrees and all were fair too poor unfortunately.
