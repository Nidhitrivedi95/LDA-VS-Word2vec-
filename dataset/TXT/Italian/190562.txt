p8URfi68QVheLkNlaIG-lA I like that the menu here has some very inventive choices - like scotch eggs, rabbit, wild boar sloppy joes... I ordered the wild boar sloppy joes. They tasted just like regular sloppy joes actually. The pretzel bun was delicious. My only dislike was that the sauce was a bit too salty. The fries were delicious!

Everyone else also enjoyed their dinner. My friend said the rabbit was good although a little difficult to get off the bone. My boyfriend enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese and said there was the perfect amount of lobster in it. 

I also liked that they had the option to get 4 samplers of beer for $12. I enjoyed the prickly pear cider.

I would probably come here again if I was on that side of town.

If I had one suggestion it would be to work on the decor of the back room where the tree is. The white walls and lighting made it feel a little sparse. I think slightly dimmer lighting and candles and more lanterns in the tree would create a nicer atmosphere.
