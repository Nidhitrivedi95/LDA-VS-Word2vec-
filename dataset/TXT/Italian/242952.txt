Went to Ve Bene for my birthday dinner . 

Food:  I had the Chicken Marsala Entre . It was very flavorful and the chicken was perfect.  For dessert we ordered creme brûlée and tiramisu.  Since it was my birthday I was given the tiramisu complimentary with a candle in it. (Very nice). We were told that the desserts were homemade . They were fantastic . 

Service : Excellent!

Ambience : We had dinner in the dining room but the also have a lounge. I loved the artwork and decor throughout the restaurant .  Our reservations were at 8 pm and as we were leaving we could hear the live band starting to play in the lounge. If I hadn't worked a long hard day we would have moved into the lounge for a cocktail and entertainment. Looks like a lot of locals enjoy Friday nights at the lounge.  

I will definitely return to Ve bene in the near future.  If you want delicious well prepared food, excellent service and great ambience then Ve Bene is the place.
