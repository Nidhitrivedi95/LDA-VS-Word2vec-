VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w I did not eat here, my review is strictly for the Lavo Day Party

Pros:
Okay music. I am more into hip hop than I am into EDM/rave music, and the music was a good blend of both which I did enjoy
free drinks (I believe from 1-3)
Not a super long wait for the bathrooms, they have a second one upstairs
The environment is really fun. The staff member passed up glow sticks, glow necklaces, some had a paddle that said spank me and would spank anyone that asked.
They encourage dancing on tables that are left out

Cons:
It is a brunch, so the whole place was covered with tables.I mean, full of them. It get really awkward trying to dance with someone eating right next to you. 
Because of the crowd, your either dancing next to tables or dancing next to the bar, which is inconvenient for people who are just trying to buy a drink and leave.

Overall, my friends and I had fun here. Haft of us liked hip hop and the other haft EDM, so it was a good blend for us all to be happy. 
This place could be better if they made more space for people to enjoy themselves.
