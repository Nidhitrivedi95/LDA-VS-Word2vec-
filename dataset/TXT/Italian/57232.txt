ANAGlfG4ELW3jiO62GQ1zw I had the BEST baked lobster ziti here. It was unreal how good it was, perfectly tender ziti baked in a rich, creamy sauce with huge hunks of silken tender lobster on top. So good. The restaurant has a beautiful interior of rich reds and brown that reflects the wonderful and rich food. I also had the calamari which was delicious and a stellar caesar salad. Finished with the white chocolate amaretto cheesecake which was the most perfect, decadent end to the meal.
