EUQoB_ph7_xIyj7JZGI3bg Avoid. Expensive wine list and our waiter pulled a wine scam on me.  The wine list here is ridiculously expensive. I ordered the least expensive bottle of Chianti for $32 ( what they call "house",  and this is not a fancy place) and I got attitude for it!  Our waiter asked: "Wasn't I sure I wanted the next step up at $38?" I did not want to pay more. Even after I accepted the tasting, the wandering owner of the place shot our waiter a look like "dig Mr. Cheapskate over there..." The waiter poured three half glasses from our bottle. Then the waiter took the bottle away. ( Bad sign, in retrospect) When I asked for the rest of the bottle, he said we finished it! I know wine bottles and there were  more than three half glasses in that bottle. I asked if he was sure and he said yes. Rather than create a scene with my party - a buzz kill for sure to argue over this -  I ordered three more glasses  - at an additional $24. The waiter opened a new bottle, poured, and guess what, there was about a half bottle left!  I was not happy! Not happy about the brazen attitude for ordering a $32 bottle or the very short first bottle. I think I was scammed.  Every order should be respected. The food was good, I admit, and reasonably priced but it must act as a lure to soak you on the wine. They do carry out and this would be the only way to enjoy this place, in my opinion.Better yet, try someplace else.
