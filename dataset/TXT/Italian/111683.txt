Ordered: cold hazelnut coffee
Cost: likely $4.00 but free
The place is hard to find. Google maps will lead you to the Alpha Laboratories building. The entrance to the café is on the south side of the building, near the middle.
The customer service here is outstanding. The owner took the time to explain about his café, offered to make a custom cold hazelnut coffee for us, gave us samples of the different sweetness levels, and then did not charge us for it.
The person I was with loved the service but thought the drink was not that great. Only after stirring it was it discovered what was wrong with it.
Bottom line: Our drink wasn't outstanding (7.4/10=3.7/5=4/5), but the great customer service will bring me back to give this place another try.
A thought: Hmm, I wonder if the ratings for this place are so high because a lot of the first purchases were free. We like to think it doesn't influence our decision, but it likely does.
