esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA Expensive and you can get better quality oysters at Kings Fish....the alcohol is pretty good but people tend to disappear to the back of the restaurant for long periods of time....

Skip this place unless you are staying in the hotel and don't feel like going anywhere else...
