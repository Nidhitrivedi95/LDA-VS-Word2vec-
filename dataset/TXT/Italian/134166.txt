iqntlaqSCB4hkzTzlPlEmQ This was my 3rd visit and by far the best,probably because Manuel was our server. The best service so far. I was a bit worried because our last visit we had to flag down people to get drinks refilled. Not this time our glasses were never even near empty. So besides the amazing service the food was really very good. Highly recommend the spinach artichoke dip. We split a house salad. Which was cold and crisp. My Husband had the pasta Fra Diablo, he liked it but I think he liked mine better I had the pasta Bravo and it was sooo good. I think my only criticism would be the cheese grating oh my goodness it took forever and a lot of muscle for the poor lady who served us our entree. I told her they should get the crank grater. It would be so much easier. Management news flash diners like Parmesan on their pasta. This is not the place to try and save money with stingy cheese graters. I would definetly recommend Bravo. Hopefully you'll be as lucky as we were and get Manuel as your server.
