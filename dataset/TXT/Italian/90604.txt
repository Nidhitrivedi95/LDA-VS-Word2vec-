eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA An old friend of mine turned me on to Brio and I fell in love! I have never experienced bad service at the Tivoli Village location. The down fall for my husband and I is that the bill can add up quite quickly, by the time we have added drinks, salads and a few of those little mini desserts. It's worth it though, the peach sangria (get the pitcher) is yummo, and those mini desserts are even better! 
My husband can be a picky eater too, and he is always able to find something on the menu that he can eat. The kids menu is pretty good too, the kids hamburger is huge and they love the fries!
