G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Great decor, view and the oysters were the best I have had! 

HOWEVER, my shrimp spaghetti with lemon and basil was served without shrimp and when they brought them on the side, they were extremely overcooked! The lamb was undercooked and the white lasagna needed salt. Server was very nice but not at the fine dining level. 

This place has potential to be worth the price but the kitchen needs to ensure food going out is perfect.
