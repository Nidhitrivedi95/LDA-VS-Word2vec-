bhM8_lovbEHjX5FK6Zfenw Disappointed.  Went with group of 10, seated by ourselves in a room.  Still way too noisy.  Could hardly hear person next to you.  Food served to 8 of us - waited till got cold, started in.  Rest finally served - said kitchen mixup- should have let us know upfront.  I got spaghetti with italian sausage.  Pasta too soft (not al dente) and Paul Neuman or Prego sauce better. Sausage was best part.  Folks next to me got seafood pasta - said only found shrimp in it, and too cheesy.  Mine needed cheese - was halfway done before waiter appeared to ask for some parmesan.  Better italian places out there - at least at chain Olive Garden you get soup and salad too!
