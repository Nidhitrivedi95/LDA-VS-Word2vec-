2QBD8wYCrwgOGRfHKvS23w I don't like pizza that has dried oregano just sprinkled over the top after it has come out of the oven. My husband is elderly and has a smaller appetite. He wanted to order a childs portion, but the counter gal argued with him that it was only for kids.. talk about age discrimination! The spaghetti was nothing to brag about.. just run of the mill sauce. I doubt we will be back. I also worry about pizza sitting in  a case at room tempurature..there is meat on it! It is spoiling.It also makes me wonder how clean this place is.
