yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Food isn't over spectacular but it was good enough to get the job done; fill me up. I've had better italian elsewhere but I don't expect much from Vegas restaurants. Then again, this is an old school joint so maybe it should be better. With that said I would come again for the comfort.
