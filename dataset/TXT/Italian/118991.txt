h-bBnFFTZ2cNiuBMFu2UaQ This is a great place to go for anything ! Resturant, Bar, Sports Bar, hangout. Wish it was here years ago. Atmosphere is wonderfully eclectic, and the service and staff should be the envy of every eatery in Phoenix. The Pizza ? Authentic and mouth watering with great ingrediends. We've been there with clients and they loved  my choice, and raved about everything they ordered. I've had the Brisket, and it is the BEST I've had ever in 50 years. It is a delight to your pallete and well worth coming back for, but be hungry. Priced right for your wallet, but well below what it's worth. You gotta try Tommy's Place.
