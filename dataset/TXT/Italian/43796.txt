82hYL5WPQpvxg8ekDsB83A My MAIN reason for giving this place 2 stars is because of our waitress. She was awful. Took 30 minutes to even get our drinks. Then another 30 to get our salads. She would leave for long periods of time without asking us if we needed anything. Another reason for my disappointment is, paying almost $20 for chicken marsala and getting canned mushrooms???? Are you kidding me!? YUK! Will not return...
