Y6ujotEhfTZd2JPZmsQ-Ow I believe this mom-and-pop shop deserves five stars for their friendly service and delicious food! The only reason I chose to go with a four star rating was because of its location.

While they are located on Ferry Road, just off of Ohio River Boulevard, be sure and travel a little farther north towards Ambridge, and cross at the overpass. You will find this awesome gem of a bar/restaurant inside the Leetsdale Industrial Park.

Using a coupon from Eat24, I decided to try give one of their signature sandwiches a try, the Giovanni. I added a side of onion rings. The reviews for this location are spot on! Delicious combination of flavors and an awesome variety of food!

More important to me then the food, believe it or not, it's customer service. And this place has it!
