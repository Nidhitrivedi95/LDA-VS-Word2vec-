8cQc0BRbkSDSkLn6oFw3mw Had an unpleasant experience with service as well as food. My sons pancake was raw , my husband had to get up twice to get his own coffee and the waitress's excuse was that their food was cheap. I guess in her mind that justifies our experience . When we communicated our concerns she asked us to pick up our kids and leave. In an age where customer service is so important I would rather pay an extra dollar in order to be able to enjoy a good meal with my family..
