KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg BEST PIZZA EVER.  They cook it Napoli-style for 90 seconds in a really hot oven, so the crust is crispy and delicious.  Great variety of toppings and high quality ingredients.  I ordered the duck confit pizza which was quite good, but my boyfriend's choice was superior - one of the prosciutto options.  It tasted like heaven in pizza form.  Noisy atmosphere and very busy but well worth the wait (which was only 10 minutes, not bad).  I will definitely return here next time I'm in Toronto.  The only bad thing is the pizza is so delicious you will eat it all and then not have any room for all the delicious-looking desserts!
