eTmy0-h4tTEpfbDVAue0MA Spinato's is a locally owned family ran pizza/restaurant chain. You can do take out service or you can get seated in the cozy dining room or patio. This location gets very busy around happy hour time and might be on a wait during all of happy hour.

The people we with highly recommended getting the Spinach Calzone with added Ricotta Cheese. We ordered and it took a very long time for the Calzones to come out of the kitchen but once they arrived our server was very attentive and brought us sauce with the calzones.

If you are very critical with your tasting you will notice that the sauce is very sweet and also very salty. If you are a normal taster and taste the sauce on the calzone you will see it as wildly flavorful.

I liked that the calzones had a thin crisp dough. The calzones were also very heavy with garlic and stuffed with lots of melty cheese and lots of fresh baby spinach. Overall it was tasty and service was good. 

Prices are low and the food is very filling.

You'll leave stuffed like a calzone.

3.5 stars rounded up because for Phoenix Standards I feel the food I tasted and atmosphere seemed above what the average neighborhood pizza joint offers.
