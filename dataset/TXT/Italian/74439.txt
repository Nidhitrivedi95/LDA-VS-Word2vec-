cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q I'm writing my review from my visit a week ago. I had called 2 months ago to set up reservations for a large party. My sons first communion dinner. I was offered some menus and had a very friendly experience with Shelly(?) the manager. I called Monday before the party to give my final head count and ask for high chairs to a gentleman manager (didn't get the name). I get there Sunday and the guy upfront doesn't seem to know what I was talking about. They tell us to take a seat. Then they seat us. Now I budgeted for this dinner with the special menu.  There was no high chairs at the table and I had to go find someone for them. Then I realize we have regular menus at our table. No kids menus and not even water. We finally get the right menus and the server was awesome but still waiting on a drink. We just came from church it's hot and now my little guy is not feeling well. I took the bottle water from my purse to give him a drink. I'm really disappointed that I called and tried to have this set up for a relaxing dinner and ended up with a headache! But I will say that our server was awesome once things got rolling. Just sad we had to wait so long for drinks.
