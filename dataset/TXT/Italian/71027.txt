C4sVRSWeWuXo0OtnXewsjQ Great food but they mess up a lot!! 

My coworkers and I order from the Richmond location regularly and we often have to go back to get our orders corrected. 

I have a gluten allergy and more then once they have given me regular pasta. Luckily I noticed or I would have been very sick for several days.

We have also had a caterpillar and a lady bug in the Americana salad (separate occasions) and an elastic bands in a chicken wrap.

I know they're busy but that's just lazy!
