tIiiq23utFKTs1At2bVD6w We were the couple that took an earlier reviewer here. We have now been here 4 times and can't wait to go again. The food is amazing and the prices are very reasonable. We have asked for Eloy every time. We were lucky enough to have him the first time and now he is an important part of our visit. What a classy and professional young man. Service reminds me of the professional manner in which you are served in other countries but not as often in the USA. 

The food is amazing. Last night I asked Eloy to bring me whatever he thought I should have that I had not tried yet. He brought lasagna. Not your mama's lasagna or for sure mine! This was the best lasagna I have ever had. Really fantastic. My wife had a special mussel appetizer that she had once before. She was in heaven again! The chicken is great, all the variations. The veal parm is to die for. The deserts.... You can go basic italian comfort food, or fancy interesting combinations not available anywhere else.

The atmosphere would make you comfortable to bring a date of bring the family. Unusual to find a restaurant that can cater to both families as well as a romantic couple. 

It s forty minute drive for us from Huntersville. But it is one we will gladly drive just to enjoy Eloy and the food of his fantastic restaurant. Best Italian in Charlotte without the attitude or expenses. They actually treat you like they appreciate your business. 

Love it.
