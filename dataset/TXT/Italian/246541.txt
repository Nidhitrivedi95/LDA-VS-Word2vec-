V_6gs6mUnUwrTQFVvWKW1A The girls in the office and I got take out here yesterday. None of us had been here before. I wanted to give it a try mainly because of the gluten free pasta and noodles offerings. I got the regular sized Pesto Cavatappi with the GF [fusilli] noodles ($1.59 extra), and added chicken (about $2 and change). Although my pasta was warm, it was quite delicious. I think it could have used a touch more sauce but overall it was good and I ate the whole thing. Two coworkers got the Pad Thai and said that it was very dry. Perhaps more sauce would have made it better. Another peer ordered the small Japanese Pan Noodles and also the small Penne Rosa. Although she enjoyed the penne, she said the pan noodles fell short of her expectations. We were all a little shocked at just how small the small servings are. The pan noodles literally had maybe 4 longish noodles in it. My work peers probably won't give it a 2nd try, but I enjoyed my meal and I would absolutely go back. If this location is really brand new, perhaps they just need to iron out a few things and perhaps this review will assist with that. I wish them all the best.
