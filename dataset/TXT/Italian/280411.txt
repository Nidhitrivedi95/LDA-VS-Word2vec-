Yo8ODT7aFMM2xKUd1yaBVw Our appetizer was phenomenal - salami, mortadella, shrimp, calamari, bruschetta; Chicken Parmesan shared was light, tender and delicious!!  The service was outstanding (thank you Marcos!).   Some of the best Tiramisu I have ever tasted.  The manager stopped by and checked in, just a really nice evening.  A really lovely evening after a long week.
