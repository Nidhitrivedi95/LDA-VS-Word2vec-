XVDR44P_74FmA0ANanm4CQ House of Pizza is a Charlotte staple. It's a small, family run restaurant that has been around for many years; since I can remember. We often get take out, and occassionally will dine in. The food is consistently good, as are the service and prices. This is not a high end artisan pizzeria, but rather, a good ol' family run pizza joint. We are lucky to live nearby. Being primarily pizza eaters, we haven't tried all of the menu items, but the famous philly cheese steak sub is awesome. The lasagna is good too. The decor is a bit dated and the rug a bit worn, but this is as it should be in such a long running establishment!
