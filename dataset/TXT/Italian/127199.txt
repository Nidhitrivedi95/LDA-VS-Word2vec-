Huo1lJmVkdqvFuLtA74Nhw It was our anniversary, and we were both too tired to actually go out anywhere. We placed our order on justeat. 2 orders of veal Parmesan, a Caesar salad, and some bruschetta. The order was finalized and we waited, and waited, and waited. Finally over an hour later our order was delivered. I started taking the tinfoil packages out of the bag, but one of the orders of veal was missing. I called back, and the woman on the phone was extremely rude and actually accused me of trying to scam a free order out of them because she knows that the veal was put in the delivery bag. After 10 minutes of being put on hold, she told me that they would send the driver back with another order. No apology or anything, just attitude. So we waited again, 45 more minutes. I know that mistakes happen and all, but when I'm spending $70 for take out, I don't appreciate being made to feel like some kind of criminal because they're kitchen can't read an order slip properly. Needless to say we won't be back here anytime soon. It really is too bad, they do have some amazing food.
