Nice house cured meats.
Tasty and interesting pizza.
PA Cheese Board with apple butter was delicious.
Pistachio and Porchetta with Arugula pizza was sweet and tasty.
Margherita pizza was good too!


Looks like Yelp may finally have it figured out.  You can actually do a search for Mezzo and get it...have been waiting about six months for that..LOL
