k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ Went to The Parlor while visiting AZ over the holidays. 

Overall, it had a nice look. I enjoyed the old pictures from when the building was a salon. 

We loved the homemade pasta. My table shared the pappardelle bolognese and actually ended up ordering another portion. I recommend the roasted brussels sprouts - something tells me they have a ton of butter in them, but that is probably why they were so tasty. Unfortunately, no one at the table liked the pizza. We ordered the margherita. The tomatoes were tasteless and the house made mozzarella was so so. The crust was burned on the edges and soggy in the middle. We ended up ordering a side of tomato sauce to help give the pizza more flavor. 

We would go back for the fresh pasta but most likely skip the pizza.
