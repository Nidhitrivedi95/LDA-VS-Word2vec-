_gPnYd3rGKRB6yo2DCcHmQ Disappointing to start off with.

We choose from the "Pre-theatre Menu" which was almost like a tourist trap kinda menu. 

The interior was nice but not really Italian, more hotel restaurant feel. 

How do you get carpaccio de Mortadella? Simply add a few slices of mortadella to some lettuce, there you go.  A tad novice and a rip off. I had caprese de mozzarella - ok again nothing to shout with joy. 

For mains, the other half had the gnocchi, which was under seasoned. Don't they taste the food before it goes out?  I had the chicken with shrimps and veg. It had a tomato sauce. Once again it was nothing with the wow factor but it was ok. 

I question this, why is this place doing the groupon voucher?  Surely it's to get new people through the door. With this visit and although the staff and customer service was good I feel a three star is valid as I thought the food let the hype down for locando di gusto.  I don't think we'll be back as I can cook better Italian food than here and I've certainly had better in other restaurants in the uk and in Italy. 

I had this on my restaurant bucket list as one to go to but I was so disappointed with the food as I was so looking forward to it.  

Value and food just lets the place down.
