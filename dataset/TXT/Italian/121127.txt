HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A Mastrioni's is more than meets the eye, from street-view it can be a bit less desirable but the food makes up for what the restaurant lacks in looks and we all know that what really matters is how your food looks/tastes. The atmosphere is charming with a dash of chatter. 

The excellent service is also paired with a delightful wine list but beware of the portions when choosing your food as the most dishes are fairly heavy. To start we got healthy portions of caprese and calamari to share; followed by veal marsala and fettuccine alfredo; topped off with cannolis.

Definitely will be back if in the area.
