tWdp26XQEJqJGnRmFVJQxA This place is soooo amah-zing! My fiancée and I went for a late lunch. The building is just around the corner from my place but I never noticed it. I read the positive reviews on Yelp and thought I'd give it a shot. We were the only people but it was raining so we weren't concerned. 

I ordered the blood orange S.Pellegrino, I really like that they put a slice of blood orange in my small rocks glass. Nice touch. We got a beet and goat cheese salad to start. The portion was awesome and all the flavours were on point. I think the salad had some fresh herbs which was very tasty.

We then got a pizza and pasta to share. The zucchina (tomato sauce / mozzarella / grilled zucchini / goat cheese / mint /we added prosciutto) and The commendatore (sausage / smoked provolone / spinach / leeks / pistachios / cream). They were absolutely delicious and we had half the pizza for take out. 

Prices were good for the huge portion sizes. My only suggestion would be to have a different way to pack the take out. Ours was just wrapped in tinfoil then put in a paper bag. 

Overall great lunch and the server was friendly and efficient.
