qk4nledWnMEkDBiBRPhq4A The only real issue regarding Panera Bread is that you can get cheaper meals elsewhere.
Dropped in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I ordered the 2 for 1 meal....2 choices from either: soup, 1/2 café sandwich or a café salad. I ordered the Turkey chili (I added 2 packets of hot sauce to it to take it up a few notches but it was excellent) and the turkey sandwich (excellent as well....turkey, red onions, lettuce), and pop. Meal also included a bag of Panera potato chips. 
Dining companion ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich (it was excellent) which also included a bag of Panera Potato chips, and a pop
We decided to split a brownie for dessert. It was very dry but had a rich chocolate flavour.
Total cost for both meals came in at just under $28.
The cashier was very friendly...didn't get her name but she was wearing a tag that said she was the Shift Manager.
Place was fairly quiet but décor was nice and the store is bigger than it appear from the outside.
I'd go back again.
