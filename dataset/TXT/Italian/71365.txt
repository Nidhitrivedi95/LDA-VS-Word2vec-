C63sF-wG4f1doMIMv2qvOg Porta Alba seemed to be firing on all cylinders when I went for a lunch with colleagues.  The space is open and inviting, classy, yet laid back.  Great for a business lunch or a dinner date.  We were immediately greeted by a friendly staff member and an equally friendly and helpful waiter.

They serve a wide variety of Neapolitan style pizza options that you'll be struggling to narrow down your choice to just one pie.  I ordered the Salsiccia, which was excellent - great topping to cheese ration, nice sauce, excellent crust.  I did split it with a colleague who ordered a special of the day pie that had a pesto sauce and greens. Both were excellent, but I felt the special pie was a little too generous with the salt.  

If Porta Alba were in my own neighborhood, I would definitely be frequenting this place often to cure my pie fix.
