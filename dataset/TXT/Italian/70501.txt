c-l4nDPZcEwapEiV-Xf08w We went to Ilios Noche over the weekend and had a great time.
The restaurant was busy with lots of laughter in the air.
My daughter and her boyfriend were going their on a satty hawkins date (she's 15).

My wife and I also went separate to grab a bite at the bar and pay for their meal.
We had made reservations for them and they were seated promptly.
They had a Great time and were treated like gold..Thanks you so much Ilios Noche.
Sometimes teen at nice restaurant dont really get the deserved service.

There was a full bar so my wife and I ordered some wine to enjoy in the seating area.
We put our name in and were told the wait could be up to 2 hrs...it is what it is at nice restaurants on a Sat. night.
I asked for the manager "Patrick" to let him know we would be taking care of my daughters bill.
He laughed and thought the whole thing was cute.
To our delight he was able to get us seated fairly quickly and NOT next to my daughters table.
The whole experience was perfect...my daughter and her boyfriend had a Great time...we had a Great meal with first class sevice...AND once again I appreciate that Ilios and the team helped to accommodate our family...What a Rock Star of a manager!!
We will certainly be back and would reccomend this restaurant to anyone.

The atmosphere is wonderful and the food terriffic.
I will say that the thing that put us over the Top was the way the staff made us feel like REAL Guests!

Thanks again.
