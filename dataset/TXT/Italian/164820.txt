Not bad tasting food and plenty of flare to make this place feel like an Italian restaurant. However, they apparently spent a lot of money on the decorations because the prices are just a smidge high, even for being in a city like Toronto.  When I look at the Starters section and I see that an establishment is selling garlic bread and cheese for 7.50$, an item that some places give away free as a side to compliment your dish, something is askew.  The pasta dish I ordered came out quickly and tasted good, I just wish I wasn't staring at a tasty plate of flour, water, chopped tomatoes, various herbs and spices for 14 dollars.  The serving staff was prompt, friendly and knew their information on specials. The bartender had many suggestions on different drinks he could whip together and all in all we had a great time here and would probably be back again at some point.
