gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw I'm actually surprised this place doesn't have a higher rating. I had the chef's antipasti tasting with the accompanying wine tasting, and it was excellent. The cheese and meat plates had great variety and I particularly liked the cherry sauce and apricots that came with the cheese. The verdure was farro, roasted beets with saba, and an eggplant caponata. All three had good flavor and texture, nice balance of flavors. The arancine and frittelle di proscuitto were good, but the fried cauliflower was excellent even though it sounds plain. I'm not a huge fan of raddiccio, but it was served grilled with smoked mozzarella and it was fabulous. The biscotti was also pretty good.

The wines were great, although I can't remember all of their names. They paired wonderfully with the food. The house made amaro was great with the biscotti.

Tip: ask for olive oil with your bread. it's from italy and it tastes amazing - very fruity and fresh. It was also nice to eat the meal and enjoy the opera show and the string quartet provided by the hotel since we ate in the courtyard area.
