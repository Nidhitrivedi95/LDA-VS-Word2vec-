iqntlaqSCB4hkzTzlPlEmQ I feel like dining is all about the experience, and Bravo knows it.

I tried Bravo for the first time a couple weeks ago and it was probably one of the best dining experiences I've had. Besides the food being good, the service was just plain amazing. Our waiter Aaron was probably one of the sweetest guys I've ever met. He recommended a few dishes for us, and told us the reasons why he liked them so much. 

To start we ordered the Calamari, which was perfectly cooked. I hate when calamari is too soggy or when it's overly crispy, but this calamari was just right. It was paired with a spicy horseradish sauce (MUST TRY) and a marinara sauce. 

I ordered the classic spaghettini and meatballs. Now, this spaghettini was different from others in the sense that it had a pomodoro and marinara sauce mixed together. That mixed with the meatballs was absolute perfection.

Bravo is definitely a must try if you're in the Henderson area. I'll be back soon to get my pasta fix.
