BaVtTt9pBoI8rrN35tsj_g Stopped for take out, staff was freindly.   Food came quick.    The reason for the 3 stars is due to the fettuccine alfredo, this olive garden is very stingy with their sauce.    There was barely enough to cover the pasta. I had the same issue last time so I remembered to order extra.    The small serving of sauce cost an extra 3.50 and still wasn't enough.  For now on I'll drive to the arrowhead location
