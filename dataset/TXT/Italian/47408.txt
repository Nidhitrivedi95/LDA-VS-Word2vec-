8yiLVWzJyyTEhYE0fVNvlA I only have one quarrel... They don't allow outside wines. I thought it was strange, even without considering a corkage fee.

However, it was phenomenal. I couldn't been more impressed with the service and the food. There was multiple complementary items - starters, dessert wine, dessert, and champagne. 

We ordered the beef carpaccio, the artichoke hearts, and caprese to start. I would highly recommend the carpaccio then the caprese. I didn't care much for the artichoke hearts with bacon - I feel like it wasn't incredibly impressive on taste and hitting multiple flavors of the tongue. 

For an entree, I ordered the saltimbocca. It was a toss up between that and the lobster ravioli with a truffle sauce, which my friend ordered. Both the saltimbocca and the ravioli were phenomenal. Probably the best saltimbocca I've ever had, and I've had a lot of saltimbocca. 

As far as the price is concerned, I felt the wine is overpriced, but I didn't have a problem spending $130 for a bottle of The Prisoner, which you can get in the store for $40. And overall price - no problem with at all. It was less than 100 bucks a person, which is pretty good, in my opinion. 

Overall, great place. Don't take your own wine. Enjoy the service, it's nearly impeccable. Cheers!
