KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ Right now, it's my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas.  The food is just so darn good.  The only part I don't like is having to make a reservation months in advance....but it's worth it.

I love how they encourage you to split everything and then serve it in courses...Here are my recommendations:

Start with the Antipasto Platter - yummy poopoo platter of proscuitto, cheeses, roasted red peppers, olives...oh so good.  The roasted red peppers alone would be great too.

Then, share/sample the Pasta in Vodka sauce and the Meat Balls (huge savory moist meat).

They say they are famous for the Lemon Chicken...but we had the Veal.  If you do the above, stick with the Veal Chop with Cherry Peppers.   We did the Veal Chop and the Veal Parmesan (which is also fabulous - so much melted cheese it looks like a pizza)!  But the contrast of the veal chop to the pasta and meatball is really superb!

No room for dessert...but go win some money - you're in Vegas, baby!

Rao's - please open up a location in Los Angeles.
