I saw this place on Yelp and we walked for a solid 20 minutes to get here in the cold. I could deal with the fact that there was a wait because it's supposedly popular, but there's no place to wait in the entrance. Once we were seated a half-hour later, we hungrily perused the menu. 

Our server was awkward and made herself scarce. She came by to make strange comments, forgot to take drink orders from half our table, and generally gave off a weird vibe. There were four of us, so we decided to split three pizzas, buttermilk calamari, and an arugula salad. Arugula salad was refreshing. Buttermilk calamari was okay. And then came the pizzas.

We got: a salami pizza, a roasted cremini mushroom pizza, and a special pizza (with prosciutto, goat cheese, onions, etc.). All of our pizzas were burnt. Not just like a little crisp on the side, but like an unpleasant burnt crunch. The salami was too burnt, the roasted cremini had an overwhelming amount of rosemary, and the special was an odd combination of flavors. Just unappealing. I was so disappointed by all three, I didn't get to eat a proper dinner. So fucking mad. Still pretty fucking mad. In fact, every time I pass by this place, i AM INFURIATED. FULL OF REGRET. How is this considered a top restaurant in Toronto?! 

It took forever to get our server to bring our check. I think she could tell we weren't having any of that shit. She had attitude the whole time we spoke to her; do you think this deserves a good tip? I don't. 

Bad service with a side of attitude is on the menu, it seems. She boxed up second helpings of bitch and gave us that to go. Would not come here under any circumstance. I suggest you do the same.
