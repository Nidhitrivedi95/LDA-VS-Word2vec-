oH6QAuoTLFaX97oqqpLTMg On my ongoing quest for the perfect gyro, I decided to try this place out.  As I have heard they served Gryos and verified it on their website.

I was too busy with work today, but my friend went to visit this place and he picked it up for me.

I eagerly unwrapped the well packaged gryo and dug in.  Good!  It is not the same as the other greek restaurant gyros, but it isn't bad either.

The size and the value are on par. I was not disappointed.  There was a bit of lettuce in it, but just picking off some of it made it more manageable.  

The things that stuck out to me: The meat, the onion and the cucumber sauce.  

I am going to be dropping by this place for sure and ordering another!
