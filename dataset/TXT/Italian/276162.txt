YDeN4OHayfKocEo7Tz4jMg La Tagliatella just opened up in the Epicentre and we got an invite to attend the special media night. Being the type of foodies to never pass up an invitation for FREE food we made our reservations and off to La Tagliatela we went.

When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly hostess, given name tags, a media packet, and seated quickly. The night started with a little bowl of olives and a delicious trio of focaccia including tomato, green olive, and onion. The appetizer courses included a caesar salad and a duet of focaccia flat breads. The first with goat cheese, honey, bresaola, balsamic reduction glaze, and finished with crushed pistachios. The second with provoletta cheese, duck ham, arugula and shaved parmigiano reggiano.

That was quickly followed by the thin crust Tagliatella pizza topped with tomato, mozzarella, fried eggplant, parmigiano reggiano, drizzled with honey and aceto balsamico. The two home made pastas that followed were a pappardelle with black truffle, parmigiano reggiano, a fried egg and black caviar, followed by a tortellone stuffed with mozzarella tomato and basil and topped with a sauce of sole di puglia tomatoes, balsamic onions, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts, basil and grana padano. They saved the best for last and brought out two desserts. Bocconcino, a fresh cheesecake and carmel custard, and Torta Rocher, a chocolate and hazelnut mousse cake.

Everything about our dinner and experience at La Tagliatella was fantastic. The food was all fresh, hand made and delicious. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, the dining room was gorgeous and we had a blast.
