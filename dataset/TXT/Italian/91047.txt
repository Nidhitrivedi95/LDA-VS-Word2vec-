EDa7_YfEB2HDOyxDMbipQA 3 times is a charm this place has gone downhill if you plan to eat there make sure you opt to sit down and not do take out, Cold wings, limp pizza. Every time we have an issue they will apologize but it would appear they do not train the staff to do anything different. If you want to experience great Barros Pizza try the one off Peoria and 75th Ave.
