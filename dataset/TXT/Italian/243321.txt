Uqs18_AgDYsByvtSSOMzkw I wish I had read the reviews first. We were starving and craving Italian. This is not that. The steak my son got was good. But that was all. The service was ok but the food took forever. If we had been in the US, I would have complained but I didn't want to be the typical ugly American. I should have. 

Avoid at all costs. .
