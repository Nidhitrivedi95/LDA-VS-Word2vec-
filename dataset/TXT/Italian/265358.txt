wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw I met up with the divine Aly d. to check out the new postinos east on Saturday 4/14 for a lovely lunch date. This is a great time to go because its not overly crowded early in the afternoon. . 

Imbibe:  we each ordered a glass of vino for five dollars and we both enjoyed very much. i went with a nice cab called bliss and Aly ordered a Zin. Wine is a must here.

I ordered a turkey panini, with smoked turkey, tomatoes, provolone, fresh greens and house made pesto....the sandwich was so delicious and the flavors of the pesto was not overpowering just right.  Aly ordered a soup and half a panini. the soup was an excellent choice since it was a cold & rainy day out.

as far as atmosphere..its not as hipster as the one in arcadia but still nice vibe. a couple next to us had a screaming toddler on their hands & poor mom had to leave to not disturb the other customers. I can tune it out for the most part however the ladies in front of us were clearly irritated and they were covering their ears with their hands...too funny that parents bring their kids to a bar to hangout.

overall I like that concept and the restaurant has a very open feel and its a welcome to gilbert. I probably would pop in during the weekday instead of weekend and will update if it improves to 5 star. By the way big thanks to my girl Aly for paying for my lunch!
