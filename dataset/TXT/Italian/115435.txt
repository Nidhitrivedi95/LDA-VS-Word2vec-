Grr2wJ3nYD_7qUyespDglA I heard good things about this place from my co-workers and thought I would give a shot. I had the Veal Parmigiana Sandwich - it did not disappoint. It was huge sandwich - comparable to California's style. There's no way I could eat anything else with it. A good bang for the buck...

FYI - My friend had the Greek salad with chicken and loved it as well.

I'll definitely be going back....
