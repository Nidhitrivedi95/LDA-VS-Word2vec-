Y_SKyssv8ClQ_p25lCsbAQ Yummy. Loved it here. Just tried it tonight love the fact of byob and no fee. We had the fried calimari. It was very good. The wedding soup was also tastey. For dinner I had the gnocchi Tuscany. That sauce was so good I could have lick the plate. My partner had the chicken parm. Which the portions are huge. The chicken was excellent moist and a nice breading. The sauce was really good. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone.
