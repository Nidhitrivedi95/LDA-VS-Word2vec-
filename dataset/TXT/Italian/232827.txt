TLMysu1mWiLEslCBon5W1g I pass by this place every day and it was only a matter of time before I gave it a go.  Was really looking forward to it due to the tremendous support they get from yelp.

The beef carpaccio was delicious, except I couldn't really taste it as it was drowning in olive oil.  With a little less oil, and a bit more parm, this would've been fantastic.

The cured atlantic salmon tasted of lemon zest, horse radish but little else. Where'd the salmon flavour go?! The rosti was well made and I enjoyed eating that more than the salmon.

Mushroom risotto was in-fucking-credible! Delicious, buttery smoothness, enough melty-gooey cheese to make your soul melt upon ingestion.  Seriously, I sighed after each bite.

Cauliflower risotto was good as well, but completely overshadowed by its mushroom counterpart.  Lacked innovation or uniqueness to make it memorable.

The 2 pieces of roasted chicken I had were polar opposites. The white meat was incredibly dry, and bland tasting.  The dark meat was fatty, juicy and delicious.  The cripsy skin was great on both, but I really didn't enjoy eating the breast.  If you get the chicken, see if they'll give you 2 pieces of dark meat.. it's a world of difference.

The pan seared sea bass was very standard, tasteless and boring, it made me sadder with each chew until I was frowning.  

Service was great and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  Our waiter misheard our order and ended up bringing us the wrong risotto.  No prob, they let us eat that and promptly brought us out another one within minutes.

Prices are pretty reasonable too.  $180'sh for 2 with a bottle of wine.  Not too shabby.

I think I have to give it another try.  Was informed that they have weekend BBQ's in the back patio with a menu that sounds amazing.  For now, 3 stars is all I can give.
