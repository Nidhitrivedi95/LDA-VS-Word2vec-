xmARZ_MuSfrQCXP4e8RQjg Top notch pizza!! Need good pizza and beer, stop here. Stopped by on a recommendation of a friend, on national pizza day. Surprise got seated right away. Atmosphere is kinda barish but not overly. I like they have several craft local beers!! Had Italian bread as an appetizer came with an olive oil dip, very good. Went with a thin skinny, which is loaded with meat and strips server recommend extra crispy for doneness and he made the perfect call!. Will be a good go to for here on. You need this pizza in your life!!
