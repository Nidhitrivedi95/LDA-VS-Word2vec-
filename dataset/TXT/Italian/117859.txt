Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw Craving Italian so tried Casanova in the Venetian, based on Yelp reviews. Great bang for your buck, considering you are in Vegas. Space is cute and comfy, but not private, very like an Italian Trattoria - and the service was excellent. We each had a glass of Italian Chardonnay, the taste was fabulous. I was boring, a salad with chicken and hubby had the pasta Bolognese which was just excellent, pasta was perfect al dente and the sauce was so full of flavor. If you are looking for good solid Italian food, go here, or Trattoria Reggiano, which is nearby - a better value than Buddy V's and the food is just as good or better - and just skip the awful Canaletto.
