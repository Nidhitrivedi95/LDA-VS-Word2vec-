Ie00N1yErrmaOa44x5K8kA This is definitely the best pizza place I have tried in town.  I've eaten pizza at just about everywhere there is in Madison, and this place is the best.  I ordered their deep dish pizza with three toppings and I chose chicken, spinach, and feta.  The crust is completely out of this world. It has a buttery, flaky texture and a cheesy flavor as well. not sure how they make it, but by far the best crust I've had in a pizza. DELICIOUS.

12/18/15 *update* this place may have gone down hill a bit.  5 out of the last 6 times I've ordered, something had been made or done incorrectly and it takes a good 60 to 90+ minutes to arrive. Once a big fan of this place, finding myself ordering pizza elsewhere now
