KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg I love real Italian pizzerias after spending some time in small town pizzerias in Italy. For the most part this place takes the good of what I experienced as an authetic pizzeria - the simple decor, casual atmosphere, and good Italian pizza. They do fancy up the pizza a little more than your average pizzeria and it's more expensive but for the most part it's worth it. 

We had a great server, attentive and didn't push any drinks on us after we ordered water (although we did later get some wine).

Food was great, wine was good and served in simple stemless glasses (my favourite!). Good vegetarian entrees but not vegan friendly for the most part (unsurprising since it's a pizzeria but it's worth mentioning).  

I really enjoyed myself but I have to say, the set up of the seats really turned me off.  We had the option to be served at a bar sitting next to each other or at a long table with other groups on both sides. We chose the bar but it was quite uncomfortable after an hour on the stools but I made the sacrifice in order to be able to carry on a conversation. It's quite a loud place, by the way. 

Despite giving it four stars (which they deserve for the food and the service) I don't know if I'd go back again just for logistical reasons (the long wait and the poor way it's been set up for seating - I like to talk to my dining mates). 

Check it out but do take the above cautions into consideration.
