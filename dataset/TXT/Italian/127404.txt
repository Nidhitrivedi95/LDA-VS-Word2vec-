HUWLnKD5LSZY134amUO2Rg I love this place. I haven't tried the pizza but the food is excellent. I especially love their baked clams. The portions are big and I usually have to take some home. It's not a fancy place  it looks and smells like a New York pizzeria. As soon as I walk in the delicious aroma gets my juicces flowing. I wish I lived closer I would be there very often.
