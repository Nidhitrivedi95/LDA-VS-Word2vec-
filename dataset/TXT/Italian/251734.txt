VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w Our experience there was so good. We moved to the East valley and I have to say I miss this place the most, my husband probably would say haus murphys. This place is the hole in the wall jewel and you are pleasantly surprised as you walk in. It's nice staff, good decor, and great pizza should have everyone there. Only drawback of the place is the location and the Circle K next to Pizza A Metro has seen better days and better patrons.

We had pizza the first time and the wood fired pizza there is like no other. it's so good and yummy. We filled up on the complimentary bread, had a great fried calamari appetizer and the salad we shared was great. We ordered a pizza ( the regular) and we split it to have veggie with bolognese sauce and my husband got the meats with the bolognese sauce. My half of the pizza was great but the meats was fantastic! Our creme brulee was good and the desserts are well secondary to the great pizza so no problem. Truly a great chef works here and the owner sat and talked with us about the restaurant as we were finishing up our meal. Such a nice guy and great staff!

We had a football party the next time we ordered from there. We ordered the biggest pizza METRO SIZE and they didn't disappoint. It was huge!!! Our meats with bolognese sauce was a hit! I love bolognese and everyone told me what a great pizza it was. We had nothing left after the party and that is a good sign for their pizza.

Whenever we are on the west side or well the 17, we will have to draw straws on picking a place but I know this will be my pick! You can't go wrong with wood fired pizza and this place makes it even better!
