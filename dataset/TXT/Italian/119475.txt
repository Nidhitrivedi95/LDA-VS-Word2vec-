H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g We are experienced New Yorkers and had some wonderful meals in Vegas.  This ranks as one of the poorest for both food and ambience.  And, even though the signage clearly stated beer on draft, once we were seated we're told only the 12 dollar bottles were available.  The pizza was awful and extremely salty.  The pasta special portions were enough barely enough for an appetizer.  The bread was literally thrown onto the table.  The dessert was the waiter telling us he agreed with our commentary.  He was from New Jersey!
