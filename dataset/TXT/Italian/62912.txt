B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw Came here a couple of weeks ago for a work party and the food was excellent! They brought around platters of arancini, mushroom bruschetta, burrata cheese, and thin crust pizza. There were tons of leftovers so I was more than happy to take some home ;) Looking forward to returning at some point to enjoy a full meal.
