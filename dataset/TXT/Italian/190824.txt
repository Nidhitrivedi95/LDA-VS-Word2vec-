PbyUiq4uk7ycJz0QujOQNQ Well, we came back after two years.( See my review of 5/26/13 ) Don't really know why it took so long to return.
There were four of us. Very warm, and friendly greeting by two gentlemen when we entered.  Our server Martha, was pleasant, gracious, and attentive, always with a smile on her face. Very proactive in making sure that drinks were filled, and any other needs were taken care of.  Four different entrees were ordered. Top Sirloin Steak, Chicken Parmigiana, BBQ Chicken Breast, and Chicken Stir Fry. All arrived as ordered, including special requests for deletions. Food was excellent. As usual, you get a choice of soup, salad, or coleslaw, in addition to a potato and vegetable with each meal. Beverages are $1.00. Dessert ( ice cream or pudding ) is also included.They don't try to rip you off here. Reasonable prices are one thing, but when you combine that with exemplary service, excellent food, and very good portions...........what is there not to like?
