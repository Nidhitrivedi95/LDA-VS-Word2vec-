fckUjXz1GKpafT4x7-MVJA Another great experience at the Tempe Olive Garden. We've been eating there for years and their great service and food is the reason why! Last night we just did take out and I'm always impressed by how quickly our food is ready and the presentation when we pick it up Love the salad containers with sections for salad dressing and parm.
