1muT5zEqoC4qp9ms08qJtQ Came on a Tuesday at around 6pm and the wait was not as long as I expected, only about half an hour.  However, about 20 min later and the wait was over an hour.   Pizza was good (had the spicy pepperoni). I especially liked the crust because it was not dry or crunchy, it was soft and chewy.  Overall, I enjoyed it.
