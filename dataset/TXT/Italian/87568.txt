dWliPaP9k43hSKGSujNFXg Tried this place tonight based on reviews. I ordered eggplant parmigiana which was mostly seeds and cheese. It was a soggy mess. I asked for a sweet wine as that was what I was in the mood for and was told that I must be a newbie with a lack of pallet for wine. I'm in my 30s!!! It was very condescending. My husband ordered the veal parmigiana which was doughy and extremely soggy. When the waitresses asked if he liked it(after not eating very much) I replied with he likes it crispy. She very rudely snapped well you should have said that!! And walked away. They have us four of the tiniest pieces of stale bread. The only good thing we had was the water. The pasta was over cooked and mushy, I've had more authentic Italian food at the Olive Garden!!
