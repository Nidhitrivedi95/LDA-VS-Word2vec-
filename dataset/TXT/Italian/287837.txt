Zmp2_b2gpSloz4Dv2VsVNg Friday wine up 5-7 pm: $20 for all you can drink wine and all you can eat apps. The apps vary and are average but to try different wines or have as much of one as you want all for $20 is definitely worth it. There were 4 wines to choose from and there are no longer raffles as advertised but the atmospheres classy and fun plus the outdoor seating is nice. Arrive early enough to get a good seat and maximize your value. The service is attentive and friendly!
