me17NOULVwu40AdKGYHIaQ Awesome pizza; super close to real NY pizza! Tried the pizza here and was not disappointed.  From the moment we walked through the door we were pleased. The girl in the front was very friendly, the pizza came out delicious!  They have puzza specials on Monday and Tuesday.  I can't wait to go try their chicken francese since i haven't had it since leaving NY!
