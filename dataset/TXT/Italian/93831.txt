eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ Tried the downtown Summerlin location since we were there for a movie 

The design is really tasteful with a large bar and nice back room.  There is a great wine wall

Thankfully the food and menu are just as the original.  Excellent. 

Gives another choice of you are in the area rather then going to the original on lake mead
