4XDWHIN46wzg8MXpo8PvQA I've lived across the street for two years now and finally decided to give this place a try. The pizza was so thin that when I went for my first bite the whole untie pizza just fell apart. The crust is super thin and Can't hold anything. I don't like how they also charge you for toppings, you are already paying enough money for the pizza, it should come with a topping. The only good thing about then is that the wings are actually good, so if you go there just go for some wings. The pizza is not good.
