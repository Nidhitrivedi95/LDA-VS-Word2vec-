4qQVf2lt-47VcQ4v54PEXQ I want to start out by saying it was my first time coming here and definitely not my last. This place by far has the best pizza in AZ. 

I tried the Quattro Formaggio (4 cheese) pizza and the blend of taste along with the dough texture made this pizza lights out. I also ordered the basil and garlic pasta with linguini which was delicious. 

This place is a great family owned business where they treat everyone like family. This is a hidden gem and eventually it will become everyone's favorite.
