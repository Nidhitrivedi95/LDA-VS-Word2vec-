0qet57CmMA5qUm6gPFUTpg For food court pizza, this was pretty good. I loved that the pepperoni pizza came with fresh basil leaves: it was like a small taste of real Italian pizza! This pizza is greasy and far from high quality, but the flavors of the sauce and basil were prominent enough to bring the quality of the pizza up. 

What I didn't like is that the service and the process for serving the pizza was pretty slow and seemed rather inefficient. If you're nearby and in need for some pizza, this isn't a terrible choice.
