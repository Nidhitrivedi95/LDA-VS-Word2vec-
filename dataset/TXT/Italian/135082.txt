IT0IODInyhKbG4a_ka71MQ We were pleasantly surprised at the cheerful interior, and cleanliness.  Our first trip to Oregano was a fun one.  I ordered the Vino Bambino small salad and was only able to eat 1/2 of it - apparently servings are large throughout the menu.  Salad was good & crisp. 
Everything was great, including music - it could've been turned  down a little as the acoustics seemed to amplify noise.  Look forward to going again soon
