USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg We had a fantastic meal here tonight, our second visit over the past year. The food is fantastic; it is very high quality, freshly prepared with local ingredients and presented nicely; the menu is not particularly expansive, but combines some very traditional items with some new-American choices. Tonight we had the elk chops ($42) and grouper  + lobster ($42). The beignets are a fantastic dessert ($8). Service is well above average but a little short of excellent. Definitely one of the priciest places to eat in Charlotte, but a very nice treat to enjoy when the occasion demands. We'll definitely be back again.
