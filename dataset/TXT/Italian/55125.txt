aFBCmJUYrPeol_P75QX7Jw We were there on March 2011 (week night) and had a horriable experience.  We ordered Sea Bass, and it tasted off, advised the server.  Server bring the dish to the Chef and came back reporting Chef tasted the dish and there's nothing wrong with it.  We insisted we want to order something else.  The server offered bad service from this point on, ignoring us etc...That night wasn't even busy!!  At the end we go the bill, and they charge us Sea Bass that we didn't even eat, we asked to remove that from the bill and te server gave us a look and adjusted it....Worst customer expereience EVER!
