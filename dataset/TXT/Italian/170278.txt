MuRiVmsfF7FXiFBQ371z3A Great find. No reviews, so we took a chance on a patio in downtown Oakville. Though to find too many, but this on was right in a square, you could people watch and enjoy some solid Italian, we split a salad and each had a pasta. Menu was not huge, but the food was delicious!

Meatballs and Spaghetti satisfied my hunger, and I was hungry. The mushroom pasta with chicken added was also fantastic.

Nice atmosphere outside.
