Lzj-_QdzL2bLeHd_bC88Fg We booked through Yelp/Open Table, and had a pretty good meal, and left a nice tip, but then discovered that "our reservation had been canceled" according to Yelp/Table. A call to the restaurant did not help - while the maitre d'ess recalled our arrival ( and ticked us off on her iPad) when called by telephone, she had no idea how to correct the error. Emails to Yelp/Open Table came back unanswered. According to them "we get too much spam to respond", so 1/2 hour to 45 minutes was wasted trying to get this corrected.

My advice: avoid this place until they come into the 20th Century.  If you are starving and need a place to eat, call by dial telephone, or leave tablets of stone. Maybe THAT they can handle.
