c5x6HWB8MTZvlTgabihaSw The customer was absolutely terrible, the front of the house was poor and the server gave us truly bad customer service 1/10. Mary was our server. It was like pulling teeth to ask for chicken cutlets for our 3 yr old Son, and they charged us $7 for 3 of the tiniest chicken cutlets (it was really one cutlet split into smaller pieces) with no side for him. 

The beef carpaccio was awful. The beef was over cured, it was like eating salami, and they drenched the arugula with dressing. Worst carpaccio I have ever had.

Even The pesto for the bread was awful

The main entrees were ok, we had the eggplant rolled with ricotta and the parradella pasta with sausage. Not bad, but my entree was $21 and the quality of the food did not merit that.

Terrible dining experience, definitely will not go back
