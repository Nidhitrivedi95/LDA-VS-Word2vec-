SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ My bf and I were staying at Caesars and after a long drive from LA, we were practically starving. I wanted to try Spagos next door, however after looking at the menu posted in front, nothing caught our attention as sounding good. So we decided to try out Trevi.

I ordered the Lasagna which was pretty good, but not the best I've had. My bf got the chicken parmigiana and he thought it was pretty tasty. 

Loved my peach belinis. 

Overall, the service was good, the food came out quick, and the prices were cheaper than I expected.
