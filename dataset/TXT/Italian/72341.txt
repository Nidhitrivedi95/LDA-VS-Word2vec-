CElwRv4CtK56NljAuCwepw Nice place in the NW valley.  Has a mom and pop feel to it.

Food is better than the Garden of Olives or the Grilled Mac joint.

Staff is friendly and the food has been consistent.

One can order online and pick up later.

Price is just north of the actual value.  All in a great place for a local meal.
