DIdvV0HZUMZWiYg4OXyGJg Stopped in for the lunch buffet the other day on account of the reviews here and their convenient location. Their pizzas weren't bad, but it wasn't good either. First, there wasn't much of a selection. Pepperoni, cheese, and some sort of ham and bacon. Second, the pizzas weren't hot.. just luke warm sitting on the little buffet hutch without a heating lamp. Pasta was lackluster (a light angel hair with chicken+olive oil and a rigatoni/penne-type noodle in marinara)- sitting in a heating tray and noodles seem to have gotten soft over time. They had some hoagie sandwich item which I didn't try as it seemed mostly bread and a tomato brushetta item which was ok- but again, not hot. Salad lettuce was fresh, but julienned carrots were completely dried out. The dessert was a fried dough with some powdered sugar on it or powdered sugar and chocolate syrup... this was pleasant as it just came out. Perhaps ordering off the menu would be better, but I wasn't willing to spend more than $10 on lunch.
