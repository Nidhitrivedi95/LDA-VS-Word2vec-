Originally, I was told by their manager that all bone-in wings were gluten free because they had their own dedicated fryer.  Shortly after that, a delivery guy informed us my favorite wings, the spicey chili, were not gluten free.  The manager I spoke to about that informed me only certain sauces were gluten free, mild, medium and hot.  I ordered some pizza and wings this past weekend.  I was called & informed that none of their wings have ever been gluten free, that they have never had a dedicated fryer.

Shame on Spinato's for mis-informing me on several occasions and jeopardizing my health, and anyone else's with an allergy, in the process.  Some things I was told were completely false.  I immediately attempted to contact their corporate office about this & asked them to consider re-training for their staff and managers.  I have not received any response or apology from them.

I am removing them from my gluten free favorites list and will be giving it some serious thought as to whether or not I want to order from them in the future.
