a6SqJZTFMpSOR6Qb0STyFA My wife and I went there last Friday night.  We were seated quickly.  The pros: the food is delicious, save for the bread you are initially brought.  The bread is rather ordinary white French bread to be dipped in oil and vinegar.  The cons: The food is very, very slow in coming out and the restaurant was only half full.  Took over half an hour to receive our meals.  Being a cook myself, what I ordered should not have take that long.  The waitress we had was too busy talking to her cronies at the bar to give us much service.  I had to flag her down to get another been and some more vinegar and oil for our bread.  They do not offer any draft beers.  My wife's meal, one of the nightly specials, a seafood ravioli was rather sparse for the $21 price tag.
