WmmdJPA5mlmIJPIcw9Dxwg My date was really happy with the brunch with some added bacon. On my side I loved the pancakes so tasty with the strawberries the strawberry sirup on the side was delicious as well. Since I'm a dark chocolate addict the chocolate sauce could have been thicker and darker.
As we left I got a slice of cornbread and and a muffin for later.... I should have had bought some more.
