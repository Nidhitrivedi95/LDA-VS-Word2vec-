ZVtjS8Hvq2a6SxHxlehPGg I do not know who is cooking here, but what is coming out of that kitchen, is pure magic! I am a foodie. I've been everywhere and every place so I am not easy to impress but I got to admit... I am impressed. I cannot wait to come back, and if i talk too much it may be difficult to get a table next time. So I will just say, it was the most delicious food ever! The mushroom soup was.exquisite. The lemon butter caper grouper was out of this world, and I didnt order the cioppino but i have never seen something so amazing. Chuck full of seefood. My friend LOVED IT! I am really impressed. The service was great by the way. It felt like they were expecting me and i was a vip. Warmly greeted by the owner himself, and what it felt like the wholeteam of waiters, i could not complain.
