WPV0ucYjnb2HOrNxSopv6A We beat the lunch crowd and were seated inside. The fans froze us and we opted to move outside. Excellent decision, the patio was perfect before the hot hot heat (not the band) arrived . Our server was excellent and was extremely patient as we went back and forth over what pizzas we wanted to try. Not to mention he was on top of our drink refills every time.
 i glanced through some Yelp reviews before heading here and happened to remember someone saying the Garlic Knots were "TO DIE FOR". i don't know if i'd die for a garlic knot, however these garlic knots were delish. Meat lovers pizza was the specialty slice of the day and was pretty good. Spinach pizza was so-so, kind of plain (as i expected as the ingredients were spinach and cheese, but told the wife to try it since i was getting my own slices). We wouldn't get the spinach pizza 
It didn't wow me enough to add to the list of repeat restaurants, but not a bad place.
