With green, tomatoes, pine nuts and Gorgonzola cheese it was delicious!  We also ordered the chicken Parmesan which was a tad burnt on the edges but still very tasty. In addition we also ordered the very traditional spaghetti and meatballs which was perfect in every way. The noodles were cooked to perfection! We ended our meal with the tiramisu which was probably the least traditional interpretation of the dessert I've ever had, but it too, was wonderful! We will be back!
