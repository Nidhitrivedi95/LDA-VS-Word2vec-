fuBpjG-lsD94_BdpjHxbuQ Went here for dinner over the weekend. It got pretty busy after 8pm.  I thought the food was okay enough to return here to give it another shot and but I was not that impressed by the flavours of the two dishes we had. If I could give a half star I'd give it a 3.5.

I had the vegetarian pizza on white sauce. I liked the thin crust and the ingredients were really fresh, although a bit bland. I typically don't prefer salty food or anything but it was a bit too bland.  

The bolognese pasta was definitely just okay. I've had much better fresh pasta before.

This place is conveniently located for me so I think that I'd return given all the positive reviews and see if there are other dishes that would be yummy. The charcuterie board that another customer ordered looked awesome.
