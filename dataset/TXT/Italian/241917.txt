UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA Italian sandwich - tasted good, but wow - way over priced.  It was basically a hamburger bun with meat and cheese on it.  This joint is small, but charming.  The guy behind the counter needs a lesson (several?) in customer service.  There's "New York Style Schtick" and then there's just plain asshole.  This guy was asshole with a capital ASS.  He seemed to be very rude with the kitchen guy and gal.  When a customer walks into a place, they should feel like they are welcomed .... not like they rudely interrupted someone's personal time.  That's what I felt like after I left there - like somehow I burdened them by ordering their tiny sandwich.  Oh well.  These types of places are a dime a dozen.  Good luck, Rinaldi's.
