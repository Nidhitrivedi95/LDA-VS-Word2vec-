Ih0f0UyhFufm3C7kR72DSQ Food: I went here for the Ramen, I have not eaten off their regular menu yet. 
The ramen was a generous portion. My broth (beef) seemed like it was missing something flavor wise, and my dining partner who got the shoyu had broth which was incredibly salty,  although once you got used to the flavor it was good. Apart from the broth, the contents (noodles, pork belly, egg etc) were tasty.  On the whole the ramen is OK. I also got a cocktail which was again, really only ok, especially  for the price . it did not go down very smooth and for $12, well i guess i expect a little more.

Service: We sat at the bar and the bartender was incredibly friendly and attentive. Great service. 

Interior: I love the interior of this place, the architecture is incredible and the vault is a marvel to look at. HOWEVER I do not understand their decorating scheme. The lights are blown glass, abstract pieces of primary colors which are beautiful on their own, but do not fit the art deco feel of the interior. This place has so much potential and the funky light fixtures are throwing everything off. I hope they consider a re-design to truly maximize the beauty of the space they have.
