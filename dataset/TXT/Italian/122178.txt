hgQOESYp7CF4LnNI90XEiw We came here thrice during our two-night stay in Vegas. Was it really that good? I've had marvelous pizzas before! But something about the choose-it-yourself, 10-minutes away from wood-fired to golden delicious pizza cheesy heaven...

No is just not an option. So thankful there's a location in Westwood!

The ingredients here are vast, fresh, and eclectic. They have anything from your basic mozzarella, feta, olives, marinara, and mushrooms to pesto, basil, jalapeños, red chili peppers, and asparagus. 

They even have killer salads. Basic Caesar is just done right here--has the perfect amount of lightly tossed Romano Caesar dressing brushed with freshly grated Parmesan. 

And they have just-for-you portions. As a small, slender girl, I was able to polish off my own pizza A-ok, no problemo.
