BcLFIr4wtd3GQ3fnz15yDQ The food was delicious, but we had an extremely rude server who made off-putting comments about dietary restrictions that a member of our party had. I would certainly try the restaurant again, but if I were given the same server I would ask to be reseated. Enjoying a meal at this restaurant should not include being lectured by your server about your diet limitations. The experience left me feeling uncomfortable and annoyed; and ruined a dining experience which would have otherwise been lovely.
