KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ Birthday Vegas Trip: 4/3 - 4/9, 2013
Man, I really wanted to like this place.

Given the hype and exclusivity of the NY location, I thought it a real treat to get a table at the Rao's in Caesar's.  It was the last night of our trip and we wanted to really celebrate.  The menu called to me, and I was psyched.

We sat "outside" in the tables meant to mimic NYC; a nice enough spot, and even the noise from the casino wasn't too distracting.  We were welcomed with bread and olive oil, all very delicious, and we ordered a bottle of Montepulciano. I started with the Roasted Beet Salad which, truth be told, was one of the reasons I really wanted to come.  It was tasty, but was loaded with way too much arugula and not enough of everything else.  There's not much worse than an uneven salad.

I knew the salad would fill me, so for my entrée I ordered the Baked Clams.  Again, I so wanted them to be good and they just were not.  Way too much filling, which had little flavor.  My fiancé's Spaghetti Alla Bolognese was truly delicious, however.  The sauce was rich and had layers of meaty flavor.  We both enjoyed that!

Again, we skipped dessert because there wasn't much on the menu that was a 'must-order'.  The service was pleasantly acceptable, nothing of note, until it was time for the check.  Our server brought us the check and it was not ours, not realizing until she ran the credit card.  The charge stayed on our card for a few days, which was a definite inconvenience.

Unfortunately, (and it pains me to say this!) several times during the meal, I found myself wishing that we'd gone across the way to the Bacchanal Buffet.
