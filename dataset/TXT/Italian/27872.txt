4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ I've been waiting to check out this place for quite some time and was able to do so today. Was a little taken back how small the dining area was. Not that it was a bad thing, just wasn't expecting such a small space. Happen to go when they weren't so busy but not sure how they accommodate larger crowds during busier hours. Due to the space limitations, I imagine most people call in their orders and do take out. Anyhoo, I'm constantly searching around for the best Italian food and this place was not bad. Wouldn't say it would land the title as my "fav" however, I enjoyed my meal. We ordered the Chicken Parmigiana sub, Cheese Pizza, and half order of Chicken Alfredo pasta. Must say I have had better tasting alfredo sauce, however it was not bad. I really liked the sauce on the sub, had a sweetness to it that I enjoyed. And the cheese pizza was yummy too but they maybe used a little too much of the flour on the bottom of the pizza as it was everywhere. But that tiny little gripe didn't ruin the taste. So in all, not a bad little Italian spot. I'll be back to try out some other dishes from here!
