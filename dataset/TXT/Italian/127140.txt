hUHIahAcew5i39D_6ZqEmQ Solid Italian, light year's better than Franco's which formerly held it's location for years.  I don't know that it's worth the price, and it's a tad overrated, but it's generally pretty good food, they don't do many things spectacularly, but they do most well, which is more than enough sometimes.
