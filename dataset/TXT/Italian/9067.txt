We were seated right in front of these walls and people would constantly pass by to take pictures and bring it back to their table. Ruined the mood of our table with constant flashes going off

Being 6 we tried most of the popular things on the menu. Personally I had:

HorseTartare- which was simply amazing. Had the slightest over taste touch of Dijon. 

Liverpool Steak- the med-rare cook was done perfectly for a 14oz steak the spinach side was perfect

Pecan maple syrup tartlet- was average 

The biggest issue of the night was we revived one total bill. We then asked to have the bills split we were told "it's joe beefs policy to provide one bill" we then spent 15mins splitting up our 550$ bill to make sure we included taxes and tip. The waitress was perfect up until this point. You could see she was not happy with this policy and kind of took it out on us.
