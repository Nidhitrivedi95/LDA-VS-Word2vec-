bo4loBeLwkQqZ7HGrgxXRQ I was in Little Italy this cold, February morning for an appointment and decided to grab some lunch with a couple friends afterwards. I'd heard mention of this restaurant before and noting its proximity, decided this would be a great opportunity to check it out.

The first thing I will note is that we accidentally showed up at the restaurant 20 minutes before they opened (noon), but our server (Natasha) was kind enough to let us in early. She seated us and brought us water and menus promptly. This was much appreciated considering it was a bitter -25C outside today!

The restaurant itself is cozy and quaint, with exposed brick walls and red-and-white checkered tablecloths. It is simple, but very welcoming. To my knowledge, the restaurant also has a patio area out front during the warmer months. While we perused our menus, Natasha brought us a basket of crisp, warm bread and a olive oil & balsamic mixture for dipping. Throughout the entire meal, she was very attentive to us (although we were the only table in the restaurant) and made us feel well taken care of and comfortable.

My friends ordered the gnocchi venezia and pizza mediterraneo. I myself, being a fungi fanatic, had to try the agnolotti al funghi. I was not disappointed. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the agnolotti pockets were filled with amazing umami flavor from the wild mushrooms. I was in heaven! The sauce itself was very creamy and delicious. I tend to prefer red sauces to white, but this Alfredo is so, so flavorful with bits of sweet/peppery basil scattered throughout it to keep things interesting. I am usually pretty good with cleaning my plate when I eat, but my friend commented that she half expected me to pick up my plate and start licking it. If that is any indication of how good my dish was, I don't know what could be!

I will definitely be going back in the future to consider bumping this 4-star to a 5.
