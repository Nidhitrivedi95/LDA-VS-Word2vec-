I enjoyed an excellent dish of veal, and the rest of the party had a variety of pasta dishes. Everything went down well, and the large portion sizes meant we were able to take a lot of food home with us to enjoy later.

Despite not being able to finish the meal, one member of the family insisted on ordering some cannoli, and so I was able to enjoy this treat for the first time in my life as well. It was perfect- the right balance of crispy and creamy. Service was fine, but was perhaps the least strong part of this experience.

Thank you Stella Mia- I will be back.
