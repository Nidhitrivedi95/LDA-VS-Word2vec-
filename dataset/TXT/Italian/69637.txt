bXbCGFk3ZjLcTdQQB-xPyQ I went to eat at Luciano's on Wednesday with my girlfriend and it was the best experience I have had in a while. The waitstaff was on point, great recommendation of wines from Cruz the bar tender. Genesis brought bread and water to our table was very friendly and polite each time she approached us. Really enjoyed that sundried tomato sauce. My girlfriend and I had the rigatoni salcicchia and the sea bass, which were magnificent and I look forward to going back.
