j7yI3qYRsbGBUv9rShLCaQ The food here is amazing, I've tried the margherita pizza, the penne alla vodka, and the tortellini alla panna. I've also tried the hazelnut and the strawberry gelato which are delicious. All three mains were absolutely amazing. Although the service seems to always be slow. I've been here a few times now and the lacking service seems to be consistent. The food comes out fairly quickly and is good quality but everything else requires a lot of patience, even when it's a less busy day. I'm always waiting for my order to be taken for a while, and refills take quite a long time as well. Empty/finished plates have sat at my table for 20 minutes sometimes before someone finally comes and takes them away. Luckily, the food here is so good it makes me want to keep coming back, but it's still unacceptable to be waiting so long for so many basic elements of going to a restaurant. Prices are pretty fair here as well, most pastas and pizzas are around $15 and the portion sizes are great.
