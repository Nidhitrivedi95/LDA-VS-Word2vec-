d5n5CsoJNu-tKEbfI6U3tA Had crappy service today . Waited 10 minutes for someone to show up to take order , wait by show up I mean I had to flag someone down to come to the table which I wasn't pleased with , then they take forever to bring our drinks , then when we finally receive our food no silverware to eat with and once again had to flag someone down to receive anything. Not too pleased with service . You would think it would be better since they aren't very busy ?
