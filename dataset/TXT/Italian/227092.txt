SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Very, very solid choice for a meal/cocktails/snacks. My husband and I had just arrived in town and found ourselves at Caesars Palace /Casino. We were starving but everything inside the casino was very high end. We ventured inside the Forum Shops area and stumbled upon this restaurant . The menu looked good and prices were moderate so we decided to give them a try.

We were very happy with our meal. First of all, do yourself a favor and make sure you're seated on the patio (still indoors but you get the same feel) which overlooks the Fountain of the Gods and also makes for wonderful people watching!   The menu is rather large and lengthy with many Italian favorites. As always, we were famished and wanted to order everything. Thankfully, our server warned us that portions were large and suggested against ordering an appetizer since so I was ordering a frozen Bellini, a salad and each of us was ordering a full sized entree. 

So glad we listened to her because out came a basket of the most delicious bread and olive oil. Mmmmm don't skip that!  The Caesar salad was good but way too much dressing was tossed with. I will skip it or share. I ordered the Gnocchi Modenese. While it was rich and delicious- after a few bites, I understood why our server warned us of portions. The gnocchi pieces were like butter (well ricotta and potato) and my stomach let me know so couldn't handle any more bites as it was closed for business lol! My husband had the Ravioli Alla Vodka- cheese filled ravioli with vodka tomato cream sauce. Again- delicious but way too filling. We honestly should've ordered 1 salad and an entree to share but hindsight is 20/20! Lol 

Anyways- location is perfect, service was great, food was delicious and a wonderful value for the money . I would suggest ordering too little rather than too much. You can always add on!
