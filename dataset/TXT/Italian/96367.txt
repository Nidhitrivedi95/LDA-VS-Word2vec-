eRjcli4nDHRwhByViUz9Ow We are here from San Diego staying with our in-laws and decided to order delivery -- we are big fans of Rosatis and used to frequent this location when we lived here. The prices may be on the higher side but the food was so worth it - delicious just how we used to remember it (we kept it simple with a thin crust pepperoni). Delivery was pretty quick (my in laws live close by) and the delivery guy was super friendly -- think his name was Kyle? The girl who answered the phone (Zuly) was really sweet even though we were "those people" that ordered close to closing time. It makes me sad to see this place gets such bad reviews -- it's been a good place for a long time and its one of the few things we miss from Vegas now that we live in SD!
