8noITN_wTSpXU2tc9oNwTg Celebrated our daughter's birthday and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Service was a little slow, but they were very attentive. I had the salad, soup and bread. The dipping sauce for the bread was delicious but a little salty. Portions were decent. The staff brought a piece of chocolate cake and two pieces of cheesecake to celebrate the birthday. A little pricey, but a great dining experience.
