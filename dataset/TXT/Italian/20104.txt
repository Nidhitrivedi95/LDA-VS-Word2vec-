3-6biVwm7VwPZ-k67jml-Q The best Italian food I've ever had in Arizona, and by no small margin. If you want the real thing, come here. Yes, you order at a counter in a place that looks like a deli. Yes, you have to go back up to the register to pay. No, it's not cheap. It just doesn't matter. Eating here is the closest thing I've found to eating in Italy in the US (and yes, I've eaten in Italy). You will not get Americanized food here. This means pasta that's actually al dente, and not swimming in sauce. Portions are not chain-restaurant gigantic. On most days I've been there, at least one table will be full of people speaking Italian. It's almost like you stepped inside a teleporter and came out at a small, local restaurant in northern Italy. 

Some people who have posted reviews of Andreoli below wouldn't know real Italian food if it hit them in the head. I'm personally happy if they go elsewhere, and I think the people who run Andreoli prefer it that way too.

In addition to the food, the deli is also first rate. They have guanciale and lardo, two things I've never seen anywhere else in Arizona. The bread is so good it will make you cry (which I do when they refuse to sell me some to take home. They won't let it go if  they are running low). The house made sausage is so good, I won't buy it anywhere else now.
