Kz4WS00PcqOJgxfZawk4dQ Nice ambiance,  the constant loop of Frank Sinatra is a bit irritating after awhile though. Ordered the linguini mussels,  chicken ravioli,  kids penne pasta with meatball and the parpadelle. Everything tasted excellent but don't expect to pay less then $20 per person, not much on the below $15 except the appetizers. The take out menu has more options then the eat in menu which was disappointing
