rUy2MtHyFv8pI7FOW1DE8w The food was good. The pasta is made fresh. The ambiance wasn't very cozy. Even though you are packed together and the tables are small, it really didn't match the menu which is Primarily Italian. Our server was busy when we first got there so we waited patiently. However, as the dinner went on and it was only us and 2 other tables, she didn't clean off the table once, refill our drinks, got an order wrong (it drives me nuts when servers don't write orders down on paper). Again the food was delicious but everything else didn't fit.
