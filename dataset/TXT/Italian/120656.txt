H6Gb3P21h4e_stdjFQO9oQ Kind of surprised at the low reviews, then again, I've only gotten delivery from this Rocky's location. Deliver in general has been decent. There was one occasion where it was a good hour+ waiting time before our pizza arrived, however, it was also a Packer game on during the time we ordered. A medium pizza has 12 slices. The slices are cut into squares and are pretty large. 2 slices should feel you up. A good 2-4 people should have able to get full from this size pizza but I guess it depends on how hungry you are. Personally, I like their pizza. To this day, I swear by Costco having the best pizza so I cannot say it's the best but it's better than other pizza chains.
