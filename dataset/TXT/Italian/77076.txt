This place has about 7 teenagers shoved in a very small space behind the counter making our order fresh, which fresh is awesome! The problem is that I have to repeat my order about 4 times to 4 different workers to make my pizza or salad. The most frustrating part is having to repeat my order, usually twice, to the cashier, who almost always is flustered and is confused as to which items are in our order. I always make sure to order drinks, but half the time the drinks get left off and I have to order them on a separate tab. Not a big deal, but annoying. This place is also above average noisy, which I think is why the cashier is so flustered and may not be able to hear customers. Great food but terrible execution.
