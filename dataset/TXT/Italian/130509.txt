Iam7tYWhssw_rscSBkeRIQ Fioris pizza is a staple to the South Hills. The sauce is mild and would appeal to most people. It is soo greasy though, like more greasy than any other pizza I've ever eaten and more greasy than I knew was even possible. Even after dozens of paper towels, I can still blot up more. 

The employees are friendly and service is always good. We like supporting a small, locally owned business. 

Parking is always high in demand so be prepared to walk.
