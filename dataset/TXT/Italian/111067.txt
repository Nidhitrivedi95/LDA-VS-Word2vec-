g-nzfTvso3-4c4gkhkmGbQ After 10 years, I decided to return to Frankie to see how they are doing now.

Keeping in contrast that this is a buffet, a lower standard is used. But seriously, chicken was dried, so dried there are no juicy flowing out. We even saw the rotisserie and though it should be good. But no, its dry. The ribs look great but once you put a fork to it..... What, the fork doesn't penetrate the meat.......

The mussel is not fresh, since seafood freshness is key to safe food, I will not be reviewing it since I don't want to risk my life writing this review.

There are some safe heaven to this catastrophic lunch, stick to the pasta, they are not great but better that the other stuff we tried. Parmasan chicken is good, with cheese. The meatball is pretty ok too.

Given the fact that I want to enjoy a lunch, not survive a lunch, I give it a thumbs down. 

Sorry Frankie, your tomato has gone bad.
