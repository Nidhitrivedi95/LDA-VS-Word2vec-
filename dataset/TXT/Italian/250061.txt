vlJsF5tTfplbo1D5kbUPmQ I am a Postino's fan and have always wondered about that Italian place next door.  So when a Groupon came up for Aiello's I jumped on it.  We went on a Saturday night thinking the ambience was not going to be what we enjoy but we were wrong.  It has an open floorplan with many windows. The bar and dining room are not separated which is a plus because we usually like sitting in the bar anyways.  We sat right in the middle of the restaurant facing the bar which had a huge wreath full of lights on the rock wall behind the bar.  It's not Christmas time or anything but the wreath was great.  The restaurant is pretty romantic. The outdoor patio needs some work. Italian food is my favorite and their Italian food is delicious!  So all in all I would definitely go there again.
