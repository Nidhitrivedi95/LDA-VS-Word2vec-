RWegZl_vMYIkLCHoTIjDqg We tried this restaurant on a Saturday night and we were seated right away.  The menu is pretty traditional and the dessert menu is uninspired.  The by-the-glass wine list was short, but reasonably priced-- although it looks like there is wine galore for the more adventurous..  The crusty, white bread came out with a hot center and cold end piece.  Our waitress was okay, but not polished or genuinely friendly.  What makes this restaurant worth mentioning was one of the specials-- grouper with potatoes and a veggie medley.   The meal arrived with a thick slice of fresh, grilled pineapple and delicious sauce.  There was a generous portion fo  grouper that was perfectly cooked.  It almost tasted like lobster.  While some chefs drown the meal in sauce, the sauce was served in a small, side container perfect for dipping the fish, lightly-crispy potato slices, and broccoli.  The broccoli was a little overcooked, but at least the vegetables were all fresh-- green beans, red peppers, and more.  My husband's chicken marsala was served in a deep bowl which kept the food hot throughout the meal.  While my entree got an A, the chicken marsala was a B- at best.  My coffee arrived lukewarm, but the waitress agreed to warm it up in the microwave for me.  When it returned, the saucer was gone.  We settled on the chocolate chip cookies for dessert.  Good, but not home-baked amazing as we'd hoped.  My advice is to give it a try if you're willing to take a chance of the special of the day.
