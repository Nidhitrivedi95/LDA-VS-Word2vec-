q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ I went here for my birthday celebration. I had heard about it and thought it sounded good. When I arrived I was surprised that it was in a strip mall. The concept is very cute. The interior is ok but small. When we sat at our booth I thought it would be nice but that's when things fell apart. My daughter ordered a steak. $23.95! It was over cooked and breaded to much. She sent it back and told them about it. They still had the nerve to charge her $20.00 for a tiny salad and a little pasta. The rest of our party ordered their food and said it was just ok but the prices are way to high. The piano player was way in a corner and he kept singing to the wall instead of the crowd. There were two birthdays at our table and not one did one thing. The waitress was polite but not friendly. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. If you don't live in Summerlin it's a ways out from the Strip.
