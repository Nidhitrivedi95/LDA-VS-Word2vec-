What? A Real Italian Cafe in America? No way?
Yes! It Is Right Here.
Very Authentic.
Just Like Italy.

This is Like A Mirage.
Real Expresso here with 
Stong Coffee Flavors.
They have the huge very expensive 
Expresso Machines from Italy here,
This is the 
Only way to experience real expresso,
You have to have a Giant 
$10,000 Car sized machine like they do here.

Starbucks & 99% of other places in 
America do not have these machines.

Highest ever Reccomendation.
Best Expresso/Cappucino/Gelato in Vegas 

Maybe West Of Missisippi
Easy Five Stars
