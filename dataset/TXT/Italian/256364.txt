w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q Palm is located inside Caesars Palace Forum Shops. Reservation was at 7pm and was seated promptly. I odered the wedge salad w/blue chees to start which was just average and ordered the bone in filet but came back to tell me they were out of it so went with a 12 oz filet. medium rare. The filet was cooked perfectly and the flavor was great. The service was not very good by our sever though as she seemed bothered when we asked for stuff that she forgot to bring. i wont be back because of the service
