bSMxmpp8X2bDbEq_qqupsA It was a cool night, after dealing with what I can only dead urge as the definition of people that don't deserve welfare (essentially 85% of Lorain county) I thought my only haven would be my church equivalent, a pizza shop. I was "greeted" with a nod from a blank stare, cold eyed girl. The kind of girl that thinks she's a 10 but honestly is only 7 because she uses one third of all of her make up every morning. "What can I get you?..." I try to be chirpy, hoping that this blonde silhouette of a human being had a any sort of empathy or ability to emulate positive emotion. Alas I was mistaken and was given a sullen response to my simple white pizza with yellow peppers. I may as well have been in Azkaband as the other employees sucked the energy from my corpse like a de mentor. I was told to come back in 15 minutes so naturally and in order to preserved punctuality, I set a timer. I returned in 16 minutes hoping the extra minute would give them time to find personality, I was mistaken again. I was handed my pizza swiftly, as if I was about to get a fatal drug. The pizza felt lukewarm at best,just like the girls personality on the happiest day of her life. If you're looking to feel like you're part of the Anime club at high school while trying to talk to a cheerleader, this could be a fun experience.
