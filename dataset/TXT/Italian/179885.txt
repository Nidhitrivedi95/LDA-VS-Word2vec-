nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A We went here for brunch last week. Cost was about $50/pp with bottomless cocktails (included Bellinis, mimosas, Bloody Mary bar, and a few other choices I can't remember). I thought there could've been more food choices in the buffet. They had a crepe station but only offered two fillings, they had a decent mix of sweet and savory dishes to choose from though. We went up three times to refill our plates, and I enjoyed everything I ate. We loved the Bloody Mary bar! Such a cool addition! They also had live music which added a nice touch. I would recommend to anyone who loves a good brunch.
