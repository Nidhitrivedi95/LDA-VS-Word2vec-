JsUprRhyzQyukZmAhcOg0A My husband and I go here often, for Happy Hour and Dinner.  Yesterday we had a wonderful server, Summer, who fixed something that I was not going to complain about but she noticed and took it upon herself.  Very astute!!  And very sweet.  Always enjoy ourselves there but she made it even better.  Thank you Summer.
