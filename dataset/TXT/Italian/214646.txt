rIWS5y7-hZYcFoCac4AXdg Whenever we go out for a meal, we always pick Frankie and Benny's!
The restaurant has such a lovely atmosphere. It's a 1950s American/Italian New York style diner. They have the old authentic music playing and booths with red plastic seats, just like you'd imagine the real thing would've been like.
The food is always gorgeous, filling and hot. I always end up asking for a box to take some home in as I can never get through a whole dinner there, the meals are so big! 
My only complaint is that twice we have been waiting to be served and have seen people come in after us but be served before us. You can also wait quite a while for your meal but as I love the surroundings, it doesn't matter too much. 
I also asked for a balloon to give to my son when we got home, and they were happy to oblige.
I highly recommend this restaurant.
