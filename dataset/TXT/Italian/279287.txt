yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Gordy is still alive...barely!  He's a funny old guy and barely plays anymore but it was still a treat to see him. My husband and I both got the lasagna. It was delicious and huge (you can easily split one) It's average Italian food so don't expect super fancy food, but we enjoyed it. The free wine was actually not that bad. We took half of each lasagna to go and gave to the homeless guy outside. Holy cow, was he happy. Made me want to go buy more food to give to him.
