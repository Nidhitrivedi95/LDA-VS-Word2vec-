sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg Bullshit place. A nightmare. Horrible food, horrible service. Never come here if you want to have an OK time. My friends and I went to get a drink at the bar while we waited for a table. Bar service was horrible, waited forever to be served. Once we finally told our table was ready, we were told they were just cleaning it off, waited another 29 minutes and then asked again and were told we were waiting because people has their elbows on the table... OK. I got Bruchetta which should be called tomatoes on toast. I walked down the stairs to have a smoke and came back up the stairs, which I guess is not allowed, although I had a seat at a table and had been there for a while to be met by a bouncer and the horrible hostess who yelled at me and told me to leave. She was so rude, threatened to call the police on me. I did nothing illegal and was not rude, initially. I can't believe this happened!
