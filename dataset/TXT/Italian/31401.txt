5p5YW_5bMOSuLIQjkJPO3w I feel bad writing this honest review but I had reasonable expectations and they were far from being met.  I had never been to Naples15 and I had a Groupon for $40 and was eager to try.

The Pros: the staff was knowledgeable and friendly.  The bread was unique and exquisite.  The gratis caprese salad was delicious.

The Cons: when I asked about the special, which sounded wonderful, I was told it was $29 but $39 if I were using a Groupon.  What's the point of offering a Groupon then?  Made no sense.  The house wine was not very good but would have been acceptable had it not been for the price.  Pricey for a house wine at $41/bottle.  The prices on the menu were what I would consider extreme for this level of restaurant.  This is not a LeToile. There were entrees in the $15-20 but many were in the $29-39.  I would still be willing to pay these prices but the decor and ambiance were mid-level at best and our entrees...the seafood tasted old and overall it didn't meet expectations for the price.  

The pizza on the menu looked good and we were told by the wait staff that it is excellent.  If you're going, I'd stick with that suggestion.
