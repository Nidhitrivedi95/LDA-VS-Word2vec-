qkDlRkNfrXE_4t2vMrTo0A I've lived absurdly close to this place for awhile now. I finally tried it and everything was passable. Good, solid Italian food. No gnocchi, which was kind of a downer, but no complaints or rave reviews here. They have really reasonably-priced fixed-price lunch/dinner options, too. And the wait staff were good. 

The view of Monona on their terrace thing is really spectacular. If you can get a seat there (or in the indoor sunroom with all the windows), you're in for a long stare at a really nice view. 

Nothing about this place stands out as suuuuuper spectacular, but it's good, tasty, well-priced Italian food. Apparently they have good happy hour deals but I wouldn't know.
