nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A This was the answer to a several month long search for a simple but ass kicking great tasting Italian meal. It was a busy Tuesday night, so we took a bar seat and enjoyed the great bartending by Mike. We asked him about a wine, he said it was good. When he brought the bottle it was a screw top... I was a bit concerned with the screw top. We had the wine with dinner and enjoyed a great meal. We met some nice peeps next to us and had some great conversation and a most enjoyable evening. Thank you Mike and Buddy V"s for a most enjoyable time and meal. We'll be back. Highly recommend for great tasting authentic style Italian food, with a classy twist.
