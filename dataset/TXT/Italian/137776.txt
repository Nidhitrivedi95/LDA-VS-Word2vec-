j6bsyQv1QLT1evlCq9_1IA Food was just awesome. Sauce was great, breadsticks great, baked ziti, spinach ravioli,  just delicious. If you want good tasting food, go here. I am no Italian food expert, but eat a lot of it and this place has good food PERIOD...The owner Michael is also a very nice person...and service was great. Do not live here but will return when back in this area. Different people have different taste in food, this is just my honest opinion.. .
