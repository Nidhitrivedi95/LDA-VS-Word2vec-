The group of us  shared a caprese salad which was fresh and flavorful.  I had the cavateli and garlic lovers sauce (chicken, plenty of minced garlic, broccoli and sun dried tomato). It was cooked perfectly and very tasty. There was enough pasta to share but we all ordered what we wanted and now we are taking the yummy leftovers home for lunch ( or breakfast?) tomorrow.
