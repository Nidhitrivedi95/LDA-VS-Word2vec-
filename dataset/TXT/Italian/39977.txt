7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ This was my second visit to Carnevino. My first, right after they opened, was my best dinner experience in 2008. I have to say that this last trip left a little to be desired. Some of the dishes, especially the pasta were amazing. The orchiette pasta with sausage and broccoli rabe and the black ink pasta with crab meat and jalapeño were fantastic. The prosciutto wrapped cheese puffs, which melted in your mouth the last time I visited were served luke warm and was very disappointing. The steak of course was very flavorful ~ and one serving for two was more than enough for four of us to share. 

The biggest disappointment and the reason why they are only getting three start for this trip was the service. It took us about 1/2 an hour to get a bottle of wine... and the service for the remainder of the meal was mediocre.

I would try Carnevino again, but I would try it for lunch, sit at the bar, and only order cocktails and pasta....
