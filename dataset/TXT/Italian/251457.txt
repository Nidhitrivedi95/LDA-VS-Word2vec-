VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w We were referred to Pizza A Metro by the hertz rental car girl at the airport. She said that if we didn't mind eating in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood, we would love this place. She was right. If it had turned out to be my last meal, it would have been worth it. 
Caesar salad and margherita pizza were amazing. Service and presentation of the meal was A++.  There are only 6 tables in the joint so I don't know how easy it would be to get in at the lunch hour. If you do get in, you will want to stay and savor every aspect of the dining experience.
