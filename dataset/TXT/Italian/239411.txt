U7fZfH9C4hj5BFRYaPOo2w Went here for lunch with my husband and two friends today.  The restaurant is beautiful and the setting of the resort is spectacular.  The food and wine list were very good, but our server was not impressive.  He was slow to take our order and not all that helpful.  The entree portions were large, but the desserts were tiny, but good!

Overall, a very nice place though!
