G099MT9cwtwgdsR71JLp6w I really wanted to give Osteria Papavero a 5 start review... after reading other reviews, and hearing from my roommates how much they adored this place I really had such high hopes. But... not all hope is lost for me for Papavero.

Love how quaint, and cozy it is here. We came at a later time for dinner and got seated right away. Checked out the drink list, and I ended up ordering the Azzuri Dacquiri. Loved it, I would compare it to a margarita but more sour/bitter. After we got our drinks, we waited for quite sometime for our waitress to come back. She read the specials off to us, and then took our order. She quick grabbed our menus and then didn't see her at all till our food came out. I ended up getting the  Crespelle agli Spinaci which was absolutely fantastic. 

The cons I have with Osteria Papavero was that our waiter was just super inattentive, and when she was talking to us it was very robotic like, and never once smiled the whole time we were there. And lastly... for the amount of money I'm spending at Osteria I would hope I would have a great experience. And sadly it just didn't do it for me. 

Maybe that I just came on a wrong night, but I wouldn't mind trying them out again, and hope for a better experience.
