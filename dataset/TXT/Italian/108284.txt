FZpyIiCAsr7Twkw4tQeqPA I've only been to Olive Garden a handful of times,  and it's been all positive experiences! We were greeted and seated quickly and politely. The restaurant wasn't too busy, which is exactly what we were hoping for.

I come for the wedding soup and salmon. As I sat there drowning my soup in pepper, the boyfriend looks at me like I'm nuts.
Jennie, however, does not judge me! She's a most phenomenal server, by the way. You should ask for her!
