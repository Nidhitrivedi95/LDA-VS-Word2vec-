DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q Wow, what a pleasant surprise!  Airport food at its finest.  When at the PHX airport, skip the typical fast food options--this place is a must!  With an emphasis on high-quality, fresh, and interesting, this little hotspot in Terminal D has a global undercurrent.  The food is amazing -- burgers, sandwiches,  salads, pizza, gelato, desserts, and beer/wine.  Funky, euro music, ample seating, and quick service.
