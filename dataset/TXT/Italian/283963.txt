z4KriCQPuPJnFr0NGgApbw We continue to return whether it be for happy hour drinks or celebratory dinners; it is a staple for us, living in Green Tree. I constantly find myself craving their lobster ravioli, which is cooked to perfection and just the right amount of cream to the sauce. I have yet to experience a bad meal, poor service or unprofessional bar tending. Every meal, server and bartender has exceeded any expectation and I will continue to recommend this place. Enjoy a bottle of wine and olive plate with a friend or take your pick of a homemade tasting pasta and sauce - you will not be disappointed! Don't enjoy it? Don't return, more room and time for the rest of us!
