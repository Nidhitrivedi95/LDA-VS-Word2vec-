q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ The only reason this place get 3stars from me is because of the environment. From entering to exiting the music and atmosphere is amazing. As far as the food I was not expressed at all order the bruschetta and it was so small the amount of bread to tomatoes was horrible. A small little saucer my 1 year old would not be satisfied. 
We ordered pastas my husbands sauce was decent but pasta and shrimp were both way under cooked. 
My pasta was meant to have an Alfredo sauce and it was just oil. I ordered a side of Alfredo and it was so watery I didn't eat it. 
2bartender behind the bar and very slow service. 
Although the girl with the red shirt was helpful when u could get her attention as she was busy and taking care of everyone while the other girl was doing nothing. 
I was very disappoint I have heard so many good things about this place. Will not be coming back.
