Uda-CqNfow8Gh4rgtdhJZg I get takeout from Tomatoes II all the time.   The crust is on the softer side and is quite yummy.  I usually get medium size pizza to avoid a case of the droopies (is that a word - spell check say "no").   I just don't like droopy pizza.

My go-to favorites are the meat and taco.   The meat pizza is as you would expect, a carnivore's dream.  The taco pizza is topped with taco meat, cheddar cheese, followed by crushed tortilla chips, fresh  lettuce, and tomato.   The chips provide a texture change which I really like.

Small Pizza base price is under $10 so you can get a really good pizza at a great price.  Delivery is fast if you are in the area.
