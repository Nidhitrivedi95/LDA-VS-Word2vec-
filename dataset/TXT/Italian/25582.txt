4jg8f82iP4lpjqZcf662HA The customer service here sucks. The place is nicely decorated and has a great location. The open fire oven lends a really authentic air but the server was really rude. We had an entertainment.com coupon and as soon as she saw it she told us that unless we had our card with us, we couldn't use it. No other place has required the card as well. She wasn't even apologetic or at all graceful about it, just straight up rude. Why even list your restaurant if you make it so hard to use? We didn't even bother staying after that so I can't comment on the food.
