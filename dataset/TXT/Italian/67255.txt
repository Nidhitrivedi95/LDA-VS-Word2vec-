bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg I've owned significant pizzerias in SF Bay Area and have dined here at least 5-6 times in the last few years. I say this because I know the restaurant business and the hardship a low review takes on the ownership, so I rarely write negative reviews. But - wow.., my meal last night was bad. Let's start with the pizza... All I can say, is stay away from the Roman pizza. It is "thin", kind of, but very very chewy. Not exactly an attribute you would praise or wish for with your pizza. On top of that the chefs heaped a mountain of cheese... it was terrible. The pizza look closer to something coming out of Chuck E. Cheese, then an upscale eatery. The chefs quite literally don't know what they're doing when it comes to pizza. I discovered one of their main problems when leaving. They keep their ovens floor temperatures at 150 to 200°. What that means is it's not hot enough to cook pizzas properly. It's too cold. The dough has to sit in the ovens a long time, hence drying it out. A legitimate pizza oven floor has to be between 400-800 degrees, depending upon the style. We kept our at 650 for Roman and Neapolitan styles. Secondly, in pizza, less is more. My advise is to get skilled guys in the kitchen who know Pizza and dedicate one of their ovens to doing it right. Everything else was meah. Last time for me.
