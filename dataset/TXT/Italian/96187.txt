eQo4kIwIWJbAnfXYl3k5BA Let me just start by saying... If you go to a restaurant that is known for its pizza, then order a salad, then it is YOU that deserves the low star rating. 

Best pizza in town that I know of. Best cheesesteaks in town hands down. Best garlic knots for sure. I've never had a Chicken Portofino anywhere else, but I can't imagine it would be better. 

Summary: phenomenal
