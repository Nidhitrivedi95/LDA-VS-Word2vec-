B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw Came by for dinner and was expected to wait for a table. To our surprise, we were seated immediately. 

They have a special, an oz of house red or white for a dollar - yes, that was why I was wobbly when I left. I got a little wine-happy. 

We ordered:

arancini 9.99 - wild mushroom risotto, fontina cheese, tomato sauce - perfectly seasoned and fried with oozing centres

Mafalde ai Funghi 17.50 - portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, truffle cream sauce - although the price may seem a little steep for a meatless pasta dish, it was so amazingly good and oh so worth the price. it is definitely a must try here!

Diavola 17.50 - spicy sun dried tomato pesto, smoked provolone, calabrese salami, roasted peppers - this pizza was very good. it was spicy but not overwhelming, it wasn't dry and it was so filling.

I love this place and would definitely come back for their other items and to check out their rooftop patio!
