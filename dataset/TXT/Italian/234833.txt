tUjyGFSN8wQqLgKp5Q0CUA Our group of six had an outstanding meal at Trentina. We splurged and opted for the 12-course tasting menu with beverage pairing. The food was absolutely delicious and I really appreciated that the final course allowed each of us to revisit our favorite dish. 

Each dish was executed perfectly and plated with great creativity and care - think burning embers atop your pasta or a beef fat candle that melts into a heavenly dip for bread. There was a lot of artistry at work in that kitchen!! While portions on the tasting menu were understandably small, I left feeling just sated enough. I couldn't recommend the tasting menu more if you're willing to pay a premium - it was great fun.

That said, I would not recommend the beverage pairing. The pours were terribly stingy and our glasses were often empty... and really, the pairings didn't add much to the experience. At this price point, that's not really acceptable. Also - while I appreciate service, the staff-to-customer ratio here is borderline excessive. At times it can feel a bit hovery - which was awkward in such a small dining room.

Portions are small and it's all a bit overly fussy, but in the end it was truly a delicious and unique dining experience.
