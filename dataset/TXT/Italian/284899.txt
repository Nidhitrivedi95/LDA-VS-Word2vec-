zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g We love this spot and they always not only say their dog friendly but we LOVE dogs visits!! Since it was such a glorious day we decided to take up their suggestion and happy hour with our dogs! After arriving to a closed patio we were quickly told patio is closed with zero accommodation... They could have easily unlocked without doing ANYTHING else! Why would you promote something you don't accommodate? For two service industry people we find it bad business!
