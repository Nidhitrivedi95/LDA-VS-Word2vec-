7ZBh-3wWVQ5zkd6KZytW0g I hosted my sister's baby shower at Cibo on Yorkville today. They were nothing short of outstanding! We had 50 guests, and throughout the event they (discreetly) attended to our every need, and ensured that the guests were comfortable and well fed. The food was fantastic (pizzas, polenta fries, lamb parpadelle, gnocchi, and shrimp fettuccine) and plentiful. They were also great in allowing us to spice up the venue with some decor (although the venue is just stunning), and even did blue cocktails for the guests when they arrived. The staff were friendly, and did not get impatient, or annoyed at all...even when we lingered a bit longer than we should have. I was nervous about this event - but Cibo ensured that it was stellar ! A big warm thank-you to CIBO!
