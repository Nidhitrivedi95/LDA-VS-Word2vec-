qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA I don't write a lot of reviews so for me to write a review means it was a great experience. I'm not a wine drinker, but I really enjoyed Postino in Tempe. The atmosphere of the restaurant is incredible. The staff was very attentive and the food was great. The service was fast and I can't emphasize enough how friendly the staff was. The prices were fair, especially the five dollar mini pitcher of beer. I will definitely come back.
