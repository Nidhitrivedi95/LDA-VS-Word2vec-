bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg Another great neighborhood restaurant in Las Vegas. I've only been twice for lunch but the food was outstanding. My personal favorite is the "Pulpo" Octopus salad but we had a really great pizza as well.

Service is excellent, and the owner is almost always there (and it shows in the quality of food and service)
