SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ I went with a group of friends to Trevi for a going away party. It was fun to sit and people watch in the outer dining area. The food was absolutely amazing (Ravioli Alla Vodka), the drinks were well made (The Trevi Bellini), and our server Jenner was so attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Overall an outstanding dining experience!
