RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ Food was great but the service was a bit slow. We went to dinner with a total of 6 people. One guest got his food 5 minutes before the last person received their entree. I also feel as though they should have explained that the entrees did not automatically come with pasta. 
All in all it was good, but could use some tweaking.
