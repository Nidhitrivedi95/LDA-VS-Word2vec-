JTBxVGHe_fPZkfBN_EkA1Q We decided on Italian cuisine this evening, but we also wanted to pay tribute to our local mom and pop eateries in the Downtown Henderson, Water Street district so Emery's it was.

Upon being seated we asked our not so fluent in English server for a wine list...No wine list along with no explanation until we inquired with another service professional walking by our table.  It was explained to us that since the wine list was outdated, they did not have a wine menu at all. Seems simple to just update something and have it printed but I suppose what is simple for some may not be simple for others?

We requested a bottle of house Cabernet but instead received two glasses to start instead.  The bottled of wine arrived shortly, unlike our food.

In good company and enjoying a bottle of "house" Cabernet, we were more than halfway through before we noticed everyone else being served before us.  Pasta, steaks, chicken, it didn't matter the entree ordered or the time in which people were sat AFTER us; our meals were never served.

54 minutes and one bottle of wine later we decided it was time to hit the road and find a dining establishment that would actually serve our meals.  We let our server know we were interested in paying our wine tab but not interested in our meals still currently on order. The waiter quickly went to the kitchen to relay the message to the cook (who turned out to be the Owner).  We were shortly approached in a confrontational manor by the proud owner of Emery's asking why we were leaving and not planning on waiting longer for our food. As I felt the tensions rising, I waived for my guest to head to the car, I stayed behind to defuse the situation..

Wow, the owner of a restaurant causing conflict with it's patron?! Interesting.. this situation merely reiterates my previous statements of service gone bad in this city.
