G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Oh man, I was pumped to get to Giada's. 
Let's begin by saying its Vegas and prices on the strip are high. If you choose to eat at the restaurants here, you're paying a premium. We know that and are completely ok with it. Giada's was no exception. 
The restaurant is lovely but we missed out on any type of view as our table was tucked into a corner. We started in the bar with a cocktail that was well made. Once to our table, we were greeted by our server who was very pleasant. The bread was good...I found the focaccia to be nice and spongy but just ok. The different spreads were a nice touch.  After choosing a nice glass of red, we started with caponata and burrata. I am a burrata freak but remarkably, this was again, just ok. Not as creamy as I would have liked. The caponata was good. I did enjoy the taste but this is an example of being disappointed in the price ratio. 
We went with pasta because, really, life is all about pasta. Lemon shrimp and pork ragu. The portions were plenty and our server was kind enough to bring plates so we could share both dishes. We felt that the pork was the favorite. More flavor and well balanced. The shrimp in the spaghetti were huge and succulent but the sauce was not what I was hoping for. I imagined a bright, lemony sauce that was light and fresh. This seemed a bit muddled or heavy. It didn't sing and for the price tag, it should have been a soprano! 
I enjoy cooking and make some great food so when I'm paying for it, I suppose I expect to taste something I can't do in my own kitchen. 
I will say, our moment there was very relaxed and comfortable. We were not rushed, the pacing was perfect and they allowed us to linger over our wine. This is very important to me in a dining experience. Unfortunately, I probably won't return in the future. However, I remain a huge fan of Giada and all she does.
