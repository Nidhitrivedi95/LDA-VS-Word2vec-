9x1bWbbSgFCMLJlJR8mezQ "La gond", as my friends and I affectionately call this spot, is in market square, but is a total dive.  I've been going here for almost 8 years and it's the perfect place to eat my feelings and makes a any bad day better.  

I've only gotten their Sicilian because it's so good I haven't had a reason to try their thin crust.  The Sicilian has a crispy bottom/crush and a gooey/thick inside covered with the perfect amount of cheese and your selected toppings.  The mushrooms here are good, not canned.  This is by no means gourmet pizza, but it is beautiful low key goodness! 

They also make a solid chef salad that is big enough to split.  The ranch is not amazing, but it goes well with the pizza for whatever reason.
