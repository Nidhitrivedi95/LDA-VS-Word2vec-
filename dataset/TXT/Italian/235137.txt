TVKenh65WwJX3zEr36zKCA Food was okay, nothing to write home about, esp if you live in Louisiana.  But biggest disappointment is the lame service.  Too slow, food was cool, and they are terribly understaffed.  We even went on a weeknight, and rather early at 6ish.  
Servers (2) were also expected to act as hostess as well as serve all drinks + food.  Too bad for them, as this affects their bottom line when management understaffs....
