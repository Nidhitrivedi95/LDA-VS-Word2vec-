ILA41PhErg4bl1royzDX4g I visited this restaurant many times when it was Stone and Vine and the food and service was outstanding. I just visited this establishment under its new name and while the menu is essentially the same, the service and quality  of the food is poor. The pizza was cold and dry. It tasted like a thawed out stale frozen pizza. The harvest salad presentation was not the same and the taste was average. The place was slow which would suggest better service, however that was not true. How sad that a place which was fantastic in the past has transformed itself into a below average restaurant. Too many others in the valley which are so much better.....
