w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q This was our first meal on this trip to Vegas.  I had never been to Palm, but my husband has been a regular.  He told me all about the shoestring onion rings...tried them...yummm.  He had the Panko encrusted Ahi Tuna.  It was very good.  I had the lobster roll.  It was rich and creamy lobster salad on a kaiser roll...very good.  They must be known for their lobster, because there were several people eating that.  Our entrees were about $20 each.  

They have a good wine list.  We had a bottle of Hartford Ct Chardonnay for $97.  Rodney Strong Chardonnay was $14 for a small pour, $20 for a large pour.  

We also had an amazing server (David W).  He was very personable and fun.  We took a few more breaks at the bar in between shopping, and I have to say the bartenders and servers were all very attentive and great at what they do.  Nice atmosphere - we sat on the "patio" which is outside of the restaurant, but inside The Forum, so opportunity for people watching.  The bar area was fun with the caricatures all over the wall, and there are TVs if you're a sports fan.
