pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I finally got the courage to brave the epic wait for a Bianco pizza...twice.  Is all of the hype true?

Bottom line: Amazing pizza, but not worth the four-hour wait (both times I waited close to four hours).  I got in line at 4:30, waited almost 45 minutes to put my name on the infamous list, and then another 3.5 hours or so to get seated.  I was starving and tipsy by the time dinner was served, so a cardboard box would have tasted good by then.

The "Wiseguy" pizza is fantastic, and so is the pizza topped with onions and pistachios.  I've never had anything else like it.   

If you are still motivated to try Pizzeria Bianco after reading this review, follow this advice -- 

Show up at around 5:15 to put your name in, and then leave for the next few hours.  See a movie nearby, or just go home and relax.  Make sure you call every hour or so to check in... sometimes the wait is shorter than they initially say, although it wasn't both times I was there.
