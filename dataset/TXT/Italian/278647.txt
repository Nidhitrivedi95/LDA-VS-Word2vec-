YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg Beautiful setting, nice views, but what I especially appreciate is the care given to the wonderful plant-based menu. As a vegan, I am always looking for great food that meets my requirements for health. We had a great meal here.

My hubby had meatloaf, and I had spinach ravioli. At one point, the manager, Mark Lopez, stopped by to talk to us about our choices. We ended up talking for a long time about how the restaurant began their plant-based menu. It was quite a transition for a traditional restaurant. However, Mark is a committed guy. He really wants to affect the health of the people that come to this restaurant, but the first goal is to make sure it is delicious. He is succeeding. We will definitely recommend them, and definitely be back.

I believe as we get ever more health conscious, the trend towards healthy, plant-based menus is is only going to increase. Other restaurants need to get a clue.
