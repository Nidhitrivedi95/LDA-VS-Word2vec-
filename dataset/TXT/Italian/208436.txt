qpBfYbkPmXIFWVQ7pLkQ_w Really dissapointed in the quality of food at Olive Garden. It has been a while since we have come here. I used to love their salad and breadsticks, which did t seem as good as it used to be. They discontinued my husbands mussels and put a less desirable shrimp scampi on the menu. The ONLY reason I gave our visit 2 stars was because of our waitress who was really great. I am dissapointed in you Olive Garden.
