7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Went with a co-worker during a conference cause this was "the best steakhouse in Vegas" and of course, he was wrong. Steak was very good, but not the best and so were the pasta sides. Atmosphere was pretty boring as well, and then the prices don't reflect the quality of the food or the atmosphere, but the service was excellent though. Much better steak at Jean-Georges, STK or Del Frisco's.
