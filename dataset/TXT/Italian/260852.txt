wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g We had originally wanted to go to Bouchon but since it was a two hour wait we walked around the Venetian and found Canaletto.  Having walked by here numerous times and having never been here I was happy to give this place a chance since it meant I have a new place to yelp about.

To start off with the waiter was rather weird.  He was snobbish, walked around like he had something better to do, and acted like our questions were a waste of his time.  Well anyway that's how the gf and I felt but since we didn't want any extra surprises in our food we just let it go.  

The table ordered a variety of pastas and gf and I ordered squid ink risotto, bruschetta, and calamari to share.  The latter was original, nothing bad and nothing great.  The bruschetta was pretty good but it isn't hard to make decent bruschetta.  The squid ink risotto was decent.  I found the seafood in the dish to be so so, it wasn't piping hot or anything but overall the dish was decent.

Now back to the waiter.  Somehow after I ordered the dish and started eating it, he started being nice to me and asking me how I like it, if I've had it, and even coming over and asking me and me only if we needed anything else.  To sum it up, I felt that he out of nowhere started respecting me or that I suddenly joined some kind of Italian dining cult because of my knowledge and liking of squid ink risotto.  (Just an fyi if he's reading, he has no idea how extensive my palate is, don't even try challenging me).  

Anyway Canaletto is in the area of St. Mark's Square.  With Otto and Postrio next door, there is patio seating where you can enjoy the faux blue sky of the Venetian roof and also enjoy the entertainment the hotel provides.  I'd probably not come back because there are just too many places to eat in Las Vegas.
