fUhgw2iXXS3TETqU4eZU6Q Was there in the past and it was good, then I had 2 bad experiences in a row...one witha carry out pizza, one with the buffet and an indifferent waitress. 
Today, I am happy to say that the help was nice and the food good. Pizza and a little salad bar for the lunc buffet. Tasty Chicago pizza, and when we requested that they make more cheese pizza, as my daughter is vegetarian, they did so...without a complaint.  Thanks Aurelio's for redeeming yourself.
