hHgSUnDB9yIrxUEMSmsdoQ YUM! This is actually my second time eating here, must have forgotten to review the first time. Shame! 

My first encounter was with online ordered takeout. I placed my order around 11am and selected 11:45 for pick up. I arrived at 11:40am and thought I may have to wait but my order was ready. The gal who received my online order said she made my food right when she got the ticket???? ugh. So my food sat there for a while. It was a salad and thankfully it was still okay when I brought it back to my office. 

I dined in for my second experience and it was much better. I heard from coworkers that this place gets a wicked line around 12pm so I told my friends we should meet at 11:45am and it's a good thing we did. The awkward line area was consistently full from 12-1pm. 

Ordering the food was a bit overwhelming. They shouted out many questions!!! Thankfully they did so with a smile on their faces. They also must have sensed the sheer panic on my face and guided me along.  I got the BLT Tasca sans the B. It was delicious!!!! The bundle comes with a side and a drink; the street corn and hibiscus lemonade were a great pairing for this delicious sammy. 

Very good, will go back.... but not too often, there are a few less expensive/similar quality places in the area.
