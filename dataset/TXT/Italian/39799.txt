7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Unquestionably one of the great restaurants in Las Vegas. Up there with db Brasserie, Sage, and a handful of others. No other LV steakhouse has as much character as this one. Plus the wine list is awesome. And don't forget to try the octopus! Be prepared to spend a small fortune.
