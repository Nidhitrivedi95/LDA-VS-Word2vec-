SEH79jbg5Q8cCozCnhqMHA I am not sure what the hype is.  I went here based on its recommendation in the who's who of restaurants publicized in the So Scottsdale magazine.  It was mediocre, and the ambiance reminded me of eating at Disneyland, you knew it was make believe but you wanted to believe.  I wanted to believe this was going to be a great meal, but instead it was lack luster.
