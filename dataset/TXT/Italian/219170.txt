s7XVRYnDgohSDlwtta5euQ Came here with my best friend before we went to a movie and received wonderful service from Michele! He offered us cappuccino to start and we ordered a margherita pizza. Super delicious! The real deal. He is from Naples and the pizza was definitely a reflection of that. Definitely would recommend!
