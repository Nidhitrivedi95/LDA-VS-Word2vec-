pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA This place was fan-flippin-tabulous. I can't believe we haven't been here before...maybe it was the big Roman dude out front. 

It was the usual Saturday night debate on where to go. Chow for the salad? Too far. Dick's? Too much greasy cheese. Then I remembered hearing great things about Centurion (mainly about their pizzas). Of course, we had decided to have pizza the night before and weren't in the mood for more pizza. Oops. Oh well, let's give them a shot. 

The wine list was nicely thought out, it's so refreshing to have someone choosing wines that they have a passion for. It definitely shows and we got a great wine from Alsace. I'll definitely hunt down more for the house.

We got the seasonal salad with cous cous, salami, spinach, tomato and lemony dressing. This salad was absolutely perfect for summer... and beyond. Seriously... it gives Cowboy Chow's salad a run for its money. 

Next we got the mushroom risotto and the gnocchi with shitake dijon cream sauce. The gnocchi was seriously good...lick your plate good. 

I am so glad I remembered to mention them! We had leftovers and I can guarantee someone at our house just might lose a finger. Just saying.
