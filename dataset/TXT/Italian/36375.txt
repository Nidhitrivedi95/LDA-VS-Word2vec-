6rl2DTYflL0t1_oL4KudYw Live in vegas and love the streets of New York on Durango. Came to Arizona for a football game and my buddy told me they ave one close by so I was happy. Walked in and greeted and sat by our waitress RJ. She was awesome. She was fun and full of smiles. She said she's a cardinals fan we are not so she gave us a hard time for being 49ers fans but still wished us a good time at the game later that weekend. Her personality defiantly makes the place what it is. Food was great just like the one back home. Next time we come to town for a game we will make sure to stop by and say hello and have a few beers and a bite to eat !
