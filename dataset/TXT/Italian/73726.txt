coEKYaAOOOOjuDCqEe-3DA I heard that this new restaurant opened up recently and wanted to check it out.   I'm not usually dining or hanging out in the Westgate area of Glendale, but I had tickets for the U2 concert.  So I got to kill two birds at the same time.

I was hoping to eat here and was told by the hostess that there were no tables open before the concert.  I guess that's understandable since everyone and there brother was going to the concert.  Every restaurant was busy at Wesgate, but I managed to get a sandwich at another place and was back at Bice Bistro after my meal.  

What drew me hear was the vibe inside the restaurant.  Wasn't ghetto or full of beer drinking fools.  It felt somewhat upscale, but with a Scottsdale sort of flair.  I ordered a glass of wine and sat at the nicely done wrap around bar.  

Next time I come back I'll have to try the food to see if it lives up to my expectations I have set for the place.
