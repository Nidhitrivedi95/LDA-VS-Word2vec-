VoXUt6TIJWyIf_lihbN5xQ This is the best Italian restaurant in Scottsdale. By far. Food was great. A lot of food to choose from. Price matched value. The Bruschetta was awesome.  The mussels were really fresh. Holy cow were the garlic knots awesome. The meatballs were fantastic. Cleat you can see I didn't even have to order an entree. But that just means we have to go back for more. 
If I had to pick a negative - the lighting was a bit dark. But no reason to take a star away for that.
