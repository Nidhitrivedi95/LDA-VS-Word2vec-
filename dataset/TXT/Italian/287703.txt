ZMIcuo-aQja0ITk4-TU8Jg We just tried this place for the first time tonight. I called in an order for pick up and got the large pizza and breadsticks special. The special was a great deal. It was ready when they said it would be, staff was courteous, and they even gave my daughter a frisbee. The pizza and breadsticks tasted great. So, overall a great experience and we will definitely be back!
