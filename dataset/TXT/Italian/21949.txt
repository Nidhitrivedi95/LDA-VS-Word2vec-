3cbsPfoUUrysf-M8FI_0IA e2 has a great menu that is always changing with a focus on seasonal and local. The four times I've been I've always had great service with no attitude from anyone.

I love the food, everything's been delicious and I try to vary what I eat each time--pretty easy considering their ever changing menu. I especially love their desserts, which are handled with a kind of care I could only expect from the Enrico family.

I'll definitely continue to come back to e2, something about just makes me happy.

I wrote a longer review of e2, with plenty of delicious photos on my web site. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/09/culinary-merits-bryant-street/
