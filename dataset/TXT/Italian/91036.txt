EDa7_YfEB2HDOyxDMbipQA I expected to be really impressed from reading the reviews.  However, I didn't find anything outstanding or special about the place.  It was pricey for a pizza joint.  A large salad was $7.  The tables were dirty.  Which I found sort of odd considering they cleared off the plates, but they didn't wipe down the tables.  I ended up getting napkins and doing it myself.

I'll go back and give it another try.
