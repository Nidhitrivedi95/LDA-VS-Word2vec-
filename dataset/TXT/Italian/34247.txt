6bVEM9jD-mpU4WNXcJ9tHA Me and hubby (poster below) tried out this place this evening. They're a bit hard to 
spot unless you are looking for it. They're in the shopping center right behind the Jack in the Box (all the way at the end).  We got the Philly Steaks with fries and some side orders to get a feel for the place. The side orders were tasty. The philly steaks could use a little bit more seasoning, I personally like some Tony's (creole seasoning) sprinkled in. Otherwise they were great. Good bread - a little crispy with good chew to it and holds in all juicy from the steak. The thin slices of meat were great. They use provolone cheese (if you get it with cheese) and melt it in. The steak fries were pretty good and a very large portion for an extra $1.25.

They have a large menu and you can call ahead, walk in or even delivery. It has a small dinning area if you wish to eat there. It looked clean and you can see into the kitchen. They're new to the neighborhood and I was scared to give them a try, but glad we did.
