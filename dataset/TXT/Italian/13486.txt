We usually drive up to our fav Streets of New York but thought we would give Barros a try since we live down here in Laveen.  First impression, nice interior, lots of tvs although I feel bad for anyone that hasnt been here before and doesnt know to order before you sit.  
Secondly, why is there a tip line on the credit card slip?  How do I know what to tip before I receive any service.  But it makes some sense because you dont actually receive service, you get a number so you mostly feel pressured to leave something.  Not sure where it goes since again, no one actually serves you.  The young girl that brought us our pizza seemed like she had more important things to do.  I think we got a "here ya go" as she slid it onto our table. 
Prior to that though, the side salad we ordered had wilted lettuce in it.  Garden salad that had lettuce, tomatoes and croutons...wheres the rest of the garden?? 
Pizza was really good though.  But I doubt we will be going again. Back to Streets for us.
