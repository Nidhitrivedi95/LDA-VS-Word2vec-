TEvCRTMnOYwQ9Up9lWXxfA If you are going to charge $15.99 for Chicken Parmesan in Tallmadge it better be out of this world good, this was not.  I think they may have priced the menu right out of the market for the Tallmadge area.  It also helps if you train/require your staff to taste and know the menu.  Good luck, with that food you're going to need it.
