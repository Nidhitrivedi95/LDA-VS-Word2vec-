Yo8ODT7aFMM2xKUd1yaBVw Haha read the first review and literally laughed out loud (llol'ed?), that guy obviously had a bone to pick. This place is STELLAR! Phenomenal service with exceptional food! We had the sea bass which was literally cooked to utter perfection and OMG the gnocchi was OUT OF THIS WORLD... just soft enough not too much flour not too little, and cooked perfectly aldente! The service was just ridiculously awesome, they held the chair for my wife, placed the napkin in our laps, constantly thanked us.... it was an evening to remember and we will be back again and again!
