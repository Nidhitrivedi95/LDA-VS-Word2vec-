V-_Kh0RtKcKdQ0ON4eVQ-Q Just ate here and really missed this place. I've eaten at other Bucas around the country and was needing my Italian fix!

We started with the mozzarella sticks / triangles. They were hand made and probably the best fried mozzarella I've ever eaten. However, it's $13.99 for 8 of them. That's double the price of most mozzarella appetizers and we could have eaten 2-3 orders of these. But it was delicious.

So we ordered another appetizer - the mini meatballs. I was under the impression that they were stuffed with cheese but they weren't. They were pretty decent but we thought they tasted a little odd. We weren't crazy about them.  The portion was small and again, this tiny appetizer was also $13.99, which I find expensive for an appetizer.

The house bread with oil and Parmesan was good and we ate a lot of bread. The servers were friendly but were never in a hurry. It wasn't busy at all but we had to wait 15 minutes to get our check once we were done eating. Most of the meal operated at that pace, which I find frustrating. I mean, if my drink is empty, please fill it up now, rather than 15 minutes later!

Ok, so onto the main entree: we ordered chicken parmigiana. We ate the smaller order which had 3 big pieces of chicken and was about $20. It was good, although my wife and I weren't crazy about it because it had little onions all over as well as little tomato chunks all over (as opposed to a nice tomato-like sauce that other places typically serve).  All in all, food was pretty good, arguably much more authentic than other Italian places, and it was a good experience. I think this place can be amazing if you find the dishes you really prefer to eat. 

One other thing: I wanted the usual salad that I had ordered in the past from Bucas and was told by the server that they didn't carry it, although "all the other Bucas carry it." I found that to be a little odd. 

Anyway, we will return but I'd like to see some improvements.
