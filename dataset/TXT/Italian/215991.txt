RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ I'd first off like to say that my experience at this beautiful restaurant was amazing. Amazing waiter and amazing service. The food was great I had the chicken Fulton, which tasted good until arriving home. Soon to realize I had gotten food poisoning, from this amazingly rated restaurant. I'm so disappointed, it's unreal. I expected a lot more than to consume contaminated food. I will not be returning due to the nature of my horrific ending to this food.
