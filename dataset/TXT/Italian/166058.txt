mbPaXByWZBZUGqvh8ewmTA Food was just ok. Not much flavor. Requested salt and grated Parmesan and they never showed up. Service was below ok. We were seated outside after it rained. The furniture was covered in bird poo and everything was wet. We had to rearrange chairs and request napkins multiple times. The young girl brought out a wet towel to wipe off the wet table and wet chairs. Probably not headed back anytime soon.
