54rjpC8YuM3QN_QbFGmLAg I was in Gastonia an meet a friend for dinner here. This pizza place does not disappoint. This is a hole in the wall which is always the best finds :) they have calzones, salads but I came for pizza. They have a 12 inch or 16 we ordered the 16 an it was more than enough for 2 ppl.  We did half pepperoni an half ham/pineapple. The crust is very good light an airy. We also ordered the cheesy bread oh this is not that nasty little Caesars cheese bread. It was the same crust with fresh mozzarella cheese n sauce to dip mmmmm
