5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA Cioppino is fantastic! Every time I come here I am not disappointed! Staff is always on point and I love the view! I've also ordered the potato wrapped salmon and I usually never finish a plate because I can't finish it all but there was literally nothing left when I ordered this because I couldn't stop eating it. Bravo! Bravo!
