CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA Enjoy Venezias very much! Maybe too much After a few visits I realized that their pizza either was very greasy to begin with, or something changed with the recipe?? Not sure. Nonetheless, I like their pizza a lot, especially the by the slice deal. Maybe now it's not that greasy, but haven't been since it was way too greasy after three consecutive visits. Wings are delicious!! GET THEIR WINGS!
