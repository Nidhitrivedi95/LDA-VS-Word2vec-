7CPGGNwHibzQtnERq7u2Hw I've always been a fan of Buca. I've been to this location before and loved it the last time. However, I've never been there for lunch before. They tell you that they downsize the entrees for the lunch specials. That's a lie. They still bring you a full-sized dish. If you've ever been to Buca, you know that a full-sized dish is perfect for two people.

I had soup, salad, and a side of spicy sausage in a marinara sauce. Super delicious and very filling. If i wasn't trying to be good, I would've tore up some rigatoni or baked lasagna. I went with a party of 8 and it was terribly tempting. Everything smelled delicious and I heard nothing but good things about the taste. 

I was surprised by the prices as well. I would recommend splitting a "Buca small" entree with someone. Cheaper, and you'll still have enough to chow. Perfect for a lunch out with your co-workers. The only downfall was the timing. An hour long lunch turned into a 1.5 hour long lunch. The size of the group was a factor, I believe. If I go back for a lunch, it will be for a lunch on the weekend sometime.
