VoXUt6TIJWyIf_lihbN5xQ Great service and amazing food. They have this brilliant bruschetta menu where u can pick 4 and it is only $13. Amazing options. Their salads are to die for. I had the pear salad and arugula, with this outstanding vinegarette. So good!! For my entree I had this amazing turkey and Brie panini with apples. Best thing I have eaten in a long time. 

Make sure to check this place out when you are I Scottsdale. Definently a must. 

And I just heard that the owners are opening a steak house. Will have to try it out when I am in Scottsdale again
