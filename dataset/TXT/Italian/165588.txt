m6rffQy85HUq82DjLq-YJg Came during lunch time and had a great experience. $7.99 for the lunch special was a great deal for what we got. Got the Italian Stack sandwich and the Chicken Pesto and both were delicious. We also got the garlic fries and they were soooooo good!!!! Will definitely come back and try their pasta dishes. Love supporting local small business and this one is a gem!
