GMriYorKj1v-dhhJ1om-Sg Went with a large group after our boys played a baseball game. Called day before and ordered pizzas for all the boys. The boys Pizza came out quickly and perfectly - this is what the 1 star is for. The adults in the party (which they also knew we were coming in advance) waited 2 HOURS for our food to arrive. The waitress claimed to have forgotten to put in our order??!! Really?! She had one job. As the food was starting to coming out for some of our party it was incorrect and we were still waiting. We ended up cancelling our order after waiting over 2h with nothing. Complete disappointment. Maybe the pizza was good - we will never know. The service was so bad we never got to eat any of it.
