tLnIHvvhtDPmCLoUrDaMaQ Mama Lena's is not large, it is not fancy and definitely not modern... But, that is what makes this place charming...it has a lovely Italian atmosphere. I like that they care more about their food than table cloths.

We have been several times. There is rarely a wait, but the restaurant is always hopping, with most tables filled and servers hurring about.

I always order from the daily specials, and have not been disappointed thus far. We have also had their lasagna and it is excellent.

Wine is reasonably priced. The bread is fresh...so fresh. I have been there twice when they are making it in their huge industrial sized mixer. It is crunchy and soft inside and perfectly accompanies their dishes.
