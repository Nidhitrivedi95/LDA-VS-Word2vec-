ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw Ordered a thin crust pizza tonight since I've heard a lot of good things about Oregano's and they're close to my office. The people I dealt with were friendly and the time I was given to pick up my pizza was accurate, I didn't have to wait at all. The pizza itself was pretty good. Nothing overwhelming but I will order from there again. Next time I'll try the pan since thin crust pizzas can be underwhelming in general.
