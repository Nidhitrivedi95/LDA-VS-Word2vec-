xmARZ_MuSfrQCXP4e8RQjg This location is the reason we stopped dining at Nello's.  I have lived in the Valley for 23 years and been patronizing them until about 6 years ago. The last time we ate here, we decided the food had just gone down hill. It wasn't the waitstaff or anything else, the food was just mediocre at best.
A couple of months ago we stopped in at the Scottsdale & Shea location; the food was fantastic. We were not sure if it was a fluke, so we visited the same location again. Same great food.   
Unfortunately, we stopped in at the Alma School location today because it is closer to our home, the food was horrible. I couldn't even finish my sandwich, the meat tasted like it had been sitting in the back, drying out for hours. The food is definitely not the same at this location. I wasn't sure why the food would vary so much, until I overheard the waitress tell another table that each location has different owners.  I'm not sure if that is true, but I definitely won't be going back to this location!
