Tp07u-0AOFRfQhtNpAXaQA I love the food here. It is delicious and really hits the spot when your craving some good pizza. I had never Sat down to eat. Always take out. But I decided to bring my daughter in and sit down and have dinner with her (she is 6)  As always the food was great. Our waitress fabien was fantastic! So accommodating! She was happy and so helpful. I will be back to dine in again with service like that. Well done!
