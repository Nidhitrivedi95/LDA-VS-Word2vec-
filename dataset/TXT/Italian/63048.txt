B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw On the top of my faaaaavourite restaurants in Toronto.  I am absolutely biased by the fact that this is on the delectable Portland Street.  (On a side note, if I can get a place to live on this street then it will keep me in TO longer!!). 

Entering Gusto is like embracing a cocktail of your Dad's shed, Aunty & Uncle's vineyard, a menu that is your Grandma's goodness-meets-your-holistic-dietician's orders.  Oh...did I mention the cute as sin bar tender that comes in the shade of ash?   This spectacle alone will have you begging to wait for your DTE waitress.

I love that they treat everyone with a personal touch.  

Gusto makes me want to quit my corporate job and simply be in the space!

They're great with big groups and small. Brunch, lunch, dinner, supper...   Dine before hopping across the street to Spirithouse. 

A Hammer review.
