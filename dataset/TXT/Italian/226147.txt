SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg Cliffs Notes: 
I live in Summerlin, and this is by far the best pizza delivery option. My go to favorites are the Widowmaker and the BBQ chicken but I often split a onion/garlic/sausage/pepperoni with a friend at work for lunch. 

Full Review

So this place is obviously not Pizza Rock quality, but I don't think anyone could expect that from a residential delivery place. If you are a pizza snob this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a step up over Pizahut/Dominos kind of place than this is great. 

Some notes on the Pizza
Price wise this place is about 75-100% more expensive than your average delivery chain for just about everything- pizza, drinks, wings etc. 

A few reviews have raved about the "fresh ingrediants"- this is not exactly true. Their sauce comes out of a jar, I have never seen anyone slicing vegetables etc- they seem to use your run of the mill restaurant supply ingrediants. I wouldn't really expect anything different for the price but if you are a fresh food fenatic you may be dissapointed.


Delivery times- I live 2 miles from the place, I work about 500 feet from it. Delivery takes about 45 minutes to an hour whereas pickup takes 20 minutes so I would highly suggest picking it up to avoid getting the pizza past its prime. 

Wings- I love chicken wings and these are perfectly passable delivery wings given that we have no dedicated wing joint in summerlin. They are baked not fried which does negate the crispness a little but not too much.

Garlic knots- yes these are pretty good. You get 1-2 with your pizza depending on the size, would recommend getting a side order to avoid fights to the death in a situation of GK scarcity.
