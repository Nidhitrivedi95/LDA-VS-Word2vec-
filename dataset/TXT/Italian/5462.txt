_qA2HPqgLiBc-M4wRyml0g I don't normally start with their service but in this case they deserve it, they had excellent service. The salad was loaded with goat cheese, mandarins and walnuts and was great. Now the pizza. I ordered a marguerite uncut like always:) It was good and I would definitely go back, however they have no buffalo mozzarella and the mozzarella they did provide (a real thin layer) was not quite enough for my liking. The crust was good but not amazing. The flavor was excellent. I would recommend this place and will gladly go back for a second experience!
