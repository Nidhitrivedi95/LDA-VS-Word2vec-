Fn_IxcCtZl1EoS81sq_s9w This was our first time ordering from here. We usually order from rosatis but have been disappointed with the consistency and service. We found rush st. on yelp and decided to give it a shot. We don't order pizza often so when we do order we are really looking forward to it!(it's our cheat meal) I have to say as soon as I called Rush st. I was impressed, the girl on the phone took her time with me explaining the pizza crusts and was extremely friendly(this was at 7pm on a Friday, so I am sure she was busy). We placed the order which was really well priced, and quoted an hour. The delivery took about an hour and 20 minutes, no big deal. When the driver got to our door he was extremely friendly, and then introduced himself as the owner saying that he delivered ours and a few others tonight because they/we were first time customers and wanted to thank us and introduce himself! Wow, customer service like that is so rare, we immediately forgot about the extra 15 -20 minute wait. The pizza itself was fantastic we ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza thin crust and a dozen medium wings. Everything tastes great! He even gave us some special seasonings they carry. Overall I have to say we have never been this impressed with a pizza delivery and when we order pizza next it will be from Rush st.
