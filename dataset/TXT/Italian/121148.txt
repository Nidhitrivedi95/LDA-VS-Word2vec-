This review is only in reference to three dishes, which are in my opinion are bench marks of simple Italian food and not about the restaurant or wine menu. 

So, I'm half way through eating my spaghetti and meatballs and the first bite I had had high hopes and the hope melted like the meatball in my mouth. The meat was tender and juicy, however their was no flavor or spice. I felt as though I was eating the spaghetti and meatballs from a hospice center. What did help was the scrumptious garlic bread that I used to fill up on. 

After the disappointment, I turned to my friend who got the shrimp linguini and he chowed down on the glorious shrimps first. With a grin on his face he dug into the linguini. Within a few moments I recognized the look on his face, it was the exact look I had when I first took a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The linguini and the sauce had a mild garlic butter flavor and he wasn't a big fan either. 

I gave it two stars because of the garlic bread and the shrimp.
