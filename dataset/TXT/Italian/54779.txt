Yeah that pretty much sums my curiosity of that splendid pasta. I was expecting iron or mineral taste coming out from it (hence the ink) but the taste was so wonderful and the pasta is as good as it gets. With the king crabs meat and yummy sauce I definitely hooked to this food. The restaurant itself is a bit in tricky location cause it is right behind the keegan and on the left side of the safeway. I am having a bit trouble with the GPS when I tried to find it, but when the food came its all worth it. 
They gave us complimentary doughnut that to die for, the crunchiest doughnut that I'd ever tasted, and complimentary brownies. With this much good food to offer, I would definitely stop by this restaurant again!
