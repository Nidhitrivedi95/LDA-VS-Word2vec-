MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg The food was excellent. We had chicken Parmesan , eggplant parmesan, cheese Ravioli, spaghetti and meatballs. The service was equally excellent. We made reservations for 6:15 and was promptly sat. I have only one disappointment I ordered a glass of wine and they served it to me in a small glass water. Somehow I just couldn't enjoy my wine. But regardless I will definitely return.
