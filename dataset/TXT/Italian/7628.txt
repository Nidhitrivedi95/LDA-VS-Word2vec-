0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw $2.75 for 12 oz cup of coffee because it's a special blend got to be kidding me. Hipsters will buy anything. Overall the food is decent and well priced outside of the cup of gold they sell for $2.75. Best features is the seating outside. Note the people this place attracts can't control their kids, couldn't survive if their cell phone died, or will not last the first three days in a zombie apocalypse. Makes a nice breakfast turn into a should I have come here.
