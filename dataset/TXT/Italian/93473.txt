Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag This evening we enjoyed a delicious meal at Cucina.  The caprese salad had freshly made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes in a balsamic vinaigrette.  When ordering a wood fired grilled pizza, we requested meat free & our server offered red onions which complemented the olives & other toppings perfectly.  Apollo, our server, provided impeccable service.  My sweet grandson needed a pizza prepared for his food allergies.  The Cucina staff exceeded our expectations.  He loved his dinner!  Thank you to Apollo and all the staff at Cucina.
