0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ For the best Napoli Style Pizza... go to Novecento!!!

Their hand-tossed, made to order pizza is cooked in their wood burning oven at 900 degrees.... thus the name "Novecento".

My husband & I have been to Napoli, Italy; had pizza several times there, but still prefer the Napoli Style pizzas at Novecento!!!

You can order from their menu; or create your own pizza with the toppings you like.
Everything they make is great!  Prices so affordable!

They also serve gluten free pizzas!  Gelato, Italian coffee & drinks also available.

This is the only place we go for the true Napoli Style Pizza!!

Chef Marc.... did it again!!!
