DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw Always a fantastic place to eat. The atmosphere and welcoming feeling is worth a visit every time. My wife loves this place so much she has us drive all the way from California and it is never a let down. If you have not been it is a must when in Las Vegas the food is a very authentic memorable taste that will have you insisting on a future visit.
