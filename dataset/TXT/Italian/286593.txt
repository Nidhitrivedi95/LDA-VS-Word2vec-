If you are looking for a decent, upscale Italian restaurant, look somewhere else.
The only good note was the service  - it was excellent - the two associates that helped us were very professional and patient.
The food was average tasting wise and overpriced. The veal marsala was a mix of unseasoned and weird tasting sauce. The branzino was mostly skin - the commestibile part was MIA. 
The bad was dealing with management (Jennifer R.) who with her inflexibility, arrogance and poor customer service made the whole experience stressful and unpleasant.
