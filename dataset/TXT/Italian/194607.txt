PJ-l-Le8_I4nPomX18M2AQ Cant comment on the service as we ordered take out, but the food was pretty good. Given the amount of tired old chains around in this area, this was a stand-out. Looked pretty nice inside, with its own bar with some folk eating there too (apparently by choice, there were enough spare tables).
