h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ I last visited Mezzo Bistro 3 years ago. I took my wife out to a nice dinner. We loved the food but the service at that time was horrible! We hadn't gone back until Tuesday December 13th 2016 for a late lunch. They had terrific lunch specials so we decided to give them another shot. Heather was our server and she was great! We will be going back soon as it is a great place to have lunch. It is clean, the staff is friendly and the food menu has a large variety. My only wish is a larger selection of beers.
