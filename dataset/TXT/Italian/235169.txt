TVKenh65WwJX3zEr36zKCA Dining at the Oyster Bar at Sunset Station became a tradition for my wife and I whenever we are in Las Vegas. We always order the oysters, clam chowder, pan roast and bouillabaisse. So good !!!
The bar is wraparound so you can see the chefs do  their magic and smell all the goodness. Can't wait to dine there again.
