wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg 3.5*** great pasta selection. The place is always busy until very late and the atmosphere is lively. The pastas are generally delicious but are not huge and do not come with salad or any side dish despite being ~$15 a plate. The salads are way overpriced not to mention they charge $6-7 more for adding chicken....and it's still tiny. Still it's a nice place to go for pasta and pizza.
