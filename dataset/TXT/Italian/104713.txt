fp1AV66Uq9mo_9ZhZIIpcQ Horrible experience! Took 1-1/2 hours to deliver a pizza and a couple other basic items. Really? And you charge extra for that? And it was cold and didn't even taste very good. Not like the Pizza Hut I remember. I tried pick up a few months ago at another location and had a similar bad experience. I guess this location is kind of new because they deliver to my house. Well if you are willing to wait 90 minutes for a pizza that is. On top of that when I called after 45 minutes to give them my gate code I asked for an update when it would go out and the guy was rude and wouldn't give me an update. He basically said that they are backed up and I'll get it when I get it.  It was 3:00 in the afternoon, not even a normal rush time. When I placed the order online the estimated delivery time was about an hour, which was long but I decided I could wait an hour but they didn't come close to meeting that estimate. . Had I known it was really going to be 90 minutes I wouldn't have gone through with the order. 

Going back to Dominos. They are always fast and the food is actually really good these days. Not your Daddy's Dominos.
