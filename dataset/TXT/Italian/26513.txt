4m3aZoOh_q8gxLy5SXI0Bg I would have liked this review to be regarding the food and drinks. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to sit and give it a taste. 
We had been wanting to visit this location for over a year and finally decided to do it with a very good group of friends. I really hope the situation was simply because it was probably a long day for some. 
We had a party of 10 including kids, and to make the long story short we were waiting for over an hour and they still couldn't figure out how they were going to rearrange tables in order to sit us. We kept seen people come and leave and from our conversations they were waiting for a particular table to sit us which according to the personnel, was been cleaned for over thirty minutes. So I decided to go and check the status for myself. When seen that there were several tables cleaned and that it would only take a bit of thinking putting them together I went back to try and check with the people at front. This time I was told that there were people on the table they were going to assign to us and that they couldn't just ask them to leave. Imagine my jaw dropping when they acted like the ones being insulted.
After an hour and approximately ten minutes we decided to just go somewhere else and eat. After all everyone had had a long day on both sides. Before leaving I wanted to leave it on a good note so I approached the hostess to inform her we were going to go somewhere else and got a priceless look of "after all the work we are putting on this?".

Definitely needs work on the customer side, and probably a basic math class to know that 5 adults plus 4 kids plus one high chair is 10, not 7. After numerous attempts to correct the number we simply gave up.

Please do yourself a favor and drive to the one Uptown.
