pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ While visting Vegas, my boyfriend and I wanted to try a nice local Italian place off the strip and found Nora's.  The atmosphere was very nice.  Our waiter was very courteous and attentive. The items on their menu had traditional fare and some other authentic plates as well which offered a good variety! I had the Veal Cannelloni al Bosco  which was nothing I've had before.  I thought the sauce was quite delicious, but the filling was a little dry.  My boyfriend got the Chicken Parmigiana.  The sauce was full of flavor and not watery.  However, the chicken did was not crispy, but instead a little soggy, so that was disappointing.  The portions were pretty good compared to your typical huge vegas portions.  If we come through Vegas again, we will probably stop here again! :)
