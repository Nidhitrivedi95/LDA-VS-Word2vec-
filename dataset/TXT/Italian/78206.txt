CZY3743GpOOhdDJu6UmPBA Thank you for a great late night meal. Service was pleasant. 

Zucchini flowers - yum!
Baby octopus skewers - yum!
Nodini - hot hot hot! Don't burn your mouth. My friend likes it a lot. 
n'duja  - hot hot hot - way to end late night snacking. 

Gotta love my partner in crime for finding a late night kitchen with me
