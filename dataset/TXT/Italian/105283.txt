FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q Great service and truly delicious food with minor inconsistencies. We ordered the Roasted Artichoke and Fried Calamari appetizers (both excellent), two Seafood Fra Diavlo entrée specials, Lobster Ravioli special, and Chicken Marsala. The marinara sauce served with the calamari and fra diavlo sauce were hands down amazing. We are Italian and VERY particular with red sauce flavor. The marsala was excellent also. The seafood specials were meant to have mussels, clams, scallops, calamari, shrimp, and white fish over linquini, but both were missing the white fish and one was missing the scallops. We didn't mind because both dishes were chock full of seafood and the omitted items weren't missed. The lobster ravioli vodka sauce was very thick and bland and needs something to brighten the simple dish such as a drizzle of fresh basil sauce or some cooked, chopped tomato. The house Pinot Noir was tasty and reasonably priced. Our waiter and busboy were attentive without being intrusive. Overall, a great experience. We will definitely return!
