MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg You have got to try this place!! For my family, it was perhaps the best experience we've ever had at a locally owned restaurant.  

We brought a group of 7 to Chicago Joe's around 720 pm.   We were immediately greeted by JC, one of the friendliest and funniest servers we had met.  (In hindsight, it would've been better for us to have made reservations, as the restaurant is located in a quaint, small stand-alone building).   The place was packed, but within five minutes, JC managed to pull a couple tables together so that we could sit together. 

Once seated, we were served hot, soft, tasty bread  which we devoured instantly.  Our order was taken promptly, and then JC brought us some lasagna to sample.   He then brought us more bread. For our first course, half of us had pasta fagioli soup and the other half had salad with a creamy garlic dressing. You can't go wrong with either choice.

Our entrees consisted primarily of meat lasagna, cheese ravioli and fettuccine alfredo.   My favorite was the lasagna, which is absolutely phenomenal,  but all the entrées tasted delicious.  Our son decided to go out on a limb and ordered cioppino (seafood stew), which he loved.   Serving sizes were so generous that we could not even finish them.

We loved the service, ambience,  reasonable prices,  generous portions  and excellent taste of the food.  We will go back here again and again.
