The service: 

The wait staff was very nice and were very attentive. 

The food: 

I had their vegetarian option of a mozzarella pesto panini sandwich, creamy tomato soup, and mixed green salad. Everything was very good. I really enjoyed the crusty bread that added to the crispiness of the sandwich, but I especially loved the tomato soup. It was thick and creamy and you can taste the tomato flavor without the acidity. I love idea of  how it was served in a cup: brilliant. 

Overall: 

This place is an excellent place to enjoy a filling lunch with quality ingredients. I'd comeback in a heartbeat.
