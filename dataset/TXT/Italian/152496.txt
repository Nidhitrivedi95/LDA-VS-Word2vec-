KT8Lyc7lhL48SXalBSwLfw A perfect find in Edinburgh. This little spot has all the charms of a great Italian restaurant: traditional, romantic decor; professional and welcoming service; an excellent wine selection; and fantastic food. We had the arugula salad, a small plate of spaghetti with tomato sauce, a margarita pizza, and a scoop of stracciatella ice cream. Everything came out fresh and flavorful. We were given a home made chili oil to put on our pizza and we absolutely loved it! We are already planning to return again just to try their extensive dessert menu. Don't miss this great find. It's perfect for a drink, a full meal, or even a late night dessert!
