cy3Or8iSsDOmHBBu2MwnOg My boyfriend at the time brought me here on one of our first dates. I think that's when I fell in love with him and a number 1 Italian restaurant in Charlotte. When we walked in I felt like I was in Italy. The place had a warm cozy ambiance and the setting was perfect for a couple of lovebirds who just wanted to sip on some wine and eat carb rich pasta (that's my idea of heaven). The waitress, can't remember her name was instantly drawn towards the affection we had to each other and fed us accordingly. We started with a lovely bruschetta, and one of my best dishes Caprese- which I normally make fresh at home. For the entree we had a delicious Buttera whilst he had Polo Medici. I don't remember the name of the dessert but that was the best chocolate lava cake I've ever had. I would highly recommend Toscana for lovers who want a romantic homey meal and good wine.
