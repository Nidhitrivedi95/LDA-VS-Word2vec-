_EIIcHRJVqaDRjcffDOBSg Dropped in just before 5 restaurant I beat the dinner crowd. The decoration in the restaurant is a nice balance of rustic but sparse. Service was excellent and the food was very good. I had the lasagna which was served on a bed of a good marinara sauce. My wife had the gnocchi with the San Gennaro sauce which had sliced Italian sausage and peppers. It was very good without being too spicy. Overall the meal exceeded my expectations and I hope this new restaurant will succeed so I have an opportunity to visit many times in the future.
