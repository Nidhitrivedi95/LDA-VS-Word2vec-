tKi4OvAlckcVzeP92InsOQ Wow! This is a great place! We planned my sons 8th birthday party somewhere else and it wound falling through last minute. We called and spoke with Laura (the bday party coordinator) and she had a table set, balloons out and everything ready for us in FIVE MINUTES notice. She acted like it was a breeze and was so helpful. She got all of the kids names for bowling written down and remembered them the rest of the time, calling each by name. She was FANTASTIC. We have enjoyed playing in the arcades or watching movies here before, but I'm blown away by the level of service and fun we were met with for my sons birthday party. And with nearly no notice at all!! I wish I could give 6 stars for such an amazing party hostess.
