THsU2vYT1sYm9amz9d0e4A Food was good. Customer service nothing to brag about    Had dinner at restaurant and then placed an order to go. Took a while to get the to go order while waiting never got a refill of drinks. Got the order. I know should have checked. Got home and it was the wrong order  dove back to jimmy's. while waiting to speak to someone a server was dealing with seated customer about giving him the wrong order.  When I finally spoke to someone it was like they knew and was looking for the order they gave me. They apologized and brought my order out in seconds. Amazing! But no consideration for their screw up and my inconvenience.  Not even a discount coupon or free appetizer on next visit. Guess it's ok for me to waste my time and gas patronizing their eatery. 
Advice. Check the order before you leave the facility
