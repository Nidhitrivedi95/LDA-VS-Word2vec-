eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg The food's actually pretty good. The service, however, is not.

Water was not refilled for the entire meal. Four water glasses sat empty for literally an hour. Other empty glasses from wine and soft drinks were never picked up. Not even after the bill arrived. The empties just sat there.

Our server was loud and sorta cocky. Which actually can be an asset in some cases. But this guy couldn't pull it off...and, based on our experience with him, he had no justifiable reason to be so self-confident in his style.

Food, though slow to arrive, was pretty good on the whole.

Half of the table enjoyed salads and they were quite flavorful, particularly the mixed greens with beets, pears, and pomegranate dressing. Very nice.

The cannelloni was out of this world good. The portion was only two noodles. I could've eaten a thousand. Fantastic!

The least successful entree at the table was a pizza, which had a droopy, limp crust, sparse toppings and little cheese. If  you go--and that should be a BIG "if" in my estimation--take a pass on the menu's pizza section.

After such good food, I was ready to forgive the lackluster service. But that's when Mr. Cocky Server came back and took our final drink orders: a couple of wines, a coffee, and a refill of Coke. "Got it," he said, "two Merlot, a coffee, and a snort of coke." WHAT? Who says that? I wanted to kick him in the nuts for fucking up a perfectly good meal with friends.

The good food is not worth the awful service in my book. I'd rather go to an Olive Garden. At least the server there wouldn't cap off the evening with narcotics jokes.
