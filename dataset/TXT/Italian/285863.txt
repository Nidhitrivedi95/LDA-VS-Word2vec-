zfOum9_rEhaLAqoAV3nYaQ Great new restaurant in Scottsdale! Service was fantastic and the food was very good. 

For an appetizer, we shared the grape leaves and Falafel. Both were very tasty! I had the pan seared salmon for a main course - I loved it, it was very well prepared and served with carrots and rice. My boyfriend had the grilled chicken - it was good, a little bland but I prefer that to places that cover their food in sauces. 

Always nice to find restaurants that support local growers and use quality ingredients. 

Very cute atmosphere, reasonable prices, and a great dining experience. We'll be back!
