3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A I actually want to give Enoteca Sociale a 3.5 star review but bumped it up to a 4 star review since you can't assign half stars and I think it is more worthy of a 4 star review than a 3 star review.

The bread to start was really fresh.  I shared the pork chop and the pasta, pork and peas dish with a friend.  The pork chop was really juicy and the pasta was delicious.  Quality ingredients were used.  I like that our server was patient and willing to explain the menu to us (as we weren't sure what everything was) and was able to make recommendations.
