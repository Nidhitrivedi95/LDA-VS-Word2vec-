0Rni7ocMC_Lg2UH0lDeKMQ Great pizza! Not sure how much of a "chain" this place is but I've never heard of it outside of Arizona. This is typically our go-to pizza place. We don't ever order Domino's or Pizza Hut since you can get better quality food here for the same price or less. 

A large pepperoni is usually $11-12.

Their wings are pretty good but theyre heavy with the sauce. Its usually overwhelming and I actually stay away from them now. But they're very large in size which could be a plus for those looking for more for their money. 

Service is great, we order ahead and pick up or even get delivery. The wait time is almost always 45 minutes to an hour.
