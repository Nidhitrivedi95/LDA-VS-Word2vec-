VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Horrible place! Security is VERY rude! I was there for an hour and had 2 drinks. I got kicked out because some girl pushed me! 3 securities took me to the back, thru the kitchen and put me in an elevator. The elevator that the employees use. It smelled and was dirty! One of the guys Asked for my ID and took my info down. They drew an X on my wrist stamp. I was treated like shit! I never want to come back! If you guys are going to have open bar for all the ladies please know there is going to be pushing and shoving and that gives you guys no right to kick someone out in that manner! At least escort me to the front entrance!!!!!
