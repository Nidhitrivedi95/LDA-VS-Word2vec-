AWJhMTYsIYzCIYAIUA-waA So-so. Came in for some dessert with some friends. Ordered the strawberry cheese cake and the tiramisu. I was really excited by the description of the cheesecake with "strawberries"... (Plural) But when the cheesecake came out, there was only one strawberry! I attached a pic of the dessert menu and cheesecake. And, I think it's strawberry season right now! I felt like both desserts were alright but not amazing enough to make me want more :/ The service was okay. The server kept serving us from the side of the kitchen over the wall of the booth which felt a little awkward.
