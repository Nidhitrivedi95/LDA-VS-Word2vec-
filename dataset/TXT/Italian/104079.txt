FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Great place. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The food was great. The sandwiches were huge.  The butchers block. Great selection of charcuterie and cheese. The goat cheese was awesome. We also got the bruschetta, the first four in the menu. Everything was delicious.
