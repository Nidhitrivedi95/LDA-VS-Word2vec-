JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A so the moment we come in the service was horrid.
we came in for take out a piece of cake and absolutely no greeting excepot an unacceptibl look on the womans face with tattoos on her arm and a look thats says why the hell are you here.

we ask for a menu and she treats us like a nuissance.  like wtf im just a customer.

anyway horrid bad attitude and ive been here a few times never had that b4.  never will go the first floor.
