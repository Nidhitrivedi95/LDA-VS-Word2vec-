jNQnscvgn_dMTS954qW_9Q Ventured into this place with the hubs after driving past it countless times and I have to say, it wasn't half bad. Sure, it's not a "fancy" Italian spot, and it's doesn't have gourmet food, but it's kind of kitschy and cute. The portions are rather large, definitely split-able. I ordered the spaghetti with clam sauce. It was spaghetti, nothing fancy, cooked well and topped with zillions of chopped clams. Was it the best I've ever eaten? No, but it also was very far from the the worst. 

Their pizza that was on many tables looked decent and I would certainly venture back to this spot again.
