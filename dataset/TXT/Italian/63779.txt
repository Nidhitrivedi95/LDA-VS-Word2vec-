BBFRnGOH_3bUpIT4GYSApQ Wow what can I say. I was introduced to this place by a friends of mine. Now I stop in every time i'm in the area for lunch. If you want real quality home cooked food this is the place to go. The selection is great and you can tell all the food was made with love. The owner and son are always friendly and show that they take pride in this place. I recommend finishing your lunch off with an espresso. 

 In regard to the reviewer saying this is place is over priced. Please tell me where you can get a home cooked meal for under $15.00 made with quality ingredients. 

 Definitely check this place out because I promised you that you wont regret it. Looking forward to going next time.
