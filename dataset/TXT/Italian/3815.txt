_e3rChyednoh47n2cjGv2w Probably the best Italian food I've had in the valley in a LONG time. I used to go to a place that asks u to "come in!" In Italian (I'll let u figure that out : ) but the food has gone downhill. Adela's has been constantly good since the first time my brother and I walked in. Super quaint, super dope staff, and the chicken Parmesan is out of pocket!! One thing that stood out to me: THE BREAD! Free bread usually is just that.. but something about what they serve stands out. It's like a mix of brioche and Italian. Awesomeness in a loaf! Try Adela's out. You won't be disappointed l.
