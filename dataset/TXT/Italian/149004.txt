Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA We went with a group of 7 randomly finding it when we were on the lookout for a pizza place. It's located down the Linq which is already a generally nice place now.
The pizzas were good with a nice selection. We got a the Big Apple, Verdure, and Mushroom to try to get a tomato and garlic cream. They were all good with no complaints and all compliments from everyone on the table, despite our differing tastes. 
The beer selection was exquisite, probably second to only Yard House. 
Our waitress Kristina had good taste with her beer, next time we'll have to try her pizza  suggestion, Calabrese. She was also nice and knowledgeable.
The pizzas were thin but hit the spot. Not too big or too small, though we were definitely too full for dessert. We also grabbed two romaine salads for the table.
Overall, good first experience, even great. The only complaint was the automatic 18% gratuity, as most places forced that at 8 people. Along with the already not cheap pizzas, it didn't make us happy.
Still, would come back for some beer and a different pizza.
