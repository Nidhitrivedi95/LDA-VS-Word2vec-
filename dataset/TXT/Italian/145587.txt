My wife and I decided to check this place out on a Monday evening. Usually I wold have expected it to be quite empty but was pleasantly surprised by how full it was.
The server was nice enough to offer the appetizer sized gnocchi when I couldn't decide on my main course as I was torn between gnocchi and the Osso Buco.
I must admit the gnocchi was perfect and melted in my mouth. It was better than I have had in a very long time. I would say I couldn't find such good gnocchi even when I visited Italy.
The Osso Buco was amazing tender and great tasting. 
For dessert I highly recommend the Nutella Creme Brûlée. Now I am not a chocolate lover by any means but have to admit this was one dessert worth ordering. 
Definitely a place I could recommend to friends looking a place to eat in Toronto.
