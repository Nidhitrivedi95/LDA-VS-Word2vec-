UHPjDgiEHnTe7-MP-b2kyQ I had dinner here with my husband last night and it was a huge disappointment!! I ordered a Ziti con Melanzane and the penne was not al dente it was undercooked and very hard to chew with a tomato sauce that was bland and absolutely tasteless. My husband's minestrone soup looked very unappetizing it came in a very small ball and was tasteless too. His calamari pasta was average. All the dishes in this restaurant are over priced and way too expensive for what u get in return. I wouldn't go back there again, our first and last visit!!
