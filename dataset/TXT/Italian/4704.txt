_mg5bYknpZgaWSfjQVmrJQ I went to Spinato's to pick up a couple of their delicious pizzas for carry-out. As I waited I decided to go over to the bar. The bartender was less than friendly--he did not make eye contact, he did not speak in complete sentences. It was as if my presence at his bar disturbed him.  After wiping the bar down in front of me with a filthy cloth, he placed some menus on the wet surface, and I told him I did not need I menu. He left me and returned to his register without giving me the opportunity to tell him what I wanted to drink. I only wanted a beer, and I was sitting right next to the tap. Shortly after he returned to his register,  a couple came in and took their seats right next to the register, and they received their drinks within a matter of seconds. I hate to pull a certain card, but it is the only thing that I can think of as to why the service I was provided was subpar. Spinato's, please train your people how to be courteous to all. I will avoid the bar and maybe even the food from this day forward.
