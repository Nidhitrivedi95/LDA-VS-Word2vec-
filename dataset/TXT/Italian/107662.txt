FyKefsWq62xeXpje0Flcig This was the worst dining experience I have ever had.  My 60th birthday and I made my reservation over a week ago through Open Table  only to be told, upon arrival that we did not have a reservation.  We were seated at a thrown together combination of two mis- sized tables right next to the kitchen.  My dinner and my mother's arrived cold. My carbonara was served with raw pancetta, no peas (because they didn't have any) and the wrong pasta.  The provided spaghetti instead of rigatoni.  The portion sizes were so small that my daughter and her husband left hungry.  Who serves bread a with an overly acidic vinegar dressing prior to the meal? We waited 1 hour and 35 minutes for this less than memorable meal. My mothers remade meal took so long she asked for a doggy bag.  At that point we gave up and asked for a check.  Thanks for my milestone birthday dinner - not!
