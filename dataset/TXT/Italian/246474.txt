V_6gs6mUnUwrTQFVvWKW1A I've made 2 attempts at giving this place a chance. 

My first attempt was a few days after their grand opening. I ordered their Alfredo MontAmore dish. 
This dish was extremely underwhelming. Very dry. Noodles stuck together. Wasn't even sure I got the right dish at first as there was no Alfredo sauce to be found. Upon seeing very little Alfredo at the bottom of the bowl I figured it was the right order. I ordered the dish with grilled chicken and added shrimp. Both the shrimp and chicken were EXTREMELY dry just like the noodles were

My second visit was just as disappointing as the first. If not more. This time I opted for the Pad Thai. Again, the noodles were so dry that I could stick my fork in them and pull out every single noodle which was stuck together in one large lump. I had a terrible time trying to pull them all apart to make them edible. I got the dish with shrimp and, again, I wasn't surprised to find the shrimp extremely dry. It was supposed to have fried egg in the dish as well but I found maybe 3 or 4 small pieces of egg. Not even anything that would be considered a full egg. They topped it with 2 soggy sprigs of cilantro and a tiny dry shriveled up lime wedge which I was unable to get any lime juice out of in an attempt to moisturize my dry noodles. There was no taste of peanuts...possibly due to the fact they forgot to add them. And there was no taste of sweet chili. 

I think it's safe to say I won't be returning and unfortunately, unless this company can really do a complete 180 turnaround and fix all the issues people are complaining about, they won't stand a chance and will be having to close their doors soon...
