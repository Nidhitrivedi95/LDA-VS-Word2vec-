wyKd4F1fAfDCA1rTxSoT_A This restaurant HAS SOME NERVE.  First, let's put aside that the fact that the portions are unbelievably small and the prices are ridiculously high.

It's the attitude and treatment of the customer which is really what I'm angry about.

Long story short, we were there last night (Monday) me, my wife, and two kids.  Clearly, the waitress (who didn't write anything down) forgot the order but later blamed it on a "misunderstanding ".  The hostess or manager or owner (not sure of her title) was unhelpful and insulting and only served to further inflame the situation by saying she wasn't there when the order was placed, so she didn't know what happened.

Adding salt to the wound, while I stewed in my anger at the poor treatment we were receiving - and waiting about 45 minutes for my calimari- at one point the hostess apologized to the couple NEXT TO US- and gave them a complimentary pizza because of the delay!  Meanwhile, my calimari never came.

In the end, I cancelled my calimari order because I was so angry (and lost my appetite).  The restaurant did take off the charge for one of our orders and a soft drink for one of my kids but it was a little too late.

Message to this restaurant:  its obvious you are packing in lots of people, you are pushing your expensive alcoholic drinks, your pricey bottled/mineral water, and your high priced snack food - but remember the basics of customer service and treatment of people.  In the days of Yelp, the customer has a voice!

Never going back.
