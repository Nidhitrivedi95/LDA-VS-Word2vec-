Zx4iQCmQfAaXvwPc3TlF9Q OK! Two words. GREAT PRICES.

Great prices on food, great quality. The product may not be what you pay for but I definitely see myself getting a bang for the buck every time I pay a visit.

My girlfriend and I pay a visit every couple of months or so. We used to smoke cigarettes, that's long forgotten about but we don't mind those that do. So yes, it is a smoky bar. But get over it, it's a bar. Want a bar without smoke? Go to Applebee's. 

We go for the 3.50 Hoegaarden. A belgian import. Blue Moon's Idol. Shock Top's Idol. The beer that puts both Blue Moon and Shock Top to shame. Hoegaarden was the originator. The first Belgian White. So give it a whirl. It's expensive. 8 to 10 dollars a six pack so if you want a full pint on draft for less go to the Taphouse. 

We drink the Hoegaarden with the pizza, original crust. Throw some veggies on there, a little pepperoni, sausage or meatball and it's a done deal. Great pizza. A bang for the buck and a cool laid back place to take my lady. 

The service may not be 100 percent but damn those ladies get it right. Shuffleboard is available for play too. Cheap drinks, cheap food for a good experience. I can't protest.
