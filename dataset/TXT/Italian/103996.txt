FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Absolutely loved this place!  Food, service, wine, atmosphere.  We had a great time.  My only reason for 4 vs 5 stars is the wine list.  We ordered a bottle of Sangiovese and got Chianti.  Yes, I know Chianti is made with sangiovese grapes, but it also has other grapes. I wanted a bottle of Sangiovese, not Chianti. Nonetheless, it was good.  The 2nd bottle was on the wine menu as a Merlot-Cabernet Franc. I assumed it would be roughly 50/50 blend and it sounded interesting. It came out and was 75% merlot, 15% carmenere, 5% cabernet sauv and 5% cabernet franc. It was good wine, but it was not what I wanted.  Not a big deal and just a minor thing, but if the restaurant is calling itself a wine bar, then it would have been nice to have a few more details and accuracies on the wine menu.
