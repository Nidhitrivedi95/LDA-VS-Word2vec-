bNNF6Z91L7Omfdi8QSo2_w Wholly cow, what a bunch of snooters.  My wife and I are in Scottsdale for a few days and I Google best views of sunset in Scottsdale and up pops the restaurant at the top of the Phonecian.  We go there and get seated around a fire pit, nice.  So we ask if we can order appetizers where we are seated.  The waiter says he will check and returns and says yes.  We go to order and are told no we were misinformed and we can't order food.  What the heck.  I question the waiter who sends the manager over.  The manager has the people skills of a rock and with the stone face of a zombie tells us we can't order appetizers.  This place should not advertise that they are open to the public because all they cater to are snooters.
