RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ If you're on a quest to find the best pizza in Pittsburgh, you definitely have to stop at Mineo's. So many in Pittsburgh claim Mineo's to have the best. While I don't agree it's quite the best, I definitely enjoy the pizza here and I also enjoy it more than its competitor a few doors up the road. 

I think what makes Mineo's so good is the really crispy crust, the slightly sweet sauce, and the ooey gooey cheese (which there is a lot of). With so much cheese on the pie, you need a sturdy crust to balance it, which you have with Mineo's. If you dine in, you've got to try the cannolis for dessert! Even if you're anything like me and you're usually not a fan of cannolis, something about the cannolis here might change your mind. The filling is so smooth and has just the right amount of sweetness. 

While I've also tried their Mount Lebanon location, I prefer the Squirrel Hill location. The bar at Squirrel Hill is a perfect place to watch a Steelers game and enjoy great pizza. Just remember to bring cash!
