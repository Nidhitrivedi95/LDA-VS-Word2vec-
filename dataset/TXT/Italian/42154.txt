7qo6rqDjlHds8ObxzxBD4A Checked out this joint based on the positive reviews. Had garlic knots to start...good but nothing better than the norm.  Pizza was also good but nothing I would consider significantly better than your average pizza joint.  Tried bruschetta pizza.  Although it was good,  probably will stick to pie shops closer to our home.
