LYWMVX8lRMfIiUTm4jS-pw So Almost feel bad foe giving Desserts Plus 3 stars but for all of you that have been here know why.  This place has been an iconic restaurant from way back in the day but unfortunately the service is not very good.  If you have no place to be and are not in a rush then look no further.  If you are in a rush you may just miss your next appointment.  Slow services, wait staff forget about you, you have to ask before you get anything rather than being asked if you need anything but here is the thing the food is hands down the BEST and the portions are insane.  I have to say that its worth experiencing the lack of service just for the food.  Prices are cheap, portions are huge how can you go wrong.  Just need to be patient with the wait staff and keep it in your mind that you are there for the food and not the service.

I wish Yelp would allow you to rate both the service and the food.  Saying that I will do that on my own for this case.

FOOD - 5 STARS ++++++
SERVICE - 3 STARS

Definitely coming back here no matter how bad the service is.
