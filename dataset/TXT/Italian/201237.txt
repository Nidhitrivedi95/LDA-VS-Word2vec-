pXQV_vlMtQt---3W_do9Zg Update.  2 1/2 hours later, I heard knock knock.  Who is there?  Maru's!  The owner saw the review and sent another pizza.  

This time it was as I remembered.  I'm happy to find out that it was just one time thing.  As the delivery person said, the last one must have had too much veggies=soggy pizza.  

Now my question marks have disappeared, it's time for their tiramisu!

I wanted to thank the owner taking a review seriously.  I never expected another pizza.  

Previous review:
It's so sad.  I loved it when they first opened.  Pizza was delivered in great condition last time I ordered.  Hot and not soggy.  Now I don't know what happened.  It was delivered within 30 minutes.  The store is about 10 minutes away.  The crust was baked nicely but it was not hot.  The half of the pizza was inedible. Has it been previously frozen?  I don't know.  The meatball pieces were also mushy.  It was just so awful.  The whole time we picked at the edible part of pizza, question marks just went through my head.  Imagine soaking a pizza slice into water....ugh.    

I know I should eat it at the store first before judging on their pizza but it was too disappointing for me to even think of trying it again.  I also ordered tiramisu.  I have no desire to try that either with my nausea at this point.  Really.  I would never said no to sweets unless I lose complete trust in the food.

That being said, the service was very good.  I really liked the gentleman who took my order as well as the one who delivered.  Hence, two stars for service.  Someday I will try it at the restaurant....someday.
