4LXZzgsrM1ZyS_-uB9Od2Q Met up with friends here as a last minute alternative since we couldn't get reservations for a saturday evening anywhere in the city.  I am so glad my friend suggested this place - we loved it. It wasn't too difficult to get a table and the waitstaff was super attentive. My SO and I split the gnocchi and the fiama pizza. LOVED the pizza and the gnocchi was pretty good too. The dessert we had was dark chocolate mousse that was fantastic, whipped and airy. Great wine list as well - loved the reisling. 
Great food - great service. Just wish they had a few more pasta dishes but I am also a firm believer that if you do something well you don't need to do everything.And they do make great pizzas. Will definitely return.
