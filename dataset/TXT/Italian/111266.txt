G099MT9cwtwgdsR71JLp6w One of the top Italian restaurants in town. This is the real thing - Italian, not Italian-American. The menu describes the food simply, but the dishes are far from simple. The menu changes constantly- always fresh and seasonal with many daily specials. Must-try dishes include the boar ragu, tortelacci (Gorgonzola and black walnut pasta, like ravioli), mare (daily special fish appetizer), and the butterscotch pudding (budino). 

Unfortunately, they do not take reservations, so wait times can vary greatly. But if you arrive before 6 pm or are willing to sit at the bar (which is good for one or two), you typically will be seated immediately. 

Atmosphere is casual, but some people wear smart casual. Outdoor seating on the sidewalk is available. 

If you save the receipt, you can show it at Maduro (a cigar bar just around the block on East Main) for 25% off your first round of drinks!
