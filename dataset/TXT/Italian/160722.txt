lJbxQFXqbgKBdHPKKxROMQ After reading some of these reviews on the way to this restaurant, I thought I was going to have one heck of an experience.  

The pizza I ordered was over cooked and it was quite bland. Thank god for having Romano Cheese and Red Pepper Flake on the tables, or I would not have eaten the pizza. 

The 16oz draft beer I ordered came in a 12oz glass. To prove my point I pour a 12oz bottle of beer into that same glass and it barely fit. 

What I was impressed with was the service and the owner was able visit with all the patrons in the dining area. 

This place would be good for drinks and apps with friends or to catch a game on one of their many TV's. If you're looking for good pizza in Wexford; this is not the place to go.
