LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw My boyfriend and I go here at least once a month. We love to sit at the bar because the wait here is always long and the bartenders are so friendly here. We stick to a basic thin crust pepperoni, which is always good, but I've also had the Lady is a Scampi pasta and that's pretty good too. My favorite part is the chocolate chip pizza cookie! Yummy. Great patio to have lunch or dinner and a beer on a nice day.
