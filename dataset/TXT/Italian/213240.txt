r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA i love this place, fresh made to order subs and sandwiches, the eggplant parmesan sub is awesome, hot and crispy, with a great marina and cheese, its not like the heavy overbaked trays of eggplant parmesan  thats usually soggy, , i have it with only a bit of that great gravy so its not messy, nice deli counter, very friendly staff. and the brick oven pizza is to die for, has a del counter, fresh imported cheeses , assorted fresh and dried pastas, nice market.
