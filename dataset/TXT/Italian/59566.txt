AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw We tried Okra last week for a family member's birthday and it was very tasty. My husband and I split the cheese balls, each ordered the umbrian fried chicken, and then shared a donut for dessert. The cheese balls were very tasty, you can't go wrong with fried mac and cheese! We both enjoyed the chicken but it was a tad spicy for me (I'm not a fan of spicy). It was good but nothing overly exciting. The cornbread was very tasty and mashed potatoes were just okay. The donut was very good but the salted caramel made it a bit too salty, we said next time we'd just order the donut plain. The prices were fine but portions are on the smaller side. Definitely a good place to try something new but not something we would visit on a weekly basis.  

We went with a huge group and the people we went with raved about the chicken skins and pot pies. They also had some tasty looking drinks! We had great service as well! 

I was happy to see the large parking lot behind it as parking in the area can be tricky! We went on a weeknight so there was plenty but it might get more crazy on weekends.
