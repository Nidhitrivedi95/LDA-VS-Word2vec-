jG1jcAeDw0pZTHCNC5kw_w It's a dive italiano spot.  Not in itself a bad thing..  Could use a little sprucing and definitely a little bit of cleaning.

The variety plate appetizer was good - had a few meats, a couple cheeses, artichoke hearts, marinated mushrooms, olives, and some bread.  Good variety, would be great with wine.  We also got the sausage and mushroom pizza.  It tasted a bit of raw flour but other than that it wasn't too bad.  The fennel sausage wasn't too impressive and there was a lot of water coming out of i$t (probably the mushrooms).  

All in all, its ok.  Would seek it out, wouldn't avoid it.
