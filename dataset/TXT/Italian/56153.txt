The sommelier was bringing the wine list pushing to make a wine selection at the same time the waiter went over the different kinds of fish. The overall service was slow and not paying a lot of attention to the table. I actually had to get up myself to refill my wine glass a couple of times. The waiters would clean part of the table but then would not return for 15-20 min to clean the rest of the table. If you don't care for good service much and just want to have good food, this is a perfect place for you.
