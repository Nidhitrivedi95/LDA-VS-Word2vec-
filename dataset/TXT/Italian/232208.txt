TKhlt0jPUhJt10jgEKdWXg Service was subpar to say the least. What eating establishment brings your dinner salad with your main course? The salad was good, wish I could say the same thing about the stuffed pizza. The edges were so overdone it was crumbled & some of it was even burnt. The inside was just barely hot enough to melt some of the cheese. The meat wasn't even warm. The sauce had good flavor but not worth what they charge. We expressed our unhappiness with the waitress who found it necessary to go tell another employee that was sitting down with a family eating, that we were mad. Not sure what her position was, but can recount the story she was sharing at the register about someone having prostate surgery as our food was being delivered. When we went to pay, we were asked how everything was. We shared our feelings & the fact we wouldn't be back. We were told "that's too bad & the pizza gets overdone like that so the insides are cooked." I forgot to mention...they charge extra for deep dish. Never, ever again. Ever.
