IXJ5sfKnsGu6drrFUceQ5Q Do not let the name, flashy window lights, or the strip mall appearance fool you. I went to Time Warp for the first time and was shocked that the interior was super clean. There was a really cool band playing everything from  Donna Summers to Tom Petty. The girls at the bar were really nice.

Ups of TWB- great music, keno, and cheap drinks

Downs of TWB- only a handful of fried appetizers

Also the crowd here is 50s and up.
