0uwQIGlKICIYuRtayVnh7g I've been to Piada once. ONCE. And that's enough. This is overpriced cafeteria food. Chain restaurant crap. A limp salad and clumped up pasta for $15.? In Cleveland? When you can get way way better authentic homemade food  for half the price? Yeah I don't need to come back here.
