7iZYl52Gtica73shRYsuMQ I've been to Francesca's five or six times, because my friends really like to eat there.  I'd never choose to eat here myself.  They change the pasta and entree menu frequently, which normally I like.  Each time I've been to this restaurant, the menu has been different.  Each time, however, the menu seems kind of all-or-nothing.  I either can't decide what to order, or nothing sounds appealing.  

I've ordered the pizza when none of the pasta appealed to me, and won't make that mistake again.  The crust somehow managed to be chewy and hard at the same time.  My jaw hurt from eating it.  The cheese was good, but I haven't licked the toppings of pizza since I was five.  The salads are small and I'd have to order three of them to be satiated.  

As I mentioned, I've either loved the pasta dishes or not wanted to eat them at all.  Fortunately, I can bring anything home to my boyfriend!  The portions are huge, so if I like something I eat half it for dinner and bring the rest home for the lunch the next day.  When I don't like something, I eat two bites and bring the rest home.

I don't eat meat (or chicken or seafood), and I think you can learn a lot about a "chef" when you ask a dish to be made without meat.  At Francesca's they don't seem to know what to do with this request, which causes me to suspect things are made up ahead of time.  I've tried ordering pasta without meat and then have to order entirely different sauces.  I've not been able to order any of the entrees, as they are all animal-flesh based.

I don't agree with the reviews on here raving about Francesca's wine list.  It's the same as you'd find at any liquor store that isn't located within a grocery store.  I'd rather stay home and drink the whole bottle for less than the price of two glasses at a restaurant.  

It'd be nice if they'd update their menu online, so I'd know whether to eat a snack before going or not.
