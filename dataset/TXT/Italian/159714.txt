lgWB0yGXpZvupYREWxtV7g Next to Lux - and nice to go to after a caffeine sugar high from a Soy Mocha. Friend and I got the Mozzarella sandwich. The bread was delicious and it came with a freshly made side cabbage salad (which I think changes each day/week). I recommend asking for some balsamic vinaigrette on the side. The sandwich is even better when you dip in that. Sorry to modify, but really, it's like a caprese on a sandwich. Just needs it! 


Staff seems to be all guys. Maybe just every time I go... but they are always super friendly. Great Vibe. 

Note: Not a ton of vegetarian/vegan nor gluten free options unfortunately.
