I had the lobster roll - which was a bit underwhelming but the sides were great.
The lobster roll appears to have a lot of lobster but the bread itself is empty and all the lobster is piled on top - so it is a bit misleading in thinking the sandwich is overflowing with lobster. Having said that, it was a tasty sandwich and there was outdoor seating which was nice to enjoy the weather. Would come back to try out their other sandwiches.
