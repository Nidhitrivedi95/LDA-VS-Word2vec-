UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ Good food- okay service ( depending on server)- great portions ( except lunch menu). 

I have introduced some friends to this little eatery and they have all loved the :

-pizza muffins
-calzones
-lasagna

those are definitely the best as the other dishes are just okay. All in all- for the reasonable prices and great tasting italtion foods...it worth the calories and the savory bites!
