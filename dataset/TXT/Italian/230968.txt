Tf13Wexrt6WmNw-CDW5Gyg So disappointed!  Was really looking forward to this restaurant, as one of my favorite foods is spaghetti with meatballs!  Was even thinking about coming here for my birthday dinner.  So so so so glad that I passed on that and decided to get take out here instead.

The good news is that their chocolate milkshake made from their gelato was one of the best I've had.  Nice portion size too.

Had to send my take out order back two times before they got it right.  I'm so glad that I checked my order instead of waiting until I got home.  The first time, it was missing one serving of noodles,  the cheese I requested for the meatballs, and the sauce for the noodles.  The second time, it was missing both servings of noodles!  The second time, when I went back to report my findings, I stood at the counter, with two employees.  Neither greeted me or asked how they could help.  It took awhile before someone who must have been watching from the sidelines came around the side and tended to me.  

The food was uneventful.  Ordered the classic meatballs with a side of spaghetti and a side of broccoli.  Meatballs were ok, except for it seemed like someone had dumped a large handful of salt on it.  I wasn't able to finish them all because the salt was so overpowering.  The spicy meat sauce didn't have a hint of spice.  The spaghetti was cooked perfectly, however, the portion size was so tiny that it's definitely not enough to put the meatballs on top & call it a meal -- not that it was ever advertised that way.  I understand, it's a side.  Still though, it's just pasta and for six bucks I would have liked to see a little more.  The broccoli was also extremely salty.

Meh...
