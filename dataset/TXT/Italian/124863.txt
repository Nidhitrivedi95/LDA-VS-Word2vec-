Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ Bought a burned pizza, black on the bottom.  Took it back &  Dan replaced it free.  The 2nd one was still dark on the bottom.  Dan said it was undercooked on top & Chef Gio wouldn't let him sell it if he were there.  I said if it's too dark on the bottom & undercooked on top, there's something wrong with the oven.  Dan said what did I expect with a 25 year old oven?  I took the pie home & all my guests hated it.  Half the pie was thrown away because it was burned on the bottom.  I've had pies there that I believe were the best in town.  I think the problem is Dan's attitude/ego.  So I'm not going back until Chef Gio gets Dan under control or gets a new oven.
