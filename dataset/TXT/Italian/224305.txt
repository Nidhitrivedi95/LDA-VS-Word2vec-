sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg Very classy bar! Love the decor. Rooftop bar looks and feels classy and bar tenders are attentive and quick! The bar on top of the restaurant had no coat check, but tables with seating were available giving the classy venue a nice chill vibe. Music was pretty good from what I remember, it's not a dance club but it has sufficient space to get your groove on. Drinks are well made.

Looking at yelp now, I wish we tried the food but next time.
