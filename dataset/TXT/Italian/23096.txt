3prYLfbO9h30ozqdUCZ_6A Man I really enjoy coming here, but the last two times I've been here the service has gotten worse and worse. Last time we waited 20m just for someone to come and take our drink order. Asked to see the MOD several times and no one promptly showed up. At the end of dinner the MOD came by didn't comp anything off our bill and just made poor excuses for the staffs lack of professionalism and speed. I haven't been back lately. I do enjoy the baked rigatoni with a side meatball. My mom always orders the alfredo. Portions are meant to be shared but we don't, we just take them home to have leftovers for the next day.
