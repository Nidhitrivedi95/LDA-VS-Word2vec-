0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg Dinner at Scarpetta was unforgettable!  Mike was our server and he was excellent!  He gave suggestions for menu items, had a great personality and added a complimentary dessert at the end of our meal.  My husband and I had the filet (med-rare) and the duck and foie ravioli.  The filet was cooked perfectly and the pasta was incredibly fresh.  Our friends loved their dishes too (lamb and a chicken pasta).  I highly recommend saving room for dessert.  We had cheesecake, a banana soufflé and a salted caramel pudding.  Overall an amazing experience, excellent service and delicious food.
