Pg6t8mG-zWY3pRSdxlFnHg Where the pizza is good, everything else lacks! Pizza was decent. That's about it. We got a chicken and bacon pizza that was pretty good, the crust was a little on the soggy side but thin crust is tricky like that. The gyro was disgusting! The meat was very dry and just stacked on top of the pita like it came right out of the frozen package. This might be me being picky but I've never had a gyro with slices of what appears to be meat, its always shredded or thinly sliced. When it got to my house it looked like somebody threw a pile of cold fries on the bottom, then a pita and a slab of grainy brown meat. The fries are an upcharge which makes this place overpriced. We will probably try the pizza again but won't go out of our way to get it. I would give 2 stars, but the lady who took our order was nice so they have that going for them.
