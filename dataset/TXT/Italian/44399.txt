The space is great - the glass around makes way for the natural light, especially for current long summer days. Spacious seating too! Food that I liked - the pork cheeks, dulche de leche, and warm berry cake. The chef/owner walked around the dining room often to talk to customers and ask them how things were.

Now for the cons: 4/5 non-dessert items we ordered were extremely mediocre. The ceviche was ridiculously overpriced at $11 for something that didn't have any flavor or fish in it. I think I got two tiny pieces of fish and that's it. The most disappointing dish that night. The ravioli was under stuffed - very flat. The gnocchi and the sauce just didn't go together - and the gnocchi pieces were too small to get any flavor or texture. The lamb, veal, pork meatballs were unimpressive - I make better meatballs. All servings were TINY. I could count the number of prom cheek pieces on my plate, or the number of gnocchi. I know they're tapas, but I found the portions very ridiculously small. We ordered 7 things in total (including dessert) and paid close to $100 with tip for two people and I still went home feeling like I hadn't eaten anything. We ordered three rounds, but as we went on, we realized the food wasn't great, and we didn't want to waste money trying to get full there. 

If you're a small eater, maybe you will feel differently. If you have a large appetite, don't bother going here. The food did not blow me away at all.
