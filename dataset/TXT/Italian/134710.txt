Pistachios on the pizza. 
Some sort of delicious seed-thing (anise? coriander? i should know but i don't cook. it was yum) on the olives. 

And caramel on the chocolate chip cookie/vanilla ice cream dessert thing.

Combine this with that amazing glass of Argentinian white I had and you've got a pretty tasty treat. 

Humble Pie made a pretty inventive, attractive, tasty meal, and they didn't brag about it or anything. 

I'd totally go back.
