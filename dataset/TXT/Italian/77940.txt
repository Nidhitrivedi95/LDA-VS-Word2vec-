cZO6RmJcqRY9jGbYY71z-A They were out of some items, so we settled on the 'Uncle Frank', which says it serves 2-4 people.  There was enough food for the two of us, but no way would it serve 4!  We had to share the meatball and the tiny piece of sausage.  The salad was bland (except for a lot of onions!) and the bread is just ok.  The food was nothing special.  I asked for a glass of red wine and it was served warm !?!  
The owner, Mike, was loud and off-putting - he insisted on getting an egg cream for my fiance, even when he was told we really did not want one.  Then, he charged us for it, although we left it on the table!  We definitely won't go back.
