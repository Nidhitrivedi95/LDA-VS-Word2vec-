Ih0f0UyhFufm3C7kR72DSQ Outstanding and worth spending an evening.  The food was excellent with great selections!  Awesome for the Vegans!  I had some of the best pasta I have ever eaten in Cleveland.  Awesome wine selection!  The calamari was the best Calamari I have ever had -- a MUST!
The only down side I can say is if you think you can get in and out-- it takes hours -- it's an experience. 
The service was outstanding -- tables are a little to close together -- felt like this party of 4 was eating with us.  It is expensive but worth it -- perfect for the special occasions!
