93FVxoipAIYG07gisMOQhw We selected Zappone's to cater our wedding. We had several different places set up to try but after meeting with Dina we knew we had found the right place and cancelled our other appointments. Dina made us feel welcome, served us AMAZING food and has been more than helpful with menu selections and ideas. She even went by our venue to get an idea of set up and flow for the evening. We have eaten there many times as well and each time the food has been outstanding. Overall, they have gone above and beyond with wonderful customer service and great food. 5 stars for sure!!
