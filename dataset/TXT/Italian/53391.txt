A2aOwMcP0DxGPr2El7eifA Dined here for the first time with a huge group for a special occasion and it was pretty good.  Reservation was honoured although it seemed surprisingly unnecessary for a Saturday night.  Restaurant is spacious offering a view of the chef's kitchen.  Complimentary bread baskets with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette were a nice touch.  Menu had a colourful selection, perfect for my fickle and indecisive self...appetizers, salads, pastas, pizzas, steaks, seafood, etc.  Portions were incredibly generous, we were all very impressed.  Although we didn't go for the 3-course prix fixe menu, many at our table did and looks to be an awesome deal with still great portion sizes for under $30!  Worth a try!  The chef came out to our table as well so that was pretty neat!
