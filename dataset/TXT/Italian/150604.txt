It's a bit on the trendy side - loud music, very VERY comfy seats, and a menu that is a little above the ordinary fare you would usually find at other similar restaurants.   And, it's EXPENSIVE.

Two of us had lunch - chicken caesar salad, and sliders, and two cokes.   Total for both with tip - $60.

Was it worth it?  No.    But it was convenient and we figured by the time we went anywhere else and finally sat down it would be a while so we went for it.    We weren't sorry, and neither of us barked about the bill.   The hotel is expensive but you get the royal treatment - even at the coffee shop.

I'm a fan, but if you're looking for a deal - take a walk to Denny's across the street.
