bo4loBeLwkQqZ7HGrgxXRQ We went to this trattoria to celebrate my mom's birthday. We had a good time there. :) I love the pizza and the gnocchi. My mom really enjoyed the zucca agnolotti. I ordered a rigatoni bolognese, wasn't too impressed with it. I always love the vibe of little Italy. It's like dining in your Italian trattoria, relaxing, intimate and warm.
