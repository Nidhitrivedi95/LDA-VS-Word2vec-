DvxGK4R1_0LR9837DCOZXg Hello All,

I would highly encourage all thinking of eating here to run away.  The pizza was ok but everything else I got was a joke.   We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, 20 hot wings (extra crispy) and garlic cheese bread.

Like I was saying the pizza was ok, but everything else was gross.  The wings were extra small and seems to be drenched in vinegar.  Also, I asked for extra crispy not burnt.  Garlic cheese bread I think not.  All we got was sub bread cut in half with melted provolone cheese.  I gagged when I bit it.

The service is horrible!!!  The store forgot to make the garlic cheese bread so as we had dinner we had to wait for our last item.  When we realized it was gone I had to chase the drive down to let them know.  Calling the store I found out they are not customer centric at all.  The first guy on the phone seem to have no cares at all that a new customer was having a bad time.  When I asked for the manager, he came to phone, listen to me for like a minute, and began to have a very rude and loud tone.  I could tell right away the manager AL came to the phone ready to fight and not looking to see why one of their customers were calling back about their order.  After arguing with him about his tone instead of being genuine about an apology he just kept saying what do you want me to do and offered me more DELICIOUS cheese bread.  My family did not have any money except on my PayPal account.  We used this site;

You put your zip code in and it gives you options and you can pay using PayPal.  I am telling you this because I had no idea the distance this places was from my home.  I figured we were ok because they came up in the results.  The manager AL literally started saying DO I EVEN HAVE ANY IDEA HOW FAR THEY ARE FROM ME.  It was like I did something wrong!?

WILL NEVER EAT HERE OR RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!!!

RUN!RUN!RUN!
