N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg Holy crap!!! I went here on a  Saturday afternoon and the line was way out the door.  I heard people being told there was a one hour wait time--in 114 degree heat!!  Good thing I called my order in--an hour ago and it is still not ready.  $26 for a 12  incher!  It was good enough but there was no seasoning thus no real taste.  I DO NOT like the crust which is like a breakfast biscuit--dry with no taste.  Made worse by the fact it was still raw--they pulled it out of the oven too soon--it was a busy day.  I was going to complain to the manager but oh well--there were enough goodies in this deep dish to make me happy.  I might go back but if you do better make sure it is on an off day.  Going  here on  the  weekend is a nightmare!!!
