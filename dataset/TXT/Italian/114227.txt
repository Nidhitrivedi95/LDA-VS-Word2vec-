gKPGer8_b532vRzEjsXQxA I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars.  Food: 4.5 stars.  Service: 3 stars.  Atmosphere: 3 stars.  Price: 2.5 stars.  

So here's the deal.  The food was delicious.  Really solid Italian food.  I would go back just for the spinach artichoke dip with pepperoni.  Pepperoni in spinach artichoke dip?!  It was perfect.

But the waitress, who was nice enough, was *really* aggressive about upselling, and even kind of insulted my husband because he didn't want to pay an extra $5 for chicken in his entree.  Wow--chill.  She tried to upsell us at literally every point in the meal, including drinks and dessert (not a surprise).  I've never had someone be so persistent, and it made the meal kind of uncomfortable, to be honest.

Atmosphere is nothing great, but it's not dirty or grimy.  It's just got an old cafe/diner vibe, and it's fine, I suppose.

It ended up costing about $55 (pre-tip) for two people, and it definitely felt high.  We got a regular drink and one Italian soda, one appetizer, and two entrees (without the extras).  The food was good, but I would have felt better about it if it were a little cheaper.
