I started with eggs Benedict and banana foster French toast and then jumped into lunch food. The salmon pasta and the beef Gorgonzola pastas both were delicious. My brother and father enjoyed the prime rib. They offered endless mimosas and bloody Mary's however since I was traveling I did not get to sample. I finished with dessert and fresh fruit. Would definitely go back if I were ever in Madison again.
