Tn1KXPi4gtPrt6DyepUQzw Pizza for my kiddos for lunch on a half day of school for $10 for a large cheese!  Yes Please!  Ordered online to pick up after I picked up the kids and it was ready and waiting.  They downed a large in about 15 mins, so I guess they liked it!  I had about a half a piece and it was indeed good, but I'm all about the veggies on mine!

Love online ordering and drive through pickup.  Not the best pizza in the world, of course, but it was fast, affordable and just right for today!
