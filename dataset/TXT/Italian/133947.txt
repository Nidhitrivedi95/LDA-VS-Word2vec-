IQ3esF7MvIOCbeVetW51Ng Going to a restaurant is an experience. The enjoyment of food is more than just the straight up taste - the smell, the ambiance, and the service all matter.

Unfortunately our trip was a disaster. Not only did it take them roughly 45 minutes to seat us (from the initial estimate of 15-20m), but the food took over an hour to arrive.

This is no exaggeration - we were given complimentary dumplings (nice gesture, except half of our party has been diagnosed with celiac disease), and our other appetizers were also comped. But we were repeatedly told that our food would just be out... I felt like a scene from The Princess Bride where you want to say "you keep using that word but I don't think you know what it means."

The food itself was simply OK. I had the chicken taco bowl, and it was about eh as it comes - the chicken was dry, the veggies were haphazard.

I really wanted to like this place, but it simply did not deliver (the waitstaff WAS still very nice).
