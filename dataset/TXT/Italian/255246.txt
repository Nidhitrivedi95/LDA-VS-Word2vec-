VYLQ3bMCqmHiNO2FS8aAsg I like to order from this place when I get pizza to go, I have never used their delivery service so I cannot comment on that.  I usually order their x large peperoni and pick it up.  it is only 12.50 plus tax.  the crust is thin and crisp with some chew, sauce is tasty, the peperoni is what you would expect and they actually put enough cheese on the pizza so you can taste the cheese...  If you like thin crust NY style pizza you can't go wrong here.
