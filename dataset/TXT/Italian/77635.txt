cZAU9Gs-rIv8DvsVp3qUTw We just moved into our new house in Peoria so we thought we would check these guys out (we hadn't unpacked our kitchen yet).  

We tried the oven baked Turkey Sub and Chicken Parmesan sub first.  Then a couple of nights later we got Pizza on their Monday special (BOGO free).  Both were very good.  The bread on the subs was excellente!

Also, delivery time was quicker than expected.

Looking forward to try new things.
