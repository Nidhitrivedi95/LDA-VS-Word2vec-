hgQOESYp7CF4LnNI90XEiw I stayed at the SLS for four nights, and I can't get enough of this place! The ingredients are fresh and the service is outstanding and very accommodating. All three bases are very refreshing and tasty, and the truffle cheese bread was definitely worth the price. And you gotta get their gelato for a bit of dessert. No complaints here!
