SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg Have been here for dinner and brunch. We were seated outside for dinner and we tried several of the dishes, being tapas style portions are small and meant to be shared. We ordered a couple of the pizettes, veggie and seafood pasta and most were great. The dessert menu was not very exciting.  My brunch review gives high marks for the view again, inside but we could still see the water show.  We had a reservation, but still waited nearly a half hour to be seated, guess they were trying to push bar purchases, but highly annoyed with a half hour wait having a reservation to only be seated inside. Food selections were very good off the menu.  Brunch service was poor. Our waiter forgot to bring the pastry basket, we had to ask, while other guests next to us that we're seated after us had another waiter, and ordered and had food, plus pastry basket long before we did.  We had to ask for several things as the meal comtinued as the waiter was either over extended in the service area or was just having a bad day.  I would recommend dinner for sure at Lago. For brunch, I would have some hesitations about going back as a local with all the other brunch options in Vegas based on Lago's poor service and having to wait so long with a reservation.
