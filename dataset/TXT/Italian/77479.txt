cy3Or8iSsDOmHBBu2MwnOg I wanted to love this place, really love this place, but it just wouldn't let me. There was something off, not too bad, but just off. People were nice, food was as good as other Italian places (except Portofino's of course). The service was good, the line wasn't too long. Anyway,it's in a nice spot, around the corner from Williams and Sonoma. So a little shopping and a little dinner. Maybe more shopping than dinner.
