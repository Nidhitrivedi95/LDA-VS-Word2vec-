SXgVJz5aIvbeCXWvg0ZuNg I love their pizza. It is always delicious and creative. Their beer selection is good. Standard craft brands, with the occasional surprise. The only reason I did not say four stars is because their hostesses are young,  inexperienced and unhelpful. They are the first people you encounter and I have never had a positive experience. Once one told me "good luck" at finding a place at the bar during a game day. I understand, but maybe try a little finesse? The food helps me overlook the irritation caused by their hostess staff.
