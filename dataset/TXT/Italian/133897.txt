IQ3esF7MvIOCbeVetW51Ng I visited Harvest Kitchen on a Friday evening for a late dinner. The main floor dining area wasn't too busy but my friend and I wanted to sit on the patio, which had a bit of a wait. After maybe 10 or 15 minutes we were taken to our table on the upstairs back patio, which is unreal, it's like being in a friend's backyard. There are a lot of options on the menu for meat-eaters and non-meat-eaters alike. My friend and I decided to share the Mushroom French Fry "Salad" and both agreed that it was very good. I got the Southern North American Bowl and my friend got the Green Curry Bowl and we both enjoyed our mains. The atmosphere is very relaxed and I would love to go back to try their brunch one day.
