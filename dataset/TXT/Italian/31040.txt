5nZVVPO_cYH9aQeClTP9zA Came here for lunch on my 20th birthday and they gave us a free dessert if we signed up with alerts with an email!

I ordered The Italian Panini, my cousin had the Quinoa salad (not sure what it was called), and my other cousin actually ordered a pesto pasta (not on the menu, they basically take mac and cheese pasta and put pesto in it instead). My panini was good, but it was better refrigerated when I got home and got to add ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise and all that! ;p 

I loved the banana peppers in the panini. My cousin's salad was alright, I'm not a huge fan of quinoa so I didn't care for it much but my cousin didn't like it too much- she didn't finish it or bother packing it to take home. 

My other cousin finished her pesto salad, I tried some and initially I thought it was bland but she gave me another part of it which was super flavorful, so just make sure to mix it evenly throughout. 

We got the pizza cookie for our free dessert and they used a vanilla gelato on top of our chocolate chip cookie that wasn't cooked in a little pan. It was delicious. Great service, as well. The food is delivered to your table and all the workers come up to check on you even though it almost is self-serve. 

Had a great first time at sauce and the staff were patient and initiated conversation. The prices aren't too bad either. My panini was $8 but I can't remember the rest of the bill because I didn't pay attention, haha.
