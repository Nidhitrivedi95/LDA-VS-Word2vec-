RyTEGJz5tG7zC73BdXt-cQ Great find. Good food
Enjoyed a fantastic pizza.  (Ask for it to be well done)

Served hot and fast

Veal sandwich was good too. Could have used a bit more sauce and it would have been great

Caesar Salad was fantastic!

Super friendly service. Owner greeted us personally from the back which was a nice touch. 

I would come back.
