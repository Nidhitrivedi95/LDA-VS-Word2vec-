YV2UPfovJZVKSEQjgTdbpA I might mirror one of the other reviews commenting the decor is dated, but I would add immaculate, and that is the only imaginable complaint.

We ordered take out while traveling through and staying at the airport. EXCELLENT food!!! Portions were right prices were right, and we loved the food.

There are some places in a neighborhood that just do things right without pretense. Off the beaten track, but easily worth the stop.
