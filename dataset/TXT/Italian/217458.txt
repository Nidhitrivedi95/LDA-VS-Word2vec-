RZdrNayqoUjovdoJ4GWe-Q Rosatis was my go to for pizza...the cheese was always a golden brown on top just how I like it, other places I have to ask to make my pizza well done to get that. But not today..order my pizza, get home and open the box to sooo much cheese it slid off on the drive home, not browned at all and frankly appeared not done. Disappointed, I go back with the pizza. I open the box to show the guy working and he says "wow what happened, I did not give you the pizza that way it had to have happened on your drive home". Told him that's not why I was bringing it back but it was not cooked well on top and that is not the standard I'm used to from them. He proceeds to call the cook out front when I tell him I don't need to see the cook but to just refund my money as I was disappointed with the pizza. He then says I'll refund your money but I'm not giving u a discount on your next order. At this point I tell him no problem and his comment was "how about this, how about you never order from here again". All while another customer is waiting for their food. 
Seriously? Because I'm voicing a complaint one time while I've been ordering from there for years? I'm blown away that someone in customer service would make a comment like that and lose business. I will say their food has gone downhill and not what it used to be but, WOW. 
If you want great pizza and customer service, make the short drive and go to Vito's!!
