H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g Went to Otto Enoteca Pizzeria last weekend and had to say it was the worst dinner we have had in Las Vegas.  From the minute we got there the waiters were rude and the manager was worse.  The music was so loud in the back wine room and when my husband who is not at all picky asked they turn it down they said No because  Mario Batali wants it loud -not that he was there but that is how it HAD to be. After even the manager refused to turn it down since we did not want to cause a further scene, we ordered spaghetti and meatballs (easy right) It was very small and dry- looked like it came out of a can.  Meatballs were gross! Very dissaponting for the money.  Also had pasta puttenesca that was more of a tasteless paste then a puttenesca sauce.  I would never go back!  Sorry that I had recommended to friends- we were all disappointed.  Even the wine was bad.

Stunk!
