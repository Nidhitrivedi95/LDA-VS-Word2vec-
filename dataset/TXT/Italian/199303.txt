pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Pizza was real good but the whole place is a hassle! They're seemingly open 10 hours a month and when u r lucky enough to get in there u feel like u gotta hurry up and eat so the next group can get in there. It's like something straight off of Seinfeld. 
The pizza was good. I like there toppings. Not the usual fair, more of a step up. However as I drove away it took a while to get the black soot taste out of my mouth from the bottom of the pizza. 
Great food but too much of a hassle to return.
