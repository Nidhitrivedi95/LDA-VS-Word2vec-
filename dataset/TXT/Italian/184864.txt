OilKQPdBj3rD7eZDF5OENQ I have to admit - I was always a bit snobbish about Pizza Express, thinking it would just be fiull of screaming kids, and the pizza would be boring and tasteless. So I haven't been for a long long time. Then one cold November evening, I found myself in Deanhaugh Street (as you do) and decided to go to Pizza Express there. AND: I was pleasantly surprised - yes there were a few kids running around, but the pizza (I had the Soho) was extremely tasty! This particular branch is very nice, service is prompt, wine is drinkable - what more do you want? Just stay clear of the over-lit basement.
