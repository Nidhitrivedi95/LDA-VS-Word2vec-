3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A Of all international wine genres and cuisine types, I looove Italian wines (especially somewhat obscure, high quality kinds, which E.S. is overflowing with) and homestyle rustic fare, and this hits the mark on all fronts. 

I had a taster of Lambrusco di Castelvetro with cured BC albacore tuna & heirloom tomato salad, both extremely deelish, followed by Fanti Rosso di Montalcino with a superbly toothsome fettucini cooked with Port-marinated chicken livers, sage and pecorino; then for dessert a Moscato d'Asti from one of my fave Piemontese wineries, La Spinetta. 

My date had a really good spaghetti cacio & pepe paired with a Frascati that matched excellently, and we shared a surreal sticky toffee pudding a la mode. 

Very kind (almost too kind!) and attentive service to boot makes this experience "cinque stellas" for me.
