It's worth it to be a little dressy when brunching here, it's well decorated and the space is open. We sat at the bar and the service was prompt and the staff was attentive and friendly. The mimosas come in an array of fruity flavors, made from a fruit puree, and it is worth trying. The coffee is also freshly brewed and strong. 

The salmon spread bagel was really delicious! The portion and presentation was perfect and the fresh fruit on the side balanced the meal. My husband got the eggs Benedict and the poached eggs were perfectly cooked. The bacon also needs a special mention.
