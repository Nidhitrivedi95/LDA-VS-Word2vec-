skQ-HIR664Ivp2-A4kOfnA We wanted to try something new and thought we would give this place a shot.  Unfortunately it was a hot mess.   There is no authenticity here except for the environment.   The food tasted and looked like it was prepared in a microwave.   Completely lacked flavor and appeal.   We will not return at anytime.
