ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw I got a chance to dine in Mama Santa's and the the wait was nearly an hour...if the weather is nice it's worth the wait and the stroll around Little Italy to check out the ethnic village...if not your stuck in the rain or in a crammed hall way. The pizza is high quality with generous portions, I also enjoyed the manicotti and homemade meatballs.  This is a great family spot with an old school dining experience. Try and ask for a booth as the tables are similar to school desks. Great food, 3rd or 4th generation Italian spot for every walk of life.
