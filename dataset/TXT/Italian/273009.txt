We had reservations..which was ambiguously handled the staff. We ended up sitting outside and it was great. Andy, the owner, came over and talked to us about the wine list etc. and then a young boy took our order. I was glad we didn't have plans afterward because the service was very slow. The food was fantastic! I loved it and would go back on a day I had a lot of time.
