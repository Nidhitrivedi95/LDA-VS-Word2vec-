2I7QtHJI-izdThjghMaT1g Cafe Toscano is officially on the list of places that I will be going at least once a year.  Out of all the Italian places we have been in the Cleveland area from Little Italy to Giovanni's in Beachwood, Cafe Toscano is in the conversation for best Italian food in Cleveland.

We tried the crusted Arancini appetizer which was really great.  It was like a ball of rice and mozzarella cheese breaded, fried, and topped with a Pomodoro sauce and more cheese shavings.  I am not doing the description much justice.  Be warned though, it is a heavy appetizer that could leave you full before you order the main dish.

That also reminds me. Toscano isn't for diners in a hurry, which is great.  They were in no rush to take our entree order, preferring to give us our drinks, get the appetizers ordered and take our time eating those before delivering the soup (me) and salad (wife.)  The pace of the meal was just right between the courses.

For the main course, I decided to keep it simple after the heavy appetizer. I got their spaghetti and handmade meatballs.  The pasta tasted really really fresh, the sauce was good, and the meatball was really good.  My wife had the lobster ravioli served alla vodka with shrimp and scallops.  I don't do seafood, but it all looked great.  The vodka was thick and full of spices.

We didn't stay for dessert on this visit, but I am sure we will sometime in the future.  

Anyway, I give this place a rave review.  The service was great.  The atmosphere was great.  The buildout of this restaurant with the dark woods and stone walls is classy and modern.  If I had one small complaint it is that this place was a bit loud.  Then again, it was really busy on a Thursday night, so that says something positive anyway.  

Above all, the food was great.  It tasted really really fresh, and despite my ordering the most boring dish on their menu (which was still tasty,) they have a lot of very inspired dishes on the menu.
