aJU9eRgtY6wH-5m7a6ZeEA I came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend. He found this place while he was searching for a nice restaurant.  Indeed, it was a great choice! He made reservations on the same week, and good thing he did because several people were turned away that Saturday night!

AMBIANCE: The ambiance had dim lighting, and it was a cozy little restaurant hidden away in the plaza near Longo's. The waitstaff were very friendly and attentive.

FOOD: I had ordered the sirloin steak and my boyfriend had ordered a full rack of lamb. Both were delicious and well-cooked. The lamb was just divine! Didn't taste gamey and it was so tender. We also ordered the grilled calamari as an appetizer, but it wasn't anything special. In fact, it was hard to chew because they hadn't removed all of the connective tissue from the squid. There also weren't many pieces of it considering it was $13.99. The bread and humus that they serve was tasty though.

Overall, with appetizer, meals, and two beers, the total came to ~$101. It was a great birthday dinner!
