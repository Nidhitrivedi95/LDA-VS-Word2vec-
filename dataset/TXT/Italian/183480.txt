oejQ4bWsJaKszf98xjNrrg This pizza is nothing special. Its actually not good at all. I decided to give it a try since the reviews were pretty good, but my experience was anything but. They are very busy and I guess a lot of people like them, but I find their pizza nothing to boast about. The cheese was bland, not enough sauce and the toppings were minimal and it was expensive. Not worth the money in my opinion.
