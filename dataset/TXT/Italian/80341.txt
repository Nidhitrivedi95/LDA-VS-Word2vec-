d5n5CsoJNu-tKEbfI6U3tA Went there with my friends and family on a Saturday. Granted it was busy. However 20 minutes after ordering we are told that one of the dishes is not available. The waiter never came back to refill our water, breadsticks or salad. I had to get up and get the water jug from the server station and serve myself! He also never bothered to get our appetizer or salad plates off of the table. We just stack them in the corner   After 40 minutes our food had not arrived at the table and the server asked us if we wanted our check??? WTH???? Needless to say we walked out. Lazy lazy lazy.  If you don't want to serve why be a server.
