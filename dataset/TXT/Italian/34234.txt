6bVEM9jD-mpU4WNXcJ9tHA I've ordered from here several times and each time I go on yelp to make another order, I'm a bit skeptical because of several bad reviews. However, they have never disappointed me.

Their spinach white pizza is AMAZING. I always get my order around 40-50 min as expected and the food is delivered hot. Definitely my favorite pizza spot!
