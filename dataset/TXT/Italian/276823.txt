yGd87bkFijZ6YHrHtW5maA We finally got a chance to try this little place out. Not sure if minors can go here as restaurant is inside a neighborhood bar.
This place get a 10 for its value priced menu. I love pad Thai and was very pleased as my plate was only $7 and I thoroughly loved it. The Tom yum soup (with coconut milk) was a solid 8. I would definitely eat here again as it's not too far a drive for me. Reasonable prices and great service from our waitress.
