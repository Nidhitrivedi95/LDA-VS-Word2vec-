1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag Breakfast was decent. It's $9.99 for the breakfast special but $4.50 for coffee. That's how they get you, I guess. They have 3 highchair and all of them have a broken strap. So you can bring your kid but they can't sit safely. I don't think our waitress was particularly interested in serving us and the wait was long for a pretty empty morning. But I did like the way she interacted with my son, so that was nice. Overall, it was an average breakfast at best.
