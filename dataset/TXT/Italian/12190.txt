0uwQIGlKICIYuRtayVnh7g I LOVED Piada when it first opened and I still really enjoy their food. They have really great quality meats and the pasta is so perfectly al dente that I can't help but crave their food every once in a while. The toppings are also really really great. They have multiple types of cheeses and the number of veggies makes sure that everyone can have a little something that they like. 

However, since their opening, the prices have gone up and the quantity of food has gone down. They used to have a get two deal - a small pasta bowl and a small piada. Now, you can only either get the pasta or a small piada with side salad. No more combining the two. Also, they used to have fresh mozarella! Not anymore (must be too expensive to keep). I don't like it when businesses seem to offer great deals and then take them away once they have lured in their customers. Would have really liked it if they could keep those great deals on their menu. 

Still, not a bad place to go for only 7 dollars.
