rZvBlC4yHQZtodZBsxb3nw Went for lunch and really was not impressed. I had their lunch special which was salad and a small 8" pizza for 9 bucks. Not really a deal in my book. I had the Buffalo Chicken pizza (their special for the day) and the pizza crust tasted like cardboard. Their house salad was drowning in balsamic and oil. I could barely taste any of the great toppings on the salad. 

The only reason I gave this place two stars was because the staff was friendly and prompt.
