The pizza could have been a little hotter but they put it back in the oven for a few minutes and it was fine. Pizza sauce needed a bit more flavor but all in all I was satisfied. Pauline our server was friendly and efficient. The only other issue, and it's minor, is the napkins are a bit thin so you have to use more of them. Will go again.
