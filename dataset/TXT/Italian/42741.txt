7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw I had a hard time trying to figure out what to order because so many things looked delicious on the menu. 

We started with the grilled artichoke. Wow! Amazing! They grill it with truffle oil and some parm. The dipping sauce was a lemon aioli. I could have eaten 5 of those things! It was delicious. 

For lunch I had the burger wrapped in lettuce! It had melted fontina, tomato jam, grilled onions and a perfectly cooked medium rare patty! It was served with a side of "crispy potatoes" (these delicious crispy potatoes with some sort of cheese roasted on top) . I would order a side of those just because they are delicious! 

I rounded out the meal with the Nutella trifle and a coffee... Enough said. 

The servers were amazing! Not only were they nice but they also had great menu suggestions. One told me I reminded him of Penelope Cruz so he gets an A+ in my book ;) . 

Perfect place to drop into for a meal during a shopping day!
