iLLzOJLU4tPAN9UUHlyZiQ Nice way to start off in Gilbert.  Interesting menu and very tasty, tho definitely on the pricier side.  I hope they'll copy the brunch menu from Virtu very soon.  Biggest downside: music too loud.  No, it doesn't have to be eardrum popping, even tho they think so at Postino down the street.  A nice restaurant can have ambience without a racket coming from the speakers!  Low level background, if you must.  Even better - none!  A great restaurant shouldn't have to distract its customers!
