TPvVGmT4AY1mloktV-2Dpw I have never gotten anything at La Famiglia that was not delicious. The pepperoni rolls are awesome and even better with cheese. I often get the tortellini, baked ziti, pizza, or chicken dishes. They have always been open to substitutions, e.g. different sauce than on the menu. I prefer loaf bread to the focaccia-style breadsticks they serve, but they are still good. My husband always orders extra garlic in his dish. The servers and hosts are always nice too.
