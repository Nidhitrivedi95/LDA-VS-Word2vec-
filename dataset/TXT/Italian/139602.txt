jG1jcAeDw0pZTHCNC5kw_w Went there for a salad today, salad was wonderful.....but was quickly ruined by the site of a cockroach crawling on the wall.  A couple seconds later one was crawling on our table.  Granted there was some construction going on next door, and the door was open, so maybe they just came in from outside.  It doesn't help that the place is very dusty inside, makes you think the bugs are justifiable.  Too grossed out to go back.
