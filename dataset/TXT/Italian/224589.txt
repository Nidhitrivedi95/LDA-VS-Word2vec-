sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg Can a vegetarian enjoy a joint that specializes in meatballs? The answer is yes. The restaurant provides a vegetarian largely bean based meatball and plenty of vegetarian friendly sauces to go with it that are marked as vegetarian so you can be clear. You can get it in a traditional sandwich type way or have it with their extensive sides such as mac and cheese, penne, risotto, or a quinoa. I had mine with the pesto almond sauce and Gouda cheese. Very delicious. The parmesan fries are really delicious as well served with an awesome aioli dip. 

Sierra Mercato is three levels technically. The top floor is a rooftop bar type setting filled with unwinding young professionals for the most part. It is quite nice, but does not have the same menu as downstairs. The wait time is usually pretty long. My recommendation is to have a drink on the rooftop from the bar and use the Nowait App to get a seat downstairs and enjoy their delicious food that is not available upstairs. They do have small plates upstairs though. 2nd floor bar/restaurant is not open yet. Oh and PS, the prices are pretty reasonable considering the cultural district location and "nice" ambiance.
