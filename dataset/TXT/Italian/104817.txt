fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ All was Okay until a table of 8 were seated at lunchtime. After waiting for someone to come around to get us more water or mimosas, I saw our server now at the beck 'n call of the larger( among other characteristics) table. Time went by, the mngr on duty asked if everything was okay, I requested a box & the check. Had to walk to the hostess table to get the attention of someone, to pay.  How presumptive of her to think we didn't notice this had gone on. I could presume myself this sour behavior had much to do with size of party, race, age- all while assuming they will leave behind a good tip, and me and my companion won't, based on characteristics of the opposite. Foul.
