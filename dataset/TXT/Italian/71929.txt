cbddL2q8uRA38RwycB0FJg Nice 1/2 off wines by the glass on Mondays. My boyfriend and I did the pick your own pasta, sauce, toppings. We both chose the agli oilio which needed roasted garlic for more flavor. I had the matalda pasta which was new for me and it was excellent with sun dried tomatoes. 
Service was ok and was short staffed in our opinion. We sat on the patio but next time will opt for the dining room. We thought the value was good for what we got. I'll go back next time I'm in the area.
