dLRJhdnelmOXRa3WeeTbnQ Overpriced. Lousy attention to detail. I ordered delivery at 11 PM. 1145 the driver called me and asked me why I wasn't at the Hilton. I had told the person who took my order that I was at the Holiday Inn and she read back the correct address for the holiday Inn. $26 for veal parm a styrofoam cup of side salad, and a coke. The food quality was a little better than Sbarro at the rest area the mall. At that time of night I was happy to have it. By the time it got to the right hotel it was still warm but not hot. The veal was tough and covered with a gooey glob of cheese. I know how tough it was because the cheap fork couldn't handle it. No knife was provided. I had to use my hands to tear it apart and it was not an easy task, far from tender. The sauce was not sweet, which I appreciated, too many places think sweet sauce is a thing. Any kind of Italian flavor was pretty muted. More robust garlic could be had at Olive Garden. Italian dressing was better than Kraft but not as zesty as Newman's. After eating this meal with a flimsy fork and my fingers, I was also pleased to discover that no napkins had been provided. No prices were viewable on Yelp's display of their website. 

2 stars for being ok at 11pm when most better options were closed.
