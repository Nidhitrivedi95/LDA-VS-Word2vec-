Wonderful and efficient service with knowledgeable staff.  We had a hard time deciding what to eat after perusing their menu full of locally sourced and creative dishes.  We ended up sharing the fattoush salad and roasted whole chicken wings - which ended up being plenty for two.  The fattoush salad was wonderfully refreshing and unique.  The chicken wings had a bit of heat and the meat was quite tender.  Would've loved to try dessert or their coffee bar located next to the patio if we had more time.  Truly an inspired menu - would love to try some of their other dishes another time.
