kHWSO8fV0Mp-M3J-w1ma7A Walked in after looking for food on a Sunday evening around 9 pm when most places were closed or closing. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and the staff were very friendly. We ordered a calzone and the pollo lasagna. Both dishes were great. The calzone was huge with a great tomato sauce and flaky crust, while the pollo lasagna was thin, but had a great cheese sauce along with grilled chicken and pancetta. Overall positive experience.
