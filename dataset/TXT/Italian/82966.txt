dGuRCJV66l-K7flfrwEgaA Nothing but kind words for this place. We live around the corner so have frequented plenty of times. Amazing tiramisu, awesome pizza (ask for extra chili sauce on the side), perfect (and I mean PERFECT) take away sourdough. They carry a few Italian groceries. Oh man the mushroom salad. Insane. Honestly. So so worth it. They have mon-wed pizza specials and cheap wine all the time!
