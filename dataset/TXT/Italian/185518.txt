oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ I adore this place. The food is wonderful and the ambiance is a good blend of urban and intimate. I've been to both their Miami locations and their Toronto locations and they seem to deliver consistently across the board. You really can't go wrong with Cibo - unless you dislike Italian food and wine, but even that's a stretch!
