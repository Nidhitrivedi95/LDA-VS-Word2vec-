NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ We came here with a small group.  Our reservations were early since we were seeing a show at the hotel.  They were very patient with us as we had some guests arrive late, but still got us out in time to see our show.  

The salads are big.  One ceasar was enough to feed 2+ people.  The entrees are also big enough to share, and the appetizers are easily a meal.  My hubby and I shared a pasta dish with pork.  It was excellent.

We would definitely go back.
