The friendly staff quickly put together a table for 10 and accommodated our request for separate checks. The service was well paced and friendly throughout. 

As far as I could tell, there aren't separate lunch and dinner menus. The fare is a little heavy and pricey for lunch. 

My girlfriend and I shared the baked mushroom and artichoke appetizer. It had sliced mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and tomatoes baked in a white wine broth topped with melty mozzarella on top. The flavor was really nice and yummy with the French bread to soak up the juice. The bread is plain french served slightly warmed with those foil wrapped pats of butter. I'll admit...cold butter that tears apart your soft bread is on of my pet peeves. Room temp the butter before serving people! 

Next, we shared the eggplant Parmesan ($13.99). The entree came with a salad. It had romaine lettuce, tomatoes, crispy wonton noodles ?? and  a vinaigrette. We were perplexed by the Asian element. So strange, like they ran out of croutons. The salad was fine. No complaints. The eggplant parmesan came with three eggplant slices and penne. The eggplant was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. The whole plate was oversauced and the sauce was a little sweet for my preference. The pasta was cooked nicely.  Once again, it was good. 

The bill was $30 ish for 2 drinks, appetizer,  and entree. $37 with tip. We were both stuffed. 

All in all, its good. No complaints. Will meet your expectations for basic Italian food.
