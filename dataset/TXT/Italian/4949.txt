_myTPlWa8QRN5eavs-hNPg Pacinos has great food and friendly service.  Went last night to hear Journey and more tribute show. Was disappointed that there wasn't much of Journey being sung by David Alcantar. He does a great job as Steve Perry.
Felt like I was watching and hearing the Wedding Singer. More Journey David!
