pEFO_hU3DNA61XnIpVGkJQ We placed an order for delivery last weekend--large pepperoni pizza, baked ziti with eggplant, and calamari. Everything was great, especially for a delivery place. The pizza ranks up there among my favorites in Phoenix. The pasta was also very good--my wife especially loved it. The calamari was pretty darn good also (this comes from someone who dislikes seafood). Delivery only took about 40 minutes on a Saturday night. All in all I highly recommend this place. I'm giving it four stars, but if I compare it to other places offering delivery, that would move up to a five.
