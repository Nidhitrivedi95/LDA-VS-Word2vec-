nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg Well first, the gentleman poured me an exquisite glass of chianti. The soup was made of beans and pasta. It was so well done it made me want to cry.  The bread was served with a tough pepper mill and balsamic and oil that was perfect. I ordered the ink and squid. Gotta say, Le mussels were perfect. The dyed pasta was al dente and delicious. I had a mug of Italian coffee. Perfect. I savoured a hazelnut liqueur and waited for the food to settle.  The bill wad affordable. While seeming a high end restaurant, the price and the flavor did not match. I expected it to be much more expensive. I would have paid more. I sat there a many while moments contiplating before getting a gin straight up and dirty. Great service to the end. The maestro had no problem sending me hone with extra bread. Well done. I will come back soon.
