CUGswyxGdkcd4IE1oHc80A okay this was the second attempt at this place! 

FYI if you're coming here after a Toronto FC MLS match be prepared to wait as this joint can get crowded.  I must say the second time around Bar Vespa prevailed and is now in my good books, perhaps it was the efficiency of the waitress we had, and w/out her this place would fall to shambles....... Since my buddy and I wanted to hit as many bars without getting wasted we decided to have some drinks and food, and its off to the next venue! 

For food, he had the Tuscan Fries, and as always it was delish. 
I on the other hand ordered their Calamari Frite, which was risk that paid off well!!! 
I've had calamari at other places, but Vespa makes it unique.  Perfected fried, and not a lot of breaded batter (which most places tend to do)  The light, not overwhelming marinara sauce complimented the dish! and I was definitely impressed! for drinks my buddy had a beer, and I resorted to their 60z... NOT 9oz glass of red...............
