4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg My family and I ate here twice during our Christmas vacation. We actually ended up eating here on Christmas day because the buffet line was like three hours long. No way were we going to wait that long. We were able to make reservations for around 6pm and when we arrived, we were seated right away.

The ambiance of this place is awesome and the service that we received both nights was impeccable. The first night I just went with the standard lasagna dish and it was spot on. Very delicious and filling. The second night I got the Ravioli dish and while very good, it wasn't that filling.

Everyone in my party ordered a variety of food from steaks to pasta to soups and salads. Everything was delicious. There was not one single dish that wasn't fully enjoyed. I will definitely be coming back here again on my next visit.
