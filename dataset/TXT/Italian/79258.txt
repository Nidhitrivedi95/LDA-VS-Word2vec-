D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg Being in Vegas during the busy first few weeks of January, my friends and I thought about how we'd get into the Playboy Club and circumvent the line. My secret, eating at the connecting overpriced restaurant! 

The view is spectacular, that's what I seem to remember the most. Oh yea, and those espresso martinis that eventually led to me jumping into a pool fully clothed at a private party. 

Food - averagish Italian food. Massive portions. Seriously, like every other place in Veags, they dish out TONS of food. Probably only need to order 2 appetizers and one entree for three people... at least for 3 females. 

After dinner, we slipped one of the managers a twenty and were whisked right into the Club, no line! 

Nothing quite like getting in the backdoor at the Playboy Club.
