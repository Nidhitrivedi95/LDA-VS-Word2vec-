Grr2wJ3nYD_7qUyespDglA The veal is very good - top 2 in the city for sure! That alone gives this place a 4/5. But the Arancini, the fries, the toppings...this place is the real deal. I have not even mentioned how great the service is, I started coming here frequently for lunch a few months ago, but on my first day I know how much the owner cared about servicing his customers; A very important trait to have when being an entrepreneur, this place has it. When coming here for the first time - id get the Italian side. The Greek is good but the Italian side is better.
