Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA After a lot of hype about Federal I was excited to try it. The restaurant was nicely decorated and laid out, we sat on the patio which was pretty noisy and had to fight some flies. I asked about the wine coolers and the waitress responded with "i hate them" I probed further and she indicated she didn't care for sweet but I was a bit surprised by her bluntness. We shared a ceasar salad which was a great portion size and very tasty (perhaps a bit salty) and a pizza with Shriner's sausage (yum) and gorgonzola. The pizza was good, one of the better ones I have had in Central Phoenix but not the best. I would come back and will probably sit inside or order through the cute drive -thru.
