I dine here regularly and the fresh food never disappoints. As a Yorkville restaurant, it is an amazing value as the portions are quite large and the cuisine is amazing Italian fare with flare. The wait staff is very knowledgeable. If you have not been to Toni B., give it a try!  
A very enjoyable time and interesting dining experience. 
I may suggest that music would be a nice accompaniment.
