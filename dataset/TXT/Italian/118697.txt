GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ I almost always stay at the Venetian so this new restaurant was a must try for me. It was conveniently located near the sports book room where i like to hang out at. I came in with a rather big group. The staff wasn't necessarily top notch or anything, especially since we were a big group. I decided to get the BOTTOM BURNER BURGER. It was DELICIOUS! So good that I had to order another one before I left Vegas. If you like a spicy burger you're sure to like this bottom burner! It has some jalapeno pesto sauce on it and another sauce, but the point is that they make a mean burger!! I also ate some fries and a Bloody Mary. Fries were fries, nothing too special. The blood Mary was spicy and very good.

Overall: This spot is in the Venetian and is a must try if you're anywhere near the area.
