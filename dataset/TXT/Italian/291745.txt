zzmIMvqiBJ_-wVKg_OnGpw I was traveling to town for business and stumbled upon this Italian gem! We had a party of six so we called for a reservation at 7pm on a Thursday night, highly recommend as the place was pretty busy. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is authentic Italian/vineyard feel. The tables are set close together for a cozy feel with some lovely exposed brick on the walls. While our party didn't visit the bar, it did look well stocked and nicely laid out. 

For dinner our waitress was very helpful to all of us in talking through suggestions if we requested help. Pre dinner the table received these amazing garlic knots instead of plain italian bread... Def get your gluten on with these, they were awesome! For dinner I opted to split a chopped salad with another guest which was a great idea as it was a proper pre dinner salad size. Then for dinner I went with the Saltimbocca di Turchia Marinated tender Turkey Medallions pan seared & topped with sliced Prosciutto and Fontina Cheese, served with Garlic Roasted Mashed Potatoes and smothered in a Sundried Tomato Sage Garlic Butter, I wanted to lick my plate clean it was so good! 

Unfortunately we didn't save room for any dessert... next time I'm in town I will check that menu out!
