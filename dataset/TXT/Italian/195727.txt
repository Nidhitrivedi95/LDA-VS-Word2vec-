All were excellent and beyond reproach.  The stuffed mushrooms were particularly delightful, particularly with the house-made sauce.

The service was fantastic, and a special mention must go to Wayne, the new bartender.  His Mai Thai puts anything else to shame.  Even for those who aren't big into sweet drinks, this is perfect.  Smooth, sweet, strong, and garnished with a fantastic dark marashino cherry. Apparently that Mai Thai has won awards, and they're well deserved.  It was fantastic!
