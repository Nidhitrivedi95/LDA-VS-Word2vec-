HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A Beautiful resturant, friendly waiter. Very good Italian food and good wine. I had the eggplant parm which was so delicious. It was a large serving and came with pasta. They have amazing sauce. I tried the lobster ravioli which is really good too, they put whole lobster pieces on top and it was so good and creamy. I will be back again for sure.
