ARWLV46iIa3Dvt1y8-SPpA Normally this would be a glowing review, but I feel compelled to warn fellow yelpers that we just had our second, and final, mysteriously excessively large bill. We have been going to Guiseppes for years because the food was amazing, it was BYOB, and the prices were reasonable. In November we went for a family celebration, ordered a similar amount of food as in previous visits, and our bill was almost $100 higher than the last time we had dined there. Even more surprising, the check wasn't itemized and it's a cash only business. The final nail in the coffin was just 3 days ago. A group of 12 of us went to dinner and ordered family style. We has bruschetta, antipasti salad(missing the meat) mushroom ravioli, pasta Alex, and chicken piccata. Somehow, in a restaurant with nothing higher priced on the menu than $18, our bill was almost $38 per person. Once again, we were handed a piece of paper with a number on it and nothing else. 

It's a sad day when a once great restaurant succumbs to such a ridiculous money grab from longtime customers.
