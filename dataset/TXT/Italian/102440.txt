We had a private party here, and Anthony was a breeze to work with - confident, happy, and quick to respond. The event itself was great.  We received excellent attention from staff during cocktail hour and dinner.  The food was flavorful and cooked perfectly.  We used the full first floor, and our presentation could be seen and heard by all.  Would highly recommend for a private event.  They also have a cool smaller upstairs area with a bar, and it looks like they can accommodate a party of almost any size.
