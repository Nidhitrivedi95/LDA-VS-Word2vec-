w3gg3OaBTOAZpotv-i80hA Food, price, and ambience similar to Shomal North on yonge and steeles. Some differences are that this place plays  live music and has an Italian menu where you can order wood oven pizza. I enjoyed the beef kebobs and rice a lot. The kebobs had good flavour. The egg plant dish was okay. Didnt have much taste. Bread was a bit dry.

Service could have been better. Waiter was a bit cold and wasn't attentive. I had to ask for my water to be filled instead of him checking to see if we needed more. The hostess was nice. Greeted us as we walked in ans said good bye with a smile when we left. 

There's parking in the back of the restaurant.
