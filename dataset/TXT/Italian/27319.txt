4S7vWgarCkYjSaN8vrTV9g Solid.  I be eaten here 3-4 times, my wife & kids were hooked right away, they loved it.  Took me a little longer, but I'm sold.
You could eat well here just having apps.  Each is a solid portion for 2-3 to share.  The ravioli, with goat cheese cream sauce, spinach and crab is a favorite.  The calamari is excellent, with plenty of tentacles (I hate it when it's all rings).  My wife loves the rack of lamb app (4 chops), it's usually her entree.
I had the gorgonzola crusted mahimahi.  The fish was slightly overdone, but saved by the pool of sauce surrounding it (red wine reduction and demi-glace).  Sounds like an odd combo, but it works, although it didn't highlight the fish itself.  Kids were very happy with the fettucini Alfredo.
