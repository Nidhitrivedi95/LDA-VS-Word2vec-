SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Came here for a bachelorette party and got a nice big round table with a beautiful view. We were all able to face each other. The manager came out and brought the bachelorette a drink on the house on arrival which was nice. They brought bread with oil and vinegar and put it in the center so only some of us could reach it because we had a big party but once we asked for another one they brought it. They also brought us butter which I did not try but some girls mentioned that it was ice cold. Then we had some shareable apps. I really liked the butternut squash ravioli. It was sweet and savory at the same time. We also ordered bruschetta which was different. It looks more like bread with 3 different dips. The mozzarella app was just ok as well. It came with marinara sauce on top which I liked but just tasted like mozzarella sticks. The highlight of my dish was the Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare. I wish I saved a pic so I could post it. I told them I was sharing with a friend and they were so nice to split it in the back because we were not exactly sitting next to each other. The half portion was perfect for me and they were not at all stingy with the seafood. This is one of their signature dishes and I would definitely recommend it. Service was on point. The server checked on us frequently and made sure we had everything we needed. He also then brought out a complimentary dessert for the bachelorette as well. It felt special like it was her birthday. This place is located inside the Caesars hotel and I would recommend coming back here if your visiting Vegas and looking for a good dinner sport.
