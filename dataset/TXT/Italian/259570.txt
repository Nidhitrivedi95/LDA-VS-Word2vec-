wlQOv6QBeewTymYIsUirYA So I wanted to give this a 2.5 start really just for a few reasons.

- there is only one server working.. cleaning all the tables and taking drinks and orders. From what I was informed she is the only one that works here and works very hard. She caters to the customer I guess for the time that she started working there she got to know what all the customers like ( if some customers don't eat meat she would put a order of veggie pizza) for the buffet. Even if you requested a type of pizza like the basic Hawaiian, pepperoni etc she will ask the cook to make it.

-service is a bit slow but again be reminded that there is only one lady but the time I went with my family which is lunch time it's very quiet.

-Tuesday kids eat free with a purchase of an adult meal so I guess it's best to bring the lil ones on Tuesday especially it's pizza which kid doesn't like pizza right.

-they have a good selection of pizza. Vegetarian(deluxe. Meat lovers, Hawaiian, cheese, pepperoni and one had sausage and tomato. The pizza are of for buffet not over cooked but I always found pizza huts pizza even in the Philippines to be very greasy guess it's they way they make it.

-They have Romain lettuce dressings are ranch, French, Italian and Ceasars and croutons so I don't know if you would want to call this a salad bar. They also had some pasta salad which lacked flavor guess you can add some of their dressing or just salt.

- there was also garlic bread slices and tomato sauce pasta which you can add more tomato sauce which they have on the side usually used to dip pizza (don't worry they have small containers to use to get your own sauce) there's also a dessert which looked like a cinnamon rolls pizza style dish unfortunately I did not try it so I can't really give any feedback but it did look good.

So.. of you want quick pizza just the basic though I can say it's òk to go here especially for the lil ones if you have any. It's very quiet and for my first time going to any pizza Hut restaurant in canada at least I can say its different and sad to see its quiet. Service does take time but they server is very friendly.
