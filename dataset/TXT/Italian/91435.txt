Full bar features a wide variety of liquors. As a bourbon drinker, I applaud any place that has Pappy Van Winkle (which this one does). Lead mixologist Micah is a part owner and works Tuesday through Saturday. We liked the 1951 (Old Fashioned) and Rebel Son cocktails.

Recommend: albacore and truffle oil, yellowtail with chive, burrata, grilled mozzarella, mushroom gratin, risotto with squid ink. Pork belly and polenta, and short rib, are also tasty but not as unique.

Bar area is more lively, fun and warm, with about 8-10 dining tables in addition to bar seating. 

Best restaurant in Phoenix.
