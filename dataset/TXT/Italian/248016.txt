VeBNqe1pI5QBxVbquv0uoQ I love every Oregano's location, but this is the one I visit most frequently, and now mostly takeout since my toddler is a little too active for a busy restaurant. The staff here can't be beat- every single person I make eye contact with says hello, goodbye, or thank you, and it goes a long way. They truly seem happy to be there, so Oregano's- you pick some winners! 

My fave flaves are: 
- The Numero One-O: But be prepared- I've only had heartburn a handful of times in my life and once was after this pizza, but I don't regret it. The other specialty pizzas are a little too "weird" in the toppings for me, so I usually go with one I build myself- simple and tasty.
- All the salads. Pablo Picasso has some bite, the Big Dinner Salad is awesome with some chicken on top, and the Antipasto salad is my new favorite- such great flavor! 
- All the pasta is good, too, but recently tried Alfredo the Dark and was really surprised how much I liked it- it wasn't "alfredo-y" at all- just a lightly creamy pasta with a tiny touch of heat.

Side notes: they will only seat you when the party is present, so make sure your group is on time, or put in an advance order of the Guac-a-Tony, since it takes a while to get to the table. also- check your order if you get takeout- I've had a handful of times where they've missed a side or a dressing, or something... not a huge deal, but they are busy and things happen!
