W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg Go anywhere else but here in Cleveland's beautiful Little Italy.  A screaming manager yelling instructions; forgotten entree delivered 20 minutes after the other diners' food; and the food - yuck!  How can you screw up chicken parmesan?  Answer: watery pasta and tough, rubbery chicken!  Ravioli had odd meat squares in the sauce alongside the pasta.  Even the Italian wedding soup tasted, according to my tolerant daughter, like water with a few meatballs in it.  

The bread was good, and once you got past reading a wine list scribbled on an extra piece of paper, that was OK too.  

Couldn't wait to leave.
