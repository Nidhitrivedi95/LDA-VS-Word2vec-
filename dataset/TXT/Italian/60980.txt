Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg One of the best in Las Vegas. I hesitate to make this review in fear that it might change this place because it's like our little hideaway place off the beaten path, it's never crowded, always a friendly staff, great authentic food, great service, and great prices. I have been living in Vegas for a couple of years now and have never been disappointed at this restaurant. 
They also have great authentic italian cookies, prepared deli items and many favorite italian grocery items in their deli section. The place reminds me of the old "little Italy" neighborhood places where I grew up back east.
