yBGqf8l9NOM3vZFnlxcgzQ I have hearted this place before I even step foot in it. I always just awesome it was too fancy of a place for me. This last week I've been there twice and it is worth it. The rooftop patio... leaves me speechless and with this weather it can't get any better. 

The servers are a little cocky, but I just treat them like the custom officers and then they always seem to bring down their noses.
