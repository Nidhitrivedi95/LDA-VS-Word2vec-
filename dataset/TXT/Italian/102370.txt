FhVYpbvE8IQeUHAcwPPIXg This place SUCKS! All of our food was very bland, my dad ordered the spaghetti and sausage and the sausage was OLD , my $25 shrimp scampi was nothing excited, I could have made it better and made it look more nice at home. Seriously do not go here . They asked what kind of dressing we wanted with our salads come to find out its $4.00 a salad!!!

There was 5 of us and our bill was $130.00 WAY over priced for terrible quality and small portions. Don't waste your time .
