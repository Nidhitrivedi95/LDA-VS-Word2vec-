gjATEWAllTfxfxhGqJ93sQ Still the best pizza joint in Montreal

I have been eating at Il Focolaio for the past 20 years and am still amazed at how consistently good the service and quality are. They offer over 70 combinations of pizzas an offer a number of items made with either dough or salad. The pizza is made in a wood burning oven.

This places get very busy at noon and people start showing up at 11:45am. By 12:30pm, its difficult to get a seat. They also have a patio in front during the summer. During lunch they also allow a pizza/salad combination to share for two people.

While I still think they need to spend some resources on cleaning up the bathroom it seems that people get in and out quickly and many will never see the bathroom.
