sKy8HkP6X-8dCKq_SzeIpw Service horrible.  Bartender/waitress continuously forgot to do things like clean our table, bring my drink, bring us plates.  Took them 15 to take our order, 15 min to bring us appetizers, than 15 mins to bring us pizza.   We had to keep going up to ask for napkins, plates, etc.  Pizza was ok but not worth returning.    The 2 stars are for the food only.
