JsUprRhyzQyukZmAhcOg0A Right up there with good non-chain restaurants. My daughter and I had the salmon salad and gluten-free grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies. Everything was done very well. My salmon was cooked to perfection, crispy in the surface and yet tender and juicy inside. Her chicken was tasty and moist as well. Solidly good wine list too, if a bit pricy for such an establishment. Service friendly and efficient. I'd definitely go back again.
