FvJtjO5nuIy5erGbkJpJXw We ate here for a family reception and the staff were so accommodating and the food was delicious and very reasonably priced.  We took over one of the side rooms and kept switching around seats and they never got flustered and managed to keep all of our food straight.  I had the chicken marsala and it was delicious and everyone around me was raving about their food.  We had about 25 people in our party and the bill came to just over $300 with tons of leftovers.  The locals all recommended it and I can see why!  Will definitely be back.
