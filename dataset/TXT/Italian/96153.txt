eQo4kIwIWJbAnfXYl3k5BA Visited this restaurant with recommended review from yelp.  Yes, this is a good place.  Wine @$5/glass reasonable.  The waiter was very professional and helpful to my friend who didn't know what to order.  
The food is very good and the portion is good size and we enjoy the bread that I dipped with olive oil.
Definitely I will come back again.
