qBXfNxSpo2_8cP_WHQRvOg My review of this particular Olive Garden is, unfortunately NOT a favorable one.  My family sat at the corner table in the bar section as we usually have a few beverages before dinner.  It took our server, Camm, at least 20minutes just to get our drink order (remember, we were sitting IN THE BAR SECTION!).  We did manage to get an appetizer within a reasonable amount of time but after that, Camm was nowhere to be found so we could order a second round of drinks and dinner.  We had one of those 'Ziosk' units and did hit the Call Server button but it did absolutely no good.  So we paid for what we Did manage to order (again using the 'Ziosk' unit).  When we were getting up to leave Camm (remember Camm, the server that never was) showed up.  We did tell him that we were leaving due to the lack of service. So we left and went next store to Red Robin where the service was STELLAR.
