rkssUq0wCU51zqHS5VZ7bg Needing some fresh air along College St west in little Italy I came across Bellavista.... What seemed to be one of the many family restaurants in the area. 
On a quiet Saturday night thankfully this place was not busy. .. But again it was after 11ppm. 
I ended up sitting at the bar with a glass of chianti and a serving of bruschetta on the side to compliment the wine.
The food was lovely and you can tell our was not ape bought! But made fresh in house. ... My server aka bartender was very friendly and we were able to have a pretty good chat about the upcoming World cup fixtures.

Overall this place is clean, classy and the variety of food is exceptional among with their prices. During the summer season they have a cute patio. . So be sure to take advantage of it
