0uwQIGlKICIYuRtayVnh7g I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. Its Italian Street Food, whatever that is supposed to mean. Let me clarify: Think Chipotle meets Macaroni grille. Its Italian food in a burrito or a salad. You can also order pesto spaghetti. They have lobster bisque soup and canoli chips.  You wait in a line and order just like you would at a chipotle. Add a nice little touch: They serve wine and Peroni as well as Italian teas and soda. The girl put iceberg lettuce  in a calamari piada instead of romaine. Nobody seemed to notice. Minus half a star. The staff are neatly dressed in aprons. The staff is enormously helpful and attentive. Its fast food casual dining. Clean bright and freshly maintained. I'll be back.
