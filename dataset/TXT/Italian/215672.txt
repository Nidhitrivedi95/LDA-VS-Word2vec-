RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ Ate here back in Feb 2016 for a sampler as possible choice for my birthday dinner. I had the Lobster Bisque out on the terrace with my friend, and I must say it was the worst I have experienced. It tasted like a pudding (very sweet), with a dash of chili powder, and minute slivers of lobster. The price should have commanded a great Lobster Bisque. It prevented me from ever considering dinner there, even though the view is as beautiful as any place I know in Phoenix. Sorry about the delay in writing a review, but due too many bad food experiences with sizeable price tags, I have decided to speak the truth about food. If we all say nothing, bad becomes the order of the day.
