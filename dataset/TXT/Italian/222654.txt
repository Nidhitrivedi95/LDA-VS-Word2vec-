SirdHmqK0LDKDQvJBYVLsA If you want mediocre cocktails and rude attitude, then this is the place to go.

I came here on a Thursday night around 11pm and the place was empty - literally no one in the entire bar.  Yet, there was a DJ spinning really loudly.  The music was sort of clubby and didn't match the feel of the rest of the bar. 

When I got up to the counter, I asked if they had Fireball whiskey (they didn't - but that's fine), then I asked if they had any hard ciders since I saw they did have a few things on tap and some bottles in the fridge.  The bearded bartender then says "honey, this is a *cocktail* bar" and starts to giggle.  That's when I should have just left.  If there is no one in your bar on a Thursday night, I'm not sure why your first instinct would be to talk down to your only two customers there as soon as they walk in the door.  So I just ordered a Cucumber Collins instead.  It was fine - nothing special.

Then my date goes to order an old fashioned.  Instead of the bartender just making the drink, he goes "I think what you really want is a Friends with Benefits" and starts making that drink instead of what was ordered.  

I just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.  The bartender just hung around in front of us and kept talking to us about all of the liquor selections he had to play with and was trying to impress us by concocting some new drink and throwing bottles and glasses around.  I would have much preferred to have been left alone by the guy who had just insulted me and my date.

Avoid this place unless you like being talked down to.
