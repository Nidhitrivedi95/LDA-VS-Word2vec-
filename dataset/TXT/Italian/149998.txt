KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ Raos is extremely over priced! $27 for a dish of spaghetti is outrageous.  Very disappointed in all the food we ordered. We started with a bowl of pasta fagioli - the worst we've ever tasted. I could only eat 2 spoonfuls. Then we ordered our entrees. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi on a bed of angel hair pasta. I sent it back because it wasn't cooked enough and was very fishy and had no flavor.  So I decided to keep it simple and order pasta marinara (there aren't too many other pasta choices). The sauce was awful - I took two bites and couldn't eat it, but I didn't want to send it back - I had had enough! My husband ordered the Ossobuco on a bed of risotto which was mediocre, and the risotto was over salted and not edible. The corkage is $35, so we opted to buy a bottle of wine for $121 - outrageous. We didn't have dessert or coffee. Our bill was $225 for wine, a pasta dish and an ossobuco. Don't waste your money.  No wonder it was so easy to get a reservation on a Saturday night.  We work hard for our money, and we don't want anyone else to get ripped off.  However, the staff was very friendly.
