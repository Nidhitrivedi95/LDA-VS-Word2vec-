1v4kXcATiOFPLZMVkMU0Ow I love this restaurant for lunch during the week, it is perfect. The reason I give it 4 stars is that it is quite expensive... but you do get what you pay for. Everything is made in front of you, the ingredients are fresh and portions are very good. They have different vegan soups every day and sometimes more then one kind. They have lots of options for all your dietary needs. My favourite soup is the butternut squash.
