VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ I've been here about 3 times since September and each time has been excellent.  The staff has been extremely friendly and helpful! The food was fantastic and the drinks are reasonably priced.  The entrance seems a little intimidating at first but once you enter, it is a nice mix of restaurant/bar seating a small lounge area near the back.  

I would recommend Distill as a great start to the beginning of the night or as a final stop before the night is over!
