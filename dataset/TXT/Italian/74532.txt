cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q Ironically...this is a very small Olive Garden..so families that have a party of 8, take heed..there's no room for fat uncle Joe. The service is okay, no automatic water refills (we had to ask twice) and we had to wait for our breadsticks for over half an hour. It was a Wednesday night at half capacity.  The food was hot and fresh as a franchised Olive Garden can get but I would t go back here unless I was with my picky eating friends. Sorry.
