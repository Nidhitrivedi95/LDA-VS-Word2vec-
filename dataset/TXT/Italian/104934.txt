FpW25osFTrQf2dCIzAPavQ I have been coming to this restaurant for over fifty years and have enjoyed every meal made for me. The roll are delicious. They come hot the table with pads of butter underneath. You have several choice dishes to choose from. My personal favorites have been, of course, their pizza. My other favorites consist of the chicken Parmesan. A whole breaded chicken pounded flat, dipped ok breading and deep fried. Payed in a dish where Guidos famous sauce is spooned out on top. Along with the meal you a side salad and small child's side of pasta. Other favorite include bake rigatoni. Pasta is cooked and put into a baking dish with cheese and meat along with their sauce. Then it's thrown in to their oven with more cheese on and baked. Now of course their is their world famous pizza. All different variations you can think off. When I die, I want a large pepperoni on put in my casket. Anyways, say to Mike and look to see if the old man is there. Tell him how nice the place looks since they've move.
