YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg I can't say enough about this restaurant.  While the menu is Italian, they recognize that sometimes vegans enjoy a night out and have a special menu for such persons.  The vegan options were introduced to the dining room over a year ago and I have made an effor to try all of the dishes.  On Friday I had the Barley & Mushroom Soup for an appetizer and followed it with the Roasted Vegetable Tortellini for an entree.  The soup was a perfect appetizer size and served hot.  It was a little salty which might be too intense for some people but I enjoyed it.  The homemade tortellinis were served with a fresh marinara sauce and asparagus spears.  It too was served hot and seasoned perfectly.  

My husband didn't see his favorite dish on the menu (Roasted Vegetable Pasta Primavera) but that wasn't a problem.  We asked the waiter if he could inquire about the chef making the dish for him.  It must have tasted great because there wasn't one noodle left on his plate.

Our two friends are both carnivors and one enjoyed a steak dinner and the other their seafood platter.  They raved about how great and fresh everything was.  

The staff members are all very friendly, attentive and professional.  

Every person that comes to visit us from out of town is treated to a meal at this restaurant and everyone leaves after enjoying a 5 star experience.
