AYLxEeVq8NKG2UhcBiggrA Great little place.

Ended up here right before closing last night with my brother looking for something to eat.

Since we happened here super late we were told we had take out as our only option. Totally cool seeing as we got there five minutes before their posted closing time. The place was super cute and very clean.

I ordered the Canuck pizza, free garlic bread (thanks Yelp for the check in offer!), a side salad, and the pasta al poppette (spelling?).

Everything was really delicious! Loved the homemade pepperoni on the pizza. The salad was simple and could have been a bit more fresh (this is my only complaint and cause of one star demerit lol) and the house made dressing served with the greens was so good (basically like a creamy garlic - yum!). The pasta was awesome, the sauce and the meatballs were great. Garlic bread was also super tasty!

Make sure to try the cray unfiltered pomegranate ginger ale from Bruce Cost if you are a ginger person, it is awesome!

Definitely looking forward to return for dine in next time!
