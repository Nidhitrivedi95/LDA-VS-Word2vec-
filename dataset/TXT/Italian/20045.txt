2Zeh89IUg7T4dUFjRfqtdg Drove to this place from Litchfield Park 1 1/2 hr round trip good prices and great food made it worth it. As soon as you walk thru the door you feel like you've been sent through some sort of time warp back to Old Time Chicago. From the Deli style counters to the booths for dining in this is a great date spot. The staff was helpful and friendly which made me feel very welcome and at home.  The only negative because well nothing is perfect is that no one welcomed us as we came in and it was mildly awkward figuring out where to place a take out order. Yet that still dims in comparison to my experience. Shout out to @Fox10 news you hit it out of the park with this recommendation!
