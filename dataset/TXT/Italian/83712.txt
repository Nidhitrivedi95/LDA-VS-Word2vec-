DjvpsmdtEvnyMk2vXxpc-w I only went here because a co-worker suggested it for our company gathering.  Ugh.  First of all there are so many smokers outside, it ruins the whole concept of being outside!  I'm sorry but GROSS.  The server was very nice (and the only reason to give 2 stars) but the food was just hideous.  Everything was overcooked...to the point of being hard as a rock.  The patio itself is dirty and overrun with weeds and such.  Again we couldn't really enjoy the view because all of the smokers were at and/or near the bar where the view is.  I won't be back.
