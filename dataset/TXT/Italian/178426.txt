Nqs4_gT6nKyeTOJ_rgu1mg Frankie's, you never disappoint! Haven't lived in Cleveland in more than 30 years but make a point of treating myself to Frankie's one or twice a year when I am "home". Grew up on Mastick Rd. and Frankie's was a treat when parents were going out. Still best pizza ever! Thanks Dorothy for taking good care of me!
