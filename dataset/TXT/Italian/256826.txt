w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q As good as it gets. Our server, Lopez, was ingratiating and charming yet had an edge one would expect if we were at the New York location. Instead of asking, "what would you like to order this evening, Miss?" to my mother-in-law, he brazenly gruffed, "...whatta ya eatin'?" I loved it. Instead of "offering" dessert at the end, he exclaimed, "I'm bringin' ya dessert...you're gonna love it. It's just a matter of whether you eat it here or at home." Definitely a welcome change to the sometimes mundane "proper" service one usually finds at a fine steakhouse.

Speaking of steaks...holy crap. I ordered the dry-aged prime, bone-in ribeye and it was one of, if not THE best steaks I've ever had. Perfectly cooked medium-rare with a nice crusty char on the outside that really gave a beautiful, bacony like crunch to the outside layer of fat. The sides, creamy spinach and potato gratin, were just as delicious. We also received a nice chilled seafood platter at the beginning of the meal that Lopez graciously put together for us. Perfect starter to such a feast. 

Lastly, I have to give a shout out to our busser, Rafael. What a workhorse! After the several messes we made during each course, he somehow was able to manage clearing us and making our table look like we just sat down. Most impressive. 

If you feel like having an amazing steak with no upturned noses and lots of charm and attitude, this is your place. Simply fantastic.
