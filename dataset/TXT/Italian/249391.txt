VjaHHmV-rSkFaOAnU3faxg I was a little nervous. There was a A LOT of hype for this place. But it did not disappoint. We had the hot cheese injection and the underground meats pizzas. It's terrific that you can go half and half with the specialty pizzas, allowing for a broader tasting of the menu. Both were good but the cheese pizza was superb. Deserts and beer list also excellent.
