Y9kXVlU4xPfSZvkZH6C_2Q My boyfriend and I heard about this place from a friend so we decided to try it out. Food and service was awesome! We had Tyler as our server; he was super nice and just the right amount of attentive. He also was really knowledgable about their beer list as well as the menu.

We ordered a lot more food then we could have finished, but it was all amazing. The chicken wings with fries as delicious (I'd take a giant bowl of the fries alone because they were addictive), garlic buns (easily a meal in itself) that were actually garlicky, and we got the smallest size "Back Home" pizza (I think that's what it was called) which we took half home for leftovers.

Definitely recommend Naked City Tavern. It's nice to have a place to just relax with good beers and good food locally.
