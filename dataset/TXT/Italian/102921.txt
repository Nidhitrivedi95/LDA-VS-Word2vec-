FkUcjHK7oQJIvZtUGjDxMQ Pretty much not real Italian food. Just a crap menu with catchy Italian sounding dishes. Out meal was horrible, from the lame breads, absolutely dressed with dressing Caesar and the "Tuscan" chicken that had so much pepper on it you couldn't even swallow.  So, great place for really cheap food, but if you want Italian, go to an Italian restaurant
