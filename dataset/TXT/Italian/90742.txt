eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA The Brio  (location #2 west of the strip), is a new favorite stop when we come to Las Vegas. Service was outstanding, our wait staff highly informed and knowledgeable about all the menu items. We were there with a group of 10 and the service didn't suffer at all.  I couldn't recommend this restaurant higher.  Can't wait for my next visit...
