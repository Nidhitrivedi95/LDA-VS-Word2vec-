svFq2-4Yv5bIXtB2EK24Ow When I go out to eat, Im there for the food and convenience. I don't pay much attention to the service and don't care if the waiter is in a bad mood. But this dude Stephan was a particularly good waiter, high energy, good vibes kind of guy. He set a good mood for our dinner party and was very helpful. Also the beer selection was good, cheers
