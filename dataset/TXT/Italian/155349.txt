L23qeWacyCZFjF9DL6o04w This pizza is just OK, the crust is too chewey (i hope that is spelled right). The toppings are good and the flavor is average, however it is very greasy. I would say this place is just as good as any Domino's pizza chain. But I have been spoiled with east coast pizza in NYC, Philly and Jersey. It will do for a cheap place to get a lot of pizza for a party.
