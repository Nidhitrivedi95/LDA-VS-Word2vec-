CZY3743GpOOhdDJu6UmPBA I came here with some girlfriends on a Sunday night.  Trendy place, with friendly service-I like the open kitchen!  I had the barbarbuca cocktail (with beet-infused vodka)- it was out of this world!! 

We shared a few plates- the nodini, the funghi, the burrata di buca, the barbabietole, the involtini di melanzane and a stuffed foccacia.  All were delicious; the foccacia, barbabietole and involtini were, in particular, outstanding.

I will definitely come back for drinks or for a special occasion date!  I can't get that barbarbuca cocktail out of my head!!
