dCgWmN4DuGBSDG4liWH3OQ Really want to like this place but the couple times we have been here it just hasn't delivered. Food every time has been OK but nothing to write home about. Outdoor patio is really nice but the last time we sat out there the service was nonexistent to the point of being humorous (almost). A simple weeknight dinner (with one other table) took us over 2 hours to get through including 25 minutes after we were done eating to get our bill paid ( i finally went into the building to track our server down and hand her the cash). The patio is nice enough I might sit outside for drinks but I would skip the food. Maybe breakfast is better.
