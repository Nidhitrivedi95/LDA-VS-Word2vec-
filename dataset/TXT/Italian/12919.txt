0xzmIBsJQc5eUNLucFrZ0Q In fairness to Stratta this review is for the late night menu - we ended up eating there at about 12.30 or 1.00am when there were really no other options ( that we knew about) close by. 

Boy, it was horrible.
Bland over priced pasta. Basic flavorless burger. 

Maybe if we had been drinking all day and all night we would have enjoyed it more - but it was a terrible start to our Vegas weekend.
