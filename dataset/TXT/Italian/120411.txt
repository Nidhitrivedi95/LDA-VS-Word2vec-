h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ Went to Mezzo last night for dinner. After the fabulous lunch thought dinner would be as good, if not better. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. Service was slow to appear, when he finally greeted us,without any introduction, the waiter, name unknown, first asked if we wanted water, when we declined he left without asking about any other drink orders. When he returned to take our food order he again tried to leave without asking about drinks, even though 1 in our party ordered coffee. I caught him and ordered the drinks. The meatball app and the mushroom apps were outstanding, lots of flavor, the reason it gets 2 stars. We thought if this is an indication the dinner should be great. The lasagna was flavorless and totally "unremarkable" per 1 in my party. If there was ricotta cheese in it it was old and lost all flavor. He said he could only taste the noodles, everything else had no taste. Another had the salmon special, salmon with a white coating over risotto. Salmon just OK, risotto no flavor, no seasoning and undercooked, stuck to your teeth and a little crunchy. The eggplant parm was NOWHERE near the flavor of the lunch serving. Flavor was bland and seemed undercooked, WAY too much cheese, not enough flavor. My steak milinase was steak beaten flat, to remove all taste, and coated with something that did not have much flavor and didn't accent the steak at all, tasted kind of like Sizzler chicken fried steak, with less coating and less flavor. Toward the middle of the meal someone, again name unknown,  not even sure he worked there, asked how our dinner was. We asked about the lasagna prep and were told it was made that way on purpose, without much seasoning as were the rest of what we had. The waiter only returned 1 time to check on us, right after the entree's were served. I thought we had found a place as good as Carraba's, for lunch yes, dinner definitely NOT.
