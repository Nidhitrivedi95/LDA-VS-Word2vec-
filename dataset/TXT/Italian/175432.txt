nebRKfau_9iTxRDR6WGj9A If Yelp gave me the option of giving this place ZERO stars? I wouldn't hesitate to rate it as that. This place is absolutely terrible, the service was subpar and the food was unbelievably over-priced for the amount of food you get. Please please please, who ever is reading my review? Save your money and take your business elsewhere because I can guarantee you that even MCDONALDS has better food? AND service than this atrocious place. And if you didn't know, IM COMPARING IT TO A FAST FOOD PLACE.
