UHPjDgiEHnTe7-MP-b2kyQ I have noticed a gross inflation of ratings in the Scottsdale area. I cannot understand how this restaurant has the star rating that it does. Do you people not know what good food tastes like?! 

The menu was small and we found it difficult to choose dishes because nothing sounded all too appetizing. In the end we went with spaghetti with clams in a white sauce and I ordered the whole wheat spaghetti margherita. Both dishes were incredibly bland and boring. I couldn't even finish half my dish because it was too al dente and just too plain. Looking around I noticed that a great majority of the other patrons were the senior citizen crowd, so perhaps the dishes are catered to their palates (and wallet sizes) because each dish was not worth its value.
