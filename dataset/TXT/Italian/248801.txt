VfxlkvZQkLr9tu_w1SU_iw We decided to order from Napoli again tonight.
This time we ordered Boston Clam Chowder & Cream of Broccoli soup- both were good and came with saltines.
Next: Hot Subs -
Philly Steak and Sausage & Peppers Parmesan  Both served with Fries. Again, very good! Marinara served on the side so no soggy sandwhich upon arrival! Yaaaay!
Dessert: Brownie and Carrot Cake. Sorry but these were just-Meh...a little dry but not horrible.
All in all it was A LOT of food. We couldnt eat it all so leftovers tomorrow.
I added an extra star because the delivery time was greatly improved! I was quoted about 1 hour 10 min, but our food arrived in about 35-40 minutes. Much better! Keep that delivery time reasonable and you will get more of our business. 
Thanks Napoli Pizza !
