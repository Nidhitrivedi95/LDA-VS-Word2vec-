wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw My wife and I have been making the trek to Arcadia for years now and have always said "if they ever put a Postino in Gilbert, it would be game over."  Diary read - it's happened!  The place has always been known for great wine selection, unbeatable bruschetta, and friendly service, and the new Gilbert location definitely doesn't disappoint.  They have a friendly response to every question and a recommendation for every taste; they simply don't care if you're a wine expert or a first time visitor, they are just happy you're there.

It's so nice to have a chic place like this in downtown Gilbert.  As we drove through on Friday night, the downtown area was bustling with couples and families alike.  Milling around between the "Big 3" of Liberty Market, Joe's BBQ, and Postino, and there was a sense of buzz and community - it was very exciting to see.  

A few recommendations:

1. Don't be afraid of the "Tomato Jam" Bruschetta.  It's delicious and, while it sounds strange, is arguably their best board.
2. Every day (yes, even on the weekends) between 11am and 5pm they offer $5 glasses of wine and pitchers of beer.  We're not talking cheap wine and Bud Light either.  ANY glass of wine and beer is up for grabs, so spoil yourself a little bit!
3. If it's just two of you, take a seat at the bar and strike up a conversation with the bartenders and the fellow wine-goers.  We've done this at each location and have found ourselves enjoying our time better than just getting tucked away by ourselves.
4. The Salted Caramel Sundae is the best dessert in town.  Period.

Have fun and make a night of it - you'll be glad you did!
