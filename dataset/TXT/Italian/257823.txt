w3gg3OaBTOAZpotv-i80hA It is an OK place. I don't like the ambiance. They have dimmed the light and have tried to make it look good, but there's something into it that makes the place look gloomy and old. It might be the combination of yellow walls and dimmed light, or the low ceiling, or something. I won't eat-in anymore. Their house bread is nice but expensive. We had Barg Kabob, Koobideh Kabob and Zeitoon Parvarde. The Brag was the best. It was tender and well done. The Koobideh was burnt outside and raw inside, so we didn't like it much. Zeitoonparvarde didn't look good, but tasted well. The waitress was very inexperienced, but polite. I think it is too pricey for the type of restaurant that it is. There are other Iranian restaurants close by which serve better food in a much nicer ambiance with better price. As I said, I won't eat in anymore, but if I crave for Barg Kabob, I will take it out from this place.
