xU_QqrlaxXlf2SKoNIaGpg At first I was hesitant about coming in here because it's greek, italian, and american food but it actually was good. My waitress was very kind and knowledgable about the menu and was always smiling. I ordered the chicken pita and it was delicious. The chicken was very moist and the fries were very good and fresh. Next time I will come and try the italian dishes because the owner said that they were very good.
