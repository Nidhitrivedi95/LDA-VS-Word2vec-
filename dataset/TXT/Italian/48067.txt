91sdZ0d-5RMXNcBYB3uU0g I did enjoy Papa Guiseppe's; it's a homey style of Italian place with big portions, and good food but I just expected more and left a tad disappointed. 

This place was rather small, and a result busy and we were told there would be a 45 minute wait at 8:30 on a Saturday evening. But fortunately were given the option to sit at the bar instead without any wait. 

We went with their basic salad, their veal parmigiano, and their spaghetti and meatballs. Their portions were massive! We couldn't finish their pasta dishes or all the proteins in the dish, and ended up taking it home - at least I had a nice decent lunch the next day! Not only there was a a lot of pasta, the meatball and the veal was massive. The fettucine in the veal was not quite right but the sphaghetti was definitely better. The pomodoro sauce was good. The salad was really basic, I thought the greens could have been a bit more crisp and fresh here. 

Pricing could have a a bit more fair, I do suppose the portion sizes do reflect that, but taking leftovers home isn't the most ideal situation.
