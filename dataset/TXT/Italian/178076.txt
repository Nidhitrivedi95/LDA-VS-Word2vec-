nOkSC1GtMUJ_I70sb0SaeQ What a gem! Got their coupon for $20 towards $40 worth of food and had a feast!  Got an xlarge pizza, baked ziti,  ziti with chicken, and wings!  Good thing we had a fridge in the room to put away the leftovers.  Honestly, BIG value to feed a large group and the taste was surprisingly good!  Will come back here again for any future Vegas stays.  They deliver too!
