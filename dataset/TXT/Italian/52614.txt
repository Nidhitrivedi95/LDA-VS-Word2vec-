9X935zq92IQDnl1n23PivA Was there for dinner this past Friday. My 4th visit to this location.  Yes it has great atmosphere, great staff and a decent menu ... However, the food on my last two visits was sub par ... And this past Friday was the worst yet.  It took forever for the food to arrive.  The pasta was swimming in so much oil it wasn't edible.  The truffle gnocchi didn't even look like gnocchi and it was so mushy and there wasn't a hint of truffle.  Both dishes we returned and thankfully OB credited our bill.  Not ever coming back to this location.  Peter Oliver needs to overhaul this location to the same standards as the other OB locations.
