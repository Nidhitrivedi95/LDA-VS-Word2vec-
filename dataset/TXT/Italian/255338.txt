VYLQ3bMCqmHiNO2FS8aAsg I have had their pizza and wings many times and always loved . This is the first time I got a large "margarita pizza " but we were left desiring a little more than a pie with sauce ..a couple spots of cheese..6 pieces of basil and a few small slices of tomato's I paid extra for. This pizza reminded me of someone who only that a few ingredients left in the fridge and decided to use them before they opened more. 
I know they employee younger people so maybe the person who made the pizza had a teenager moment but not worth $15.
