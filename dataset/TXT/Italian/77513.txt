cy3Or8iSsDOmHBBu2MwnOg First of all, for the love of God, let's PLEASE separate Italian / American restaurants from TRUE Tuscan restaurants...they are entirely different cuisines! I have been a HUGE fan of Augusto Conte's restaurants for many years, celebrating birthdays, special occasions etc. First, start by asking for the canneli bean dip with the wonderfully crusty Italian bread...it is on the house! Then, if you are a couple split the Portobello salad over greens with Tuscan Fries...unbelievable. Then comes the masterpiece entrees. Whether it is the fresh pastas like the Buttera, the fabulous Osso Bucco or my favorite, Mare. As a former Charllotte restauraurant owner, the Mare is the BEST dish in Charlotte for the price! Excellent fresh shell fish prepared with white wine over linguine...off the charts! This has been one of the top rated restaurants in Charlotte for years. I personally rate it #1. Celebrities abound at this Southpark hotspot, Panthers and Bobcats players and coaches, Rick Flair ( whooo!) Darius Rucker (Hootie and the Blowfish), future Governor Pat McCrory, Mayor Anthony Fox etc. This is the BEST gourmet meal you can have in Charlotte for the price!
