zKwzMHiufpQ3bRAA7R7f8w I come here frequently, so this review encompasses my last 10 or so visits.

This place just cannot seem to get it right. In Sewickley, unfortunately, they aren't alone. The atmosphere at Mambo is decent, and the food sometimes borders on great, but the service is almost always remarkably slow, and is sometimes outright snotty. Other reviewers capture the specifics in detail, so if you want to read episodic outrage or delight, read those reviews. From mine, take that when you visit Mambo, you have slightly less than a coin toss' chance of having an overall satisfying experience.
