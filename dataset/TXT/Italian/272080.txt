XT25YpQoNDuzAZHur-HZ8g I recently visited this pizzeria thanks to Lambert's UYE hosting. It was an excellent call as I never would have visited it had not been for this opportunity.

We were a large group, close to 20, so service was matched to accommodate our group (at times too slow for my liking, but it's a group and you gotta roll with it, right?). We were extremely lucky that in spite of asking for separate bills, we were not adding the instant gratuity!

I ordered the Ontario prosciutto and arugula - a tomato based pizza. It was large and despite having a healthy lunch, I managed to eat it all! It is that delicious! I love crust, and this one had a puffy crust. Prosciutto was generously spread all over the pizza, as well as an equally portion of arugula topped it off! No regrets.

I ordered the 4oz Muskoka cream ale and it paired well with it, despite it not being a recommended pairing.

My other dinner companions also enjoyed their pizza and I was told this was a certified Neopolitan pizzeria with ingredients flown in from Italy! Pretty impressive stuff.
