9bxcpud3GREFOxKY2cbheA Came here to post that the Hawaii 5.0 and the Caribbean pizzas here are absolutely to die for. There is just nothing like either of them anywhere in Cleveland that I know of, chains like dominos/pizza hut won't even get close, and California Pizza Kitchen has sub par variations. The garlic knots and the pizza come out pipping hot and fresh, literally cannot go wrong. I really need to start coming here way more often than I already do
