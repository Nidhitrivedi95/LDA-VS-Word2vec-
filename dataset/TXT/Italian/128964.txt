i4hvmTd4RH9HvOyG8ndYGw I've been coming here since 1979.   They have some of the best pizza in Phoenix.  If you go, you must try their Sicilian pizza by the slice or a whole pie.  The owner is very personal and all the staff make you feel at home.  I go as much as I can.  I highly recommend everyone take a trip to Raffael's Pizza right behind 7/11 off of 19 Ave and Glendale.  They are in a strip  center in the back.  Enjoy if you go.
