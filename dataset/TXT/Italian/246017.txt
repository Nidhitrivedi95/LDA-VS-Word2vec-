UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Brio is amazing.  I've never had a bad entrée or a bad experience.  This is across a couple of locations and a good stretch of time.  

Love coming here for lunch, business or personal.  The strawberry chicken balsamic salad... wow.  Maybe my favorite salad ever.  That being said everything is good.  Try the salmon,  try the gorgonzola crusted beef medallions.  It's all good. 

Bottom line, come here, eat well and have some vino.
