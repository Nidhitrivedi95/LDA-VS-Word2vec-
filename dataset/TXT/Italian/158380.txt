LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Food is really good, price is very reasonable for that quality and quantity.  The chicken pesto and bruschetta were delicious. It wasn't too heavy like other Italian restaurant that I've tried. 
Service is great, and the atmosphere is good too. I love the booth, it's very comfortable.
The only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 star is because I was a little disappointed at the cleaniness of this place the second time I went there. I figured there was a kid sitting in our booth before us and the floor and seats were full of crumbs and very dirty. Seriously? the booster seat was still under the table...
Other than that, this place is very good, definitely worth a try.
