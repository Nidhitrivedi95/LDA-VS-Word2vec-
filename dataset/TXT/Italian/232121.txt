tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg The food was really not good. We were optimistic because they are located near our house. The optimism was misplaced. I felt like I was eating concession pizza. It was disappointing for a pizza joint. I asked my husband if he got it from the zoo. The ranch pull apart bread was weird. Their ranch dressing was mediocre packaged dressing. The appetizer sampler was very small and poorly cooked from frozen. My daughter asked if she can eat a PB&J instead of the pizza that was in front of her.
