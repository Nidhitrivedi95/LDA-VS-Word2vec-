9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw LOVED THE cute in this place:-) Went here on a date.. its coolio for that.. HOWEVER, I didnt care for the pizza we had... and its not to say the other pizzas arent better! I had the Pesto, my 'date' ordered.. I just thought the combo of potatoes with pesto on a crust was odd.. BUT I loved the antipasto platter.. a huge assortment of olives.. and the marinade was awesome.. Great wine.. great service! Ill go back for sure... and just order something without potatoes and pesto!! :-)
