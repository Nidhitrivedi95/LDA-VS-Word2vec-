vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA We dropped by the Carbone for a drink since the bars downstairs at the Aria were so crowded.  It has a great bar with wonderful bartenders.  It has a really good feel to it--upscale, but comfortable.

I started with a glass of red while my friend had cranberry and vodka.  We asked about dessert.  This is one of those places that rolls up the dessert cart that always looked decadent.  We were compelled to get the chocolate cake--that was absolutely great, with great creamy layers.

We followed that up with some port that was really good--great choice be bartender.  It was so good, we had a second glass.

The food looked really good also--I definitely want to come back and hope it is just as good as the cake.
