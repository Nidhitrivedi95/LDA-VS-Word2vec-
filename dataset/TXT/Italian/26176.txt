4KZRFxciaKfTD7qbS55b7g I was very impressed with the quality of the food and service.  Most of the staff are from Italy and truely infuse a piece of Italy into each dish.  We ordered a large pear salid, gluten free pizza, and eggplant parmesan and ate family style.  It was so delicious!  We finished it off with thier in house Tiramisu and an Italian cappuccino which was spot on!  In the end we bought a variety of Biscotti, and cookies for later.  They are in the process of applying for a liquor license, so until then you'll have to drink water, tea, or an Italian soda.
