mvsnt4q3A5TzcbPFolpsZQ I have been searching for a good local non-chain Italian joint and this hit the spot. The place is TINY - 13 tables, small patio. ALL were packed and this is a Wednesday night at 645pm no less. I ordered several items to try, took some home. Scallop appetizer w/ pesto - very tasty. Real pepper at every table by the way. Trout (special) maybe among the best fish I have ever eaten. Side of spaghetti was ok, sauce not very thick. Lasagna was ridiculously good, heavy ricotta flavor, perfectly done. Also had the ravioli - got one of each type. The cream/tomato sauce was unreal - I could eat that for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day. Not cheap but not unreasonable, three mains and an app (no drink) was $70. Highly recommend, not that they need the help!
