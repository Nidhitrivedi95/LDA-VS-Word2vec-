Tf13Wexrt6WmNw-CDW5Gyg Was out shopping and wanted just a bite to eat with a friend so we stopped here to share something since we were going out to a big dinner later. When we first walked in we weren't greeted =[ and just stood there like uhhh okay now what? After a busboy saw us standing there he sat us at the table. He was the only kind person we interacted with there. Once we looked at the menu we decided on sharing a medium hoagie with classic meatballs and classic sauce and half house salad. The food took quite awhile to come out, I have no idea why there were only 3 other tables that had people there and they had been there way before us. I was happy that the kitchen did cut the sandwich in half for us, however, it was very hard to pick up and eat so I ended eating it with a fork and knife. The food was pretty good, because it was good I will give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again. Fingers crossed the service will be better next time so I can update.
