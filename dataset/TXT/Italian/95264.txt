eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg GROTTOS HAS THE BEST PIZZA I have ever eaten!! (in Las Vegas). Being from Chicago this pizza is ... well, different.... 
I NEVER would have considered eating at the Golden Nugget. c'mon its reputation (to me) was an old dumpy casino in old dumpy downtown Vegas, but a co -worker recommended it so we gave it a try.  
We sat at the bar, ordered a nice chardonnay and were happy to find out it was "happy hour".  for 7 bucks we had the most delicious 
"Roasted herbed chicken and garlic, mozzarella, basil,
caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes and goat cheese" pizza!!!

DELICIOUS.  I DEFINITELY WILL go back to GROTTOS!!
