XPDzKfrq5uzz4o82eCZI7w Not child friendly!! We went to dinner tonight as a request from my 8 year old. We take our children to fine dinning restaurants to experience the service, and enjoy conversation. We have always been welcomed with our two children and complimented on their manners. (People are amazed how well they enjoy dinner without screens) When we made the reservation we indicated that we'd have a child with us. The restaurant was kind in saying they could get us in at 530, this was perfect. We understand that not everyone likes children and go early out of respect for other patrons. As we were waiting for food my son was playing with the plastic candle (picked up to see how it works). Instead of helping out and bringing bread to suffice a child. The owner stomped over and ripped the candle out of my child's hand! How insulting and demeaning to the next generation!

The food was mediocre at best. We ordered the lamb chops with mint pesto. The pesto was nothing more than chopped mint. My son enjoyed the ravioli and would have wanted another order. However, he was concerned that the "women expediting" was giving him mean looks. It's sad that the owner didn't just deny our reservation if she truly didn't like children. We gladly would have went elsewhere. I DO NOT recommend this restaurant. There are many amazing restaurants in the area.
