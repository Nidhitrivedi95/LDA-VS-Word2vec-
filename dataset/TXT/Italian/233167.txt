TMkTYhDMgDCuFwdDYIIoJA The food was good soup and salad combo for lunch, can't get that wrong. The service not so much, we waited on our server much more than she waited on us. Not a good thing. We left a generous tip. Definitely more than she worked for to hopefully brighten her day since didn't seem very happy.
