FEnAZBsWW9o1yhDRygQ_Sg Went there with a few family Members on a recommendation from a friend. Was not disappointed at all. The place is in a strip mall so I had my doubts. It is a small place, but that is not always a bad thing. Sometimes it is good to have a small quiet place to have dinner. The food was exceptional, and the portions were just right. Not small and overpriced like a lot of places. I had the Muscles for my appetizer. So good! For my main I had their pasta mixed in the parmigiano cheese wheel. All kinds of good! Would highly recommend it to people visiting for the first time. I will be making this restaurant a regular in my places to eat out from now on
