KyzPvdGPb2ubVlXJrS2QPA Order from here about an hour ago and I have to say for a second try of this place this place is not bad the pizza was delicious and I would say a step above pizza Hut and Dominos it is delicious the wings which I got with the pizza was delicious fresh and probably the best wings I have tasted in vegas only in front of wingstop which has the best wings in vegas in my opinion. And they are not selfish when it comes to giving you the ranch and etc the only negative was the delivery driver who didn't want to give me my whole change as he was expecting me to give him a tip I gave him a tip but that's not the point I shouldn't have to give you a tip because you tell me to or how much you want I give you a tip if I feel you deserve one. Overall outside of that main gripe this will be my to go place from now on if I decide to order food from home.
