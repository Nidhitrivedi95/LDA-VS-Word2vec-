OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ I LOVE ROCCO'S! They make delicious, authentic, NY style pizza and their Stromboli's are dynamite! I drive from Henderson just to get Anthony's special sandwich...that sauce though!?! I must also mention that they have an amazing selection of desserts including house-made cannoli's and delectable cookies(my favorite are the pine nut cookies)! Imo, the best pizza/Italian deli in Las Vegas!
