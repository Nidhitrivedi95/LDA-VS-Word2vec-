ZSCEkqlzZKRrZUz98CXtNw So I have been to this noodles & company many times before. Usually its pretty good. It seems to take longer than other times to prepare the food, however service is usually friendly. 
This time I decided to try the shrimp green Thai Curry. Flavor wise it was great. It's got a kick of spice in it. Sadly  it was really dry. Like dry enough to have the noodles all sticking together. I would of liked some sauce or something, but nope dry, yet flavorful noodles. I put some soy sauce in it to give it some sauce and that did the trick.
Anyways, The potstickers are usually good and their caeser dressing it good. ** note-the side caeser salad is really a tiny cup of salad.
