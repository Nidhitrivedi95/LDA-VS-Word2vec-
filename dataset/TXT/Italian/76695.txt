CvpXZRF-I7wfm19dW1jOXA Ordered hot wings and got plain wings in a box with a little bit of hot sauce on top like they weren't even tossed in the sauce or anything. Under side was completely clean which made a weird soggy crunchy feel.

Also only got one "2 oz" cup of ranch which was half filled, and for 12 wings that is obviously not enough. 

If im gonna pay 13 dollars for wings Id expect a little more quality food wise. 2 stars. Service was great though.
