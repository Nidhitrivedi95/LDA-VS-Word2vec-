UH6mET5JYZR6yPDVpTG9Og Might just be the best Italian restaurant in town. Great location and quite romantic for a date night dinner. Had the best Ossobuco I've ever tasted! Paired with an awesome glass of wine and un-parallel service, my dining experience was nothing short of spectacular. Will definitely be visiting again.
