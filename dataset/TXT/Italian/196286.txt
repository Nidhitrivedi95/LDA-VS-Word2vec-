PmwKGY3HLpcnC_-g0NCIvQ My family and I have been going to Dino's regularly for dinner for many years and we're never disappointed. Their pizzas are great as are their baked pastas. This is a family owned restaurant at it's finest. The staff is always friendly and it's obvious the owners take great pride in their food and service. I highly recommend this place.
