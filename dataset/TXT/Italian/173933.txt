nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g The food is good, but the arrogance and pretentiousness exhibited by this restaurant really annoyed me.

The server kept going on about how they are a certain type of Italian restaurant so they don't serve balsamic with their bread, then she proudly went on about how there was no pizza knife in the restaurant.  Good for you, now leave me alone while I rip up my pizza with my bare hands.
