G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I have always been a fan of Giada. We were excited to be able to get a window table for dinner. Once we were seated every thing started to go wrong. The waiters English was so bad we had difficulty understanding what he was saying to us. We made out what we could and order our first course. It took a long time to arrive but the city street view kept us entertained.  We order the second course of pasta when they arrived both were luke warm and the pasta was gummy (possibly from sitting to long) we only had a few bites. after that we never saw  the waiter again. We finally gave up on ordering the main course and flagged down one of the hostess to bring our check. The waiter dropped of the bill and said something (to this day we have no idea what) 200.00 minim to sit at the window and not even completing the meal was very disappointing. We received less service then on a counter at a Waffle House. By the way we are still wondering if the waiters accent and poor English was a put on.
