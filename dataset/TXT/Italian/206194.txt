qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA Subpar Italian place located in the Venetian Hotel. It was fine for a dinner out with nothing glaringly wrong, but just didn't impress. 

The atmosphere is nothing spectacular and even kind of strange with no views except a gift shop and other stores. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The garlic knots at the beginning were probably the best part of the meal- very fluffy and flavorful. 

I wasn't feeling so hot so I just got soup and a Caesar salad. The soup was 12 dollars for a bowl of pasta e fagioli. The soup was good, not great and had way more beans than broth. It almost didn't even feel like a soup because of how many beans there were! I'm all for beans in a soup, but I want to feel like I'm eating soup at the same time. The salad was just alright, nothing special. My friends felt the same about all of their dishes. Just meh overall! Wouldn't come back.
