8pmGz3Lg4f_r7HdDZPa4dQ Best Pizza I've had in a very long time! The food was  delivered hot and on time. We ordered the Payless Special and the Hawaiian, both are very good, we especially loved the NY style slices. The House salad was fresh and crisp too. I will definitely be ordering from Payless again.
