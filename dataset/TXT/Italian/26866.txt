4qQVf2lt-47VcQ4v54PEXQ Went here for lunch with a visiting friend, which was okay, but not as expected.  I guess I was a bit misdirected as I thought it was a nicer, higher end place, and it turned out to be an older place, sort of run down, not a destination, but the pizza was good, salad average, prices reasonable.
