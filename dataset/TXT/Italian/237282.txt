u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg I was visiting a friend for the weekend and didn't have much time and wanted to go to my favorite places that I've already tried and liked.  She suggested we try Postinos but I whined because it meant we would miss one of the other places I'd been thinking about for months.  I'm so lucky she pushed the issue and took me here!  I don't even remember those other places and want to visit her again so we can eat at Postios!

We were there before 5 and did the $5 wine special and a bunch of the bruchettas plus a salad.  All of it was delish.  I didn't want to share!  I will say the food combos were fantastic but simple enough to try at home.  I grabbed a take-out menu and brought it back to Los Angeles and have been making my own bruchettas that taste pretty close.  My whole family raves about them.
