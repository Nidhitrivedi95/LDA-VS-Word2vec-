DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw I have been eating at Seina Deli for about 20 years, the food is always perfect, the service is always perfect. The Deli makes in my opinion the best sandwiches in Vegas. The restaurant next door is top notch also. My only problem with the place is they moved. :( working at the airport, I can't run over there a get lunch anymore. Now I have to drive to the other side of town.
