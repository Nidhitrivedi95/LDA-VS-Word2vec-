6I27BTuHI5PMvOBG4WS8NQ Mercatto has a nice ambiance and that's the biggest selling point. Good to bring a date or business associate here. Despite being a late Friday night where most of the patrons have finished their meal our order took quite a bit of time. And it took a while before the waitress came to take our order.

After a while we finally got our food. It wasn't bad but it wasn't exceptional. I had the recommended Linguine. It was good, it's been a while since I had pasta due to the carbs. My friend had the Margherita pizza. Despite being really hungry due to the long wait, it still wasn't that good. 

Overall I would give it a 2 star for the food and service and 4 star for the ambiance.
