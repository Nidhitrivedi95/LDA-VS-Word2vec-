7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Stop the bus.....screeeech. You mean to tell me I haven't written a review for my favorite brunch joint in the city. Woah Nelly. I hope the brunch gods can forgive me for this slip up.

Lady Marmalade is the most wonderful mish mash of  non matching chairs and tables, young and spirited service with a smile, a warm collective ambiance and Food Glorious Food; served from a kitchen quartet who bring a whole new meaning to brunch. 

Get there early. Or try to figure out their turn overs. 10am and 12pm seem to be safe times to show up where you'll be seated in no more than 10 minutes. Service in quick, attentive and helpful. Coffee comes served in a cup which is sure to remind you of one of your grandmothers pieces. My boyfriend raves about this cup o joe. The menu has an assortment of options. Everything from your usual eggs/bacon/potato to creative bennies to crepes served in nest form to your mexican favorites and some classics turned onto their head. They also serve lunch offerings. 

Must Tries:
The Bennies - May the brunch gods hear my testament...the 'lady' serves the best bennies in the city. I've had the Brie and Avacado and Fresh Tomatoe and Pesto. Each comes with a side of nicely spiced potatoes and a generous mixed salad with a tasty asian sesame dressing. YUM. 

Aged White Cheddar and Spinach Waffles - I never imagined eating my waffles on the savory side of the track. Holy Moly. These were unreal. Dressed with  a smokey tomato orange cream sauce and topped with scallions and avocado (I swapped the bacon).  I didn't only write home about this dish...I wrote to the whole damn choir! I've got this savoury tune stuck in my head and I the only cure is to replay the whole experience. 

Don't forget Lady Marmalade only accepts cash.
