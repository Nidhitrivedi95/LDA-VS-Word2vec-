aylmrtz1AaFQTeM62cul0Q Used to love this place, but the current owners really should have sold it years ago. In case you haven't heard, they are totally DESTROYING the restaurant and bar in a very clueless "update." It ruined our dinner last month when we heard the news. We talked to the owner and you could tell he had no clue at all about what he had -- one of the most atmospheric and historic restaurants in Cuyahoga County. If Cleveland still had a major newspaper, you would have food critics all over this -- basically, some of the dining rooms here and the bar have incredible historic atmosphere, we're talking 30 or 40 years old and unchanged, the kind of places that are landmarks in real cities like Chicago, LA, New York, Miami etc. But here in Cleveland too many owners don't get it -- the owner told us that he kept hearing how "dated" the place was. I said sorry, it's not "dated," it's "historic" -- but as the OWNER, you should know this! You shouldn't have outside consultants to come in and tear apart your cool medieval dining room (with actual lit dioramas in the corners with armor!), and pull out the wrought iron and make it a "winery" room. What?! That's like taking a classic tiki bar and pulling out the vintage (and expensive) decor to give it a "Jimmy Buffett" update. How extraordinarily clueless. They're ruining the bar, too -- what was until recently a total throwback to the disco era (something just waiting to be capitalized on and made a trendy must-see CLE hangout) is about to be "updated" into something stupid as well. How sad.
