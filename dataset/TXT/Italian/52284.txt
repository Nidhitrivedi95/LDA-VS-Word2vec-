9umA26_aWjEuVe4QW7axtw My family was going to be in the neighborhood so we had to try out their pizza. We have already eaten at the burger joint and loved it so I was super excited to try out the pizza place. The kids wanted burgers and my wife and I wanted pizza. We asked the very helpful girl at the pizza place if we order there could we take the pizzas over to the burger place. She said of course. So we did and she said she would deliver the pizzas when they were ready. I try the daily special "pollo asada pie" and my wife had "the Phoenix ". I love mine, it was spicy, cheesy, and so tasty. The chicken on mine had great depth of flavor and I really like the pomegranate seed on top. The Phoenix reminded me of a BBQ chicken pizza from CPK but this on have pulled pork on it and was much better. I wish we lived closer so I could try some of the other flavor combinations, but I would definitely eat there again!!
