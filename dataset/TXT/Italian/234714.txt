TU2oECyx4VhCnzRzGzOlTg I ordered from this pizza place last night. I enjoyed how convenient it was to receive quick delivery and a perfectly executed order. However, the pizza was very hard to eat because all of the toppings kept falling right off of it. I felt that the buffalo chicken rolls had no buffalo sauce in them and that my Caesar salad was just a house salad with a packet of caesar thrown in. Regardless, the pizza tasted good and the Oreo cheesecake cake was a treat.
