ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw I realized I have just been leaving reviews for places that were horrible and thought I should change that.  Oregano's is consistently good!  Key word CONSISTENTLY!  They are always busy but turn tables quickly.  Service is always friendly , food is always good, cookie is always worth fighting over!!
