IKhwrMO42BecLZU4Pdwulw Had a mini Yelp meet-up for the West side today and I was a little disappointed with my favourite little Italian place. Everything was good; not bad, not great but good. Perhaps my taste-buds have grown to identify mediocre food or maybe I remember my meals here better than they actually were. 

In any case I had the Caprese salad and the California Risotto. Both good and as usual, the Risotto serving was huge and needed to be put in a to go box.
