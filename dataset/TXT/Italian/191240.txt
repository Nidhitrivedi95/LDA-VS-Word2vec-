PebX-Sf_h4FJGgsRAA5Fng What a cute place! We came in here for dinner and were pleasantly surprised! This is a definite family feeling environment, the service was really friendly and welcoming. We had told the hostess (who I think is part owner) that it was our first time and she came over a few times throughout our dinner to ask how everything was and offer suggestions. She also provided us with free drinks on the house to end our superb meal.

The Balsamic Chicken is AMAZING and the Pear Salad was a little piece of fresh heaven. Great combination of flavors and dressing.

You will definitely enjoy a visit here...slightly overpriced, but the service and environment make up for all of that!
