-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw I wanted to LOVE this place since we were planning to reserve a room for our daughters birthday but we've had a change of heart. While our server was a bit slow, which was understandable since it was a busy night. But my husband's order(short rib) was frozen! Seriously frozen inside. How does a restaurant charge $20 something for a frozen meal?! This place is nothing but an overpriced Olive Garden. Without the awesome soup and bread!
