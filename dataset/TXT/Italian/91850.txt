EGJb8zZPlAfRzj9rg2KwqQ Have been on the east side since October and searched for a good Chinese buffet. Took a shot in the dark and went to this place and wasn't disappointed. Only $4.99 for lunch, I ate my fill of sesame chicken and chicken with broccoli with a lot of rice. They had what looked like a good selection of sushi but I'm not a seafood fan so I didn't try any. The food was also constantly rotated and fresh which really impressed me. I have never seen so much efficiency on a buffet line. The staff was friendly and I didn't see anyone resembling the "skeletor" that was mentioned in another review. I could also see much of the kitchen from where I was seated and everything looked very clean and up to standards (which I know is a concern for people sometimes.) The decor is a bit worn but I'd take a place like that over an overly fancy restaurant every day. Definitely a hidden gem and a good place to get a cheap lunch.
