My bf and i were in the area. We had dinner plans set for an hour later, but didnt eat all day. I searched yelp to find some pizza by the slice and it suggested Aiello's. 

Pizza is like $1.80 plus 30 cents for toppings. My bf wanted a margarita pizza, but the one they had offered looked old (and to be honest didnt really resemble margarita pizza). I considered a pepperoni roll, but figured a slice would fill me up more. 

The pizza was okay, above average for sure. It had a sweet sauce and the crust wasnt limp or soggy. I normally ditch the ending crust of pizza but i enjoyed Aiello's. 

This pizza is well deserving of 4 stars. The reason for my 3 star review is that all 3 workers seemed have a crappy attitude. We came in happy and hungry. We had questions on the menu so they knew that we were new. No one even bothered to smile at us or give us any detail on the pizza or the menu (Legit, not one smile from one person. Is it that hard to smile?). Their sour attitudes almost ruined the experience for us. Luckily the pizza (semi) made up for it.
