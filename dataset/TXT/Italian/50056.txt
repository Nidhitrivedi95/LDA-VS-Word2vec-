9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw I don't understand the great reviews for this place. I went here on a nice evening and decided to sit outside. The atmosphere outside is alright. Cute little old house set up. Big deal. 
The service is horrible and our waitress didn't seem to listen at all. We ordered some bruschetta. It was ok at best. We then said we were probably interested in trying the lasagna, but to come back in a few more minutes. We told her we changed our minds on the lasagna and wanted to share a four cheese pizza. About 5 minutes later, we get lasagna. She said sorry it came out so fast and the pizza would be out in 10 minutes. We decided it wasn't such a huge deal and we could take that home. However, it is totally rude for one person to get their food and not the other person. Who does that?? We then get our pizza. 
On to the awful food. Like I said, the bruschetta was ok. Postinos is 100 times better. The lasagna, we just boxed. My boyfriend ate it the next day and said it was horrible. I make much better at home, and this was some extra special dish they had. The pizza.......oh my. It SERIOUSLY tasted like I took a bunch of cheese and melted it in the microwave. It was some of the worst pizza I have ever had. 
I will never go back. Horrible service and horrible food. I don't get why they have such good reviews. Maybe because it is in downtown and its a cool place to go hang out. Go to Angels Trumpet.
