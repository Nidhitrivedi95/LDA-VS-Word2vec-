aqrTv6QiU0J9Sxm_T--c5g I just ate there last night and I have to say the food was terrible.
We ordered Ossobuco--$41, and Escolar( a fish)-- $36. 
They were the specials so we were hopeful, but everything was poorly presented and very salty. It was very disappointing especially since it was so expensive.
Our waiter, Chaz was great, but the food was really a letdown.
