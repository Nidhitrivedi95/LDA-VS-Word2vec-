w3gg3OaBTOAZpotv-i80hA Dined at zaffron on the weekend. It was very busy at lunch hour but  the service was good, fast and friendly. Ordered kebabs, comes with saffron rice and salad, and some extra garnish of veggies on the side. Delicious! The kebabs are well-cooked and flavorful. Really big portions. They also have a wood burning oven for pizza, which smelled really good. It's a Persian place, so if you go, order the kebabs. I will be back for more.
