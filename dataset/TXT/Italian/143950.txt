juu7S1nP5eirbeJ8-rfguw I must start by saying we have always loved Bravo.  Today, we went there and was seated outside.  We sat for 15 minutes and no server.  The couple that came after us was waited on first....still no server.  I went inside to ask if they forgot us....the fella said, this has been happening a lot for they just had major cuts....well one could tell..... uncleared dishes every where. After 5 more minutes, we left.  Bravo please get your act together....we love it there.
