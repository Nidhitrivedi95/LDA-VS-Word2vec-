usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA Read the nyt article and we were excited to try it, since we were in Pittsburgh. First of all, expectations were very high. Imagine, after the article, we expected lines around the block and a sublime experience. We split the pomodoro, e bufala (caprese by any other name) which was competent, but spare us the attitude when we ordered it as a caprese. Kath had the tortelli bolognese, sauce was good, pasta mushy (overlooked to blob consistency). I had the quatro formaggi. Which we are going to herby name quatro blando. No zip no zing no pizzazz. 

Ok, the tab was reasonable, but the experience was unmemorable. Curse of the top drawer press!
