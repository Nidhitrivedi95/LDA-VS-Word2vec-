VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w If you've ever thought of traveling to northern Italy just to try the food you can save a lot of money by coming to Pizza a Metro.
After living in Italy for 3 years we heard about the food at this restaurant and decided to try it.  Very authentic sauces on the cheese ravioli.  Very authentic pizza.  The crust, the sauce, and the restraint on the use of toppings was exactly the way pizza is prepared in northern Italy.  Of all the pizza we've tried in Phoenix there was no other as close to real northern Italian pizza.

If you don't like the food at Pizza a Metro, don't go to Italy.  if you want an affordable date night , split a saladand a small pizza.  My only complaint is the location .


Question:  has anyone else had their credit card used by others after eating here?  Not accusing, just asking.
