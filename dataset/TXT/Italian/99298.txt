f_R4-FMtQ2Dj6m8LNuse1w I love the pizza. I've been 5 times and it has always been hot and very good 
The crust is thin , the kind you fold 
The toppings have been equally distributed and plentiful 
I like how long it is cooked too. The crust and toppings are done and not watery 
Easy to order and nice staff
