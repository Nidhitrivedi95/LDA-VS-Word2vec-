TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q Despite living in Central PHX for a decade and only two miles from their previous location, until earlier this year I'd never eaten at Spinatos. Twice this year I have ordered the Baked Spaghetti Calzone with ricotta and Vodka Cream sauce as take out. Unique and absolutely delicious! Last night, which was their first night in their new 7th Street and Missouri location, I finally tried their pizza (also as take out). 

I couldn't decide between the Get Meaty or the Here's the Beef, which is not on the Menu link on their website, only on the Order link. Once I got to the order page I was very happy to find that I didn't have to choose between these two pizzas: I could get half of each on one pie. Score! In addition, extra cheese (they offer mozz, ricotta, feta, gorgonzola...the last at least on the Here's the Beef) were at no addt'l charge...though this may only apply to select items (e.g., maybe not for addt'l meats or veggies and perhaps only for their Specialty and Popular Combinations but not if you make your own). Bonus!

The pizza itself was great. Not the best I've ever had (had better albeit different types in Chicago and elsewhere in the Midwest), but maybe the best in PHX. I got the Sicilian crust as I'm not a fan of thin crust and it was excellent. Of the toppings' combos I ordered, I liked the ones on the Here's the Beef (with extra gorgonzola and extra mozz) better, but the problem with this pie was the lack of sauce, which in my opinion is the thing that makes these pizzas so tasty. If I had to do it again, I'd order the Here's the Beef with addt'l pizza sauce. The Get Meaty (with feta and extra mozz) was great, too, no doubt.

I'm happy I finally tried their pizzas and will definitely return to try other combos and hopefully also check out their brand new dining space.
