w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg I'm from Hawaii, so of course we're doing an Olive Garden dinner at least once during the trip.  I love pasta, and I love garlic bread. I am a fettuccini alfredo eater to be exact. If it's on the menu, thats what I'm getting. Always satisfied :]

After going to the Vegas one, I decided to give Olive Garden 4 stars. Majority of the servers there seemed a bit on the older side. Ours seemed like she was maybe early 60's? She was nice, but a bit slow. It took a while to get our drinks, and take our order. So it seemed like FOREVER to get our food. My bf got the braised shortribs. I can honestly say, I've never once had a bad braised shortribs. But this one was pretty terrible. When we were ordering, our server said it was a "good choice" because they were going to take it off the menu. But it tasted awful... no wonder they were taking it off the menu! I cant quite put my finger on it but it had a very odd taste.

Aside from that, the endless breadsticks, a yummy salad, delicious fettuccini, and refreshing peach iced tea were a win.
