3qrfY-XCUKVyrO5T6GskqA I am indeed a fan.  I have gone thru most of the noodle and soup menu (no salads and no sandwiches yet).  I tend to order by the calorie count - so as to preserve the ol' waistline - and if their calorie count can be trusted, then their fare is a tasty and healthy treat.  I find the asian noodle dishes to be my favorite.  And I am always very satisfied with the portions ( I order the small bowl).  In fact, the tasty goodness of the noodles typically causes me to keep eating even after my brain is telling me "hey buddy, you are full".

In the winter, I was getting chicken noodle soup and  the small noodle bowl and that was A LOT of food.  

Today I ordered the small Indonesian w/ Chicken, a large soda and a rice crispie treat (so good), and the total bill came to $9.38.  I find that to be pretty darn reasonable for Oakland faster-food.
