a4MVM9E9022sYFrrYWy9DQ Delicious pizza! I'm not a fan of muscles but my parents say that they also have the best muscles (all about the sauce with ingredients that my mom still can't figure out). It's very reasonably priced, and super cheap considering how good the food is, but the lineup is proof enough! They don't take reservations so you have to either be lucky or wait 15-20 minutes for a table.
