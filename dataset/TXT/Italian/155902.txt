L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw The food was really really good. My absolute favorite was the cherry tomatoes and ricotta bruschetta. Mhmm mhmm mhmm  yummy.  And I also had the rigatoni pomadaro . Fresh pasta made there daily and you can certainly taste that.  Would love to go back soon with all my friends . I am so glad jamie has a restaurant in toronto now. Would be even better if he did a meet and greet in Yorkdale & or at the restaurant
