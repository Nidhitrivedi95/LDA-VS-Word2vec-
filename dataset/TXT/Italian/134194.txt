iqntlaqSCB4hkzTzlPlEmQ First time eating at Bravo Cucina Italiana and was thoroughly impressed! The decor provides an open and welcoming ambiance and the servers all wear white shirts and ties. Cesar B. was our server and did a phenomenal job - personable, knowledgeable, perceptive, and quick on refills. Rosemary bread basket and dip were fantastic. Both my wife and I ordered the White Peach Palmer (white peach syrup with tea & lemonade) and loved it! Just the right amount of sweetness and tanginess. I ordered the Pasta Fra Diavolo with shrimp. It tasted as good as it looks in the pics, excellent flavor and rich creamy sauce. My wife ordered the Pasta Woozie dish. The sauce and pasta tasted great and the large spinach leaves tossed in added to the flavor and texture. Both our dishes were part of a three course meal special. For about $17/$18 each we got a large Caesar salad (one of the best I've tasted), the main dish, and a small dessert (peanut butter brownie & chic chip canoli were great). Great value and great experience...will definitely be back!
