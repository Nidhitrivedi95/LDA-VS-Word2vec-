HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA Went here on a spur of the moment decision and I'm glad I did. I should say first that I'm a thin, hand tossed pizza crust kind of guy. This was a little thicker than that and not something I would typically have ordered, but they make it work, mostly because of the quality ingredients, from the tangy sauce to the cheese to the toppings.
Few things: 
The half sheet is a huge square cut monster that'll feed a large family
The wings are awesome, enough by themselves to bring me back. 

I will definitely come back to try their sandwiches, especially the East coast standard beef on weck
