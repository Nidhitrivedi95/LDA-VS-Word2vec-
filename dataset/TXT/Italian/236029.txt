Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA I have yet to find anything here I don't realllly enjoy.  Last night the bf and I shared the campari tomato appetizer before chowing on pizza.  This is sort of their caprese salad... They roast a few campari tomatoes and serve them up with fresh mozzarella, a healthy portion of aged balsamic, drizzle of olive oil and a few basil leaves.  That cheese is seriously melt-in-your-mouth delicious. And the buttery-ness of the cheese goes jut perfectly with the acidity in the tomatoes and balsamic.  A sprinkle of fresh-cracked pepper and sea salt is the cherry on top.  If you're an olive fan, it should go without saying to try Castelvetrano olives as well. 
As for pizzas, I absolutely love the Casanova.  The Answer is really good as is the Manifesto.  I even enjoy the Brussels Sprout pizza.  I'm leaning toward the Sweet Potato pizza next time with sausage added to make it a bit more savory. As with most restaurants, I have yet to make it to the dessert menu...
If you are in the mood for adult beverages, their house made wine coolers are light and refreshing.  They have a good craft beer and nice wine list too.  On Monday and Tuesdays after 8pm, you can get a pizza and 2 sm pitchers OR a bottle of wine for only $20.  If you don't want to drink and then drive, you can get this same deal through their carry out window.  Winning!!
