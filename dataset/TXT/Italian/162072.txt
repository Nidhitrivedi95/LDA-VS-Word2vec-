LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g This restaurant was amazing the food was great and the service even better . We went to the steak restaurant near it the nite before and was disapointed make sure to come here instead . I will be back we loved the bruschetta and my husband got the lasagna which he loved and I got the linguine with shrimp forget the name but the server recommeded that one and it did not disappoint . Make sure to eat here at least once in Vegas or if you stay at the hotel you will not be disapointed .
