UP7ejOl-PQyWZ9iFRQD8Xw I'm confused how a small container of bland fettuccini Alfredo with cold bread and butter can cost me $19 after taxes. Does Il Fornelo realize that there are 100 Italian places in the city? My particular beef is the location on the Danforth. Please do something about this. Next time I go Scaddabush
