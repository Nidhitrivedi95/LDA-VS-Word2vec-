yOxuSjJcW7oEWYz9yb4HYA Oh my. Oh dear. Leslie Jones is definitely as good as it gets. It's not pretentious and it doesn't try to be something it's not. Leslie Jones is simply a lovely, inviting place that serves amazingly good food and has fantastically good service.

A warm, breezy summer evening and the front windows of Leslie Jones were open to look out onto Queen Street. They also have a lovely back patio with string lights and umbrellas. Candles lit on the tables brought a warm glow to the room, that was already filled with rustic, comfortable furniture. Bob Dylan on the sound system and jugs of water with lemon and orange slices floating and bobbing. 

They bring pita and a delicious hummus to the table to start. For dinner, I had the slow roasted pork with fennel, braised onion and lime chili herb yogurt. DELICIOUS! I finished it off with their homemade carrot cake (sans raisins and nuts) with a cream cheese frosting that was divine. 

The service just could not have been any better. 

Like I said...oh my!
