g-nzfTvso3-4c4gkhkmGbQ Everything here looks old and worn out. Found lots of food scraps under our table, which makes me worry about the general cleanliness of the place - especially since it's a buffet and food is just laid out collecting all sorts of germs. Ignored the crab legs and seafood on ice area as I didn't feel safe eating it and they looked pretty stale anyway. Went for all the warm food. Very carb heavy, as other reviewers have stated. Pastas were greasy, not al-dente (LOL are my expectations too high?) and generally meh.

Every table seemed to have a birthday song play for them, including our party. In truth, I would not have thought about coming to this place if it were not for a friend's birthday... he really wanted the cheesy Frankie birthday song experience to fulfill some childhood dream (lol).
