aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw we didn't have the opportunity to pay for dinner, but it's safe to assume you're looking at $100+/person w/o any drinks.

they claim the fish is flown in fresh daily from Italy.  Not sure if Italian fish is better than any other fresh fish, but every restaurant needs their hook.

Our host was from Norway (which is the world's #1 exporter of Salmon), so he knows his fish, and so we followed his lead in ordering a type of snapper that was prepared in salt bake fashion.

i've heard of salt bake dishes, but never tried it before.

I'll tell you i'm a convert.  Salt bake is the way to go.  keeps the fish extremely moist and tender, and imparts the perfect amount of saltiness (the salt crust is on the outside, and the skin protects the salt from becoming over powerful, but the salt crust basically steams the fish inside its own juices).

however, for what i'm guess was about $60/person for the fish, it was a 2 oz. serving.  i'm serious.  a can of tuna would be extremely filling in comparison.

but it was the best 2 oz. of fish i've had.  there was a simple potato side dish which was very tasty and had a nice outside crust.

needless to say i was still starving after dinner (this was a 3 hour business dinner, so there's much more talking than eating), but a great restaurant if you're really into fish and don't mind paying a premium for the experience.
