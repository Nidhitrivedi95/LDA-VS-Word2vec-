bo4loBeLwkQqZ7HGrgxXRQ Had their lasagna. It was really good. One of the better lasagnas I've had here. Seems like a family-run business and it had great service. The portion was quite big. Had to ask for a doggy bag, which I enjoyed the next day. Will definitely go back for some other items on the menu, such as the pizza and the ravioli.
