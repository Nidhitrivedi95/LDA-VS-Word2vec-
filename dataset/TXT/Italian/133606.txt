iNhP0ejUf2jVzaR5YCOoEQ Came by for dinner the other night and it was a mediocre experience. Parking was rather tricky in the tiny parking lot although we were seated upon arrival.

Our waitress was rather frazzled forgetting waters, along with missing utensils, napkins and forgetting to bring out dishes, refilling bread etc.

The veal parmesan<U+200B> was mediocre. It had plenty of cheese and the veal was a tad chewy... The side of steamed vegetables were okay.

Finished off with the tiramisu which was also lackluster and it had sugar crystals in it...
