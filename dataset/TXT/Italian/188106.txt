oUvqwPJkorOnYZFKRt0oEg I love this place. The owners and staff are very friendly. I have never had an issue eating here. The food is authentic and delicious. It's my favorite place to eat in Queen Creek. If I moved I would drive out here just to eat there food and see the staff. You guys are great!
