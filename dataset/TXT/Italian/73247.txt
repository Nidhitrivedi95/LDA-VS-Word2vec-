CKJnoUSWocdVIj6Fqbgm5g This is my first time back in a couple of years to find a new pizza pasta menu at Red Tomato.
The Neapolitan style thin crust pork belly pizza topped with chopped balsamic radicchio was done to perfection, crispy and yet chewy crust. My friend commented on her ricotta gnocchi as feathery soft and very tasty.
In my opinion their pizza crust is as good as any of the popular pizza restaurants in Toronto but with more generous toppings.
Service was friendly and we will be back for more.
