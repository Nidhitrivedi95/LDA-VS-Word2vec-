Try the Colorado rack of lamb. It was cooked perfectly at a medium rare temperature, and was without a doubt the best rack of lamb I've ever had. It was one of those rare dishes you hope never ends.

The oysters were also excellent, as was the caprese salad. 

Our waiter was one of the best I've ever had and, while I don't remember his name, he reminded me of Kevin Spacey and gave us a free dessert for my fake birthday.

Plus, those world-famous Bellagio fountains are in the background, providing perhaps the most romantic scenery Vegas has to offer.

I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough.
