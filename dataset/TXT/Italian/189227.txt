OyiOg9GYKzHI19EbnWqL8A Popped into Hey Lucy for a birthday drinks and dessert combination. The deep fried cheesecake was good, the dessert pizza should be skipped. Martinis were very sugary sweet. On Wednesday they are $3.99. Great deal. On any other night they are $8.99 and they are not worth that price.

Music was rocking.
