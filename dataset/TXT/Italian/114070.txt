gjATEWAllTfxfxhGqJ93sQ Was really disappointed by the pizza here.... especially after reading so many 4 and 5 star reviews. While the service was fine, the food was pretty sub par. The waiter recommended a specialty pizza. It was obviously pre made earlier in the day and served cold. Save your money. You can get a better pizza at the nearby underground mall.
