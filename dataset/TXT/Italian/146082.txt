K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ Yes, yes, definitely more of a lounge.  So I was a little disappointed at the lack of opportunity for dance.  The dance floor seemed to be the center aisleway, so people kept squeezing through to get to the bar or the balcony.  Plus it's right up against (and on the same elevation as) the table service areas, so when people dropped glasses it got on the dance floor.  ...Although the fact that their glasses could breaks speaks to the high quality air of the club.  

Most impressive of all was walking into the club and witnessing the vision-filling Bellagio fountain display just outside the patio.  It was breathtaking.

Also, in addition to the awkward "dance floor", there was also no place to stand and chat or bounce to the music that didn't feel in the way!

The elegance of this place definitely won me over though, and for a lounge, I appreciated the ambiance.
