5XLuRoXqafFY_GAQ0D8dWw I placed an online order because I have a special needs child. It's easier to get take out then risk a melt down in the restaurant. My son and I arrived at 5:55, at 6:15 I asked for how much longer the wait was. If it was short then I would try to keep my son calm or if it will be long just refund me my money. They told me not much longer. 20 minutes later the manager came out and said the order was being bagged up. My son was distressed and I told her I could not wait much longer. We waited 20 minutes after that conversation! She brought my food out and comped one dish. I was trying not to melt down myself and just walked out. Note to anyone ordering take out DON'T!
