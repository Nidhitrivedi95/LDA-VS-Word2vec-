sa1ZAswk7kEQfg9Mb6iQwQ This is my go-to place for pasta, and might as well be my favourite restaurant in Toronto! Foods are sumptuous and well cooked. Pastas are better than any others I tried in Toronto as they taste authentic and delicious. Other dishes like fishes, meat, steak and pizza are strongly recommended too. They are always well prepared and taste fantastic. Another reason I love this restaurant is the romantic setting. It could be the most romantic place to dine in Toronto.
