RZdrNayqoUjovdoJ4GWe-Q I love all pizza! Rosati's is my second "go to" pizza place if Grimaldi's is busy lol I LOVE the delivery and they have never been late. Sometimes the people taking your order talks too fast or they don't really explain too much when it's your first time ordering BUT thats ok! Pizza makes up for it LOL
