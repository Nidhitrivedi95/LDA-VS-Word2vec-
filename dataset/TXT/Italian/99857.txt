F5BCXUpQpCRPeFmWnQmSJA This is the best every day restaurant in the Summerlin and it's also a fun choice for date night. You might like the most about this restaurant is the service. Owner and the rest of the team will make you feel like you're the guest of honor at a very VIP party without being overbearing. Besides great atmosphere and being a fun place to spend an evening, the kitchen always knocks it out of the park.
The menu has a number of healthy, simply-prepared light dishes, as well as heartier items. 
Menu is fine dining without being snobby or outrageously expensive. 
Don't miss great selection of some boutique wine recommendation from well versed servers or knowledgeable owner. Thanks to the thoughtful wine list this place might become a popular oenophile hangout. 
I'll go back for sure!
