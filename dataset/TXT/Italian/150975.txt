klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw My husband and I wanted to treat ourselves to a nice Christmas dinner since we weren't traveling home for the holiday. When we saw that the Christmas prix fixe menu consisted of stone crab, prime rib and chocololate/dulce de leche for dessert - all for $52 per person - we were sold!

Instead of regular bread for an appetizer, they brought out pretzels with a delicious dipping sauce. The stone crab was the perfect start to the meal.  We each got two claws and a side of crab meat with two dipping sauces. The crab was fresh and so succulent!

The star of the meal was definitely the prime rib. My husband and I both requested our meat to be cooked medium well, and it was cooked perfectly. The entree came with winter vegetables and mashed potatoes with truffle oil... so good! I don't know what they put in the au jus but it was divine! We both agreed that that was the best prime rib we've ever tasted. 

We were already bursting at the seams by the time dessert arrived, but the chocolate/dulce de leche dessert was pure heaven! It was rich and indulgent... everything I would ask for in a Christmas dessert. 

What prevents me from rating Society Cafe five stars is the service. The service we received wasn't bad by any means, but when a meal costs that much, I expect GREAT service along with it. Our waitress was nice but not once during any course did she ask how how meal was. A few times our glasses were empty and plates were cleared away. The restaurant wasn't terribly busy so the lack of attention was a little disheartening. 

Our meal at Society Cafe was a memorable one. I would love to try food off their regular menu sometime but if they offer a great prix fixe menu again, I'm so there!
