cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA I'm writing this on an empty stomach 1.5 hours after putting in my order.  It's Super Bowl Sunday, I drove all the way across town for some of my favorite pizza.  It's a 35 minute bake time.  After regular updates on the status of our pizza, we were told 1.5 hours later that it was never coming out, that the oven was broken, and that we wouldn't be able to eat.  We were offered the chance to order sandwiches with no assurance that they could come out within a half hour.  Bottom line: this is the most epic fail I've ever seen at any restaurant, and I'm going to show up hungry and late to my Super Bowl party.  

Giving us updates that clearly weren't accurate and a story that doesn't make sense didn't help.  The family at the table next to us were told that their pizza was accidentally given to a different party.  So who knows what the truth is.  

This is not an isolated problem.  

My favorite pizza from Chicago came to Phoenix and I couldn't wait to come.  

The first visit was fine.  But I did notice that people seated after us were given a two hour wait time for pizza.  I figured it was a one time thing or even a result of not having their act together yet.  

This location is destroying a great brand.  If you are willing to risk waiting an hour and a half to find out you're not eating pizza, go for it.
