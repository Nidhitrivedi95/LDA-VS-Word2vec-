-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q The service is awful!! The hostess was our waitress as well as everyone else's hostess and waitress. We felt rushed when ordering. They dont have a kids menu and you basically have to order what's on the menu as is. Although,  our first impression wasn't good. I do have to admit the food was delicious! We ordered the stuffed shrimp,  which were so good. The Italian stallion pizza was tasty as well. I would have given it a higher score for the food, but the service just wasn't good. We won't be going back.
