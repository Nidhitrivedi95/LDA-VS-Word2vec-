9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Finally made it back to one of my favorite patios in Phoenix for a delicious lunch! 

We enjoyed the Sardegna (baby spinach salad) with grilled shrimp and a Vegetariano  Saltinocca (sandwich) hot. 

The salad was absolutely perfect. Wouldn't change a thing. The shrimp was perfectly grilled. Plenty of candied walnuts and goat cheese with fresh strawberries and spinach. 

The Vegetariano was very good as well. Could have used a punch of flavor with a pesto or some kind of sauce. 

Great service and perfect seating on the patio engulfed by the big tree. 
Thanks Cibo!
