Really good food that is priced accordingly.  It's not cheap by nay means, but on par with any other good Italian restaurant off the strip.  You begin with free bread and a nice side salad for $3 more to any entree.  I had the gnocchi with prosciutto and coupled that with some drinks.  The gnocchi was exceptional but I wish it had more prosciutto and spinach to make it more a formidable dish.  The salad was fine, especially for $3 add on, but nothing more than a house salad.  The house wines were actually quite good and large portion.  Draft beers didn't have a large selection but they had a few IPAs and a few high ABV which I always appreciate. The greatest part was the bar area with plenty of TVs and good service from the bartender.  Overall I very much enjoyed my meal and would recommend Casa to anyone in the area or for someone looking for a romantic Italian not overly priced as if it were on the strip.  Half priced wine bottles on Monday and live music almost nonstop are always a plus as well.
