zluk4cL7Ch-uRlRply42ZQ Not that great, overall. 

I made reservations in advance for my boyfriends birthday. We got there a bit early but thankfully they were able to accommodate us. We sat down and were offered their bean dip...if it wasn't offered I wouldn't have ordered it. Not the greatest. We ordered the Chips & Dip for an appetizer (beef kabobs and 'homemade' chips with a Gorgonzola cheese). I would never order that again. The beef was great but just two 2 inch pieces. Not worth $10.

My boyfriend had the Filet mignon and said it was the best he had so I was very pleased because I wanted him to have is favorite meal for his big day! I had the shrimp pasta. The shrimp were huge (isn't that weird to say?). However, there was a lot of water. Not my favorite thing.

The atmosphere was weird. We were 2 of the youngest people there (25 & 27). Our server was for sure new.

I'm glad I went to experience it BUT I wouldn't go back...not really worth $100.
