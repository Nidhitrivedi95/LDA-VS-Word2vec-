I came here with a few business friends for lunch...took the recommendation from the waiter and had the Seafood Insalate.  

Lobster, crab, jumble shrimp, sliced boiled egg, tomatoes, greens.  
Healthy, refreshing, Abundant.  
I loved it except the price --$26.   
Food in Vegas is insanely expensive these days.  For that price we get two entries in LA.  

Wait staff is professional and friendly.
Interior is stylish and beautiful.

I will probably come back to try their signature items.
