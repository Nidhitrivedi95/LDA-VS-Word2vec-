a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w I am sorry to give one star, but after the second attempt I can definitely say that the food is VERY DISAPPOINTING! 
I tried the chef salad and the quality was just low. Usually I am an indiscriminate eater, but this salad was just disgusting. 
Second time I ordered the rigatoni four cheese and a Caesar salad... The pasta doesn't even taste pasta. I am from Italy, and in my opinion, pasta must to be cooked in certain ways. The rigatoni were overcooked and the cheese was bitter and just not good. The Caesar salad wasn't that bad, but neither special.
I am disappointed because a friend of mine recommended this place for pasta, but I didn't like it. I am sorry but I won't come back.
