xzxUkHFaKnykMO4_NUy09Q I have dined at The Cabin several times before and wanted to share the place with my friends. What a disappointing experience. Why do diners need a flat screen TV in the dining room? The ambiance was ruined - the fireplace was enough. Also, who runs out of their signature Zuppa di Angostura so close to the start of the dinner hour (5:30pm)? There were four of us in our party and three ordered that soup. Only one serving remained. I thought I was lucky to be the one to get that serving till it arrived at the table sans any recognizable lobster meat and certainly no tomato basil creme evident - nice presentation. Not so lucky, I guess, bottom of the pot. I also ordered the chocolate mousse; it tasted artificial and had been spooned over cholate syrup in the dish. Sweet but disappointing. Two of us ordered hot tea but only one tea bag was offered to each of us despite two refills of hot water. It seemed the waiter couldn't be bothered providing us with basic service much less a positive experience. He never made eye contact , was curt, and walked away from the table several times while we were talking to him. He has been a waiter there for years but his heart didn't seem in it last night. I won't go back anytime soon, if ever.
