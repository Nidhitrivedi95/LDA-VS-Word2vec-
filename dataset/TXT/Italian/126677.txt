HtpNW2ksFbflBHBs7t3AFw Went here for the first time for lunch today and have to say the chicken parmesan and steak sandwiches we ordered were pretty good. Was kind of confused at first because the sign said Don Franchesko rather than San Fransesco, although it is the same place.

Both sandwiches were 4.99 each and with extra toppings and a drink came up to $14.

The sandwiches were enormous, stuffed with lots of meat, big pieces of onions and hot peppers (they are super hot with the seeds in)

It was an impossible sandwich to finish, so you can definitely get two meals out of one if your not a big eater.  Im literally in a food coma while writing this off just half.

Make sure you ask them to cut the sandwich in half because its impossible to handle and the bread tends to break up.
