PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA WOW IS THIS PLACE LOUD. It may be a bit to trendy for my group of 40-70 year olds but we were deafened by the experience. They are only open a week or so, so we wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt when we sat for 20 min. Waiting for service but when the server showed up we couldn't hear her explain the menu concept.  

What we learned after several repeated explanations is that they intend everything to be shared since the food does not come out in "courses" like most restaurants, but rather inches ever the kitchen prepares them. We like "Tapas" but in most of those restaurants the atmosphere is relaxed and conducive to visiting and conversation. This place is NOT. 

The food was a bit over the top in the "unique" category... The older set in our group had a very hard time finding something they were comfortable with. Us "younger" folks thought it was interesting but most of the food seemed uninspired. 

Overall, we were pretty disappointed. In most cases we will give a place a 2nd try but this place just didn't have anything to offer to bring us back.
