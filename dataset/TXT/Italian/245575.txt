UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Mediocre at best!!
If you are looking for bland food and people watching Brio is the place to go..

I've had dinner in the past... It was awful then.. So I thought I would try lunch nearly  24 months later.. 
Bad idea. 

:( the food is grossly over priced for the quality of ingredients & dished offered.  
Thumbs down!
