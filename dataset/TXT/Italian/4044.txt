_GKMtL4zFOlNc0U3gljT0w I finally made it into Momenti last weekend.  The restaurant is located in a small narrow spot blended into Zoyo's next door with only a small number of tables.  The restaurant has its mission (statement) in chalk on the wall when you enter - unique.  It also has a series of photos from area the Shea/PV neighborhood - unique. The atmosphere is modern and matches the neighborhood.

When I placed my order, only one person was working the cash register, pizza oven and cleaning tables.  It was chaotic, but understood since it was around 4:00 p.m. and the dinner crew had not started.  I had ordered a margherita pizza, cheese pizza and salad.  The salad came out first, followed by the cheese pizza.  I waited for my margherita pizza.  The sole worker in the restaurant forgot about it and the pizza was partially burnt.  He gave me the pizza, apologized and cooked me a replacement pizza at no cost.  Both pizzas were good, albeit the first one had some burnt areas that needed to be discarded.

After 30 minutes another two employees came into the restaurant and the flow of traffic and cleanup improved.

I have lived in the neighborhood for about 12 years.  I must say that I am happy to have Momenti down the street.  The pizza and salad is reasonably priced at under ten dollars.  In addition, I enjoy Zoyo's that is next store without a wall in between.
I would say that the restaurant needs some braking in.  However, the pizza is good and the ambiance is even better.  Once the flow of business is improved, you have a winner.
