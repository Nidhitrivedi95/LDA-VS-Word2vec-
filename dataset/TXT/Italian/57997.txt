ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg Crust is generally a great place, but lunch was a disaster. They were severely understaffed and our lunch took over an hour. While the restaurant was busy, this is a crazy amount of time for lunch. Our drinks were never refilled, it took 35 minutes to get our pizza, and was impossible to get or check. 
My pizza was over cooked slightly. 
Overall, it's generally a nice place to go, but I would never come back for lunch, unless I had 2 hours to waste.
