Aw4HH_bjUL8L_EU61mgQHg Most disgusting place I have ever eaten at.

Customers look and act like a bunch of animals, and the place is extremely filthy.

They make you get your own drinks and silverware.

The girl taking the orders is very rude.  

I'm ordered a well done sub, and got a luke warm piece of chicken in between 2 cold, uncooked pieces of stale italian bread.

The wedding soup is probably the most tasteless and watery I have had.

If you are a disgusting animal, please eat here.   If you are human, go elsewhere.
