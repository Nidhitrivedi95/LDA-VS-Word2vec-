s7Pj1mNYqRTGNOXLOiBafw I went to Figo for a "fancy lady brunch for fancy ladies" (TM) on a Sunday afternoon. There were 15 of us so obviously we made a reservation, but miracle of miracles, they still had space for our large group when we called to book only five days out. Granted, when I arrived at 1:05 for our 1pm reservation, we had to wait a few minutes, but I think its totally reasonable to have this happen during a busy Sunday brunch. Our group gathered by the bar and chatted contently and I'd say by the time everyone arrived and completed our round of hugs we were sat by 1:15 ish. 

Because we had a group over eight we were required to order the prix fixe brunch menu, which were were informed of when making the reservation. And honestly, there's nothing else I would have wanted off the menu anyway. Plus, it seems a great value. $24 for three courses and coffee or tea. Figo also does an auto grat for groups this size, which is pretty standard practice. Plus our group of largely once and current service industry people enjoy the reduced stress of knowing the tip will be covered without much stress or Sunday hangover mental math.

So, WHAT ABOUT THE FOOD. I had the burrata with peach, thyme, basil and almonds for my first course and hello, yum. For me it was the perfect brunch starter: fresh, sweet, and a little earthy and salty, but not greasy at all. This is important because I knew I was going for the eggs Benedict for my main. Benedict for ever and always, and no I don't mean the Cumberbatch kind. 

Figo makes a nice variation of this dish with pepperonata and capers on a tomato focaccia. Almost made me not want ketchup. Almost. It does come with potatoes after all and what is a smashed breakfast potato without ketchup?

Third course was an Italian donut (bombolone) which was good but I could only muster a couple bites. I'm sure if I was less full by its arrival I would have enjoyed it more. There are certainly worse problems to have.
