SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ I'll give them a star for mediocre food and service but that doesn't at all make up for the experience we had. We could barely enjoy our meal because of where we were seated. We were seated by the fountain and although it looked peaceful, every 5 minutes someone from OUTSIDE the restaurant would walk past the hostesses and bump our table/chair just to take a picture of the fountain. We paid over $35 per person and some drunk guy almost fell on top of our table! I won't be returning. Go to Mesa Grill or even Cheesecake Factory for a better experience.
