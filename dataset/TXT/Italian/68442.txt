BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag My first time at LB.  Although my wife has enjoyed each of her previous visits.  Sunday brunch was busy with, what appeared to be, a full house.  And we really enjoyed the atmosphere and our fellow patrons.  Everyone appeared to be having a wonderful time on a beautiful morning.

Found the brunch menu to be traditional. Covering all the breakfast /lunch bases.  My wife had the Spanish Skillet and I the Eggs Benedict.   All in all, an OK meal.  My portion was very small and my wife's Skillet was sizable but short on everything except potatoes. We also found the service attentive albeit slow.  However, the waitstaff did a good job of keeping our  Mimosa and other drinks topped-off. Two meals arrived after several minutes; two others arrived several minutes later.

According to our guests our less-than-impressive effort was an exception.  We'll give it another try for dinner later in the Spring.
