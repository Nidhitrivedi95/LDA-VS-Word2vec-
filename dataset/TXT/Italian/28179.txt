4XDWHIN46wzg8MXpo8PvQA I've had two bad experiences here, both were the same issue. 

Once, was on new years eve. There was a young girl working the register. Once we ordered she informed us that even though it was not posted anywhere, they would be closing an hour early and that we would not be able to eat our food there. Luckily we hadn't paid and left.

The second time we went in the other night, it was 9:50pm and the store hours for that night said they are open until 10:30pm. We noticed there were already chairs sitting up on the tables and they were cleaning the place out. Once more we went in and asked if we had enough time to eat. The guy, who I believe is either the owner or manager of this location said "It depends on what you order and how long it takes us to fix it and how long it takes you to eat it." He went on to explain that they like customers out of there well before 10:30pm and that they are only open that late for pickup orders, even though this is not mentioned anywhere on any signs and seemed to be more of a on the spot rule. 

It's hilarious that some businesses get by operating like this. We live right down the street and wanted a good little dinner time pizza place to go to. 

The food itself is honestly not worth the price. The meatball sub is small and doesn't come with any chips, pickle or anything and the bread is too doughy. The pizza is very bland and as some one else said, always so scorching hot that it will burn a hole through iron if you're not careful. It's overly greasy, thin and just very bland.

There's so many better choices in the area for pizza establishments, don't waste your time on this one.
