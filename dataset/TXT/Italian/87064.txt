duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ Great happy hour specials and tasty food for dinner!

After hearing so much about this place from a buddy, I decided to come here for dinner one night. Luckily, I came right in time for Happy hour. Ordered the Ahi tuna cones $5, and I was presented with 2 very tiny and cute sesame ice cream cones filled soy sauce infused ahi tuna. Nice presentation. Then I got the beef sweet truffle slider $5 for 1 slider; the patty was overcooked and the truffle was too sweet and overpowered everything else inside the slider. Probably will not order that again. For my main entree, I got the braised short rib and that was absolutely delicious. I finished everything under 5 min, and was polishing the plate. 

Service was good, I sat by the bar and the bartender was super skilled and talented. I watched him make all sorts of fancy schmancy concoctions and watched people's faces lit up after sipping his creations. It was very entertaining. 

I would definitely like to come back and try some of the other options on the menu.
