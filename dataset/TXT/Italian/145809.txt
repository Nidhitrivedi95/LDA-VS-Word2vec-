K74HYkFjYwhEpJt8HTOxnQ New Year's Eve at Johnny's Fulton was an elegant way to welcome in 2016!  Bo and his family along with all the stellar staff made you feel like you traveled to NY to celebrate. A fantastic jazz trio along with their iconic dishes like their cherry walnut glazed duck appetizer and my long-bone veal chop with smoked Gouda made it a remarkable night! However big that wine cellar is, Bo and Ricky always have a knockout pairing for you at any level. Simple details such as the best damn cappuccino I've ever had with dessert completed an exceptional experience. Thank you so much. Buon Anno!
