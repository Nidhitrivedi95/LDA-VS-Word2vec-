dulgBrNtDCGjYcbQa2E6uA This restaurant had always been on my list but I never got the chance to go until just recently. 

Super super pricey. 6 small oysters for $23 bucks! Nuts! I had the lobster ravioli. It was ok. But wasn't good enough for a repeat visit. 

My guest seemed to like his tuna. 

Overall, it was an ok first and last experience at michaels.
