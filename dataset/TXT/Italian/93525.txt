Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag Across from the Aria (park there), inside the Crystals shopping above Starbucks... this was one of the BEST meals that I've had in Vegas.  From the Brioche to the squash soup and the Baby Kale Salad was amazing !  My date had the Chilean Sea Bass special at lunch - he said it was fabulous too.  Dessert was the Tira Misu - yummy !  Service fabulous, I felt like a Queen.  Met one of the chef's "Lucky" - very nice young man - service with a smile !  Definitely going there again.
