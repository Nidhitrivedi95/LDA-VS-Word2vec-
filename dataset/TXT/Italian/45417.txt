8MXlF26jvhrfGA9rcua2bg What can I say about my time in this restaurant? Horrible, would be kind.  You can't call a salad a salad if you only have 5 leaves and they are mostly red coral, a ton of cheese and dressing from a plastic bottle. The tomato sauce was beyond disgusting. You can't take mass produced canned tomato sauce and throw in herbs to a point you can't taste tomato anymore and call it homemade.  The lentil soup had so little lentils and so much pork in it that they should change the name.  It was also not very good tasting.  It was another dish that tasted like it came from a mass-produced facility and the same herbs that they dumped into the red sauce.  If you list a chicken dish that is dipped in Romano cheese and sauteed with tomatoes, you assume the chicken was sauteed, no, it was FRIED, tasteless and not worth a second bite. I had the steak with mashed potatoes. The steak was acceptable, but if that is the only good dish, I'll go to a steakhouse. The potatoes had a very bland potato flavor, needed salt for some flavor and looked grayish-brown that was not very appealing to the eye. We had a side of Mac & Cheese, how can it be watery and the pasta so soft it fell apart just looking at it. I will not be returning to this place.  Since I did eat the steak, we picked up McDonald's for my wife on the way home.
