q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ This review is mainly due to their group policies.  We have enjoyed the restaurant many times and have brought friends.  This week the group was for 12.  Upon arrival, we asked about separate tickets because most of the 12 were on expense accounts and needed receipts.  We were told their policy was a maximum of two cards.  When the issue was brought up, they agreed to accept 4 cards, all others needed to pay cash.  I won't speculate on reasons for this policy but we didn't have cash and we weren't one of the ones needing a receipt, so we left. We are very disappointed as we have introduced a significant number of people to this restaurant.  We can no longer recommend them based on their inability to accommodate business needs. We are searching for a new Italian restaurant that we can recommend to out of town diners.
