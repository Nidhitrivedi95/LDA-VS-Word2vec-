VoXUt6TIJWyIf_lihbN5xQ My dad and I come here for family birthday dinners and we really enjoy the menu and wine options. It's always busy there (which is a good sign) however, the hostesses seem overwhelmed and a bit disorganized at the host stand when they're on a wait list. I put our name on the wait list and they quoted 15 minutes, I told them I would be right outside the door waiting. I was lenient and didn't come back in until 25 minutes had gone by because I had a feeling they forgot about us (which they did). They offered us a table against the wall (which had been opened since I walked in and put my name on the wait list), seeming to lack confidence in selling that particular table to guests. I get it, every restaurant has that one awkward table that nobody wants to sit at. But it's better to offer it than not at all. Other than that incident, the food has always been amazing, server staff and management here is very friendly and helpful as well.
