Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A I was very excited to try caffe boa, because their food looks amazing however I never got to the food part. Our server was terrible and after my friends waited a half hour for their wine we were debating whether we should stay or not. In addition, we hadn't even been asked if we were ready to order. When the server did finally come around to take our order we told her to wait a minute, because at this point we wanted to speak to the manager. After he apologized, he offered to get us another server, but we had decided that it would just be best to go to Canteen down the street instead. The manager, Adam, was nice and apologetic but unfortunately the server whose name rhymes with men, was not remorseful at all and was just rude.
