NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA After hearing about this place for quite sometime, we went to Proper for my friend's birthday. We did not have much of a wait in the evening after 7 and our group of four was seated quickly. I noticed that it was rather dim lighting which isn't a problem for me but I know some people do not like this at all. We started with the Hummus Trio which was delicious. The only problem was that we had to ask for additional pita because they give you so little. The waiter did not have a problem with this and surprisingly we were not charged extra. Two of us wanted a house salad and the waiter again come to the rescue telling us to just order the large house salad and he would bring two salad plates rather than each ordering a half. Less money and more food that way! I like this guy!  I also ordered a from scratch wood fired pesto pizza. Incredible!  This is not your typical pepperoni pizza place so keep that in mind. What you are getting is an authentic wood fired pie with fresh ingredients.  

I greatly enjoyed our experience here and while I may not always be in the mood for this type of pizza, I'm glad to have finally tried it. I'll be back to try a few other options as well. The service was top notch! My one caveat here was their beer selection. Pretty much just your standard drafts. While there were a few craft selections, I'd like to see more variety. There are a lot of local options that would do great here!
