cy3Or8iSsDOmHBBu2MwnOg It has been years since I have been to Toscana, but after reviewing the 2017 Restaurant Week menu, I knew it was time to return.
Needless to say Toscana did not disappoint and again deserved 4 stars...why not 5? Unfortunately we had a new waitress and service/amount of time in between courses and are bill definitely could have been better.

With that said, let me tell you about the restaurant and food.  Toscana is a beautiful restaurant with attention to quality and service!  We had 7:00 reservations and were seated immediately.  The restaurant and bar were packed, which is always a good sign!  
As I mentioned above this dinner was during the 2017 Summer Restaurant Week so we had a limited, but a unique menu for this event.  Note: Toscana does allow customers to order from the full menu as well if you are not interested in the Restaurant Week options.  Several restaurants do not offer this.

We started with the mussels and mista and panzanella salads.  I loved the Panzanella, fresh tomatoes and cucumber with a light dressing and basil was my favorite. Others loved the mussels.
For the entrees, most stuck with the Risotto of the day, a garlic risotto with lobster, shrimp and fresh peas, it was amazing. I had the Parmesan Crusted Halibut, the fish special of the day, which might have been one of the best cooked fish I have ever had.  The entrees truly did not disappoint.
And, finally we ended the evening with Tiramisu, Cheesecake and a Chocolate Torte, all delicious as well.

After this experience I will not go as long as I did before returning to Toscana. I actually want to go back tonight and order from the regular menu, everything was that good!
