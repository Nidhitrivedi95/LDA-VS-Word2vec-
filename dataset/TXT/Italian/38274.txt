Because it's close, I have tried to move past the extreme lack of customer service. This has been a constant, in fact one of the counter staff misquoted a deal. I had ordered and asked a question, so she asked a coworker who told her she'd made a mistake, and there was no deal. I asked for it to be honored and got a no. A manager was brought over, she honored what I was told. Still no apology, I thanked the woman who made the mistake when paying. She told me not to expect this discount ever again. I was floored. Too bad, their hiring practices are so poor.
