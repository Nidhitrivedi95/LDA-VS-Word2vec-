86W-L1l70wL-7n0lSfoY-Q I wen't just recently for a co-workers birthday party. Starters was delicious and filling. I loved their freshly baked bread and the salad is divine. And it was hands down the best kebab I've had. It was a dinner special though so they might not have it available at all times... The gnocchi was also very good. And the port wine? ah, it was love:)
