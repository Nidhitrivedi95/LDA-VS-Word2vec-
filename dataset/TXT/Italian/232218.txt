TKhlt0jPUhJt10jgEKdWXg Probably the worst customer experience I've had in a long time. Buffet had 4 pizzas half picked over when the tour bus got here. The same bus comes at the SAME TIME EVERYDAY! you would think that the restaurant with guaranteed business everyday from the bus tours could capitalize and get an additional oven.  Pizza was average would not put the world famous title in front of it for any reason at all. Waiting staff were all very friendly and had no control over the kitchen.  Also had no noon meat options for those who choose not to eat whether for religious or non religious reasons. Food network sign should honestly be taken down.
