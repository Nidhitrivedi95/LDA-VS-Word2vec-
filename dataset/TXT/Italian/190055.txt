P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw Good food, crappy service.  Been here before,  but the service tonight was unacceptable.  We ordered a pizza,  fries and waters.  Had to wait long after our glasses were Empy for refils, and after we finished eating,  we waited over 30 minutes for our server to check in and see if everything was okay. At that point we simply wanted to leave and asked for a box and our check,  but we ended up waiting an extra 15 minutes for that.
the place was not packed by any means.  The only positive was green olives on the pizza.....
