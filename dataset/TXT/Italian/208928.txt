qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg MMmMm! if im craving for greek food, this is the place to go if you live in the North West area!  theres not many good restaurants up here but this is a good family restaurant! Hummus and pita bread was spot on. 
Its a big portion and well worth the price. I definitely would come back here.
