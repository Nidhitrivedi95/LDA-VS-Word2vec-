hTsZSiftorNUFb1VaHCHHg We went to Nook today for the first time, and WOW are we glad we did! Nice place, with a good size bar down one side. From the moment we walked in the door and sat down at the bar, everyone there made us feel welcome. Carrie was great behind the bar, and we wish we knew the name of the guy who fired up our pizza for us a half hour before it was time! It was AMAZING!! They went out of their way to make sure we were happy. We will be back immediately! Go there, and get one of those pizzas in your face right now!!
