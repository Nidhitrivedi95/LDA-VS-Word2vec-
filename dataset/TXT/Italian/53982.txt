A7waf6G3cvnLfAqKeLL8DA Best pasta I've had in Toronto. Everything you order is fresh, inventive and delicious! If you're lucky to grab a table (they fill up FAST), you will not regret it!

The only reason it's not 5 stars is that it's a bit on the pricey side, and I'm not as big a fan on the appetizers. The portion size is also on the small side - if you're hungry, you'll likely need to order an appetizer and/or dessert. 

However, I've never tasted a pasta there I didn't love, and I still fantasize about the Spaghetti Carbonara. If you're in the good for fresh, homemade Italian pasta, go now!

I also really like the decor - the outdoor patio feels like you are in an italian piazza, with brick walls all around. A great summer evening restaurant!
