jaicRYvLNQKT-iquYQ1wAA We hadn't been to Canelli's in a long while because, quite honestly, it just wasn't as good as it had been when it was first opened. In fact, we were disappointed  the last time we were there. Then we read on various review sites that it had changed ownership, and the reviews weren't great. Recently, reviews seemed to be better, so we decided to go tonight.  Our meal was fantastic. The service was good, the food was fresh and the prices very reasonable. If there were growing pains when the new owners took over, you'd never know it. It was busy, there was live music and it was a great evening. We will definitely put Canelli's back on our list of regular dining spots.
