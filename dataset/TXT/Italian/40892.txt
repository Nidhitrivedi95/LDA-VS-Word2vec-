7JkPRXmtRmspIX_k3zMNvg My wife and I had dinner here for the first time on Wednesday evening, and really enjoyed the whole experience.  We arrived early, around 5-ish, and so there were only a few other diners in the restaurant.   But from the moment we were greeted at the door by our eventual server, Luciano, we knew we were going to have a nice customer experience.   We took a comfortable table near the pizza oven so we could see all the activity, and started off with a nice bottle of Pinot Noir while we decided on our meal.  Since this was Wednesday, our bottle was  1/2 priced so that was a nice surprise.   Our server was GREAT!  Luciano had a big smile, was attentive and had a strong resemblance to Dustin Hoffman.   We ordered a salad to begin our meal and got so filled up on that, and the basket of warm, toasted bread that we ended up ordering one pizza to split between us.   Fabio "the pizza master" prepared a wonderful "Pizza Genova" cooked to perfection!  A little charring on the crust some thinly sliced Prosciutto and topped off with a bit of balsamic vinegar?  I especially like the hint of pesto on the crust. Excellent!

We will be back again soon and hope to replicate our initial experience.
