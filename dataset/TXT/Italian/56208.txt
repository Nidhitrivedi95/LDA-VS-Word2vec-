First off, when we went to get a table, the hostess asked my boyfriend and I if we were wearing inappropriate clothing.  However she did not ask any of the other people waiting this question.  She then proceeded to seat us far away from other customers.  We think she did it because we were on the younger end of their customer base.  Regardless, other high end Vegas restaurants (including some at the Wynn) don't do this and this place shouldn't have.

We both ordered a pasta appetizer to start off with.  In addition to the wine, this was one of the highlights of the meal.  I had the spaghetti with meat sauce and my companion had the gnocci.   Both were excellent but pricey (15-20 for a small bowl).  

The entrees were disappointing.  I had the fillet and my boyfriend had the rack of lamb.  Both were mediocre at best.  My fillet was suppose to have been medium but came out well done.  Again nothing spectacular except the price.  We were so disappointed that we skipped dessert and got the hell out of Dodge.

If you're looking for a fancy meal with good ambiance, skip this place.  I highly recommend other restaurants such as Le Cirque or Daniel Boulud instead of this waste of space.  Even the Wynn Buffet was better than this place.
