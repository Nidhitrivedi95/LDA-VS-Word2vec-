nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ The food was good,however the place was understaffed.The server really didnt know italian food or wine.We asked several questions about the wine list and nobody could properly answer them.If you work in an Italian restraunt you really should know the difference between chianti and barolo.Surprised they dont hire more experienced serversll
