TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag Ate here last night with friends and co-workers. While the food we ordered was flavorful, the service was horrible and slooooow. We waited almost an hour for the food to be served. The waiter could not be located and we had to ask the receptionist for drink refills. The manager (if that was the manager) just chatted with the receptionist staff and did not go around to check with customers. We were ready to leave when the food came. There are better options out there I bet. Avoid this place if you are in a hurry.
