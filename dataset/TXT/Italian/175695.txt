NFHlMOEyVsbqY_VQNJFafQ Driven by this restaurant 1000 times and finally decided to try it. It seems like it is a family owned, family run restaurant. There weren't many people in there, but I can't figure out why (it was a Tuesday night).   The food was excellent and the service was great as well. I really like the flat screen TVs that were scrolling pictures of the many different dishes. It gave me a good idea of what to order the next time I go in. Good stuff!
