fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w Nice spot to catch a quick drink or have a full blown meal. Everything from drunken bar food to giant steak dinners. Appetizers looked great but was forced to save my belly space for the 20oz rib eye... and a wise decision it was. Just enough food to fill me up and leave me satisfied. I'll definitely be visiting here again during my next time in Vegas.
