RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ Mineo's is in a league all its own when it comes to pizza. I'm not saying it's the best, but it's a very different slice altogether. 

Mineo's is a sweeter pizza, with plenty of cheese and an always crispy toasted crust. There is an art to eating Mineo's when you order in--you can't eat it immediately. Wait a couple minutes for it to cool down, but not too long! Mineo's is at it's very best when eaten fresh. 

This spot is always bustling, and the shop has recently taken over three full storefronts: a causal pizza parlor, an ice cream area, and restaurant/bar. There is a full bar in the restaurant, and beer in coolers in the other section. I was surprised how great the selection is! I've found some really hard to find stuff tucked away in the coolers.

The only downside to this spot is it's cash only, all the time. It's fine for a few slices, but can be tough if I want to grab a drink or entree. Not too much to complain about, always happy to snack on a slice.
