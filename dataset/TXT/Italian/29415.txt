5CqM8dr3d3LI_B-1_-5U7A I went to a Cleveland Playhouse Show this past weekend and decided to get dinner at Cibreo before the show. I went with my mom and we decided to share a few plates and have a glass of wine. It was a last minute decision on a Saturday night (@ around 5:30) so I knew that there was a good chance there would be no tables. That happened to be the case so we went to the bar. About 5 minutes later the Maitre D came up to us saying that there was a table that became available. SCORE! 

I wasn't super hungry so we ordered the calamari, the salmon, and the zeppolli to split. All three of the dishes were delicious and we really enjoyed the wine selections. The waitress was really knowledgeable about the selections and gave my mother a great recommendation that she loved. 

We will definitely be back again!
