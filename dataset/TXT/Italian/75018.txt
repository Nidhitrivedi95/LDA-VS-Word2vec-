Cr5CLpmVrmzFyz_RfQ6rmA I was always a big fan of Alice Fazooli's so when I heard that Scaddabush had taken over, I did not know what to expect but had to give it a try. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. 

We went on a Friday night and the restaurant was bumping. The vibes were good, the decor was nice, there was great music and it was not too loud - it was the place to be. They have an open concept kitchen so if your table is close to the kitchen, you get to see them cook which I really liked. The servers all sang along to the music which made it more entertaining and fun. The servers are very friendly and will go out of their way to help you, even if they are not serving your table.

We ordered the Calamari Fritti to start and when it comes to calamari, I can be very picky. But I was not disappointed; it was pretty good. My boyfriend ordered the Americano pizza and it was absolutely delicious. The only reason this review is 4 stars instead of 5, is due to my order of the Capri Pasta. I normally love seafood pasta, but I was pretty let down. There was not enough sauce and not much seafood. The pasta was not the greatest and they were stuck together.

But overall, it's a great restaurant and I would definitely come back. Prices are very reasonable. If you sign up for their Scaddabush Social Club (it's their free emailing list) on their website, you can get discounts.
