Pp93J9-VPxgEyMBB-NhUog I visited Pizzeria Napoletana during the 2012 August Italian week.  We were packed like sardines but what can I say about their pizza?  This is what pizza is supposed taste like! Even though I'm not Italian I would say that this is what home made pizza should taste like, not Pizza Hut, Domino's...

I will definitely go back accept this time not during an Italian festival!

Ciao!
