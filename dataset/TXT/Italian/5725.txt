_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw Top notch pizza place!  Everything was delicious, staff was super friendly (special shoutout to our waiter, Eli, who was outstanding!), great vibe throughout and the manager seems like a very nice guy.  I think Pomo is a wonderful addition to the Heritage District!  We'll be back!
