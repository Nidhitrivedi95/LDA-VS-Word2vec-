CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA I'd like to start by saying this place is hands down the best place to get pizza in the state. I'm quite the frequent flyer as I've been coming here 4 to 5 times a week for the last 8 years! And today was the day I decided to let the world know how awesome you guys truly are! There is one girl upfront in particular who inspired this review, Alex G as the receipt always says, who just blows me away everytime. She has exceptional customer service, and unfortunately that's just not as common these days. I'm normally in during the lunch rush and it never fails, she remembers my name and order. Although it's just a slice of pepperoni, salad and a drink, it's very impressive considering the amount of people that come in and out of here everyday! So shout out to you Alex G!! It may be something small but it's the small things we remember and that's what keeps me coming back, and the food of course! All of you are a very hard working group of people and I can't thank you enough for all your hard work to feed the hungry people of Tempe! Keep it up!!!
