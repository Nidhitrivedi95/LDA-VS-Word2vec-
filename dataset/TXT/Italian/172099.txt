N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ We drove from Aliante to here because of reviews. I had been asking my bf for 3 weeks to make the drive Bcz of the reviews. Since Ciao Ciao closed we are ruined - only secret pizza in the cosmopolitan has helped w our craving.
Pros: 
young lady @ register was super nice
Ranch dressing was good

Cons: 
beeping noise on register
Crust has NO taste/texture
Food needs garlic
Salad lettuce was not fresh
Display of cold pizza in glass has u ask is this going to be cooked or do we order fresh
No menu board behind register-u hv to read a menu@ register.
We waited awhile so ordered a salad Bcz we were starving & then they gave free apps to the booth behind us for waiting wtf! 
Bottom line: pricy-& I don't get the other rave reviews- there's 3-4 reviews like mine that are spot on.waste of $$$ & gas
