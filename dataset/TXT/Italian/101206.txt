fbZKVUec4oNGmPRXzWGpxQ I went again with my family this Xmas, and I am giving 4 stars (compared to my 3 star in a previous review) as this time most things went right. We had a super tasty pizza, very well cooked, crispy (perhaps too thin)  but complimented with many rich toppings. We did not left anything on the plate. The waiters were very busy this time so they did not spent much time questioning. We wanted some changes in the toppings, and were served as per request (it's not rare that waiters get changes in toppings wrong!)

There were many people and the tables were a bit too close to each other (a certain feel of lack of privacy) but I did not went to a romantic dinner!  The amount of noise was high as it seems there was a noisy group below and our table was close to the stairs, but that is called bad luck not bad service. Despite with many people, we got our pizzas in reasonable time, though the drinks came a bit late (and that do not require much time to serve).

The prices are reasonable good (ranging 7-8) and I have seen many pizzas in Edinburgh 8-10GBP, but in Malta 3-5 (5-7Eur)! 

I have not surveyed many Pizzerias in Edinburgh, and I am pretty sure that one could find same taste and perhaps cheaper - but this Bar Napoli is a good option, and not far from Princes street.  

4 stars well deserved for this time.
