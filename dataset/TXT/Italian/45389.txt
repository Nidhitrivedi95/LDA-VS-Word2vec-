8lZtLSeJVg28Gb75iklmmQ East Side used to be good, but getting worse each time I go. Placed order for a large cheese. Was told 15 minutes. 35 minutes later someone asked me what I was waiting for. I told them and they had no idea about my order. The pizza maker didn't speak English and the person at the register had to translate. They kept apologizing and said my pizza would be ready in a couple of minutes. They hadn't even made it yet. I  told them to just refund my money. It took 3 people to return cash. They offered to deliver a pizza to me at no charge but it would have been 830pm. I just got my money and left. don't think I'll be returning.
