-httBl6DSZiUtDX4SQWtag A nice, old school bakery and cafe in the heart of the Strip district. Although it's not among my absolute favorite bakeries in town, they've got some nice selections to choose from. Living nearby, I make a habit of dropping by Enrico's every once in while. The bread is hearty: rustic, massive loaves that could feed a family of eight or more. Biscotti are tasty. Plenty of other pastries available too, although they tend to be on the sweet/dessert-y side. Super, super friendly staff. Haven't tried the cafe.
