nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g The best thing about this restaurant is that it is incredibly convenient. It is right downtown and is very accessible. The design is quite lovely and intimate setting making it a nice dinner spot for a date or intimate outing. It is quite pricey but I always end up having left overs so portions are pretty fair.
