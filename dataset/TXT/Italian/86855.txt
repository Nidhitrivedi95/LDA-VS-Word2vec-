Positives:
If we are comparing apples to apples here (which is how I like to rate) it beats any other Italian place I've been to, of the common chain type. Why not 5 stars? With that being said, I have had some mom and pop Italian places that are absolutely unbeatable. We do not go to Olive Garden as it is bland. Oreganos? Anything but bland! They pack in the flavor on every dish I have ever had. I cook with a lot of flavor and I also expect to get it when I eat out. I don't do blah.  I love the degree of flavor this place dishes out. 

I got the Riga Tony (yes that's how they spell it here) and added meatballs. The fact that I finished my entire huge plate is a good sign. Or a bad one depending on how you look at it lol.  Full of flavor. My mom got the scampi pasta dish which was wonderful but it def has a spicy kick to it! My sister got the thin crust pepperoni pizza which was good. And no.. They didn't forget the pepperoni it's under the cheese! Haha. We wanted to finish strong with the calories so we got a pazzuki (cookie pizza with ice cream. SOO good. They bring out the cookie hot and a tad underdone to perfection.  We had a great server.

Negatives: 
It does take quite some time for your food to arrive.. But I guess if you want fresh you gotta wait.
