r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA Awesome food! Hands down the best Italian deli in AZ 
Just a note - the owner solicits for tips but the employees never see any of the tips.  Have always tipped 40-50% of my tab & a little upset about it now because I believed the employees serving me were actually receiving the $ at the end of their shift. Not the case. 
I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the owner soliciting for tips for his profit. Not cool :-|
