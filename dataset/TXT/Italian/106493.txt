fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg THis is my husbands favorite little sushi place! GReat food. I don't care for sushi so I usually just get noodles and a salad. (Also good)
Its a little far away from us so it's not that frequent that we go. I noticed that other people were saying the service is not that good. We've been there a few times and haven't had problems with the service. Still would go, cause my husband loves their sushi
