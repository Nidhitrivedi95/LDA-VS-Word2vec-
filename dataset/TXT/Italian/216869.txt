rUy2MtHyFv8pI7FOW1DE8w The food here was delicious. We had pizza, pasta, salads and wine, and all were top notch. The location and setting are both charming, would be a lovely spot for a date night. I would have given the restaurant a higher rating, except that the chef was so rude to us. Just a couple of minutes after we paid the check, when we were relaxing and chatting, the chef came over and gave us a huge guilt trip about how there were people waiting for tables, practically kicking us out of the restaurant. The hostess loudly complained as we were walking out about other people who had left because they didn't have tables available, and about us "finally" leaving (she even ran out onto the street to try and track the people down). It couldn't have been more than *5 minutes* from the time we paid the check until the time we left. I've never experienced such inhospitality at an otherwise friendly neighborhood restaurant. I hope they improve their attitude towards diners, because otherwise, it would have been a 4 or 5-star experience.
