rU3gQnwoCx_bjDJEsxathA I have come many times with my boyfriend or his family (they love it). Personally, I find it just okay. I have always been happy with their breakfast..especially the french toast or the waffles :) However, I have also tasted their pizza,soup and pasta..it was just okay.  The one dish I really enjoyed was the Asiago and Red Pepper Stuffed Chicken Breast,but it was a special and not on the regular menu. 

They have a small front patio that looks very inviting in the summer. The service is always good, the owner seems to always be there. The biggest problem is that it is just too crowded, and on a busy day its unbearably tight.
