k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ Best Italian in Phoenix. The pizza is superior to Federal and Bianco. The space is lovely. The bolognese is the best I have had and I am from NYC. I have had two "salads" which are, delightfully, actually hearty meals. Try the mozzarella en carrozza and the chicken milanese if you are a hearty eater! The service is never bad but never incredible.
