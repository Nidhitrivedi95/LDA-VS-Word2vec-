RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ Took a friend for a birthday dinner last week. I don't think there was anything to complain about really. The server, (Ian, I think) was wonderful. He was knowledgeable about wines as well as everything on the menu including the special of the day. One of the reasons I picked this place is because they have several gluten free items from which to choose. First, we had what I consider the best table in the place, right at the far southwest corner. Perfect view, wish we could have come at sunset, surely it would have been spectacular. We started off with red wine and pork belly for the appetizer. What I will share is that we thought we only ordered one, to share, but they brought us two, no worries, we enjoyed them. Then we had salads. My friend ordered the steak and I got the chicken, so we could try each others. Both were just fabulous. I was way too full for dessert but my friend made room for creme brulee which was very tasty. The entire meal was nicely done and enjoyable. The meal was not inexpensive, but you kind of know that going in, ours with tip was just over $200.
