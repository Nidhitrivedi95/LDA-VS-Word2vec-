svFq2-4Yv5bIXtB2EK24Ow Horrible service. I ordered a Arnold palmer and got a lemonade/ice coffee drink then they brought me a iced tea and after the third time I finally got my Arnold palmer. Then they charged my friend for both our meals when we split the bill and gave them 2 different debit cards and so now my friend has to wait 3-4 business days for the $40 to go back into his bank account from the waiter charging his card for my bill. I will not be going back.
