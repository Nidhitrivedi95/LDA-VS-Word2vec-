j54J0Ky4ruVbN_NTJ3daFg You have to go into your night at Girasole understanding that reservations may not matter, you could be waiting 20-45 minutes for a table, and you'll probably be sitting at a tiny crammed table right next to another group, but it's all worth it if you appreciate genuine Italian food. 

I had the special, bucatini all'amatriciana, which was fabulous and you could tell the noodles were homemade! Bruschetta, rose, and fresh table bread were all delicious. Only basic thing was the Penne with chicken, nothing special and could be made at home.

Overall one of our favorite easy Italian places in PGH
