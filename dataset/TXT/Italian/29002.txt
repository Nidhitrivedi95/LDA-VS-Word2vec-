5aRyuqJZSGp1fNXHQHMLjg Went there about a month ago with a deal certificate I got from one of the deal sites. Place is tiny, so probably not so good to eat there.. though there were a couple of tables outside I wouldn't mind sitting at if I was eating lunch. can not beat the lunch special.. wish work was closer, so I can go there for lunch... Pizza was excellent, services was fast. Only took about 10 min for the 2 XL pizzas to be made and they were hot and tasty. Looking forward to my next stop there.
