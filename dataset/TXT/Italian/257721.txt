w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A Hey so the pizza is Good , WAAY  over priced unless you go for their happy hour where you could order pizza half off from 2:30-4:30 (check the times to be sure) but  not  for take-out. You could order as many pizzas as many people are there for half price , then it's worth the money... also the red sauce for pasta is horrible,   But the salad house dressing is amazing!! I have visited this place many times over the last 10 years I have had hit-and-miss service which didn't bring me back for a long time but the most recent time I visited the service was very good .. 3 stars for Inconsistency , food and prices.
