7NucoWCjPzZyRPjsVR28xQ I don't remember how I got here, but my slice of cheese pizza at 4 in the morning hit the spot.  No, it wasn't artisan pizza.  But I wanted a greasy slice to fill me up, and I got what I paid for.  And $5 and some change?  Not bad at all.  A way better alternative to the McDonald's next door.
