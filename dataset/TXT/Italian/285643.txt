zFnPRtP7LGvr3sfxvy_dfg Awesome bartender David took the time to let me and the bf try a few different beers. David was very patient, knowledgable and welcoming. New to NoDa and already know that Evolution will be a go to spot.

Ended up meeting some really cool guys at the bar and very diverse. They also serve food which I didn't order this was strictly a liquid visit but will come back since they appear to have a nice following. 

Looking for a good beer spot that serves food, great selection of beer and awesome bartenders then check out Evolution which is also a local favorite from those I've talked too.
