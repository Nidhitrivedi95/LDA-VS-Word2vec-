wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q It's funny how we ended up checking yelp only to see if bad service is the norm here. Guess now we understand. The acceptable attire I.e hair styles are comparable to fast food joints. Short sleeves and all tatted up manager is not setting the example. We won't put our server on total blast but how would you feel if one of your apps that you ordered never made it out until the other one was fully eaten. It wasn't surprising to see that one of our entrées didn't come out until the other one was fully eaten as well. We ended up getting a bunch of I'm sorry's but A sign of true concern and understanding would have been at the very least a small discount on the meal. Obviously this did not happen. There are plenty of other restaurants on Stephanie and this place seriously needs to work on it's service standards.
