roz-ed8kvBF6fwKBPeJ49Q Outstanding food and engaging service. Ordered the amazing linguine with seafood fra diavola (spicy) style. Dish was loaded with fresh seafood (clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari) and pasta was al dente. I sopped it up with the delicious garlic bread that is complimentary. Carb overload but worth it! I also thoroughly enjoyed the authentic, NY style Cannoli. Incredible casing and filling like my days in growing up in New York. The food was a very solid 4.5 stars. What took my rating to 5 stars was the customer engagement and service. My server was Vincent. What an interesting, engaging, and warm human being. He sat down like a friend and we shared stories about New York, kids, movies, and food. He was like a friend who happen to be serving me a delicious meal. He also shared two shots of Sambucca with me to finish a great meal. He was  supported by excellent teammates like Andreas, another very genuine and wonderful guy. Just a phenomenal overall experience! Thumbs up and may you be lucky enough to enjoy the service of Vincent and Andreas during your meal! :-)
