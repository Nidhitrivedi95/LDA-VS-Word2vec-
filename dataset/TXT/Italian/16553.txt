1YdO6O1iEqhHTM-N0K5pHA so, i walked by this place a few weeks ago and noticed a sign 'closed temporarily due to family illness', ok..cool, whatever.  Yesterday walked by again and saw an eviction notice on the door, a cowrker and I decided to be nosey and looked in the windows the whole place had been gutted out. 

I guess the family illness was no customers....
