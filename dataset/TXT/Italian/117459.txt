GxfgOFgUhv2rfr3FXVWfCg Love PMD since i found out about it a few years back. Always get the deep dish and toppings depend (today was pineapple, mushroom, jalapeno and canadian bacon) and it was delicious. 

I dot have 1 gripe that kept me from 5 stars and that is because this time around the pizza was not as thick as usual. Last time i ordered it was a thick hearty pizza that tipped teh scales at 5lbs. todays was still tasty but the crust was a medium thickness not the typical deep dish thickness it came with.

Ordered delivery, told an hour came in an hour, new delivery driver, younger gentlemen extremely friendly as always.

Also love their Italian house salad, its massive and toppings are fresh. this coming from someone who typically hates salads.
