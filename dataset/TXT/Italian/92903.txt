Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag I wish I can give no star at all.

My wife and I had a long day and couldnt wait to come back to hotel.
we ordered food togo but the server is very unhelpful and they got our order wrong.
We ordered pasta and salad and they forgot to include the forks. 
When we call and complain to manager, he claims that they do not provide it unless we have to ask for it. Doe this make sense to you??
We have to ask for forks when we ordered pasta and salad??
What kind of service is that? 
manager is the biggest joke of all.
Doesn't even understand english.
All he said was "comeback and pick it up or ask for forks at your hotel".
what a jerk!!! 

I will never ever go back to this restaurant!!
