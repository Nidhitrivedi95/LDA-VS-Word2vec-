Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A This place takes my breath away. From the food, to the music, to the service, it reminds me of my very short time in Italy. Let me start by saying, the fact that this place is anything but a perfect five on here is a testament to the fact that most Americans dont know a thing about Italian food. This IS PERFECT pizza made in the way of the old country. Yes, it's a little soggy in the middle. It's supposed to be that way. So keep your stuffed crust. It just means Pomo will be less crowded for me......

So, anyway, the service here is impeccable. I always eat at the bar, but the waitresses are wonderful from my observation. The manager even takes time to explain  tricks of the trade when they have a minute to rest. You know what else makes me know its a great place? The staff wear perpetual smiles. You dont get that at places people dont want to work. I would also like to recognize the bartenders, Shannon and Amber. They make eating here very enjoyable.

The music is modern Italian music. Not some American New York or Chicago gangster stuff from the prohibition days. It just adds to my already visible Colgate smile. 

Dessert? Amazing! 

That is all. If you are a real foodie, you MUST try this wonderful place.
