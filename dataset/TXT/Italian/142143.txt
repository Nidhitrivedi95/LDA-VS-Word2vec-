JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A I have been going here since my first year of university. This place isn't kidding around when they say 24/7 and year round. Open on all holidays and Christmas. The ambiance is a bit romantic and cozy, filled with couples.Not the best place for lonely singles, but overall just a nice place to enjoy a Irish coffee with delicious cakes.
