j7yI3qYRsbGBUv9rShLCaQ Such rude service last night!
I got a medium 2-scoop in a cup take out gelato. Instead of it being $4 something like it was a few weeks ago when you order TAKE OUT gelato...it was $6.78.
Then the man complained that I was paying with a credit card...so he said he has to charge me $7 flat.

Unbelievable! I have never experienced this there, and it really makes me question if I ever want to go back there.
