3-6biVwm7VwPZ-k67jml-Q I sent my husband into Andreoli's to get authentic ladyfingers which are generally not carried in grocery stores.  We were in the neighborhood.  I didn't think to ask my husband the price until we got home and saw that the 17 oz. package was $14.99.  Outrageous!!!  I purchased the same bag at Guido's on Scottsdale and Shea several months ago and it was $4.99.  I will never go back to Andreoli's!
