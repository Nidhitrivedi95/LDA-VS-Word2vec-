My plan A spot closed early so i figured down the plaza is an ok joint i used to visit. Went in the store and waited 5mins to be seen even though there was no one in the shop. Had goofy mc doofus half ass take my order for a calzone. "that'll be like 20 mins or so homie" So i trusted is intelligence when it came to accurate time measurements. Walked to the chevron to go grab a soda, returned , again to an unmanned counter. Him and his pals are in back cursing,laughing and grab assing. Which isn't very good considering folks walk thru the door some with kids. He almost hands me the wrong order. I purchased a pepperoni calzone.  That was basically cheese and bread with 3 pepperoni's. It was uber greasy which is gnarly. I was really let down that I paid for a greasy slice of cheesy bread. Hope they up their game and ditch the scmucks, because there is a lot of unprofessional stuff that I witnessed.  I know it's not Dow Jones, but take some pride in work.
