FYWbBFMAoIKuQlbUcBa9Zw I am visiting from Chicago and I checked out Bloor street this afternoon in search of a pleasant looking restaurant with sidewalk dining.  It was time for lunch.  I paid $15.00 for the smallest salad I have ever seen.  It was the size of, at best, a side salad.  I finished it within 3 minutes.  After tax and tip, I paid $20.00.  Needless to say, I was expecting a hearty lunch size salad for that price and was absolutely shocked!  Don't go to Villa Restaurant if you are hungry, but if you do, bring lots of cash.
