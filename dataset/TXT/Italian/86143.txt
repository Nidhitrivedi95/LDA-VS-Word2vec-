dSnQTUJC0tCHadU1AGzvrw We have been here a few times. The bruschetta is great, but would be great to have more selection (especially if you have a bruschetta bar)-every one kinda has a sweet element. We prefer authentic, so it's a little eh. I haven't had the pasta yet, but have been told its good. Just went yesterday and had great service. A few months ago we had mediocre service. The location is great, especially sitting outside.
The dessert cassata is delicious! It's a decent neighborhood place.
