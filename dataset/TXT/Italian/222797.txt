SKpg4zgr83YPZ14uzhmn9g I love this place, been here several times for both happy hour and dinner.

This place has great happy hour!  It's fun to sit at the bar and Jeff is friendly and funny.  A couple of pizzas on the menu are half off and I had the Americana.  It was good...thin crusted and not greasy.  I could devour the whole pie. :) Beers was served in a chill glass and even though I am not a beer drinker, i enjoyed a beer there.  The Italian beer was light and smooth. 

For dinner, i had Lasagna.  It was fantastic and covered with mozzarella cheese.   Emiliana salad was yummy!  Mmmmm...it makes me hungry thinking about the food.  They do have live music on Saturday with a musician playing guitar and singing.  Overall, everything was amazing!

I would recommend this place!
