Bar tender was nice but talked to much so service was slow for all of us. I ordered the Cesar salad which was good. Then the veal Piccata which the Veal was good but the sauce was a little thick and sweat. They suggested the fried peppers as a side dish which was really bad and as a presentation looked the part. Also they were playing a monster movie on all the tv's that line the walls and it was a scene of a guy getting his face shot up which made eating pasta interesting. I would pass on this pace.
