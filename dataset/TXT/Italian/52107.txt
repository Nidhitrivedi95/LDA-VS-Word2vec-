9PZViPPXgOrk7rY1-K1tZg I have not eaten at a Streets of New York in years. We went last night to get some dinner. We arrived at 9 and they close at 10. We were the only ones there eating. The staff was very friendly. The pizza was way better than I remembered it being. Their wings are very good, we got medium but they were more on the mild side compared to other places. We will definitely be going back soon.
