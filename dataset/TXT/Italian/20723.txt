366FaRQ1MWEHBhaEKTcriQ Just a few days late on my review but I didnt forget about them. This place is amazing!!! Awesome food, awesome server  and awesome service!! First time here and I was very pleased. It looks small from the outside but it's fairly big inside. The food is not the only reason I would go back but the server she was sooo cool, you could tell she loved her job and wanted you to feel comfortable and at home. I would go back just to hear how her vacation went!
