sbm0jmhWui8YrvFgxnJ4kQ Would have given 0 stars.  Horrible service...eh food.  We LOVED everything we ever ordered from the west side location and had amazing customer service so we were pretty excited to be moving a block away from a Glass Nickel in Sun Prairie.  We have been disappointed pretty much EVERY time we've ordered.  I think we keep trying with the memory of the past, but after last night we are done.  Ordered shrimp po boy sandwich and fried cheese ravioli...shrimp was tough and chewy and ravioli was filled with meat.  I don't eat meat so I didn't want to eat the appetizer and called to let them know(in a cordial way).  Pretty much gave me $10 credit and hung up on me.  I hope this place just closes up, waste of space.
