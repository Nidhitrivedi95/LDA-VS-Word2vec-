5aRyuqJZSGp1fNXHQHMLjg There are surprisingly some really good pizzerias in the Valley of the scorching planet. Although shouldn't be surprising being that ex-wise guys so to speak relocate from the megaoplis in the northeast to the desert that the witness protection program made more famous, lol!

Anyone who thinks everyone hailing from you know where are arrogant, loudmouth "guidos." Frankie, owner and pizza chef of Mamma Mia's is so far removed from that stereotype.

First, the pizza. Got the large 18" plain (cheese only) pie. The crust is firm and thin, the sauce is slightly sweet and savory, using the best California grown plum tomatoes that are very consistent in taste and texture. This is not bland and salty hunts!!! The cheese is more flavorful than your everyday mozzerella. Excellent indeed, you can fold your slice and won't flop. Fork and knife? Fogetuhboutit!!!

I also bought 2 Manhattan Special expresso sodas made in Brooklyn. The first ingredient is pure coffee, nod carbonate water. Who da f*** needs red bull? This is a very popular soda in the NYC area, not well known outside the region. This got the attention of Frankie asking me where I'm from and replied I'm from Staten Island and Brooklyn, Frankie is from Brooklyn and new Jersey.

He hooked myself and my bro with an ice cream tiramisu that Frankie makes himself and is awesome. Very flavorful, not too sweet!

Frankie also hooked me up with samples of the tomatoes, fresh basil and cheese he uses on his pizza. I do cook and look forward to trying these ingredients in a dish or two. Thank you, Frankie

I truly recommend Mama Mia's, I frequented the original location on the SW corner of Indian School Rd and 40th St.
