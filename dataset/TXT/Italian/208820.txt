qRTbYc7ennnwfr992kfjdA Caffino is a nice little gem that's hidden in Liberty Village. I didn't know this place existed until a colleague suggested it for lunch. 

I love the decor of this place; it is romantic, yet also laid-back. This would be a great place for a lunch date.

I had the Robert De Niro Panini, also known as a Steak and Mushrooms Sandwich and it was appetizing. I've been told the pizza and risotto are also very good here.

The food was brought out pretty quickly, and our waitress was attentive, checking with us every now and then to make sure everything was okay. The prices are reasonable here and the portion sizes are decent. 

I'm in the area often, so I'll be sure to come back and try out other dishes, including the gnocchi - one of my colleagues had and it looked delicious!
