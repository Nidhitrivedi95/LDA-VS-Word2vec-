You have to figure out which counter to go to to place your order, but once you do and get your food, it's outstanding. We had the baked ziti with homemade sausage, and it was fantastic. The side dishes are also excellent, particularly the mustard potato salad. It's also a grocery store, with all kinds of tempting Italian delights. The dessert display also caught our eye, but unfortunately we were too full to partake! Highly recommended for a unique and delicious lunch experience.
