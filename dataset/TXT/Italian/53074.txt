a0imQZn-utjU8kyIfEdwLg Do not order the Grandma Pizza! It was the worst pizza we have ever eaten! Hidden under a glob of cheese and too much oregano you will find canned tomatoes that will slide right off the pizza! Zero flavor and super greasy! We could not eat it and ended up throwing the pizza in the garbage. The only pizza worth ordering is the white spinach pizza. The regular pizza sauce they use taste like something straight out of Domino's. Very disappointing for New Yorkers we will never go back.
