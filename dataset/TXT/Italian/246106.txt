UYJLWDj_jytplZEkjPe6sg Worst service I have experienced since moving to Arizona. I love Olive Garden as a chain and I have been to restaurants in several different states. This one started out badly. When we walked in, two servers and two hostesses were standing at the front counter complaining about their personal lives. No one looked at the door, no one greeted us, and when they finally acknowledged us, it was as though we were imposing on their lives. Once we finally got to the table, there were crumbs all over the bench. I can always understand this as I used to work as a server and bartender. When we asked for the host to bring something to clean it up, he brought a wet rag and not a dry one. Once we tried to get into our seats, he left without giving us a chance to ask for a dry towel to dry the seats. I decided to use my cloth napkin to clean it off-- as I was wearing a white dress. After sitting down and drying my seat (my significant other decided he would just tough it out in his black shorts), I looked up and realized 2 of the wine glasses which they set the table with were dirty and had actual food on the rims! After that, we still looked at the menu and thought about staying. As I said, I am pretty tolerant of dirty situations as a former server and bartender and I know how hard they work. Once 5 minutes passed and more than 5 staff members walked by without greeting us, we decided to walk out. 

I really love pasta and the way Olive Garden provides a consistent product throughout the US-- but, I will never be a patron of this specific location ever again.
