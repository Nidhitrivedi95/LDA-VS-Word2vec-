Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw Another Yelp find thanks to fellow Yelpers.  We decided against any buffets while in Vegas because we know there are good eats out there and we did find them.  We tried the Sicilian tripe soup. Didn't know Italians like tripe but I guess they do. Think of this soup as minestrone with pieces of tripe that are easy to chew because sometimes it could seem like you are chewing on rubber.

I recommend going for the hot sandwiches instead of the  cold ones since they seem to have more flavor.
