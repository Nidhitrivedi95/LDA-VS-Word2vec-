By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g When visit the famous Las Vegas, the price for dinner at a restaurant mean at least over $100. However i think this newly open restaurant doesn't know that overrated prices must come with satisfactory service. Well this place had the most horrible service in a Restaurant in Vegas. It took 30 min to sit us down, 30 min to ask us for our order and another 30 min to bring the food. Not many options on the menu ( 6 options). We order the schiacciatta pizza, a medium size entree with a salad.  I think I would say that pizza from Costco Warehouse would taste better. I visit Las Vegas several times a year so I won't come back to that restaurant.
