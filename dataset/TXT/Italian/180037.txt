nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A We grabbed dessert at Carlo's, and realized that there were not very many tables to sit and enjoy dessert, so we headed over to the restaurant bar.
Our server was very nice. She was attentive, nice, and pleasant to speak too. Ordered a few drinks, chowed down on our Canoli and chocolate mousse cheesecake, eventually we ordered some food (mac and cheese, calamari, they are standard off any Italian menu, however they were delicious!). The ambiance of the bar was very nice, it was packed and had a live singer (with a VERY nice voice, Thanks to the Fabulous Baker Boys!) it was so romantic, and straight out of a movie- I was so in love (we were on an anniversary trip:).

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it all, and look forward to visiting Buddy V's when we in town again! :)
