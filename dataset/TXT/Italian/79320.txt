D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg Went for Valentine's Day, so the menu was fixed and way expensive (expected I guess) but the food was meh.  Definitely not worth the price, it wasn't bad but was just OK.  My girlfriend's steak had to be sent back twice because it wasn't well done as requested.  The staff was very friendly - very slow but friendly.  The ambiance was great, but for the price I'll choose somewhere else next time.
