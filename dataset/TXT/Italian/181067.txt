nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Very large portions 3 course meal for $25 / person. The mussels, salmon, and lamb were all decent. Didn't enjoy the veal and panna cotta as much. The spaghetti with shrimp appetizer seemed a bit out of place on the menu, esp when there is a seafood pasta option in the entree. Friendly staff.
