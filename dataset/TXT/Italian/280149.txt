yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w This place is a step back to 1977 and for a really good meal at very reasonable prices it rocks. Very attentive and very knowledgable service. The prix fixe menu that includes highly drinkable red or white wine is great. If you want to see 70's celeb pics EVERYWHERE (99% of whom are deceased) and feel like it's the 70's again go check it out. A very professionally and well run spot. And fun. ***Great for large parties at the last minute!!*** as that's what we did and it was a blast.
