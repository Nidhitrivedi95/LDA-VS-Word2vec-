r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA Went there with my daughter and granddaughter today for the first time.  Read the reviews on Yelp and we were in the area, so we had to try it.  It is a busy little place.  Has a lot to offer for groceries and a large selection for their menu.  I had read about the Cheesesteak so I had to try it (Beef).  While its not like the Philly Cheesesteaks you get at Pat's Steak or Geno's Steak in Philadelphia, it was a close second.  Very testy.  My daughter had the Italian Combo and it was delicious.  We will be back and next time we will bring more family and friends.  Great job!!!!
