Service adequate. Lighting inside can be a little dim and hard to see the presentation. Good thing I brought a flash.

Came here to try the pizza. Had the Everyday Lunch Special for under $10. Starts with a half salad or a cup of soup then any of the smaller 9" pizzas on the menu or a half sandwich. Tried the Creamy Butternut Squash Soup which was tasty good and then the Schreiner's Sicilian Sausage Pizza with roasted fennel. Just the right amount of food to still feel like going back to work. Also tried the regular size pizza on another day when I could go home and take a cat nap afterwards. Ordered the Meat Lovers Pizza which has meatball, pepperoni, sausage, and panchetta. The pizzas are pretty good and it is fun see them being made in the open kitchen with the hot brick oven. You could easily order a few types of pizza and share them to experience all the different kinds.

I was hoping for more of a flavor explosion in my mouth but would still go back. Maybe the pizza just needed a drizzle of EVOO at the table and / or  a little more garlic in the red sauce. Looking forward to going back so I can try some of the other types of pizzas as well as the starters and their other types of food on the menu. Order up!
