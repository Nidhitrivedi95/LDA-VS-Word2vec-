nDfN1RkA40anfzjFGRO8qQ Went here for lunch, big mistake.  The nice is decked out nice for a strip-mall but the food just was not happening.  2 stars because the service was excellent.  

I got the Fettucine Alfredo with chicken.  The sauce was watery.  Alfredo watery?  Really?  The chicken was a good flavor, but the running sauce just takes away from the chicken.  And the parmesan cheese is on the table not freshly grated.  No thanks!
