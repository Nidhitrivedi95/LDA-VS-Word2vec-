KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ Don't let this place fool you.  They boast of being a gluten free restaurant so we were looking forward to trying it.   When my wife asked for a gluten free menu, our waiter said they don't have one.  He said he could point out the items that were gluten free.  He said this soup and the salad without crutons, but none of the pastas.   Really, I could have figured that out ... salad without crutons was glueten free - duh.  We asked why they advertise they have glueten free options.  He said he had to go ask the chef.  We didn't even both to wait for an answer and left.   The employees were not that friendly either.  Proceed at your own risk, but I wont be dining here.
