82-wE5pkxyBKhfxyyZap_A My girlfriend and I ordered the special #2: 1 topping pizza, "fingers" and fries. The pizza from this place is exceptionally terrible. They overloaded the amount of cheese on the pizza and didn't even cut the pizza all the way through. We both had 1 slice each and tossed it. The fries were just as bad they was no crunch to the fries, they're just painfully soggy. The chicken was ehhh okay. Wish I read the reviews more thoroughly on this website but like others I certainly learned my lesson. Wish I could get a refund.
