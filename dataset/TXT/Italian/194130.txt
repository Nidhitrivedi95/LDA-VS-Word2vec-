Walking in, you are warming greeted and introduced to the special menu, seasonal, and regular. The staff is so caring that you feel as if you are at dinner at a friends house.
The room is warm and casual yet tasteful. The food was great for the price. We had the caprese salad, crab cakes, orange roughy, and the protein dinner. Everything was perfectly seasoned and cooked well. 
As I said the real soul of establishment is it's team. Its truly a family owned and operated joint. I can't wait to go back.
