GbcFCQp9VmgMaW_jaMAq_Q So I Emailed the corporate office.  And this is the resonce I got;

Dear Sir,

Thank you for your feedback regarding your visit to Spaghetti Warehouse. We appreciate it greatly when our Guests take the time to provide feedback - it helps us to serve you better.

Please accept our apology for your unsatisfactory visit to our Pittsburgh restaurant. We want to apologize that the service and food provided did not meet your dining expectations and that your coat got spaghetti sauce on it from food falling to the floor. Your comments have been sent to our General Manager, Christopher Beers. We truly want our Guests to have an enjoyable experience when they visit us.

We do hope to have the opportunity to serve you again soon at Spaghetti Warehouse.

Sincerely,

Carissa M. Pennington
