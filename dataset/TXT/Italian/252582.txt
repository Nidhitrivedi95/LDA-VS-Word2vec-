VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Really nice venue, with a great huge bar. Having been to the original in midtown NYC this is nothing like it. The food isn't quite as good as NYC, but it's still decent for sure. We tried a slew of share-able foods. The service was excellent at the bar and at our table. The waitresses are all hotties, which is never a bad thing.

Food reviews from best to worst:

Kobe rice balls were by far the best thing we tasted, we ordered a second plate of them they were so good.

Kobe Meatball is excellent and huge, great meat texture.

Burrata salad was a special and was done nicely, but not as great as other spots nearby (such as B&B). 

Eggplant parm was decent, not enough sauce, and too heavy/oily.

Skipped Scallops and the calamari, since I'm allergic.
