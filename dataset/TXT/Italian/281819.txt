It seems the stock in trade of this place is solid food in enormous portions. We began with the bruschetta which was very tasty, though served on toasted Italian rolls which made too much bread for my taste. I just ate around it, though. Next came a slice of lasagne that could have easily fed 2 people, and probably 3, and a special spaghetti arrabiata with chick that was good for 2. Honestly I we go back we will split an entree. To finish the tiramisu was recommended. It too was good, though not great. It did not have enough layers of lady fingers for my taste. 

All in all a good meal, and a good place to go especially if you are really hungry.
