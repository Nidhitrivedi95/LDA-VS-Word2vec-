XXBZL4GxOvNyY5xOdDlN6g Was really expecting something special based on all the reviews but I'm sad to say my experience was borderline awful. 

To sum it up: the wine and bruschetta were the only good things we experienced. The service was awful - everything took forever, the waiter was all over the place (kept spilling wine and water when he filled our glasses because he was doing it really heavily and without paying attention), was pretty much unconcerned by our experience; my friends fettuccine was ice cold and he casually said he would warm it up and offered no apology or swap for another meal. The swordfish was suggested to me when I asked what fish was best (for 40$ i expect more than arugula, tomato sauce and strips of fish with cold potatoes on the side).

Overall really disappointed and will not be coming back.
