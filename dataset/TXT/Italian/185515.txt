oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ Went here for lunch on a Friday after my city hall wedding ceremony. Didn't make reservations, but our party of 9 was seated promptly. Food was delicious, and this was unanimously agreed upon by my husband's visiting Italian family. One of the guest's pizza arrived a bit later than our entrees so the chef gave us a complimentary dessert platter. Great dining experience, beautiful restaurant, yummy food and excellent service. Highly recommended!
