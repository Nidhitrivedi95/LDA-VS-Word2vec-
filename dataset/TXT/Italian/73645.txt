CO8MpD1bSkBPArXKBKkIfA My visit today was not very pleasant. I have been to this establishment many times and always order the Penne Rosa with parmesean crusted chicken. Today when I went they were very busy so I understand the long wait. However, they had to ask my what my order was 2 different times and when I finally got my food (I ordered togo) and got home I had received the small order of pasta when I ordered the regular and my chicken was in a little bowl on the side VERY overcooked! This was my first meal of the day so I wasn't very happy with what I received.
