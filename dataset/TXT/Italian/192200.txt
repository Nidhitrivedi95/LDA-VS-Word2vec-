pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Nora's - ate there once and no-mora! Food was fair, not great at all. Pizza - no real flavor to the dough, and ziti was half assed . If you want Italian food better than this you can find it at Parma 's  all day long. But make a reservation if more than four.  I'm Italian  - ate it all my life - don't set your expectations too high if you must eat at Nora's   Just because people say 3 generations of business doesn't always mean its good - I know some real shitty plumbers that have been in business longer!
