SEH79jbg5Q8cCozCnhqMHA My husband's favorite upscale Italian! (He is a noodle guy!) We have eaten there about every 4-6 weeks since we learned of it last summer! Pastas are handmade daily and are authentically Italian! I loved the set summer menu + have also loved their steak & fish! The flaming desserts are fun, along with live music nights! I loved the coffee and biscotti at the end of my meal!
