The house salad that came with my husband's meal was kinda plain. It was basically the lettuce mixture that comes in a bag with a 1/4 of a tomato wedge and 1 slice of cucumber  (this small salad) bit it was still good.
The bread is a very good crusty roll. 
We had enough food that there was plenty to take home for a snack later.
I recommend this resturant
