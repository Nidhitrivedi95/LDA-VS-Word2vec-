Lu5hB_5YtX5Re2067Zf3cg I don't know why its taken me so long to stop in here.  My hairdresser reminded me the other day that I really needed to give this place a try...and I'm glad I did.  I really enjoyed the ambiance a large bar with a wood fire oven fills one side of the restaurant and an extra dining area in the back plenty of room for larger parties.  The wine was great and the food was pretty good.  I enjoyed the complimentary white beans and bread very tasty...and I had an excellent pasta dish.  I'll be back soon to try some pizza.
