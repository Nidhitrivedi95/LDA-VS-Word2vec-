JqcYO5T8OZ8ukDPMwAzu7A This pizza does not disappoint!  We consider ourselves to be pizza experts and I will tell you, there is not a better pizza to be found in Lake County than this pizza.  The sauce is sweeter and the dough is fantastic.  We have also found their "Amazing Sandwiches" to be nameworthy.  I would recommend the Meatball one.  Also, under specialty pizzas, the Bacon BBQ is not to be missed.

The customer service is great as well!  Super friendly and attentive to make sure that each order is perfect!
