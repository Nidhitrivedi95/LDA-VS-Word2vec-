We got the The Malnati Chicago Classic.  Which is typically made with a "full layer" of Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust.  I asked for chunks of sausage instead and they said that would be no problem.  It came out perfect and our server said she orders it exactly the same as we did.

The sauce is perfect, not overly seasoned and extremely fresh!  Cheese is also excellent (fresh hand shredded and melted to perfection!).  The crust is awesome as well with a great yeast / butter flavor.

If you haven't tried Lou's, do yourself a favor and get there asap!
