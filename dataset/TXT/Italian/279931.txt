First of all, the concept of this old school Italian restaurant is different. There is a minimum $13 fee per person, but each entree is around $23-$41. This means that you can either choose to have a ton of food, or to pay the $13 fee which includes salad or soup, wine, garlic bread, and a cappuccino. 

For the 4 of us, we decided to just get 4 entrees so that we had extra to bring home. If you are just visiting and don't want leftovers, then I'd suggest just paying the $13 per person. I'd say that 3 entrees for 4 people would've been a good amount to order for us, since the soup/salad and garlic bread were pretty good and filling.

We really enjoyed the chicken parmesan and the lasagna. The spaghetti and 2 meatballs was pretty standard. We also got the linguini with chopped clams in white sauce and it was not very good.

I'd definitely come back for the ambiance, unlimited carafes of wine, garlic bread, and to try other pasta dishes. The service was great and they were very attentive in refilling our wine and bread. I was sad that the accordion player didn't come to our table, but maybe next time!
