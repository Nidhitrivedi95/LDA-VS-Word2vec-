mDiFWhywAziq9SKnj6am_Q Amazing food and atmosphere..  I had the Ricotta Bolognese and Melanie had the Gnocchi in a gorgonzola sauce, both fantastic.  Can't wait to go back and try other dishes.  Melanie has dined in Italy eating Gnocchi and she said Ziggy's was the best she's ever had.  We highly recommend Ziggy's.  Great to have them in the Neighborhood.
