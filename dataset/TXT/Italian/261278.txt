WpZkK951tqHONywmKLmhQw Horrible service. Our waitress Kristi was the worst waitress I have ever encountered. She spent most of her time standing beside the table next to us talking to her friends. She walked by our table numerous times while ignoring us and then would immediately go back to the table next to us to talk to her friends about her new job, how the days fly by, when she will know her next week schedule, (which is Saturday apparently) her personal life, etc. She wasn't polite whatsoever. My wifes salad (main entree) came out about 10 minutes after my sandwich and my son's food. I sat around waiting for her salad to arrive so I wasn't eating without her while my sandwich got cold. My wife called the restaurant later on to express her frustration to Mike "the manager" and he could really care less. It was obvious he wasn't listening to what my wife had to say and just wanted to get off the phone. I have been in retail management myself for over 10 years and that is not how you treat a customer with a concern or handle a customer service issue. This was my 1st visit to an Oreganos restaurant and it will definitely be my last.
