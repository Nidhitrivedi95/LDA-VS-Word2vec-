intKyiipUlHDWi_chv0f3A I lived in NYC for 20 years and can honestly say this is some of the very best food I've ever had! I've been twice now, and the short ribs tonight, completely sublime! We also had the scallops with corn succotash - really out of this world. The prices are beyond reasonable, and quality is absolutely top notch. The ambiance and decor is elegant, yet cozy and warm. This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland by far!
