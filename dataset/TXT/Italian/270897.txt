XPgurhZwZgNAwHcrpoe3Zg I've been eyeing this place for a long time and I was recently in the area (and craving Italian) so I stopped in. It was just before the lunch rush so I was able to browse their cute little store, which I bought some rigatoni pasta and ordered a chicken parm sandwich. The owner was so sweet and helpful- she told me it would be about a 15 minute wait. I sat myself in their adjacent dining room and waited. It turned out to be a 25 minute wait but the sandwich was amazing! Other than the longer wait time, I also was surprised that their bakery didn't have more desserts- just breads from what I saw. I would have definitely bought a dessert had I seen any. The prices are a bit steep as well- the pasta was $3.25, their canned soda $1 and the sandwich $10. 

I enjoyed the food, customer service and the pasta I cooked later that week. Good experience overall
