LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g Like the Italian restaurants I grew up with in San Francisco, a monument to thoughtful and meticulous choreography and attention to detail. I dined here twice in succession, almost completely different crews on the floor, so the quality was no fluke, it's intentional. The staff is very attentive and highly coordinated. The waiters know the menu in every detail and they also know the details that aren't on the menu; the bussers are in and out before you even realize something needs doing; and the restaurant manager has his eagle-eye everywhere like the conductor of a great symphony, making certain that the diner never sees under the hood and just hears the purr of the engine. The portions are ample and done however you ask for them to be done. The atmosphere is intimate and comforting, the lighting is moderate and soothing; I'd rather hear Sinatra coming over the surround sound but the ambient music is pleasant enough. I've never stayed in the Stratosphere and probably won't again, but I will gladly take the taxi ride to dine here again.
