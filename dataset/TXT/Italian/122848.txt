hHgSUnDB9yIrxUEMSmsdoQ I have to be in Oakland for work from time to time and this is the spot to go to. It gets really busy around lunch time though, so always better to order ahead. The chefs favorite piada is really good! Although I haven't tried anything else other than the tomato basil soup, that of which I wasn't a big fan of. Will definitely be back.
