MrmwDgMlL2GtthlAZsJwNQ I came here on a Friday night for dinner with some other friends. We didn't make reservations but we asked to be put on the list for both inside and outside (so we could just have our pick when the time came). The weather was so nice so we decided to wait for the patio which was nice cause they had cushions for us to sit on outside to wait. When we finally got in 20 min later we were greeted by our waitress and we all shared a bottle of wine, I had the naked mozerella which was amazing and the zucca which I wasn't sure I would like but it blew me right out of the water it was so good! It was easy for the waitress to split the bill which included splitting the price of the bottle of wine we had. 
I cant wait to go again! Best Italian food I've had
