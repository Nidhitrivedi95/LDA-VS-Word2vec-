eVurjy0t-82KGUfPf2ViGQ Domani's has always been a stand-by favourite of mine for years.
The pizza and pasta have always been excellent....light with deliciously balanced flavours.
The appetizers...their unique caesar great...have always been enticing 
And the mains excellent.

I haven't been there for the last couple of years 
And last night was anticipating good food and an enjoyable evening...
But was so disappointed.
The fussy white table cloths tell it all I think.
They are aspiring to be 'upscale'...
But the only thing 'up' is the price of the drinks.
The cooking is very heavy handed.

I will not be back.
