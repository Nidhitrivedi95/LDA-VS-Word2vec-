The calamari was cooked perfectly.  The pizzas are also made pretty well.  Although forgive me because I don't remember what type of pizza I bought.  

So why don't I give it 5 stars?  Well the night I came here, the service was pretty bad.  Kind of a bit of a wait to get the food which I don't mind much.  However, the orders on our food kept getting mixed up.  It happened three times this night.  The place wasn't really busy either.  There was also a bit of a wait for some simple water.  The waitress was nice and apologized.  I gave the benefit of the doubt this time because maybe it was a long day for the waitress, however, apologies can only get so far so hopefully it was just this time.   The food is really good though so just hope that when you go, the service is up to par.
