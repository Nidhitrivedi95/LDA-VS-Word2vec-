Mpnh7Hut-zO3U-kHy2LfRg I'm not sure if I caught them on an off day but the first thing when I walked in it took them a few minutes to even notice I was there. 
I ordered an panzerotti, it was HUGE. I was so excited to eat it only to find that half way thru the pan-z all I was eating was dough. Tbh, I'd rather them serve me a pan-z that was half the size with the same amount of ingredients. It was like a huge dissapointent
