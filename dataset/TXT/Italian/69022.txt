bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg Finding places like this makes me happy I use Yelp. Excellent service from the minute you walk in the door. Our service Oscar was polite and very prompt.the food is excellent and I am very picky about Italian food i.e. I don't eat at Olive Garden . It was a great find and definitely visit again when I'm in Vegas
