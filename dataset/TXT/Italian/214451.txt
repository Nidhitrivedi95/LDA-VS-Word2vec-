rIcEm0o8Xk413HWD4-f2QA Stopped in last night after seeing a movie and were pleasantly surprised. To us it was obvious that you order from the counter. After ordering they gave us a number to put on our table. The food came out quickly and was exactly as ordered. We sat on the patio which was lovely, but we were a little to close to the speaker which was too loud so it was difficult to carry on a conversation. It is the perfect type of place near the movie theater. The food was great. The only reasons I did not rate it higher was that it felt too cold to sit inside and the music was a little too loud outside.
