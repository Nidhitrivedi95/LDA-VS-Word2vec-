_e3rChyednoh47n2cjGv2w Well....this was another strange experience but 4 stars for the food. I just moved to this side of town so wanted to try a neighborhood joint. We walk in and an older lady greets us and seats us with no menus and walks away. Comes back and asks if we would like drinks and I order an iced t and my sister says water and maybe wine. She goes back inside (we sat outside) and grabs a wine list. Comes back and asks about apps. Leaves, comes back with my tea, asks about wine. Leaves, grabs menus, comes back with bread. Leaves, comes back to take order, leaves, comes back and says she forgot what we ordered. Brings soup, brings salad I never ordered, asks about wine again. Just back and forth and back and forth....I had told her it was my sister's bday but she just dropped off the check, didn't ask us for dessert (not asking for a free dessert but it was her bday, maybe she wanted dessert) which she did. We order dessert and coffee and it comes Togo. Why would it come in a box? So my sis says, can I eat it here? The young man that was a busser, I think, went and got it plated up. Coffee was lukewarm. When we went to pay, the young man asked us how much the tip was going to be so he could put it in the IPad. Just weird. Who does that? The food was very good though. The lasagna tasted like fresh pasta and had great flavor, the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and broccoli was amazing as well as the soup. Spinach and egg in a broth kinda soup. Dessert was tiramisu and cheesecake were both creamy and delicious. I really enjoyed the food. Maybe I'll just keep this place in mind for take out only.
