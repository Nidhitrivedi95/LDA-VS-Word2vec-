fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w Waiter was a straight up liar! Ordered the chicken with waffles..$16 cool no problem..I asked for a extra piece of chicken..Me personally prefer wings..they serve 2 chicken breast..anyway back to the extra piece..He charged me $2 for an extra piece..Which I never received..Pointed it out to him..He told me the waffle alone was $16.. menu clearly states "chicken and waffles" Like really dude? You think I just sat here and paid $16 for 1 waffle..I'm not a fan of chicken breast..Never have been..When i expressed my concerns it might be dry cause it's the breast..He ensures me its wasn't, and that it was flavorful..Ehhhhh I've had much better..Anyway thats why I gave it 2 stars cause dude lied about the price..Would not go again either
