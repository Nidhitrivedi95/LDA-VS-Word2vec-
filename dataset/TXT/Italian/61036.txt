Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg Since moving to the West Coast I've been on a constant search for good, cheap Italian food.  You might find a fantastic Italian meal at an expensive restaurant in the city, but the West Coast is conspicuously lacking the neighborhood delis that the East Coast so enjoys.

So it was a very pleasant surprise to find Roma while on a trip to Las Vegas.  This place is the real deal.  They serve fantastic sandwiches (I got the sausage and peppers) and have wonderful Italian desserts.  They even have a small grocery section so locals and buy the right pasta, tomatoes, and olive oils for real Italian cooking.  You won't see a can of Hunts crushed tomatoes here!

Also, I ran into Jerry Lewis here.  Random.
