8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA I am a huge pizza fanatic. I've probably  eaten at over 40 different pizza places in Vegas. (I've lived here for over 25 years.) This place have the best stuff pizza in town. If you like Chicago style,the ones here are pretty good too. The reason i only gave it 4 stars is because their regular crust pizza here is only ok,but their Chicago style and stuffed..are truly to die for.
