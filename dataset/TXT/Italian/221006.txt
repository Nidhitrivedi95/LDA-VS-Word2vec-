SEH79jbg5Q8cCozCnhqMHA Ate at their new location in Scottsdale last week. Not only is the restaurant very tastefully done inside but the food,service & presentation are excellent. We have been at the old location and very happy of the move to Scottsdale. Never had an average meal as it's usually very good. Strongly recommend the home made pasta's. We were also surprised with a male & female opera singer which added some charm.
