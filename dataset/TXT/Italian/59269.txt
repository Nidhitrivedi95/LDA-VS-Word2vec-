AsL41PPAeRkPwRbxLGjs4A Absolutely delicious! Family run business, a hidden gem. I was expecting a pizza joint - boy was I wrong - the server came over with the chalkboard menu and thoroughly explained each dish.  I started with a lobster bisque which had huge chunks of lobster followed by a perfectly cooked pappardelle with a succulent lamb meat sauce (came with a salad), others had Mussels and fries, Pasta Romanoff, a Mixed seafood pasta, Ravioli with a blue cheese sauce   We were a group of 9 people and everyone at the table was raving about their food. Portions are very generous  and the service was top notch. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I haven't yet gone back for another visit. Best part it's bring your own wine!
