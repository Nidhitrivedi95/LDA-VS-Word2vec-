VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w I went to Lavo, Fourth of July.  Had little trouble getting in, just stood in line with the regular folk around 11pm.  We were on the guest list through a promoter so ladies got writst bands for open bar from 11 to midnight.  There was no problem getting the wrist bands for the guestlist, which is nice because sometimes you go to clubs and the people with the lists ignore you and treat you like poopoo.

Guests staying at Palazzo got in free with showing their room key.

Open bar was ok except one of my girlfriends ordered a vodka tonic, and there was zero vodka.  It was free so it wasnt such a big deal.

PROs:  I never felt hot in this club, the AC system is superb.
Music is great, surprisingly very short wait if any for the bathroom
CONs: This place is always crowded, jammed packed with people.
You will get spilled on and you will get stepped on.
The door men need to really control the number of people they let in its ridiculous, they need to cut the number of people by half.
The featured DJ that weekend never showed up. 

We left around 1:30 because we got tired of being smashed up against people on the dancefloor.  The whole time I'm on the dance floor I was touching a minimum of 3 people at a time because it was so crowded.  I got elbowed, spilled on and stepped on so many times, i had to laugh it became funny .  haha
