The only bad thing is the strong smell of cigarette smoke inside. I was surprised since most businesses do not allow smoking, and I don't even know where it was coming from. Had to sit outside, luckily it was breezy but still 105. I wish we would've been able to sit inside. However pizza is blehhh no taste hard crust definitely not NY Pizza like I've had in NY.
