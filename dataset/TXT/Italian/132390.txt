Ijw0d-2wTcsciDesjCVgsA I went to Barro's for a small Italian sausage pizza to go. The staff was very pleasant and efficient. 
I ordered over the counter. 
I really didn't have to wait very long. 
When I got home, I opened the box to find a pizza full of cheese, and large chunks of meat.
The pizza was hot, and flavorful. The deep dish crust was crisp, and buttery. 
Over all, a nice experience. I would definitely go back.
