Actually had delivery last night, so I cannot comment on the establishment itself, but I have been in the parking lot many times.

We had pizza and pasta, and both were absolutely amazing. The funny thing was, I am told that last nights tasty treats were not as good as usual. I cannot imagine that, but it was said.

Normally I salt and cheese my pizza, but I ate this straight up, no flavorings. That is quite the accomplishment!!

The pasta (I forget which kind it was) had a really different but amazing flavor. I also enjoyed dunking the bread.

I am so excited to discover MM delivers to me, although I am not excited about the amount of weight I am going to gain as a result... better start doubling my diet pill intake...
