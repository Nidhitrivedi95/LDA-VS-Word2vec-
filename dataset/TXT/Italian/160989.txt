lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ Slice! is set up like a NY-style Italian restaurant -- or at least what I think of as one -- with plush red leather cushions, lots of wood, and slate grey walls.  There's plenty of pizza and pasta on the menu, of course.  The food's pretty good, although I think the pasta soundly trumped the pizza.  The menu of bottled beer is surprisingly huge.  The staff is friendly and patient.
