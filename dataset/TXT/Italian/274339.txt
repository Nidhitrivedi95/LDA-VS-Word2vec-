y1esDY2vFyaTMf1YlRT7ZA GREAT RESTAURANT!! I ordered the baked ziti and the first bite I took I noticed there was meat in it, and I am a vegetarian. I told my waitress and she immediately took it back and new one came out without meat within 5 minutes! The manager even came up and brought me the pasta. The customer service is amazing at this restaurant and so is the food! Some of the best baked ziti I have ever had, my date had the pesto with chicken and devoured it because it was so delicious!! I am new to Las Vegas and I will most definitely be coming back more often. If you are look for Italian and are having a toss up, choose this restaurant!
