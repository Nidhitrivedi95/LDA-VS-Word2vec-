n_xqf8Es-k2XBOneXfYGRg Tried this new place for lunch today. They have both a lunch menu and their full menu available. Our server was fantastic. Helped us to make an informed decision in which entrees we'd like the best. They have a great selection of beer and wine too. I have the piccata and my business partner had the manicotti. Both were excellent. Great portions without being to big. I would strongly recommend this place to any Italian food lover.
