15YuEFO59yXd7BTO5NZgYw Great food and easy to find location.  Parking is so-so, spots can be pretty tight.  The decor/ambiance is decent.  Pastas are good, Pizza is good, Salads are good.  It's more expensive than, say, Olive Garden...but you get what you pay for.  I would love to eat her more often!
