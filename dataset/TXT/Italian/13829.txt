1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ I love the fact that they have the classic pasta buy 1 get 1 free deal. Food wasn't bad, was actually pretty decent. Would come back but probably for to go.

Service - just for 4 people, it took forever to get a seat when the room only had 2 tables occupied. To top that off, my waitress was a real idiot. Couldn't get any of our orders correct then insults us. Awesome job AMY
