eQo4kIwIWJbAnfXYl3k5BA Went once for lunch. We had pizza, on a recommendation that it was the " best pie in town " . If it is in fact the best in town I would only make pizza at home. It was mediocre at best. Crust was just how I like it from a texture point perfect balance between chewiness and crunchy ends but it was only slightly more flavorful than a big chain fast food pizza place. The cheese was ok and the sauce was simple and unremarkable taste . The 3 toppings we ordered were mushroom , black olives and banana peppers they were eye appealing on the pie but not particularly anything special. The place was fairly busy and I will try another item off the menu another time and it better be better than the pizza . I thought the music in the restaurant as a bit odd it was a mix between the Sinatra channel and Mexican radio and was too loud for a lunchtime. I can't say that effected my review but it certainly didn't help it.
