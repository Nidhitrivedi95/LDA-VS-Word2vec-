The crew there  that is making pizzas now doesn't know the difference between round and square.  lol. I ordered the 2 square deep dish pizzas and got 2 little round pizzas. When I asked what happened the girl replied"that's how we make them". There are other pizza restaurant around here so you may want to go somewhere, where they know the difference between round and square.  The amount of cheese applied to the pie is getting smaller also.
