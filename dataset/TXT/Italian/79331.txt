D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg We headed here to celebrate my birthday this past weekend. The staff is very welcoming and we were seated quickly. Our reservation was for 9:30 on a Friday night and the restaurant was pretty empty. It took a few minutes for our waiter to greet us. Once he made it to our table he was awesome. He clearly explained the menu and have a great personality. Wine took longer than expected to come to the table. The waiter did bring us a couple of glasses of champagne to help celebrate my birthday.

The appetizer Shrimp FrancaiseI is absolutely amazing. Four our main entrees I ordered the Rigatoni with chicken and my fiancé ordered the Ravioli. She loved her plate, my plate was okay. My plate was okay not anything to brag about.

The place looks awesome and very nicely decorated. The views are amazing.

The house also gave me a free dessert on the house the bread pudding. This was absolutely amazing. 

Overall, I can say I left a fan and would probably go back primarily because our waiter was awesome and took great care of us.
