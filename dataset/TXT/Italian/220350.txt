SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Stumbled upon this place while I was driving around for a place to eat dinner. I noticed the parking lot was full so decided to pull in and find a parking spot which took a while BC the lot was full. I made it in just before HH ended so I took advantage of the discounted beverages. 

I sat in the dinning room which dark but I noticed this place is definitely a locals joint. I Started off with a wedge salad that didn't disappoint followed by the 12 oz bone in Kansas City steak and side of truffle mac & cheese. The steak was tender, juicy and the mac & cheese was solid. 

Overall a good dinner with cordial service from my waitress at a reasonable price.
