9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg Don't normally go to this part of town but this restaurant was recommended to me. My husband and I split the avocado bruschetta, a chicken pizza, and a tiramisu and everything was super delicious. The service was good, and our bill only came to $70 which is pretty decent for a dinner for two which included a bottle of red wine. Highly recommend this place. Can't wait to go back and try their pasta.
