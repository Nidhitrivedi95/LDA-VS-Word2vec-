7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw We stopped by here for lunch and were pleased with our experience. The decor is very clean and modern, and the ceilings are high with an open kitchen, giving the entire place a roomy feel. The dining area can get tight I'm sure during heavy hours, but we came as the lunch rush was winding down, so it wasn't too bad. The servers were on top of everything even with plenty to deal with. It has the feel of a busy, hustle and bustle type of place where you would catch a meal at random or a drink after work. The food was good and about what I expected... tasty but not too complicated. The prices are reasonable because the portions are large. I had a sausage pasta and my wife ordered a California strawberry salad of some sort, but both tasted great and fresh. I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch but it may be too crowded for dinner to be worth it.
