bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw My first experience at Vivace was divine.  The atmosphere was fantastic and the food was every better.  Our selections included the the Steamed P.E.I mussels (good), a Caesar Salad (nice), Scallop Risotto (I am a fan!), and mint chocolate Gelato O Sorbetto for dessert (fabulous).  We brought in our own bottle of wine (superb) and paid a $10 corking fee.  My strongest advice is to make reservations otherwise, you will have to wait.  We had an early dinner @ 6:15 so that we could attend the Kirk Whalum concert (nice).  The only drawback was that we were seated near the register used by the wait staff so they tended to congregate in that area.  Check out my photos.
