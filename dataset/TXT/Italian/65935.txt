bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw Food was delicious. Waiter was professional. Server ruined my table's experience. When asked for dressing, the server placed it on the very edge of the table. Then when he placed an entree on the table, he tilted the dish to where the sauce spilled onto the table. We then saw him arguing very openly with a cook. The final straw was when he was delivering our desserts so we simply & nicely asked him which dessert was what & he VERY rudely answered with unnecessary attitude, talking as if the identity of the desserts was obvious. We asked to talk to Jay, the manager, who sat down at our table. When we described to him in detail what occurred, the  manager apologized but stated "Anthony (the server) usually works in the back of the kitchen but sometimes works on the floor. We battle with him being recently diagnosed as bipolar". The manager then tried to make small talk & did not comp us for the horrible service we received. We were all so troubled by our experience that we didn't even have the appetite for dessert.
