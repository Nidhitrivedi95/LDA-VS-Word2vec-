6PQve0oFCLPSh4wnIzvJtg WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE? New ownership and it went downhill, that's what! The older husband and wife sold out and the new owners don't have a clue.

Came in and noticed decor was gone and it was bare looking. We were greeted by a 'host' who was a guy with unkept below shoulder hair wearing camo shorts and a wrinkled shirt. Acted like he was stoned. I couldn't believe any restaurant would have a host or server that presented themselves like that. We were seated, got our drink orders and then no waiter for 15 mins. We called someone over and placed our food order. It came out WRONG. Like COMPLETELY WRONG. And the delicious soft bread the used to serve is no more - not even offered.

The food was so-so. Pizza was burned black on the bottom and no flavor. Pasta was meh. Meatballs were mush.

Overheard waiter and cook using foul language in the kitchen.

Just terrible. This was such a great spot. Never again.
