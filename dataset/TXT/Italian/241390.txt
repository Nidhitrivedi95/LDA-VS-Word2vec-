UHPjDgiEHnTe7-MP-b2kyQ I don't like Italian food. I lived in Italy for 5 months so don't get offended. I cook a lot of pasta, panini, and pizza for myself, so paying someone else to do it isn't my cup of tea. I didn't have a choice going here because it was a group decision. Now that you think I am a huge brat let me redeem myself. This place is delicious. It is not your Olive Garden type of place. It is actually real Italian food. The service was great and we were a big group of 12. I tried a little bit of everyone's plate and it was all delicious. I highly recommend the calamari pasta. The sauce was light but had a lot of flavor. If I ever do decide to eat at an Italian place this will definitely be the place I will go.
