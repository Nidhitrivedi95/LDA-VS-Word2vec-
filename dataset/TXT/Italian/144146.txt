jWlErd3TOkO4C0MgP8eDvw DO NOT come here if you want to have a larger party/celebration. I am getting married on July 5, 2014 and planning the rehearsal dinner has been the biggest headache of all. Since many friends and family are coming from out of town, we wanted to showcase Pittsburgh on the 4th of July with a great fireworks display and a great restaurant on Mt. Washington (where we live). We attempted to plan our dinner at Bella Vista but Rose, supposedly the events manager, was less than helpful and pleasant.  We kept getting the run around ("we are busy the holidays, can we discuss prices or even if the cook can do this event after New Year's? "). After the holidays, we called back mid - January and the same run around but this time, the excuse was for Valentine's Day. We called back end of February.  And guess what, Rose was "not there", "in a meeting", "on a call".......and when we finally were able to speak with Rose, "can we discuss prices next time? I need to speak with the cook to see if we can do this." No Rose. We cannot discuss next time and we are canceling. You have not been helpful and I will never eat at that restaurant.  I am in sales and when someone tells me that they would want to reserve out the whole restaurant,  I would go above and beyond. But Rose, you are an epic failure for your establishment and I will tell everyone that I encounter, never to eat there. Thanks for causing undue stress and frustration while planning my wedding. Thankfully Lidia's was accommodating. And that is how you run a successful business.
