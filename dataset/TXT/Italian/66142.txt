BMR_AsSBzTQHqW-SQabI4w Though a chain pizza place, I have never had a bad experience at any of the California Pizza Kitchens that I've been to!

I believe that I've eaten at this location three times over the last several years. I've only ever had pizza here - Pear Gorgonzola, Hawaiian BBQ, and White Cheese. All three of these pizzas were delicious. I'm actually dreaming of the White Pizza right now! 

Service has been OK. The wait time has never been quick, but I've also never become irritated by the wait... maybe 30 minutes or so. 

Even though CPK isn't as exciting as a local, hole-in-the-wall type pizza place, they consistently deliver good food with descent service at a moderate price. And since I like consistency, and am dreaming of their pizza right now, I give them 4 stars!
