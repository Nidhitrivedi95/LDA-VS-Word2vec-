cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q Came here with my family for the never ending pasta bowl! Yay! It's back!!! Our server, Katie, was excellent and attentive. Food came out quickly, which is a plus because we've had times when it would take forever to get those additional bowls of pasta. I guess my only complaint is that they would only take one of my kid's free meal coupons, saying that they could only use one coupon per ticket even though the coupon doesn't have lost any restrictions. I've been to other locations and that's never been a problem.
