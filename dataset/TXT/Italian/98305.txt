Ew9YPQV9g4a-L8NjigV0NQ The food is consistently good whether we dine in or carry out. This is one of those local gems, food-wise.  I've been to many Italian restaurants throughout the country and this is up there as far as food quality. That being said, I do have 2  complaints.

1. They don't open until 2pm, so during the week this just isn't a lunch option. The hours (at this time) are listed on yelp incorrectly and I have notified yelp. Check their website for correct hours. 

2. Service - rarely service with a smile. Sometimes we get the impression that we are an annoyance and all though we may crave their food, dining there isn't exactly a pleasant experience.
