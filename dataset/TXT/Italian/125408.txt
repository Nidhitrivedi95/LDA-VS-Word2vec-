Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A My date and I had a very nice evening here. We started with the Charcutrie 5...pate, lardo, buffetta, goat cheese, prosciutto...all very tasty,  the goat cheese and pate was my favorite and I slathered on some of the grainy mustard and the red pepper petso...it was a nice display, dips of the different cheses and pates all around on a board with side accompanients and very good sour dough bread...then I had the halibut, my date had the chicken marsala, both very delicious and I had a delicious wine Veddechio and it might have been from Croatia as much of the delicious wine list is. I had a couple tastings of a couple other wines, all very unique and interesting. Our waitress was charming, Natasha and we had a few others attend to our table as well, Eric and another gentlemen as well as the owner is very hands on and greets and chats as well. It was a beautiful atmosphere, full of dinner guests chatting and I think there was some drinking going on as a lot of people were laughing and leaning out of their chairs and a others on dates like ourselves etc...Its a very homey place to enjoy with good friends. The best thing about it was the specials I got onscreen once I checked in, it was outrageous, it was as if they had a seperate menu for 50 off, any wine by the glass, the chicken marsala, the ears of grilled corn appetizer...which we got also, very delicous and 4 toasty grilled buttery ears...that was the best part...OH and the other best part was the fabulous TiraMisu we got to go, we should have got 2 slices because when my bf was watching a movie at home and glued in on the tv, I scooped that tiramisu up, it was divine...very creamy and tasted like silk heaven.
Order the Tiramisu for sure and the Veddechio wine. Ciao'
