72_6srKAdZPSHCGNwK2Hfg After a few attempts at ordering what we had hoped to be a decent Italian delivery, sadly disappointed.

Pizza was okay.  Not great.  Crust a bit thin so gets a little soggy and sauce aways gives me heartburn.

Pasta - avoid alfredo.  Just not good.  Hard to mess up alfredo but just not good.
Carbonara sauce - is okay but hit and miss.  Sometimes quite runny/oily.  

Chicken Parmesan - absolutely terrible.  Worst thing I've ever tried.  Over cooked on outside and bizarre rubbery meat.  Could not eat more than a bite...even then kept thinking about whether I was going to be sick later.  (I wasn't)

Having given this multiple tries (I really wanted to be wrong) I won't be ordering from there again.

Only good thing - to can order only me easily and flexible on options.
