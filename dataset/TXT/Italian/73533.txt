CnHMPB1BZL7Nx2OyCsSAVQ Recently tried their brunch. They have some decent menu items and variety. Coffee was pretty decent which is always a must review for a brunch place. They say they charge for refills but they didn't charge us. They also say their 3 egg BIG breakfast comes with 3 eggs but it came with 2. Perhaps I didn't read the fine print about the pre-11am deal which is $7.99 for a bacon, sausage and 3 egg breakfast (save 2 dollars and save 1 egg?) Anyway, the potato rosti square was a nice change from hashbrowns and the bacon plus sausage was generous. 

My dining companion enjoyed French Toast - 1 big slab but seemed really good and filling. Also $13+. 

Overall, prices are to be expected for this area and food quality was good. I wouldn't run back here but if I was West of Woodbine and too lazy to walk into the Beach proper (which I was) I would stop here again.
