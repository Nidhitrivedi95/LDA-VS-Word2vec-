SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg Had the brunch. It's 3 hours later I am still full. I had the Chicken Florentine my husband got the steak. Holy moly this was so good. The steak was perfect. The chicken wonderful. This was a 3 course meal. My husband had a Mac cheese with  prosciutto I had  bruschetta as our first course Delicious! 
We ordered bottomless mimosa's. They were an art experience. Almost to pretty to drink. Then the desserts seriously this is an artist making theses items. 
All in front of the fountains. The view is so breathtaking. Frank our waiter was a pleasant person. 
Now the only thing that bothered me. Why go to this beautiful restaurant and spend your whole time looking at your phone. People look up your missing so much. We were sitting looking and talking to each other I started looking from my seat at the show. Than noticed a couple looking at there phone the who time. They weren't the Only people. It makes me sad how much people depend on there phones for entertainment. 
All in all loved this place. Go but leave your phone on your purse or pockets.
