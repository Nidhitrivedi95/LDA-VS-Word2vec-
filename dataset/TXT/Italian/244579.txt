uuaH1UNcqcV-alT6nh42WA Ordered pizza and salad for takeout on the way home from work.  Pizza was very thin which I loved, but the cheese wasn't tasty and the veggies were just blah. The salads were gross.  The tomatoes looked like they had just been recovered from the dumpster.  Man, I miss good pizza in Las Vegas.  Where are you?!
