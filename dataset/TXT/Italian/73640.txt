CO8MpD1bSkBPArXKBKkIfA First time in this location, second time overall.  I love noodles, even thought this is nothing comparing to Chinese good, it's still very tasty.

I had the regular Spaghetti & Meatballs, the portion wasn't all that big as it came in an even bigger bowl, it's about half full.  The noodles cooked just right, but the meatballs are a tad bit salty, I think it came with 5 meatballs.  They serve Coke products.  My meal came close to $9.  Not really sure if it's really worth the price to go again.

Maybe I'll give it a try again in a year or so.
