UlSvQqRRzrqRy5i5hHlQaA I would give this place 0 stars if I could. The best part of the entire meal was the complimentary bread they give. There wasn't much to choose from on the menus and was very pricy!! To start we had the mushrooms as an app, awful don't recommend, comes 4 in an order, stuffed with sausage and blah blah they were hardly stuffed and the Panko on top tasted burnt and the tomato cream sauce was luke warm and tasted like tomato sauce from the can. Then I had the "fettuccine carrabba" it was awful. It was greasy and tasteless! Chicken was burnt and the peas inside were still frozen !!! Wtf don't recommend coming here !
