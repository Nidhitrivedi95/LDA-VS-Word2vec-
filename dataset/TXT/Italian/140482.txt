JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw I've been to Chinato twice and enjoyed myself both times. I've sat in the downstairs dining room the first time and upstairs most recently. Generally, the ambience is romantic with low lighting, modern, but comfortable seating, elegant silverware and dressed up wait staff. The upstairs dining room is a bit noisy, especially when full. The male bathroom could use more frequent cleaning; there was toilet paper in the floor and water splashed around the sinks.

I like the complimentary bread that comes with the meal, however some of my friends found it dry and tough, which it is. The accompanying EVOO is delicious, so dip away.

Both times I've dined here, I've shared meals with friends. Their pasta dishes are incredible. The pasta is always al dente and seasoned well. The dishes were tasty, beautifully seasoned. I also like they have two portion sizes options for their pasta dishes.

As you can expect, the service is generally very good. The staff is friendly, warm and mindful. On nights, however, that are busy, you may need to call your server over once or twice. Otherwise, if you're looking for a nice dining experience, perhaps for a special night even, and want to support a local celebrity chef, then Chinato is a fine choice.
