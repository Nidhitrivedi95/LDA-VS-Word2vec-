There are two high top tables at the front of the restaurant and despite having made reservations, that's where we were placed. The chairs are on the nicer side as far as  high top/bar stools go, but for a 2 hour meal, it's incredibly uncomfortable to be propping yourself up on bar chairs throughout the entire meal and especially awkward for women in skirts and sandals.

The food was wonderful and with the exception of the cotton candy that we didn't get, but had to request, there were no service problems (and we were given the cotton candy to go, which we appreciated). We had a flatbread and salad to start, both were excellent. For our main course, we had the hangar steak and ravioli - both excellent. Dessert was the noca Hoho and an almond blueberry tart - also excellent. 

So, no complaints about the food, but frankly, it was hard to enjoy it when we were so uncomfortable at the table. If we go again, and we'd like to, we will definitely request that we not be placed at those tables.
