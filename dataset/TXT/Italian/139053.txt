jeTfL2kCyBtmFGSrSQHqVw Went here for dinner in February 2011.  Extensive wine list, great service.  Food was not so great.  I had the duck dish for app and monkfish for my entree.  both were too salty. Maybe it was just that day? 

Also kids who wail/scream should not come to wine lounges! (the rest of the crowd was fine, just these two kids who sat at the table next to us...)

I would probably go back here but just to try the other wines...and sit at the bar.
