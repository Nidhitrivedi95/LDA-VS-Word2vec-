SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg Just ok.

Very cool, sexy place.

Good service, very attentive.

$50 corkage fee, only if they don't have the wine you've brought on their menu.

The portions are tiny. I mean tiny. The food tastes fine, but you would expect much more for these prices. You are primarily paying for the ambiance, which is definitely great...but if you're looking for some spectacular dining with food that will leave you wanting to come back for more, this is not the place.
