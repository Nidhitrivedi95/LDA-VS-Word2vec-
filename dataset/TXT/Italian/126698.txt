HtpNW2ksFbflBHBs7t3AFw Authentic Italian sandwich shop with simple, effective decor. On a mission to find the best meatball and veal parms in the area we landed on this place after a failed attempt at a rival sandwich shop that was a little to "clean" for out tastes. Great success. The owner, lively and tank topped took great care of us and even gave us a free meatball sandwich after mistakingly giving us an extra veal (not the worst mistake one could endure). Highly recommend this place.
