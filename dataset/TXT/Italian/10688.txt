The service, views, food and ambiance were top rate. We had the scallop appetizer, and instead of us sharing off one plate, they put one scallop on each of our plates so we could individually taste what a perfectly cooked and garnished scallop tastes like. 

Next, my husband had the foie gras ravioli which he didn't shovel into his mouth because he wanted to enjoy and savor each bite. I had the gluten free spaghetti with tomato and basil sauce. You'd think something so simple wouldn't get your heart racing, but there was nothing simple about the flavor of this beautifully done dish. 

Finally, we ended with the gluten free chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce. This was not the dinky salted caramel sauce you get at a coffee shop - this is the sauce that ruins all sauces on desserts. If it wasn't so upscale, I probably would have licked the plate and asked for a gallon of this sauce. The gelato had a perfect rich, creamy texture, and it complimented the cake and the sauce instead of taking over the plate. The textures and taste of this cake alone is a reason to come here. 

Everything about Scarpetta is excellent. Try to get a table near the windows to catch views of the Bellagio Fountains while you enjoy some of the best food in Vegas.
