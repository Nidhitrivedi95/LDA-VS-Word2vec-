GtHu9uGXpn7Jg_Z7vFKZKw I was leaning toward a three star, but the more I thought about their name I realized I couldn't go three. They are called the Meatball Spot and the meatball just isn't special. It isn't a bad meatball, but it isn't good either.

We first visited this spot when they had a restaurant in Town Square and thought it was okay. Saturday we decided to give them another try at this location and see if our feelings had changed about the food.

We went with meatball sliders, one traditional and one pork. The sauce was spicy Italian sauce. First, the slider rolls are just not hardy enough for the large meatball and the sauce. The buns were mush instantly and that wasn't the most appetizing. The meatball wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. The meatballs have zero in the way of seasoning. They are essentially a giant hunk of meat (which usually is a good thing), but meatballs should be seasoned! Forgive me, I'm Italian so this seems like a sin against meatballs.

The line at this location was really slow as well. Everything was prepared in the assembly line and yet it took at least ten minutes for the three people in front of us to be served. None of the customers seemed to be doing anything that would delay service either. The people behind us in line were complaining about the wait as well.

I may seem really down on this place, but it would be okay for a quick lunch or dinner. It really isn't awful, but in my opinion there are too many good food options in Vegas to devote a meal to this spot.
