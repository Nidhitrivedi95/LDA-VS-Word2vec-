Then we each had a personal pizza, the Regina Margherita and the Pomo. All of the ingredients were perfection and the dough was nice and thin. While we were waiting on our tiramasu (which was incredible) the head chef Matteo brought us a cinnamon liqueur that tasted like Cinnabon in a shot! The service was great, the patio was pleasant, and the food could not have been better.
