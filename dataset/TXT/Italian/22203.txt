3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A Had a reservation with Nicole M. and some friends in town from NYC, which had been made about a month prior, for 6 people at 8 pm. Left at 9 pm to go to Union as we had yet to be seated. 

Between 8 pm and 9 pm we stood in the "lobby" jockeying around in order to let people past to use the restroom (we didn't go to the bar because it was full of people eating, so basically there is no bar). We were given no update about what was going on until 8:20 when one of the members of our party finally asked (despite the fact we were standing no more than 3 feet from the greeter), at which point we were told it shouldn't be more than 20 additional minutes and that it wasn't their fault, but the fault of the diners who were eating too slowly. 

Apparently at Enoteca if your table is incredibly delayed it is not attributable to their inability to manage reservations, but instead it is the fault of their paying customers. Enoteca, if you can't work out how to time your reservations, stop taking F'ing reservations! 

At 8:50 we were informed that the customers that had the audacity to occupy our table had been asked to leave, at which point we said, "That's convenient we were just about to tell you the same thing". 

We went to Union on Ossington (which we'd had ample time to call to inquire about availability), which saved our night with great food and better service.
