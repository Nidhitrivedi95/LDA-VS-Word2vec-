esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA THIS PLACE WAS LIFE CHANGING. I went with my boyfriend after day club. We shared a dozen oysters and both got the pan roast.

The pan roast is AMAZING, man. They don't skimp: it was packed with scallops, clams, shrimp, lobster, etc.  The broth is packed with flavor.

Paired with a glass of white wine, you're in for an amazing meal.
