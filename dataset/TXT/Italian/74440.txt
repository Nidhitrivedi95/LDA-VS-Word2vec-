Atmosphere, you know the drill. "Fancy" interior for a chain restaurant, quaint music in the background, and decent lighting.

My girlfriend got a pork/ravioli dish, it was tasty, and I decided to be a cheapass and ordered the never ending pasta bowl with meat. Everything was pretty good, it did not taste bland or cheap like you imagine a special would taste. We also shared the sampler appetizer which had the chicken fingers/calamari, all equally delicious, especially their herb tarter sauce. The seasonal pumpkin cheesecake was FANTASTIC. Seriously, pumpkin and cheesecake, my two favorite things, done deal.

Alright, the best part, the service. Our waiter's name was Tony, and he was absolutely the highlight of our dining experience. I'm a manager at a popular cafe on the strip, and I know great service when I see it. We never had empty glasses, and he was on top of the table ensuring everything we needed was there and more. Tony went above and beyond and his service was honestly the best I've ever had. 

Go see Tony, have a great time!
