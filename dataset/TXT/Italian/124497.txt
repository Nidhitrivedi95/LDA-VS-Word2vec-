Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ This is the best pizza in Vegas. I won't get pizza anywhere else! My favorite is the Vegas Meets Italy, but you really can't go wrong with anything. The Chef Gio salad is a great alternative if you're not in a pizza mood. Try their ranch dressing for dipping! It's literally THE BEST ranch dressing I've ever had.

However, the last 2 times I ordered a Vegas Meets Italy, I didn't find any dates on it... That was super disappointing because it's one of the best ingredients on the pie. I'm not sure if they stopped adding them or maybe they are out of season (since they buy them local).
