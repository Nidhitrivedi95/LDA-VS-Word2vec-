99j5vhhtFJIefXDLsmA29Q Awesome pizza!!! We ordered margherita and diavola pizza and both were spectacular. We have been to Naples and had pizza there and the pizza at Inizio is the closest we have been able to find in the US. The sauce is delicious!!! The restaurant is really well decorated and has a great atmosphere and we loved the tables. The staff was also super friendly. Loved every bit of it; we will definitely be back!
