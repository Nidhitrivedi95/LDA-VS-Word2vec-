PJVjfGtVc71M0XlUr83teQ Great service, friendly atmosphere, delicious casual pizza to go or to stay.  Choose your crust, sauce, cheese (be sure to add ricotta) and toppings.  The pizza literally takes 2 minutes to cook.  Wine and beer special all day....make it a great dine alone or with a friend type place!
