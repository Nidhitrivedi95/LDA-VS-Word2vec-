-xbQQR_ydEJGqYzHSF4DnQ I am surprised to see so many bad reviews. I've been twice and had really great Chicago style pizza and a huge fresh salad each time. The Chicago was really great. The crust and sauce were pretty much perfect. The complimentary bread sticks were soo good, too. My wife had fettuccine with alfredo and it was also some of the best I've ever had. Plus it was only $8!

My only complaint was about the house salad. Although huge and fresh, it only encompasses four ingredients. Romaine, cucumbers, tomatoes, and red onions. We got the balsamic and ranch which were both freshly made and fantastic, but the salad could really use some more to it. Croutons and something else like that round it out would be nice. Plus the red onions were so hot and plentiful it tasted like a raw, red onion salad.

Service was great and prices were very reasonable, I will continue to go again and again.
