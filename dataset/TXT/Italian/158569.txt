LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Food was yummy as always.... Love the chopped salad!!!!  Then gotta get mushroom ravioli. It was delicious. Save room for the chocolate cake because it is to die for yummy. I've tried to recreate it but can't get it right.   


Our service wasn't the greatest but it was still decent. 

Thus meal was one of the better meals we had this weekend plans s it was cheaper than a few carry out type meals.... Crazy!!!!
