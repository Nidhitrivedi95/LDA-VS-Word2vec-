WCqcYtJ4rUxA4bIzjOfzqg What a cool lunch concept!  I'm not understanding the horrible reviews -- if you want fine dining then go get fine dining this is certainly not it.  This is a quick, convenient, and tasty lunch option.  I had pretty much an hour with a client before I had to make the trek up to Mooresville (I'm from Atlanta) and my client suggested this as it's walking distance from her office and we wouldn't have to fetch cars from the parking decks.
  When you walk in they give you a card and you can walk up to the pizza, pasta, or salad counters and order what you want.  Once you place your order, you get a buzzer and it will buzz when your food is ready for pick up at the counter.  The fountain drinks are in the back but water is in the front.  When you are ready to leave you pay at the counter.  I'm glad my client knew all of this because it was CROWDED and I would have been a bit confused with out her.
  We both ordered the Margherita pizza.  It's huge! Both of us ate about half of ours.  It comes with fresh basil and tomato.  The crust is light and crispy and the sauce isn't too sweet or over powering.  I loved my pizza but the salads did look good as well!  I would definitely try one if i make it back.
