G8vo5r543nQyTC24VNpBIg I am amazed that people are queuing to get to the Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill when  food as good as this is available for a tiny bit more money in far nicer surroundings than  aforementioned chains.  

This is a small Seattle based chain that is "hiding" out on Greenway   and does not deserve to be as quiet on a week night as we found it this Wednesday.   

The wedding soup was excellent   I'm pretty sure that's home made stock from the bones  ( either that or they have a kick ass supply house)  but it was really nice, flavor from all the ingredients came through.   Main course Cannelloni  which was very enjoyable, piping hot, and nicely stuffed .   Let down?  Frozen tiramisu   which is a shame as I think they could pull off a great one  if they did as well as the prior two course. Nice  staff too.  Come on  please keep them busy we want to keep going back here:D 

Physically it's a really nice looking restaurant , outdoor patio's nice but  sadly they can't really help the Kmart  to the side or the Goodwill on the other side  best stay indoors :)
