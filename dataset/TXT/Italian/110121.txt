G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Not worth the money. Nice tables, nice silverware and a decent view of the strip is wonderful but when serving Italian food lets be honest its noodles at the end of the day and when you charge 26.00 bucks for 5 noodles and some sauce it leaves a lot to be desired. My wife and my in laws had dinner there recently and quite honestly if I had never gone it would never have been missed. They are way over priced for what they offer. Was the food good. Yes it was but nowhere in the neighborhood of the cost. They have a lot of flash and very little substance. Don't waste your time here.
