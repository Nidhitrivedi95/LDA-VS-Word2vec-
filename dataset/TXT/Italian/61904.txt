azE1DNVQFBU8boVbaJhj7w I go to Lidia's once a year when I am in town for Thanksgiving. I like the ambiance and the decor, although this year our corner table had chairs that sunk WAY down - we wanted to ask for telephone books. I usually choose one of the special salads and have the gnocchi with duck ragu; it is superb! So much flavor and the gnocchi are perfect. This year, though, there was a special fall prix fixe menu with Winter Squash. The ravioli with balsamic drizzle were delicious. I choose quail with apples and squash for my main course and was very satisfied. Terrific glaze! The dessert, however, was over the top! Creme fraiche and pumpkin ice creams, caramel sauce, AND pumpkin fritters. We enjoyed a couple of the $28 bottles. No, they aren't stellar, but for the price they are all good food wines. Everyone in our party enjoyed the meals and we will definitely return.
