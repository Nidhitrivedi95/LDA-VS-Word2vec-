The ambience was excellent (for the main side which we were on) Caprese was delcious, our tasting portion of the sausage orchiette was perfectly al dente, my osso bucco was very good and my girlfriends filet mignon was fantastic (even for medium-well). I think that since this is a Celebrity Chef restaurant inside of one of the top 3 hotels on the vegas strip, the prices could have been higher! Honestly! Yes it is all al a carte, but the sides are only $9 when they could be $12 like other steakhouses. The petite filet was about $10 less than it is at other steakhouses, i think its one of the best bargain celebrity upscale restaurants in vegas.
