Very good Italian food with generous portions. This is a local favorite for the North Mesa residence as you will see as the place is always busy. Never a long wait as they have plenty of seating and super friendly staff that does their best to get you seated and eating ASAP.
The food is good not the best Italian in the valley but defiantly good quality and you will not be disappointed. Their second location in Scottsdale is an amazing location and atmosphere.
