1VDP92FU2p8AqJw9vU11sw First time into Lakeside Bar & Grill, but it certainly won't be the last!  From the get-go it was a great experience. We were seated immediately and our server, Matt, was da bomb!  He was able to make great recommendations and has a super personality. Service was great; attentive but not pushy. Good lighting, a comfy booth & lots of TVs will appeal to most. And the food?  Amazing!  We had cream of mushroom soup that was house made and the stuff of foodie dreams. We also had the spaghetti marina w/meatballs. The pasta was spot, on-cooked to order, and the marinara was great, with just a hint of heat. The meatballs were sublime, tender and bursting with flavor. Add a great margarita and the hubster and I were happy campers!
