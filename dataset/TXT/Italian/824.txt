-8JaNeG3etLgOVyg2gOIiA I'd heard about La Fontanella over the years and finally stopped in for a bite.  It was the best Italian food I've had in Phoenix!! The service was outstanding and our waiter, Eric, was enthusiastic and made my date and I feel right at home.  The dishes offered reminded me of food I grew up with. The pasta was perfect, fish was superb and bread and olive oil stopped my heart. I will return to try everything on the menu! Thanks, Eric, for making my first experience one to remember.
