1uZO2IigAzxec9rLugftSg again as other reviews very disappointing. It doesn't look great from the outside but i thought i would give it a go with my son who fancied a burger. The food isn't the worst i've tasted but the staff are so slap dash they're not really geared up for people sitting in. They seem to focus on take away's and seemed to have alot of delivery orders but still we had to wait 10 minutes to get some cutlery. I don't think we will be going back!
