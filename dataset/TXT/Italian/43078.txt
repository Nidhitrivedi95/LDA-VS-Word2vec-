7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw I first encountered NoRTH years ago in Tucson. It was a first of its kind in the land south of Phoenix with a new, swanky and trendy vibe along with good food and fun times. So, when I moved to Phoenix, I was sure to check this one out. 

Fast forward a "couple" years and I still frequent NoRTH whenever I'm up near Kierland. After my most recent visit, I realized that I have yet to review them, so here it goes! Happy Hour. That's it. OK, I'll keep going, but I could just stop there. NoRTH has a stellar happy hour. You just can't beat the $2.50 beers, $4.00 well drinks and glasses of wine starting at just $3. The happy hour goes until 6:00, so it's worth the hustle to get there in time. 

Now moving on to the food. I like the food at NoRTH because it's hearty and light at the same time. You ask how? Well, it's Italian food, but it's northern Italian which means the items are much lighter than the south with their hefty meat sauces, etc. To start, I adore the zucca chips, bruschetta and trio of spread. And let me add a little fun fact here. Each of those items are on happy hour! The zucca chips are light, thin little morsels with just a hint of zucchini and the right amount of salt. The bruschetta is my favorite because of the prosciutto atop a crescenza cheese. The bread is the right amount of hard and soft at the same time and it's the perfect way to start a meal. Or, if you just want something light yet filling for a meal itself, this would do the trick. As for entrees, I enjoy the Fennel Sausage and Pepperoni pizza, Baked Ziti Bolognese with spinach, ricotta & mozzarella cheese and the plates of the day are all excellent! 

So on that note, I end the tale about my experiences with my first Sam Fox restaurant: NoRTH.
