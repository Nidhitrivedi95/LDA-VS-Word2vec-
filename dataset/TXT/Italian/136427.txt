j_PL_u4SWW1LoEd2dCu0Iw Bambinis is the worst!  Me and my family waited 1 hour and a half and it wasn't even busy. The garlic knots were burnt. The Pizza tasted horrible and the tables were really sticky and they were not clean. What Pizzeria allows 5 year olds into their kitchen ? They were extremely rude," Even when ask for napkins"! The Health Department should shut them down!
