eRjcli4nDHRwhByViUz9Ow When I want Pizza delivered in Summerlin I call Rosati's. I am slightly out of their delivery range but they deliver anyway and are no longer charge me a nominal extended delivery fee. Their thin crust extra large pepperoni is my regular order. I can eat it for days. Delivery is consistently 45 mins or less. 

Online order would be convenient but staff is always friendly when i call. The chicken fingers I tried once were meh or I would rate higher.
