aY0Y058p2_iWxMAZron2mg If you're looking for Italian fine dining just north of midtown, this is it. Paese is consistently excellent, and has been for years.

They seem to do everything well, from pizzas to meats and seafood. Last night the specials were a grilled octopus salad appetizer and steak with mushroom risotto entree. Both were superbly executed and delicious. Our table also ordered veal scallopini (fabulous) and perfectly cooked, grilled whole fish stuffed with garlic, lemon and thyme. For dessert we opted for affogato with a shot of Frangelico (if you love affogato--a shot of espresso poured over ice cream--try it with Frangelico for an extra 2 bucks, trust me) which also came with a plate of soft cookies. Outstanding!

A reliable bet for a quality meal!
