I should not have my hopes up for Arizona in the first place since this state has arguably the worst selection of dinning in the United States. I have been a Pizza fanatic most of my life and let me tell you that when something is wrong you can taste it! First of all I have been to chicago several times and had the pleasure of eating a real chicago style pizza. Let me break it down to all of you. I ordered a thin crust since that was all they had, but I was expecting a Deep Dish selection since that is the Chicago signature dish. Little Chicago had only one selection of pizza. I felt bad for them. The Sauce was salty (New York Style) and the difference between chicago style sauces is that the sauces are always sweet. Not Little Chicago. The thin crust dough was bland. Most Chicagoans use cornmeal in the crust. Probably on of the worst tasting paper crust that I have ever tried to eat. The cheese was burnt on top and mush underneath. I don't know who is running this place, but its a good place to go if your drunk and have no passion for flavor. Worst Pizza In Arizona next to Rosati's. I hope they change their menu or close down soon better, yet change the damn name because this is not Chicago style pizza!!!
