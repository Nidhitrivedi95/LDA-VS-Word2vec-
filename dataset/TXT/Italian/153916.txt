Kz4WS00PcqOJgxfZawk4dQ Seriously, the worst food experience ever. Easily the worst pizza in 30 yrs of eating pizza. Zero taste. No cheese, sauce, or pepperoni. Crust had zero taste as well. Chinese buffet pizza is much better. Pizza 0/10. Calamari was at least somewhat edible. Maybe 4/10.  Also, would not honor $10 yelp discount, which I could not care less. They stated it was not posted by them. Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.
