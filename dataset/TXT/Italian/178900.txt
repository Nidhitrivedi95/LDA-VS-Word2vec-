nS6QENxe6YODNrQ45bpC-A Me and several of my co-workers ordered lunch from Cafe Verdi, as they were one of the few delivery places with somewhat decent reviews in the area. We each ordered the 5 piece chicken finger meal off of Grub Hub. One was an order of garlic, one was for something titled garlic Panamanian, and the last for an order of mild buffalo. When our food arrived, each order was the same (what I assume they would consider just garlic). Luckily the prices were the same for each order. When my co-worker who ordered the food called in to point out their mistake, a rude man told her that garlic and garlic Panamanian are supposed to be the same, that's just how his manager wants it displayed on the website. Maybe they were actually trying to enter it as garlic parmigiano, but due to their obvious and ongoing lack of attention to detail, confused an Italian cheese for a small Central American country. The only order that was credited back was the mild buffalo, as even though the others were two different menu items, they both had garlic on them, so same difference to Cafe Verdi apparently. The overall quality of the food was mediocre at best, and we discovered that their restaurant was once featured on dirty dining. In summation, mediocre food, terrible customer service, geographically illiterate, and filthy. Needless to say, we won't be ordering from Cafe Verdi anymore.
