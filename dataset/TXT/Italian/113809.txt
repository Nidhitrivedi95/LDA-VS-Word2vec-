gIPrEKqnJwaAH0ZyvnQHeg Literally some of the worst tamales I have ever had and the chile rellàno was not great. The cheese enchiladas were pretty good. We went there while waiting for the movie to start. It used to be a fairly decent place before they changed the name. The only thing that made the situation better was the waitress, Jackie. She was very professional and extremely sweet. She needs to move to a different restaurant so she can make a living, because most people wouldn't have tipped considering the quality of the food.
