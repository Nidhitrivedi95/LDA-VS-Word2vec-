4LB4xtFAwfvJRachr6Eaxw Thankfully these guys make it right when they screw up, but let me tell you how many times I've had to come back to get a new pizza made. It's not like I'm customizing my pizza, I'm ordering what's on your menu!!!! I expect my gluten free pizza to be gluten free because I have Celiac's disease. This is not a choice I made, I have a disease! I'm not just some pretentious hipster deciding to go GF because they want to lose weight- I'M ALLERGIC!!!!so not only was my pizza not GF but it didn't have goat cheese on it. Goat cheese, dig, prosciutto and arugula pizza. On your menu!!!! How do you screw that up?
