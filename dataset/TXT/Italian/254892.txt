vxadNrpTY7OHNmWsrEpNnA For being featured on Guy Fieri's "Diner's, Drive-Ins, and Dives," my experience at the Landmark was quite ordinary. Upon entry, it appeared some of the patrons look like locals who have dined there forever. That's a great sign, and the Landmark's lucky to have them. 

I had a really long day, and the lengthy menu was more of an irritant than anything. I chose a Philly cheese steak just for a simple, unpretentious bite to eat. When it came out, I found it to be edible but fairly bland. I will say it was filling, however. 

My friends had spoke of the large desserts, and I walked by the case to take a second look. Indeed, they were monstrous. Everything seemed jumbo sized! However, they all agreed it wasn't the best they ever had. In the end, I opted for a milkshake. After all, a good diner should have a good milkshake. Like everything else, it was average. 

I left with the impression the Landmark was a perfectly legitimate place to have a decent dinner in Charlotte. However, I wouldn't make it a target if I lived outside a 30 minute radius of the place. There are so many different flavors in Charlotte that this is best left for established residents who just want a dinner out.
