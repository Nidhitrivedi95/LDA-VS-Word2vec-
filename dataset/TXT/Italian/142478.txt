jpOT1ctnCzl-zWXR4Uyu1A Chicken scallopini and chicken carbonara are to die for!!! Yum yum yum!  Service is excellent for the few times we've been to this location.  We recommend taking the family on Monday evenings since the items on the menu marked "F" are family sized platters that are half priced! With two people at dinner, that means lunches for Tuesday!  Nice cozy atmosphere with baked fresh bread smell permeating the dining room.
