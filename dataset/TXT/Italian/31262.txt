5p5YW_5bMOSuLIQjkJPO3w The food is good, but nothing here that I saw warrants the prices. $15 for appetizers is ridiculous. One is basically mashed potatoes and cheese in little mounds- three of them on a plate with a sauce. It is delicious, but not so good that it justifies the price. There are other good Italian restaurants in Madison. I think the reason people give this one such high ratings is because they don't want to acknowledge that they overpaid.
