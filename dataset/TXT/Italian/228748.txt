SXgVJz5aIvbeCXWvg0ZuNg I've eaten at Pizza Peel more than half a dozen times in the last two months and I've never been inside. This is my FAVORITE place to "Postmates" lunch or dinner. My go-to is the BBQ pizza but their house chips and wings are amazing. My boyfriend loves the Tong's Sweet Chili wings and I really like the pizza that has that sauce too. Maybe one day I'll make it in there but either way, they'll always get my business!
