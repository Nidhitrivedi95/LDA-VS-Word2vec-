nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Buddy V's wins for best happy hour on the Strip! The bartender was super helpful and fast. The portions for HH aren't that large but allow for a taste of a variety of options. We had the meatballs, calamari, ricotta and polenta-all delicious! The sangria was AMAZING! If I was eating on just the HH it would have received five stars!

After HH we sat down and had dinner. The majority of the courses were excellent. I didn't like how the waiter pushed more food than was necessary. I also had the veal piccata and it wasn't that good. Eating starved baby cows only happens once a year for me and it wasn't worth it on that meal. The cheesy garlic bread was very delicious. I would definitely return for the HH but probably wouldn't eat in the main restaurant.
