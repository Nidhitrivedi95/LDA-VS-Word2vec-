ddlnpDxGDDxGGoG_dVXwiw Pet friendly and happy hour was all I needed to hear. They have a great outdoor space with a shed converted to a bar. The vibe is completely laid back and friendly. The owner came by and said hello. The food on the happy hour menu was varied and all very tasty and reasonably priced. I was going to go for the burger but wanted to sample some other things; fish taco, calimari, Korean bbq ribs, and fries...all delish. We will be back for sure.
