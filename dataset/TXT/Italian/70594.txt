c-l4nDPZcEwapEiV-Xf08w I had not been here since they first opened several years ago, and it has expanded and is now very elegant as well as delicious!! Hubby had the chicken parm which was huge, it took up the whole plate.  The sauce was delicious and the chicken was perfectly cooked. I had he chickpea salad, broccolini, and Greek potatos. He chickpea salad was to die for.  The broccolini was infused with a wonderful lemon flavor.  The potatoes were plentiful and so nicely seasoned.  For dessert we had the angel food cake dipped in toasted coconut with passim fruit sorbet.  It was so fresh and the best dessert I have ever had. Our waiter Selvin was phenomenal, very helpful and attentive. We will definitely be back!!!
