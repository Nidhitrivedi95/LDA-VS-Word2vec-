We were hoping to have the fried ravioli as our appetizer, but they were out, so pizza bread was our next option.  The pizza bread was what you would expect.  It wasn't bad at all,  but just nothing out of the ordinary.  

I ordered the veal ravioli for my entree.  The raviolis were quite large, sauce had a nice flavor and came out piping hot just the way i like it, and the meat was tender and not overpowered by the sauce.  I thought it was a really good dish. My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti carbonara, which was awesome!  It taste like "breakfast" with spaghetti noodles.  If you're a bacon lover, this would be the perfect dish because it has such a great bacon flavor to it.   We had seven people in our party and everyone was satisfied by their meal except for my brother who ordered tortellini with white sauce.  The two items just didn't mixed well together because it was too creamy and cheesy.  The dish would have worked better as a side or the tortellini would have been balanced better with a red sauce.
