Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA Kids will always scream for Pizza. No matter what kind a pizza it is and where... they just love it!! 

So while walking the Linq boardwalk... we saw this little shop. The front was small but the pizza is visible for you to pick from. 

The price kinda scared me a bit because for a Cheese pizza slice is $4 and pepperoni is $5. For that price... the pizza better be good right. 

My kids loved it. I don't know it's because they are hungry or the pizza was good. So I had to try it myself to give it a review. 

Pizza was actually tasty. You can tell it's like a ma and pa shop. The dough is soft and chewy. But overall, not bad at all. 

I wouldn't mind coming back.
