tYbK94fl50os3h_RjpY4gw After reading the reviews online, we decided to check this place out. The menu is huge and I wanted to try everything, but we came here for the pizza. We ordered a large pizza and it came with free garlic knots with a yummy dipping sauce. The cheese pizza had a thin crust, which I love. They also have beer and wine available. The price is beyond reasonable for the great quality and quantity of food that you get. We will be back!
