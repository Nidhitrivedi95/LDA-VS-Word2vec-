h_y6FbNPaFbAgeMCD4bcAw Came here on a weekday night. weather was amazing so everyone was out and about. We made a reservation and did not get seated until 40 minutes later. There were empty tables but maybe not enough servers? 

Before we even sat down I ordered the appetizers right away. It took then another 20-25 minutes for them to come around and offer us drinks and order food. All along we had no server and were just left there. Take note that there were still empty tables.

We ordered the carpaccio, calamari, rack of lamb, risotto with chicken and a prosciutto pizza. The appetizers were ALRIGHT, nothing special. The rack of lamb was also alright. The prosciutto pizza I found very unauthentic. The dough was so thick with just ingredients slapped on. The risotto was a complete nightmare.. There were probably four spoonfuls of it. It was not cooked correctly and had no flavour AT ALL and was just drenched in sauce. It was also undercooked. 

I would never go back to this place. Reason why its so busy is cause its in main street and has a patio.
