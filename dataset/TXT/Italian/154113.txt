kz7O0_o6WrDQk1Kl8dKeHQ Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Good, solid dinner.  Not all the dishes were great, but many were something we'd come back for.

I'll start with the main drawback of the night.  Busy Friday night.  It was crazy loud.  We were near-shouting the entire time.  Now on to the food.

This place is all about sharing.  We shared every dish that we ordered between the 4 of us.  Even the steaks come pre-cut for sharing purposes.  We ordered the following:

Salumi board - Probably the best dish of the night.  5 meats, 2 cheeses, Noble bread, tapenade, some pickled veggies.  It was a good size and each component was pretty darn tasty.
Pork n beans - Actually green beans cooked in pork.  It was fine.  Beans were crisp and cooking in pork added some meatiness to a veggie dish.
Farfalle - Slightly spicy in a seafood broth, this was maybe the second-best dish.  The spice saved it from general mediocrity.
Gnudi - Decent gnudi, pretty heavy on the truffle.  These little suckers are pretty filling for their size.
N.Y. Steak - A good steak for a non-steakhouse steak.  Definitely need the butter and chimichurri on the side to liven it up, but it was cooked to a good medium rare (a little closer to medium) and had decent flavor on its own.
Frites - Decent fries, nothing special.
Tuscan kale - Decent kale, nothing special.

So even with the shouting, we'd probably be back.  It's nice that parking seems easier here than across the street at the Yard.
