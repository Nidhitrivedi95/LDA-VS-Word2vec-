7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw Zucca chips and seasonal salad were amazing. Also, the bread with sun dried tomato butter was out of this world. 

We ordered the Funghi pizza as our main item. Unfortunately, it was not the star. The crust was a little think and chewy. Definitely not the thin and crispy style we prefer. The pizza also had onions that seemed out of place. Red onions would have probably fit the pie better. 

The decor and atmosphere was appropriate and the staff was friendly. Our check came to about $40 for the chips, salad, pizza, and a glass of wine. I'd definitely recommend this as a decent and affordable lunch place.
