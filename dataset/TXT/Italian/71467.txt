C7bK6Sd0LcvH7SOAjQu3LA I used a Groupon to dine here and the experience was just okay, nothing special. When I presented the Groupon to the waiter, he seemed fine with it but then I overheard him speaking with who I assume to be a part of management. She was a larger woman with highlights in her hair and said rather loudly "I don't care for people who come with Groupons. The Groupons are more like advertisement for the restaurant and for cheap people." 

WOW. 

Not a nice thing to say at all and I will not be coming back here. The food was alright and dessert was subpar - would get better cake at the grocery store. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone who cares for good customer service.
