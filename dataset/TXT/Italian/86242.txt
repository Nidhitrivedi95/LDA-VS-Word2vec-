dSnQTUJC0tCHadU1AGzvrw Fifth time there, and can say that they are getting much better.  Perfect setting and views of the golf course, and attentive and friendly servers.  Actually was there twice this week, once for dinner and once for lunch.  Pizza has changed since their opening, and now it is pretty incredible.  Both experiences this week were excellent, and awesome place for casual dinner with pasta, pizza and wine.  Will be back, and while not much was really wrong before, for some reason everything just seemed better.
