oWPnXGnW3tHO4wh9hFpdXA I Went to this place many times and always been served by one older man who always comes off rude towards customers and staff which i i find really un professional. But there is a girl her name is Rena and her customer service is outstanding she always goes out of her way especially with updating me on my pizza and letting me know when it is finished and letting me know it is ready so i don't get it cold, she offers suggestions and always has a smile on her face which keeps me a happy customer. Another girl hardona is very friendly and makes suggestions always. Love their service! Happy customer and they keep me returning :)
