uDb1lOfDhl_VLmAbYvp-vQ Hungry in NoDa and love pizza... say no more... go to Bennys. 

Very simple menu, five or six choices of pizza max for anywhere between $4-$5 each a slice. However, the slice is the size of a small country. They only make 28' pizzas (ie: four times the size of a regular large pizza). One maybe two will definitely fill you up. They have a good selection of beer by the can and it's a very laid back atmosphere. 

They have a pizza challenge, an entire pizza in one hour, I'm going to try to do it one day. Wish me luck.
