ypkahHKiFXaZhrEzNZRvLA You know when you really, really, really, reeeeeaalllllly want to like something?

And then you don't?

Posto Panino is that. 

What's worse though, is that when you enter, you think it's going to be everything you've ever wanted and more: the hip vibe of the place makes for great eye candy, the waitresses, attentive and polite (albeit, too attentive at times)...but then there's the deal breaker, the one you knew would be the deciding factor as to whether or not this was going to be a long lasting  relationship: the food.

We ordered the rice balls which were sparse on the sauce, and were cold -- which struck as odd given they were deep fried, which led us to guess they'd been pre-deep fried, then frozen, then reheated, which make for an unappetizing experience. High hopes though, there was still room for forgiveness.

The gnocchi was oddly textured (even for gnocchi) with a rose that was acrid in taste that stayed with your taste buds no matter how many sips of water you took.

The two pizzas, both the parma and Sicilia were equally unforgiving and....wait for it: cold. 

While I appreciate it's interior and convenience being one of the few restaurants in King City, it wasn't worth the $75.00, and as much as I really wanted to love this place, I just didn't.
