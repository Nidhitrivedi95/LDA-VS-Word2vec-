XjAb0mxgCtq96pWWJjUBAg The worst Italian food I can remember The sauce is flavorless and the chicken bland. No idea what they were calling a cannoli. On The other hand, the service was absolutely fantastic. That's the only reason I gave it a two otherwise I would've been stretching to give it a one.
