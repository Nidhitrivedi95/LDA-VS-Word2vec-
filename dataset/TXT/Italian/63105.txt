B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw Soooo much of what makes this restaurant great is the vibe/decor. It just feels cool. 

If you want go on a Friday or Saturday night, prepare to wait. Luckily, this is one of those restaurants where you put your name on the list, head somewhere else for drinks for an hour (or two!) and they'll text you when your table is ready. 

The house wine was $1 per oz and comes in a pitcher. We were offered a taste along with one of the other wines. I can tell you that it was pretty vinegary compared to a nice wine. Drinkable, but certainly not good. They did have other great wines to pick from though.

The bread to start the meal is served in a brown paper bag, a neat way to present it. the bread was nothing special though.

We started with the Octopus, which was actually a pretty big portion and perfect for sharing between 2. It was served on a dark wood board with a raw edge, the presentation was beautiful.

We each ordered a pizza. They were good, but certainly not amongst the best in the city. Thin crust, chewy dough, heavy on the toppings. 

If I were rating this place purely on the food, I'd give it 3 stars, but the ambiance more than makes up where the food is lacking. A really trendy spot to spend an evening.
