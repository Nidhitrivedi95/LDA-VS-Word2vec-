i4Jb_b28YAphS9_jPPzwkQ Dudeeee this place is awesome. I've never had anything that wasn't absolutely delicious. Really good grub spot and reasonable too. Chicken Gyros with extra crispy fries are a must! Double burger with everything and grilled onions is juicy and delicious. The mozzarella sticks are super good. If you haven't been here before it's defiantly worth a try.
