rxr0kjcVwX22QI2Hq5iA4w First time at Grappa - live in the area and I have to say, we had an amazing experience.  I love pasta with seafood and this had to be one of the best.  So fresh, light and delicious.  The veal on the bone was incredible.  Wine list is fantastic - Super Tuscan a great buy.  Waiter and Manager made us feel very welcomed.  Decor very 'fancy/upscale', more rustic laid back decor would make it feel less prententious. Food is AMAZING!
