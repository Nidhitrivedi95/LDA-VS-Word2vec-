vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw We love Oreganos! Always friendly service and great food. Our favorite is splitting the Caesar salad or the Pablo Picasso salad (spicy, yum!). The Clarke Street is our favorite pizza, the boom dip is great, and the garlic lime Parmesan wings are heavenly. But, don't eat too much because you have to save room for a PAZOOKIE!! 

The food is great, but the service we get is always better. Darby is by far our favorite server. She is wonderful at her job, and it is so fun to have dinner when she is serving. There is nothing more enjoyable than going into a restaurant and being served by someone who loves their job.
