pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Dined at the original location several times with friends but never thought to do the check in or review.  Loved it then,  and i think i love it more with the new location.  Takes the ambience to a new level. Service is amazing as always...the antipasto is the best.   Nice for a intimate dinner or even to show up with friends. Hope you enjoy as much as i do.
