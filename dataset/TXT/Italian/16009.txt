1VDP92FU2p8AqJw9vU11sw Great place no matter the occasion! We dine here often with and without the kids. The prices ate reasonable, food portions are large and kudos to Franco, the owner as my husband and I have both noticed that the music is adjusted based on time & clientele. This places is always clean with very friendly staff, fast food service, and they are consistent! All you can eat fish fry is awesome as well. If your in the neighborhood and looking for food, skip the franchises in the area ,and give this place a try. I've known this owner for many years, ( he owned & operated a completely different establishment when we first met) and you will definitely leave satisfied with food as service as these are his specialties. Enjoy!
