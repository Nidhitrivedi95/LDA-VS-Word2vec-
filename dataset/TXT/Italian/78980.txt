D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg For my 30th birthday my husband, friends and family took me to Nove Italiano.  It had a beautiful setting, ambiance and wonderful food and service.

We had a few problems with the way the steaks were cooked, not exactly as requested or explained by the servers, but they made every attempt to rectify the situation.  They also served a beautifully huge dessert tray to the table to make up for the mishaps (for my birthday).

I might go back for a special occasion or with less people.  It was pricey which makes it difficult to please such a large group...for a party of 6, the bill was almost $1,000.
