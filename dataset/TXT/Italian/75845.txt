cs1qJvnWUg_f8g020z_3PQ Ok I guess I just don't get it.  I was really looking forward to a pizza extravaganza.  Afterall, how could Oprah, Martha Stewart, and my hero Rachel Ray be wrong about something as simple as a pizza???
My boyfriend and I happened to be off on a Monday afternoon and so we made the drive up here to check this spot out. 
This location is hard to find.  We even looked it up beforehand and called for directions.  In the 110+ temperatures we were all but about to give up finding it and head over to Potbelly's (which would have been better in hindsight) when we finally came across what I had thought to be a pizza oasis.  It was a mirage.
We were seated promptly and given 4 small olives which were delicious, but it would be nice to have some bread and olive oil as well.  I mean, after all most people wait hours just to get in the door to this place.  I also thought the service was just OK.  No one went out of there way to recommend anything to us or even seem really friendly at all.
The food did come quickly though and the topping were really good.  The fennel sausage was flavorful, the mozzarella fresh, and the basil was very tasty as well.
It's the crust though that kills it for me.  Yes I am not an idiot and I know what brick oven crust tastes like.  It is typically charred and the crust is thin and chewy. Normally I really enjoy it, but here the middle was actually soggy.  It's a small pie, which is ok, but that crust was really bland and wet.  
Also again I would love to have the olive oil and Parmesan to dip the crunchy ends in. 
Sorry guys I just don't get it.  I have had better brick oven pizza at dozens of places in Chicago and I hafta say to all my foodie heroes I have been let down.
