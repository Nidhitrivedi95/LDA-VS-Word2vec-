F73T-N5lRNL2Gcpg0Q4KKw Very busy, trendy atmosphere, but on the loud side. The drinks and appetizers were fantastic, entrees were not as good as I would expect for the price.  Spent over 400 for four people and didn't quite seem worth it. Steak was over cooked and they didn't even offer to remake it or comp it.  Service was average.  I had high hopes to try this new place and it was ok, but not sure I will be spending that much here again.
