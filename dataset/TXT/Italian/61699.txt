The décor is the same as it was the last time I was here. (Can't believe it's been 5 years).

Stopped in for lunch. Had the pasta trio. Crab meat ravioli, fettuccine  with spinach, and rigatoni with bolognese sauce. Good stuff.

Why did a star come off after 5 years? It seemed to me the wait staff for the lunch time patrons was in training, so the service seemed a bit sluggish and off. Other than that, the food was great.
