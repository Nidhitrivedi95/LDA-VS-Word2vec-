AuIiqDeL65kczmiFSkAWrA We went for Thanksgiving dinner.   The food was delicious and our waiter, Eric, was terrific.   However, we were a party of 6 and made reservations two weeks in advance, I do not understand why we were given one of the worst tables in the restaurant.  We were put in the corner table by the elevator.  There was a constant stream of servers, patrons, busboys and trash collectors going up the elevator.  Not to mention the rescue workers that took a woman out on a stretcher.  My son and his girlfriend had to move for that.   Because we were in the corner we were forgotten about by some of the support staff.  Our salads came out before the appetizer.   It took forever to get our teas refilled, and we had to ask for utensils and plates several times. It was a good experience but not great.  I noticed that there were tables for 6 in the extra room where the patrons were not crammed together like sardines and not constantly interrupted by the goings on of the elevator.
