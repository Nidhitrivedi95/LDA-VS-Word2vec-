Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A This place is the epitome of meh.

There really isn't much to say about this place. The food is just ok, bordering on blah. It's on par with the buffet at Palace Station or Gold Coast. Just generic food that wasn't particularly appetizing and lacked any sort of appealing flavors. 

I stuck with the crab legs, which weren't particularly fresh or tasty and made sure to make my price of admission back with juice and soda refills! Hah The service was good, our waiter came by to check on us regularly with refills and to clear away plates.

Luckily, we had a coupon, so this is the only reason we ate here. If you have a comp or a coupon, by all means, partake... otherwise, just walk on by.
