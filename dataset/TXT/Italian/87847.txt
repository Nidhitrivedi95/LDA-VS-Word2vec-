The food is excellent, but I thought the portions were a bit small for the price. 

I ate here with my wife, daughter, and son-in-law. I was tempted to order the spaghetti and meatballs but then noticed that the menu said "spaghetti and meatball" (singular), so I passed it up; my SIL had it, though, and sure enough, there was just one single solitary meatball (not even a terribly large one) sitting on top of his spaghetti. He said it was very good, but nonetheless I would expect more for $12. I had the meatball sub ($6.25 for a regular order) which was also quite tasty, but which only seemed to contain maybe two meatballs (they were sliced, so I don't know for sure). My wife and daughter split the chicken parmegian sandwich and spinach/cheese manicotti; they were both very impressed, though the bite I had of my wife's chicken sandwich didn't wow me (but then I always prefer meat to chicken). I don't mean to suggest that the portions were inadequate; there was certainly enough for a meal, but I just didn't think we got as much as I would expect for the price.

One nice feature was the garlic bread I asked for, which was very good, and for which we weren't charged, but that may be because our pasta dishes were supposed to come with bread, and this may have been that. It was not terribly garlick-y, but it did have a nice buttery texture and had crumbled parmesan cheese on it. 

If you're in Vegas and you have a car, this place is well worth a visit.
