86W-L1l70wL-7n0lSfoY-Q This place is NEVER open, stroke of luck that it was tonight. 

Portions are fairly large. 

Mussels to start in a white wine sauce. Everything was properly prepared but we didn't care for it. 

Gnocchi was good. Prepare to bowl over in pleasure from the smell of the dish (doesn't taste as good as it smells, sadly) but still pretty good. Chicken was super juicy and tender. :) 

T bone steak... Disappointing, ordered medium rare and it came out rare. FULL of bone. Tasteless. Inedible. Potatoes on the side were your run boiled potatoes. 

Service was fairly good - waiter and the owner (I assume) checked on us fairly frequently. 

Ambiance is lovely. It's a beautiful restaurant! 

Buuuuuut between the hours and the food, won't be back.
