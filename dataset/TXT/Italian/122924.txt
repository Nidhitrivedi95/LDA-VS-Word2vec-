HhPVzZYQI-akaXRK_A4dKQ I live in the neighborhood and am always excited to patronize local places.  In this case, there was a reason that I could never get anyone to go with me.  The food is not good and there is no ambiance.  We were seated at a dirty table with no place setting (which was not rectified until AFTER I received my food and had to hunt someone down).  My husband ordered chicken wings.  They were dry and freezer burned.  This was a weeknight, so they had some good deals for dinner- 2 dinners for $20, which included dessert, which was a very reasonable price, but the food was bland.  I had chicken parm and my husband had fettuccine.  The fettuccine was watery and the chicken parm was soggy.  Overall, if you want a good portion of mediocre fried (recently frozen) food at a good price, this may be the place for you.
