9WIn1fMJoDPqkc5HOQdybw We tried this restaurant last night with some friends & found it to be absolutely terrific!  The best Italian restaurant in Charlotte without having to drive Uptown.  Don't expect chain food Italian, as this is real authentic Italian cooking.  The atmosphere & the staff were extremely friendly.

We started with bruschetta & calamari, the best we have had....calamari served with fried zucchini strings, just wonderful.

My husband & I both had the seafood pasta dish and it was awesome!  Our friends had rigatoni & veal, both commenting that it was very good.

We followed dinner with tiramisu & expresso's, again....they truly know how to do Italian!  

We will definitely eat here again & would recommend it to anyone!
