RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ Stopped here because we heard that this was the best pizza place in Pittsburgh. I will say the pizza sauce had a great peppery flavor and the cheese was creamy and bold, but the service and environment was subpar at best. Maybe it's because I'm from the Midwest, but the attitudes of every person we interacted with were just above the mark of rude. The environment reflects your local pizza joint, nothing fancy and is exactly what you would expect, but the smell was what I couldn't stand. It smelled like bathroom air freshener, which was hard to get over since you're standing in one of the most famous pizza places in the city. I expected to inhale the scent of delicious melted cheese with greasy pepperoni and a perfectly toasted crust, but was met with a Porta-Potty fragrance. The food was pretty tasty, but I recommend getting it to go so that you don't have to interact with the staff.
