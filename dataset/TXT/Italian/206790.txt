qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA Came back to Tempe for the holidays and was surprised when a friend said to meet at Postino's in Tempe... when did they build that?  Was a cold night but plenty of heaters on the patio that kept it warm and comfortable. Service was very good and attentive and the food was what I expected having been to the other locations in the past. Very nice location btw... good scouting. 
Nothing bad to say at all. Postino's does it again - but in a better location :)
