ii9kqE9s4456Jn9asz-BPQ "Do you want me to be honest with you?"   That's what the waitress asked us after she told us she could bring us the Martini's with Gargonzola Olives they had on the menu.  When she brought them with Olive's that weren't ripe, had pits, and were awful, we questioned what the deal was.  She also asked which Vodka (mine), & Gin (my friend) wanted and gave us the choices.  When she brought us the bill, (we decided we weren't staying if she had to give us the choice of honesty or not), the vodka & gin choices she gave us were additional to the already high price on the menu.  When questioned, she said the extra charge was for the alcohol.  Evidently, $14 Dirty Gorgonzola Martini's, neither include the Gorgonzola or alcohol.  I will never go back to this place and it's going on my Montreal black list.  Good job Nakkita, if that IS, your real name.
