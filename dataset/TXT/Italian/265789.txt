wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw My wife and I recently had dinner at the Postino's in Gilbert since we were big fans of the one in Arcadia. The place is amazing!! There was a small mistake with our order(allergy), but the waitress (Marsha) and management did a great job fixing everything!!! We will definitely be back!!
