cWih5wWspfgeiGEeQ04nxA An italian restaurant in a cracking location. If you're lucky, you can get a seat with a view over Newhaven Harbour, looking out towards the Bridges. Or, on a nice day, a seat outside (whoooooo)


 Menu is mainly Pasta, Pizza, Salad and Chicken, but don't be put off by that - they also do a cracking Red Pesto & Mozzarella Burger.


 Go on, try it, you know you want to
