Mb4V2aPneclZZ8BfZUjWGA I went to Ken Stewart's Saturday and was completely impressed. We had a 6 top, and I was dining with some finicky people, and Ken Stewart's didn't miss a beat.  The decor is nautical and edgy at the same time. The service is very good as well. Three people at my table ordered the ribeye with two huge scallops on top. I tasted the steak and it was delicious and cooked to perfection - medium. I ordered the Dover sole, that was prepared meuniere style. The server said that it would be deboned at the table which it wasn't. Another elderly  diner at the table ordered it and couldn't eat because it was filled with bones. The GM came to the table and attempted to debone it, but it was impossible without making a mess. The fish was delicious, bones and all. One person ordered the Sea Bass, it looked a little dry and it's an extremly small portion. DO NOT order the Sea Bass if you're starving, it will not be enough. The tiramisu is very good, and has a salted carmel taste to it. The cassata cake was tasty, but a little dry. All in all, it was a great experience.

Even though they don't have a dress code, I would adhere to the following:
Men, wear a jacket
No flip flops and t-shirt
Dressy jeans
-smart casual or casual elegance
