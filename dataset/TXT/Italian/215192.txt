RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ Wow!  Amazing food and service.   My girlfriend and I went and had the daily special - mine was a lobster pasta and it was outstanding.   Definitely a place I could go for a date or just for a random Tuesday night.  I love the look of the restaurant....all of the new places to dine are getting me back to red rock!
