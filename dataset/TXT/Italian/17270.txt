2alo9GzeOsbg4jeKYFQmxQ Santo's used to be TEN STARS until the kids took over and then decided to let THEIR kids take over. Fettucini with vodka sauce, alfredo, meat ravioli and white pizza are their staples along with wedding soup and the fresh bread. Service has gone down hill along with the food - comparably - from where they used to be. Unfortunate, but true. I know I'm not the only one that feels like this so...santos take note.  I have been going here for the entirety of my nearly 30-year life so please step it up.
