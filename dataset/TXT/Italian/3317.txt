Their portion sizes are pretty good for the price you're paying. The lasagna, both meat and veggie, is super amazing. And goodness gracious is it huge! The sausage is pretty good too. As for the desserts, man oh man! Their lobster tail is oh sooo yummy! I loved their nutella heart donuts as well. The Tiramisu is so so, not really the best. 

One thing that irks me about this place is how rude their servers are. If you dont want to be working there, please do everybody a favor and quit.
