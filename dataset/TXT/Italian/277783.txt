yJkYsl0hOlG2-ITBe16ZIA Had dinner tonight at the Yacht Club and it was delicious. I haven't been here for awhile and I won't wait so long to come back! Our favorites: lobster rolls (we got all warm instead of half warm half chilled lobster rolls - amazing!) hamburger (my daughter said the best burger she ever had) and the fish tacos. We all split a Caesar salad as well. Finally, I love the grapefruit beer that they serve here (I say "beer" lightly - it's refreshing and delicious!) come here and you won't be disappointed. I'm glad to have the Yacht Club in the neighborhood!
