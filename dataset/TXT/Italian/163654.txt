LWwAMZUiH6iBaL4a6jGRWw We went here because we had a coupon.  Upon arrival we were told there would be a 30 minute wait for a table.  They took my cell number to call me when the table was ready.  They did call within the time and seated us.  We waited for 5 minutes before we were acknowledged after seated.  

Finally the server came and offered us a drink.  We ordered our drink and the insulate italiano.  He brought us our drinks and asked if we wanted appetizers.  We stated we ordered one already which he then remembered.  We gotordered the saladfood which wasis actually veryunder good.  When we finally got the chance to order dinner, my wife ordered the grilled chicken caprese and I ordered the rigatoni with sausage.  Her chicken was over cooked, dry and the sauce very bland.  My plate, the pasta was good, the sausage which is not made in house was not too bad.  The meatballs were actually under cooked and raw in the very center.  The sauce was ok, not spectacular, I make a better sauce at home.

The server was ok, not the best we ever had but not the worst.  This is not a place we will go back too.  There are much better itilian places to eat which are comparable in price and the food is made in house and cooked properly. Again, the server tried his best and when we let him know about the food he did take her order off the bill and was very understanding.  He definitely had a desire to see the place he works do better.
