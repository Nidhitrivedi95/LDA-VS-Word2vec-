HAvlj15w6j1noGeY0kleDQ I love this Rosati's! The owner is so nice...always makes me feel like family! He will make whatever you want for lunch! I usually go at a later lunch time (2-ish) and I like a certain salad and he will make it to order, happily! Thanks, Rosati's! Oh, I love their chopped antipasto, too...the thing is huge!
