esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA We had a really nice server/cook.  Raymundo made us seafood risotto with lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp, and bay scallops.  I was expecting a cream sauce but it was mostly butter and seafood broth, which wasn't bad.  The rice was cooked perfectly.  We also had crab cakes with aioli and they came two to an order.  The exterior could have been more crisp, but it was delicious nonetheless.  We had a few glasses of champagne to complete our meal.  3.5 stars
