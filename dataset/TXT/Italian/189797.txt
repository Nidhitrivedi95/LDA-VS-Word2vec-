p1ohbPwI1QfjHQ2zRup5OA As the official Yelp Dutchess of this establishment, I do have a HUGE COMPLAINT.

first of all, let me say that we came here a couple days ago and received wonderful treatment from the server- sorry I forgot his name... The margarita pizza was  absolutely wonderful and was at our table fairly quickly. 
We actually compared the taste to that at Emerils in Las Vegas. Delicious.  We were  surprised at the negative reviews.

Today we grabbed a juice in an unmarked plastic cup and decided to eat here again.  My cup of orange juice was half full.  We ordered  the pizza again.  Two minutes later, the waitress tells me that  I am not aloud to have my juice here. I can either throw it away or they can hide it behind the counter. Seriously? We just ordered a $15 pizza outside on the patio and I can't drink my juice.  I was told Starbucks wouldn't allow me to bring anything in there-- which is funny because just yesterday, I walked into Starbucks with my husband with a bottled water while he ordered an iced coffee. No one said anything. 

I guess they aren't concerned about my business because they put my juice into a glass and threw away the container. 

As much as I love the pizza, we will not be back, and tonight when I return to my group of 50 that we are here with, I will let them know. 

My five star rating turned into a 1 just like that. 

It's sad some people lack good business sense.
