FqJ1SWEBhgVl66FrcsovOQ Upon entering, there were two ladies in front of me ordering take-out.  A gentleman, possibly the manager, behind the counter said, "Welcome to Cici's" and then walked away while the young lady at the register told me it would be a couple of minutes. The women in front of me finished ordering and the lady at the register stood there for a long time just looking at the register. Shecalled the manager over for help with something, he left and she continued to stare at the register. As I stood there, according to my watch, almost FIVE minutes had a passed since I entered the restaurant. She did not look up or acknowledge me again. I walked out the door, never being helped, paying or eating. If there is a problem in making me wait to take my money at Cici's, what other issues does this restaurant have?
