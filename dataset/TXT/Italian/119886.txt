h_y6FbNPaFbAgeMCD4bcAw If you're ever craving Italian in Markham, I would definitely recommend this place. I come here quite often and am almost always satisfied, I don't remember the names of the dishes so bare with me. I personally like their pasta with lobster which I don't believe is on the menu so you'll have to ask if they have it. My second favorite is the pasta with sausage. I tried the pasta with chicken recently and found there was way too much oil. If you're not in the mood for pasta, the lamb is also really good. They also have steak but I wouldn't recommend it. Now onto dessert and my favorite item on the menu by far.... drum roll.. Creme Brule! They have probably the best creme brule I've ever had! If you go here you must try it! The chocolate cake with vanilla icing is really good too but the creme brule is a must-try!
