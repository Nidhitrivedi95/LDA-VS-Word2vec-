fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg This place is exceptional. I ordered togo from here and the gentleman who took my order was very through and he even gave me a free miso soup. The finer details are what matters. When I picked up my togo order, the person who took my order asked me to have a seat at a table while I waited and he offered me some water which came in a plastic cup, a lid and a straw so I could take it with me. Thoughtful. He also asked me what kind of sauce I wanted on my Grilled Salmon and packed that in there for me. He later asks me what kind of utensils I wanted in there. 

Wow, such customer service. All this I experienced in 5 minutes of being here.

From the looks of it, it looks like it may have been an Italian restaurant at some point because of the antique decor and brick walls. Usually there's Japanese posters, Japanese bamboo art, Japanese lanterns, but this place didn't have all of that, which isn't a bad thing, it's just something I noticed. I took a look around while I got my food and it looks like it's Japanese owned(+most are not) because I heard some of the sushi chefs and possibly the owner conversing in Japanese. It was fairly populated for it being 8:30PM. The place settings included a plate and a black cloth napkin rolled up with utensils inside. This is unusual for a Japanese place because most Japanese places will give you a paper napkin and a wooden chopstick that you throw away afterwards. There's also a sushi bar for those who like to eat their sushi right away. 

The Grilled Salmon itself was a bit dry, maybe a bit overcooked to my liking but it went well with my ginger sauce. I also ordered some nigri and a tuna roll which turned out to be decent as well. I would come back here again and I see why this place is such a hit. I wanted to review anything but the ramen only because I see a lot of reviews on the ramen here. Next time.

Located across the street from 'Just Blaze' ( a smoke shop) and apartment complexes. Accepts AmEx.
