cy3Or8iSsDOmHBBu2MwnOg One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. They make fresh pasta, and the free bean dish with the bread they start you off with is so yummy and garlicy! It is a small cozy restaurant! I frequented this place at least once a month! They have delicious salads! They do a really good job at putting a lot of love into the food!!!
