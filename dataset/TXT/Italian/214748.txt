rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg YES it's stupid expensive! YES my family and I had a blast :) the food selections were pretty extensive this year! The jumbo shrimp were huge and awesome. My daughters strawberry italian ice was tasty! We went on thursday which mommies got to ride free! They wouldn't let my daughter on the big bucket ferris wheel which sucked cause that is my fave ride!! I'll prolly take my family next year too lol
