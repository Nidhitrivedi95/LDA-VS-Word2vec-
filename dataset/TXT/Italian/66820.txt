BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg Feeling like pizza, I called in a order for pick-up. The girl who took my order was friendly and said my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. I headed over and upon walking in I was quickly greeted by the hostess who rang me up and asked if I needed any crushed red pepper or parmesan cheese added to my pizza box. I sat only for a couple minutes before my pizza was brought out. The inside looks very clean, but I was glad I placed my order for pick-up because it looked too trendy to be eating pizza in there. The hostess opened my pizza box and went over my order and asked if it was to my liking. It looked good!

Priced at $13.50 I had the "Margherita DOC" and the pizzas seem to come in one size here. It is more of a personal size pizza, but not super tiny. I was happy with it and couldn't finish the last 2 pieces. The pizza has crushed tomatoes, fresh buffalo mozzarella, basil, parmigiano reggiano and extra virgin olive oil. The crust was light and crispy, while the center of the pizza was softer. I had trouble picking up the pizza and eating it so I used a fork and knife which I don't mind. The crushed tomato sauce tasted sweet. I loved the amount of fresh mozzarella that was on it too! I'd like to try some of their other pizzas so I will be back. They also have some salads that sounds good!
