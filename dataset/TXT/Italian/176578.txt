nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ Second time here. First time four stars, this time two. It would have been less but Beth came in to save the day! The first time 4 stars due to the horrible tiramisu. This time I would have given 1 star but like I said Beth, the bartender, came in and made the experience so much better with her great personality and social skills. Ricki our "server" was not attentive, OVER charged us, did not bring our antipasto (I had to ask the manager for it). We were there early, at 4pm, when happy hour starts. I recommend waiting until the bartender comes in at 5pm. The restaurant was not busy, there were us and 2 other tables, 6 people total. If you can go Wednesday through Sunday Beth works then, she is amazing. So helpful, always recommending, attentive, pleasant, sociable, etc... Just a fabulous gal all around. This is what I want when sitting at the bar. The kale salad was fabulous, as was the pizza. Last time we were here the Bolognese and calamari was fabulous. The food is outstanding, but Ricki is horrible. If you hate your job, stay home!
