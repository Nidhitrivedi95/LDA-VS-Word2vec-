xSIkiqB2tuiyJwFmPyNR5Q Yet again another atrocious experience at macaroni grill...first of all we were sat in the back room where the thermostat was set to a frigid 65 degrees. I'm normally a hot natured person but today I was so cold I had to put my arms inside my shirt for half of the experience so I didn't feel like I was freezing to death. One of the many sloppy dressed waiters wearing jeans asked if we wanted bread and it took us three times of asking again to actually get it. I asked for my salad dressing on the side and of course it wasn't, there was so much dressing I couldn't even taste my salad and it was sopping wet but I was literally too hungry at this point to have them make another. Overall very disappointed. Hard to say which was worse the service or the food.
