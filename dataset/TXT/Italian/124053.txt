HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q My review is only for the coffee - I did not try the gelatos (there were none out yet at 8am), or any of the pastries. We were staying at the Palazzo, so I had to try this place out. They open at 6am, so if you're awake that early (or haven't slept yet), this is the place to go. I had the cappuccino (my tummy can't handle the lactose in the lattes anymore), and it was delicious. No bitterness to it - it didn't need sugar or anything. The caffeine buzz from it was perfect as well, no jitters or heart palpitations. It also helps to be drinking it within the beauty that is the Shoppes of the Palazzo... Give it a try ;)
