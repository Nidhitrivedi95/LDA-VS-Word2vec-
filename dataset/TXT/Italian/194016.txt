pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg Loved this place. Great food in big portions for fair price. Due to high lease charged by Caesars Forum Shops, it's unusual to get a fair deal there. But when I left I felt I got a great deal.

The big boost in my great experience was the outstanding guest service we had. Not only from bartender/waiter that served us, but also from the operations manager that checked on us throughout and incited fun conversation.

 Then when throw on the best music played anywhere with lots of Sinatra, Dean Martin, Frankie Valli, Keely Smith and an occasional Motown hit. I love the DJ.

I also love the wide array of photos on the wall. I wish there was a directory. But I did recognize many of them.

Total home run!
