Lu5hB_5YtX5Re2067Zf3cg I consider myself a pizza snob, coming from NY I was not thinking I would ever find great pizza in Charlotte but to my surprise MezzaNotte won me over! They have great pizza and dinner entrees but I have to say I usually go with the pizza since it really is my favorite! It's a fun place and if you sit at the bar Kari will take great care of you! If you go on a regular basis she knows what you like and has it ready in a flash! 
We love MezzaNote and would highly recommend it!!! Thanks to all there for making us yankees feel right at home!
