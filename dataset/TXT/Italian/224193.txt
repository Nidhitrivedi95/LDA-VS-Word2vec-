sMJAUZNU6u4iNvpmaLgx_g I came here with a friend visiting from out of town and we both really enjoyed our meals.  If I was rating simply on the staff and service, I'd give it a 5.  We had an awesome waitress who was helpful in deciding which meal to order and also some of the highlights in the city to check out after we finished!  I went with the lasagna special and ate every last bit. We also shared the cheese board as an appetizer and really how can you go wrong with cheese?  Went for the flourless chocolate cake, which was scrumptious, but I may be biased that my Dad has the better version!
