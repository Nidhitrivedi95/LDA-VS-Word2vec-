FeC5DeqINOSr37y5TABnKA A couple of friends and I went for lunch today, and it was fantastic! 

We had the Cornish Club and open-faced Short Rib sandwich.  Everything is made in-house, including the bread - and this attention to detail really does elevate the meal. Portions are a bit on the small side, but the quality makes up for it.

The only issue I had was the side salad that accompanied the club sandwich. It was  a handful of arugula in an overly acidic dressing: If it was meant to offset the fatty (and delicious) meat in the sandwich, it should have been ON the sandwich.
