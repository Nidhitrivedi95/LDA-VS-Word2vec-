-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g Where to start? From the moment we walked in and realized that we had reserved on the wrong night, but efforts were still made to accommodate us, to the impeccable service and then on to the outstanding food ... Everything was just perfect! 

We are no strangers to Italian food, as it is one of our favourite countries visited based on food alone. So let me assure you that Le Serpent delivers on truly delicious Italian  food ... and more :)
It's Italy but with a twist of Asian/North American!

All the ingredients were so fresh and tasty, each dish held true to its description.
We started with the beef carpaccio served with a generous dollop of burrata (which is a fresh mozzarella stuffed with soft cream). It was divine! Best dish we've had in a while.
We followed with an excellent rabbit tartelette; flaky pastry, medium gamey meat, a bit on the saltier side though. 
For mains we had the linguini with speck, almonds and truffle bernoise. Each bite had the perfect balance of each ingredient; some crunch, some smoke and that heavenly hint of truffle! We also shared the classic lobster risotto. How can you go wrong with lobster risotto? Delicious and served Al Dente! 

Desserts did not disappoint either. We ordered the Tiramisu and were pleasantly surprised by a chocolate pistachio log, on the house! Both were pure joy and would satisfy any sweet tooth. 

Honestly if you haven't gone, go and try this place out... and then go back!  Because we know we will :)
