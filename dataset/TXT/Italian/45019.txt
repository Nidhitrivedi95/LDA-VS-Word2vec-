8EvgKu_VpVXJ0KUvrxS7BA I cannot believe I have not written a review for this place yet. It is literally around the corner from my house and I have been quite often. The service is great and the pizza is delicious. Now granted everyone that calls Sardella's, I am sure  their number ultimately locked in but I always feel special when I call and  they are like "Hey Eb, how are you? Are you getting your usual order"? lol.  I especially love their Monday deals in which some of pizzas are 50%. Score! Although one of my favorites is a the large meat lovers for about $12 (not included in the Monday special) It is meaty and delicious! Lord knows how many times I have ordered that one.

So if you happen to be in the neighborhood and you are craving pizza and wings, stop in to this location. I promise you won't be disappointed!
