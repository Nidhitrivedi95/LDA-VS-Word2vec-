lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ I stopped in for some appetizers during my conference break and it was amazingly delicious! I ordered the calamari which was on point. I was surprised how delicious it tasted because deep fried calamari is not easy to cook. I also had a side of the garlic fries. It was some of the best fries that I've ever had! I love how it comes with the dip on the side. I wanted to try the pizza but I ate alone so appetizers were enough for me. Great customer service!
