pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Surprisingly I've been here three times and I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes. Not that I would mind waiting. The bar you can wait at next door is adorable! Perfect spot to grab a bottle or glass of wine before dinner. The restaurant itself is cozy, warm, and filled with delicious scents from the large oven. The margherita and the onion & pistachio pizzas are my favorites. The ingredients are fresh and delicious and the crust is perfection. The caprese salad is also great! I loved everything about my experience here.. Definitely plan to return again & again. Plan ahead and if possible go with a small party on a less crowded night during the week to avoid a reallyyy long wait.
