pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ I moved to Las Vegas around a year and a half ago from NY and had been  in search for a taste of home. Thank you Nora's, I now feel I have found it. This is most authentic New York style Italian restaurant you can find outside of Little Italy in NYC...From the crafted cocktails to the apps and entrées down to the cannoli and espresso, I have yet to be disappointed. This is one of Vegas's Crown Jewels and I'm positive that we can all expect the same quality of fine food and service at their new location...
