Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag We had another amazing dining experience at Cucina by Wolfgang Puck.  

They just happened to have gluten-free ravioli available the night we dined.  They were light and delicious with cheese filing and a marvelous tomato sauce on top.

This time we also tried the gluten-free mushroom pizza with fontina, braised leeks, taleggio and a fried egg on top!  OMG, I have a new favorite - the flavors together on this pizza were unique and magical!  Wow, Wolfgang Puck... you really knocked it out of the park with this home run!
