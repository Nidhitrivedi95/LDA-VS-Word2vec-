Ask for Michael. He's an awesome server and a cool artist. He knows the menu well and helped us decide on what to order. Everything he recommended was AMAZING. 

I had the marinara pizza with vegan cheese added and ate it all in one sitting. The pizza is napoletana style with a delicious sauce that's just tomatoes imported from Italy and some salt. Seriously. So good. I'll definitely be back.
