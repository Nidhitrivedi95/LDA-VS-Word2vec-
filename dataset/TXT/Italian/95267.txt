eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg I ordered the Chicken Milanese salad. Half the items mentioned as the ingredients were either not there or just barely there. Service was good. Bread served tasted great until the second round when it came to the table partially frozen/ cold. My daughter ordered the ravioli and there was only 5 of them. The place is overpriced and over rated. Not enough on your order to fill a normal person.
