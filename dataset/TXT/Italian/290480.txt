ZvtELJTUOh0yRrPxyyiakQ I heard a joke once before ... they're not mad, they're just hot! And I use this to describe the customer service we received at lunch the other week. Our waitress didn't smile once while we were there. Just zero pizzazz. And it wasn't even 11:30 am yet for her to have a bad day, at least I don't think so. But at least she was nice? When our drink orders came, my co-worker ordered a sierra mist, only to find some black crud in his cup. Our waitress did apologize and came back with a new one for him.

Other than that, the food is good there. Good enough that my co-workers come to this restaurant all the time.

I ordered the O'zone Special of the day which was the Especial. But if we wanted to know what's in it, per the waitress, look it up under the hot sandwiches...hahaha.  I ain't making this up. That's exactly what she told us. Although it was the o'zone special of the day, it seemed it was their regular sized calzone. I could only eat half of the calzone! And it tasted pretty good. And honestly, I have had better calzone and far better customer service. 

As always, I'm happy to change my rating with an improved experience.
