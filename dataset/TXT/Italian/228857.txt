syJDAay5Huu3QWL51El2cA What Italian restaurant does not give you bread? The food was okay and the dinner portions were filling. A tad overpriced and my lasagna was floating in water and grease. We tried, nothing special probably won't be back again. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful and not over pushy! He was a pleasure to deal with.
