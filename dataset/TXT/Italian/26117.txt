4KZRFxciaKfTD7qbS55b7g Omg what an amazing little gem on the north-west side!  Went with my family after hearing it was a great place from a client.  We got a table on time despite it being pretty busy for a Sunday. Our server came and introduced himself and told us about the restaurant. They have homemade pasta and fresh baked bread and wildfires pizza. 

We ordered a burrata and pear salad to start with. The burrata came with roasted Campari tomatoes and pesto. I would have like the tomatoes to have a bit more flavor but the mozzarella was super fresh and with the delicious bread it was a win.  The pear salad was perfect with the spice from the arugula and the sweetness of in season pear.  The toasted shaved almonds were a nice surprise as well. It was dressed perfectly too. Not soggy at al and not too dry.  

For my entree I ordered the salciccio and funghi pizza. OMG it was perfection!!!! The sauce was perfectly seasoned. The mushrooms were fresh and the sausage wasn't too overpowering. It was the perfect Neapolitan style pizza. Bubbly, crispy, and chewy at the crust with some char and saucy and thin in the center. The rest of the family all got pastas and everyone's came seasoned perfectly and the pasta was the perfect texture with a nice amount of sauce on top.

We finished with a box of assorted homemade Italian cookies and oh my word they were delicious. 

I will definitely be back and would highly recommend this place to everyone!
