5U6eSspKyHyaT7jAYpgWTw I snuck in here around 10:15....early for lunch. I had a doctor's appointment downtown so I wanted to kill some time. He told me I lost weight and lowered my blood pressure so I felt obliged so eat something I probably shouldn't.

They had a handful of specials. One caught my eye was a 1/2 steak or Italian hoagie, chips and a 12 oz. soda for $5.95. I ordered the steak. Just like every place in this silly little town, they tried to pile a bunch of lettuce and tomatoes in it. I ordered it with just cheese, steak and onions.

I got a 6" sub on crusty, crispy, crunchy bread. The meat was fresh-sliced steak. The cheese was bubbly-brown mozarella. And the onions were potent. The only complaint with that one piece of  the bread was soggy from the juicy steak. Other than that, it was a good sandwich.

Another yelper complained about the size of the soda cup. It is small....12 oz. I didn't have a problem with this. You also have the option of getting a large fountain drink or a can of soda. If you really need to chug down that much soda, get a large one.

Oh the service...the cashier was super friendly. She even offered to let me have a free refill. As I arrived pretty early, there were alot of employees just shooting the breeze. They all seemed nice and friendly with each other.

All in all...just a normal pizza shop in the Burgh. Nothing special. It wasn't awful. It wasn't great. I'm sure their other subs are pretty good....the bread's good and that's the most important part to a good hoagie.

If I'm downtown again with time to spare I wanna check out their pizza.
