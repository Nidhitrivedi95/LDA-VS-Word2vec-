ix-CkoFcqTX7hi62ZqGXJQ First time eating at Angelo's this weekend and it was delicious! We didn't know what to expect but had been wanting to try it out for awhile now.  The parking lot is a little tight, and a few people were backing their cars into spaces, which upon exiting we realized why, but now we know! :)

You enter into the bar, which was slightly confusing, but go straight back to the dining area. I enjoyed the smaller dining area. A little more intimate of a setting. I didn't count, but I'd guess about 10-15 tables.

We ordered breadsticks for an appetizer, which were just perfect. The marinara they come with is slightly sweet. And the breadsticks themselves, were garlic and buttered up. Yum! Not greasy and soggy, but not over cooked either.

For our main dishes, we ordered the Chicken Pesto Pasta and Baked Mostaccioli (I added chicken). The portions were more than enough, and we had leftovers! Again, everything was cooked just right. The pasta was al dente, and the sauces were amazing. The only downside (if you can even call it that) was there was too much sauce for the chicken pesto pasta. I was like MORE pasta!!!  haha It was so good though. We really enjoyed our meal and the service. Waitress was friendly, knowledgeable on the menu and specials. Very warm and inviting atmosphere, loved the music they had playing lightly in the background. 

We will definitely eat again, and maybe even bring the kiddos!
