wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg I have been coming to this Italian restaurant for over 10 years. It is a classic restaurant in Toronto, known for its excellant quality italian food, good selection of wines, and dessert. 

My usuals are the Penza Pasta, a fabulous caesar salad and a nice glass of wine. On some occasions, the service has been less then stellar, but on a whole a consistant and good experience
