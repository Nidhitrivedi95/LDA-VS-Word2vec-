VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w four stars for the restaurant. two stars for the club. but because i enjoyed the food/restaurant so much, im going to go ahead and give this place four stars.

RESTAURANT
went here friday night w/ girlfriends for a bachelorette. 
- service was friendly and attentive, although a little scattered at times. 
- decor is beautiful, it's really really pretty inside. i would loooveeee to be brought here on a date. (hint, hint.) HOWEVER. the bathrooms?? what the hell is up with the water falling from the ceiling in the bathroom sinks? i got DRENCHED. water splashed all over my face. maybe im just not talented enough to use their fancy shmancy sinks :(
- we ordered a pitcher of some blueberry stoli drink. don't remember the exact name. for 9 girls, it came to $8/pp. we each got a little glass of delicious but completely weak drink. i do NOT recommend you purchase this. although tasty, a total waste of money. perhaps you could ask them to make it extra strong? 
- four of us went splitsies on three dishes: the beef kabobs (yummy and there was a kabob for each of us, so well-portioned), the greek salad (lots of fresh veggies, really tasty but the olives were bitter, and definitely worth $15 because it was huge), the greek dipping platter (the pita chips were sooo yummy and the hummus & tahini were perfectly made)

if this restaurant were in LA, i would go back all the time just to eat. really a yummy menu. i only wish we hadn't gone at 11pm, that is WAY too late to eat dinner. :(

CLUB:
seriously, why do owners think that they can take such a small space and call it a club? the place was CRAMMED with people, not because it was so great, but because the space was ridiculous. the dance floor was just a giant mass of people. ugh. and the bouncers were SO RUDE. pushing and shoving girls?? not cool at all. from what i remember, there was no bathroom line, which means there must have been ample stalls, but i dont remember it being particularly pretty. which is strange, because the rest of the club, although crappy for other reasons, was well-decorated. & as for drinks, they were made pretty weakly and $13 for a raspberry kamikaze (times 10 for 10 girls) is not okay if you dont listen to me, make regular kamikazes, and then get mad at me when i point out that you screwed up. heifer. 

basically, lavo is just a smidge larger than bank and just as shitty. save your time/money - go to XS or tryst.
