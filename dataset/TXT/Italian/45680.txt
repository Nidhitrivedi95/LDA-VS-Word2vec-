8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA Having eaten at Giordano's (among other pizza places) in Chicago (and Vegas), I would say that Amore does manage to capture the substantial technique of Chicago deep-dish style. But I would also say that the crust wasn't as fresh tasting as I would like it to be, and the fried ravioli were a bit of a letdown. Ultimately, it's 3.5 on the food, but I think the prices are a bit much considering the product. So, on that basis, I am dropping them down to 3. It's certainly far from the worst pizza place around, and you can have a satisfactory meal there.

EDIT: Having had an allergic reaction, I believe it is likely that their pizza crust and/or their ravioli have thiamine mononitrate, which is a sign that they are not using fresh or high-quality ingredients. Particularly for that price point, this is unacceptable. So, I am docking them a star.
