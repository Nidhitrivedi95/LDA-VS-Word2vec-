LGO manages to keep its wood fired crusts substantial and bready, yet never, ever flaccid (unlike other so-called wood fired pizza joints *ahem*Bianco*cough*Cibo). 

I'm knocking off a star because the place is always yuppie pandemonium, and you have to watch your ass in the parking lot because it's full of Range Rovers driven by women who don't know how to maneuver a large vehicle. But, they get part of that star back for the adjacent gelato shop. Perfection.
