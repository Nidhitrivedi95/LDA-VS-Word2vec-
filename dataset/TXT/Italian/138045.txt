jbbFyy2rl8x_7ssz-GifbQ I live in the area and have walked by this place many times, curious about how the food is.

At the start I was unimpressed because he service was slow, with not even water served. But throughout the meal I realized that the server was also the owner and short staffed - and when we spoke he was friendly and funny, so I appreciated that.

For appetizers my friend and I had the bruschetta and calamari. The bruschetta was unimpressive. The calamari was better - grilled, salted and put on top of a salad. Simple but decent.

I ordered the salami pizza (paesana). Thin crust pizza that was not bad and not incredible. The one thing I did really like was that it had thick slices of salami which I enjoyed.

My friend had the salmon fusilli, which I tried. The pasta was not home made which is disappointing because I think that any Italian restaurant hoping to be taken seriously will offer fresh made pasta. However, the sauce was quite good - large chunks of salmon, and a garlic rose sauce. 

So if you live in the area I would say give it a whirl, know what you're in for, and try the salmon fusilli.
