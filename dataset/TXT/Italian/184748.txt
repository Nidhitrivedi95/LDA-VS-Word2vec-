OIdOJaNS8M624F58XGV3PQ I've been here on many occasions. Twice with my toddler son and once for a girl's night out. 

I was relieved that they were accommodating of my large baby stroller and didnt shun me for bringing a baby to their chic hip trendy resto. 

Service was impeccable and no one was stuck up as you might expect places like that to be. They did not scoff at me for ordering water instead of a cocktail. 

The food....the food is amazing. I had their set lunch with the margarita pizza and every bite just melts in your mouth. The sauce is fresh, the dough is thin and crispy where it should be, the ingredients were top notch. I also tried their meatballs. Very meaty and succulent though I've got nothing else to compare them to. The caprese salad was also delicious. 

The mousse dessert in a jar is to die for. Creamy chocolaty and heavenly. The donut holes were also delicious. 

Definitely recommend this place.
