lvv9Vv_5i4IwvDdofO_rKg Underwhelming!! Pasta portion was small with barely any tomato sauce and one small piece of mozzarella - the sauce had a weird spice combo in it - tasted more like clove/cinnamon than tomato sauce. The marguerita pizza was mainly tomato sauce...maybe 5 small pieces of cheese and 4 small pieces of basil. Service was minimal- the server kept guessing what we were going to order and then pointed at things on the menu without saying anything- we think this was his way of suggesting what we should order although he didn't say anything so we weren't sure. We barely saw the server - he gave us one menu for two people and we tried to get another one but it never happened. 
 I would never return to this restaurant- there are so many other options for great Italian food in the city...don't waste your money here.
