RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q Spinato's is my GO TO place for pizza.  Their pizza, calzones...   well really just about anything on the menu is fabulous. Their homemade sauce is to die for and unique to itself.  I have dined in and the ambiance is great.  Taken out, when frankly, I just want to get home and relax, with my favorite comfort food.    I have tried most things on the menu and never had a bad taste experience.   I appreciate the fact, that even though they have multiple locations, they are locally owned so I am supporting MY local business' economy.   After enjoying Spinatos' for the past 14 years, this is the only pizza WORTHY of eating cold the next day.
