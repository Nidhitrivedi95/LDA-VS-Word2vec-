zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA My husband and I shared a seafood cioppino. It was expensive and it was simply just spaghetti sauce w/seafood added to it. No broth. It had to much noodles with barely any seafood. Also, it had so much oil in it that i had to ask for a cup of warm water to wash down the oil in my throat. It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't good! Garlic bread was good.
