UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ I don't usually review a chain restaurant but this one is special.  Although it is located in a "mall", it offers great outdoor seating in a comfy environment.  

Big plus, its meant for Vegas residents so its inexpensive.

They have a great tasting bar menu from M-F 3:30pm-6:30pm and M-Thurs 9:00pm till closing where all items are just 2.95.  Not just talking fries or chips either.  Great burger, sausage and pepperoni flat bread, beef carpaccio, spicy shrimp and eggplant, etc.  

Don't make the mistake of ordering the entire menu like a buddy and I did.  First your server and bartender will laugh at you (noob), and second, no way you will finish it (wasteful noob).

Wines are very inexpensive.  Large by the glass selection and generous pours are the norm.

If its a cooler night, sit outside by a fire pit and make some friends.

Service is very friendly (its a locals place).  Family friendly.

Oh yeah, the regular menu for lunch and dinner is also very good and fairly priced but you cannot beat the bar menu for price.

Well worth it.
