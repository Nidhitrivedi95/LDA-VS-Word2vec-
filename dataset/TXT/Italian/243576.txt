USbeHpw9-zMtGct92LtJYg Sorry for the long story...my husband and I moved back to the valley and after unloading our Uhaul truck we decided to do takeout from a place we missed. I looked up Venezias in Yelp and ordered the pizzas. When we got there we were hot, sweaty, exhausted, and hungry. But turns out I ordered from the wrong Venezias. My husband apologized for me and explained we just moved back were tired and made a mistake and asked how long if we wanted to wait for pizzas. We were given a cold drink while we waited, our order was cancelled at the other Venezias and they rushed our order and got it to us in 10 minutes. Pizza was amazing and it was nice to be reminded of their wonderful service. Thank you for the great welcome back to Mesa. We will be coming in to eat again and again!!
