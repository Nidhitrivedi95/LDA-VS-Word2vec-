w2b0ve7xpuCQkwYICFIUOg We were driving by last night and were attracted to the lighting from the street.
Upon entering- the ambience is fun and and inviting. The owner's wife is a talented artist and her wall sculptures and paintings decorate the ristorante . 
Giana the manager was the one that waited on us. She was warm and friendly.
She seems to really love her job. (we assumed she was an owner)

I ordered the special with scallops (to die for), salmon and a yummy homemade pasta (which Giana actually gave us a sample of to take home) in a white wine caper sauce. 
My hubsand ordered the Franks meat sauce pasta. Which he said it was one of the the most delicious he has ever tasted.

This little family ristorante  is a jewel. And we cannot wait to return.
Molto Buona!!!
