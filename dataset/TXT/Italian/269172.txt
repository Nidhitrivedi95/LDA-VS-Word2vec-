xjjxHavx4RIiW6zS6rasGA After coming to Tommy Vs  multiple times and having decent service, today was a disappointment. It all had to do with the waiter.  He was inattentive, got the order wrong, and proceeded to give attitude when we wanted it corrected.  Additionally, I had to ask bus boys on two occasions to get the waiter. Tommy Vs you can do better.
