yNp0ybYo07JQWlmdz1K4Cw I took my fiancee there for her 30th birthday with a relatively large group of friends. I selected Players because of the reputation. I would have to say we as a group were disappointed. Our server was not on the ball for such a large group. At one point I asked for a beer menu and she never brought it. I did not feel compelled to ask for it again. We had to ask her to clear appetizer plates, and  when our main entrees came. She never cleared the plates in front of my fiancee and we just ate around them. I ordered a burger medium well and a lobster pizza. The burger was overdone and lacking of all juice the fries it was served with were luke warm. The pizza had a firm crunchy crust that seemed to be overdone. It was what I would expect if I went to Applebee's not somewhere that charges 22 dollars for a lobster pizza and 16 bucks for a burger. Honestly, I do not mind spending the money, but I expect more from these places. I would not recommend players to anyone who asked me and I don't see myself returning. There is way too much competition in this segment to have bad service and bad food. I would have complained but I did not want to ruin the evening.
