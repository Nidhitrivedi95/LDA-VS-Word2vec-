RzPqAx9QLEccTpxJcLqyfg FRESH describes this place best!  I took a friend here for her birthday lunch. Wonderful, welcoming owner and his wife is a superb cook. They make everything from scratch and when they run out, they are out. This means that everything they have is really freshly made. We shared the Chinese chicken salad, which was superb and had homemade dressing. Hummus was tasty and homemade. We had the delectable maple-pecan bars for dessert, which were, again, homemade and SO good! The interior is pretty plain, but don't let that turn you away! As others have said, it's not the easiest place to find, but worth the search. I really wish them well; they deserve the business!
