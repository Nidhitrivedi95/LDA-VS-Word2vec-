JTKzGJvIK9yuoUf-erV2qQ I'm the jerk who goes to the pizza place and gets a meatball sub.  But I had food jealousy and I had to!!  I saw a waitress with a tray full of them and then I watched this guy bite into it and it was done, I had to have it!  

Was it worth it?  HECK YEAH IT WAS!  There's nothing like a thick Italian bread bun with 4 heaping balls of meat, enough marinara sauce to satisfy my sauce obsession and melted moz cheese.  Does that talk you outta a pizza now?  It was REALLY good and worth every bite.  I did not get food jealousy over my friends pizza.  

Will I go back and order the Pizza next time?  Maybe, unless I see a Meatball Sub go by again, then all bets are off!
