TMkTYhDMgDCuFwdDYIIoJA Four stars for the two appetizers (calamari and spicy shrimp)' both were very enjoyable.  The salad was also very good.  
One star for the main entrees.  Both mine and the wife's were awful.  I had the tilapia with asparagus.  The asparagus was way over cooked the the fish was very dry.  Wife had a pasta dish and was very disappointed. The kids meals were okay.
Atmosphere wasn't very appealing since areas were dirty in the waiting area and the dining area near the fireplace.  Wait staff was very inconsistent, our waiter was very neglectful, while the waitress at the table next to us seemed very attentive to her tables and we had to ask her for refills on bread, salad and drinks while our waiter was MIA.
Bottom line, go somewhere else while in the Concord Mills area.
