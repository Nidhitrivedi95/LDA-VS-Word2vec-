JlkHGjgS3MJ5FqEDJdu8xQ Service was slow, but it was mother's day.  Had the grilled chicken chopped salad and it wasn't that great, but not bad either.  My son's kid's meal chicken parm was actually really really good.  The "mac n cheese" that came with it was extremely good.  Maybe next time I'll pretend to be a kid and order it for myself.
