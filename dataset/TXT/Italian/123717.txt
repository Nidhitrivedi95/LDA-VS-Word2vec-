HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q Beautiful cafe with fresh crepes, gelato, sandwiches, pastries and delicious Illy coffee drinks. The "Amore" which is their version of an Irish Coffee (non-alcoholic) sent me into a sugar coma. Imagine amaretto at the bottom of the glass, then a shot of espresso and fresh whipped cream on top. Sip the espresso through the cream and you'll be so full that you won't want anything else.

But save room for some gelato too... or have an Affagato to satisfy your craving for both. It's 2 scoops of gelato with espresso poured over. Yummm...

It's a beautifully bright and cheery place. Do a little shopping at Barney's and then walk across the way to this place. You'll love it.
