hT3pnZ6HR7oLDE-LfxAElQ After just moving to the area, my husband and I were looking for "our" place.  We were craving Italian and love supporting small businesses so we stopped by on a Wednesday evening.  Here is what we experienced....

Service: upon arrival, we were "greeted" by a hostess who asked us if we had a reservation. We glanced at the mostly empty seating area and she added "...well you don't have to have one."  Huh. So she seats us and turns out is also our waitress.  We were starving so I was about to order our drinks and possibly some appetizers when she interrupts me to read off a lengthy list of specials. It seemed to take forever to get our drinks. 

Food:  When the bread came, it was fresh, delicious, and disappeared quickly. That is where the compliments for the food ends. I even asked our waitress if they order food from a frozen food company because there was absolutely NO flavor.  You would think that an Italian dish might include oregano, garlic, onion, parsley, basil.... Nope. My chicken parmigiana was literally unseasoned Panko crusted chicken and a sauce that was almost acidic because the tomato flavor had nothing to be balanced against. I honestly felt like walking out after the first bite and going to Olive Garden and I despise chain places. My husbands favorite dessert of all time is Tiramisu. He has driven to EarthFare right before they close just to get a piece of there's.  He actually declined their's and asked if we could get ice cream from McDonald's instead. It was that bad. 

Value: everything you need to know about their prices, known from the fact that only the first loaf of "complimentary" bread is free.
