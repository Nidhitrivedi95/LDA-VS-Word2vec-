What I Liked: The lady working there was really nice. I believe she was one of the owners. The decor was kind of cool...sort of Ikea-chic. I didn't stick around to try the wi-fi out, but it says they have it.

Room For Improvement: It seemed kind of dark and quiet in there--so much that I had to ask if she just opened the door (nope, she had been there an hour already). It would seem more lively with more light and some music playing. The medium Mocha was a tad overpriced ($4.22 with nothing extra). The flavor and quality was nothing really to brag about either.

Overall: They're a new business still (about 3 months old), so maybe they'll work the kinks out and I'll have a better experience next time. I'm curious about their gelato, but I don't think I'll be back for the coffee.
