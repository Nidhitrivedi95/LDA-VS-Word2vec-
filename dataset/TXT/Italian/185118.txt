oJSa5HCiZXKLXxggQmecEQ ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE! 
Came here to celebrate my birthday with some friends and we all LOVED it! Great ambiance and vibe, lovely staff, nice decor and DELICIOUS food! All the dishes that we've ordered was incredible! My favourite of the night was the Fresh Burrata Cheese with Roasted Grapes and Toasted Bread and the fish (i think it was a trout). The bone marrow was also fantastic and let's not forget the dessert: the Salted Caramel Budino! YUM! out of this world! I guess the only thing I didn't like was my mixed drink, didn't finish it, but my friend was more than happy to help me with that. Next time, I will have their fresh made pasta. Can't wait!
