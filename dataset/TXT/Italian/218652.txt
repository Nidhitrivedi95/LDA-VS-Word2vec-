s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q The food is pretty good, and our server was very nice! Very pricey tho and the location and ambiance is very lacking. 

We got a LivingSocial deal for half off voucher here, so we decided to give this place a try. Parking was a nightmare at the Tropicana, and we had to walk a long way from the parking structure to the entrance then another long walk over to the restaurant. The restaurant was tiny and sort of inappropriately built on the side of a walkway, lacking any type of ambiance or privacy. The floor looked dirty and aged. Our hostess was nice enough to seat us by a small table at the window. 

We got one salad to share, one glass of wine, 2 entrees and the bill without the voucher was $120. Hella expensive and definitely over priced! This restaurant is a slightly better middle ranged restaurant but definitely not a "fine dining" establishment and the prices do not reflect that. The food: salad was average. The chicken entree was seasoned well and cooked well. The salmon dish was definitely my favorite, lightly sauteed, juicy and soft. The spinach side that came with it was also seasoned well, flavorful and cooked well. 

I would come here again if we had another voucher, but definitely would not pay full price for this place.
