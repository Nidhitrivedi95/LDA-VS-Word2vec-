I don't come here for the bar though although that is a big draw. I come for the food, particularly the Sunday brunch. Come here for the Sunday Brunch and you'll be swept away by the gloriousness that is their Parmesan garlic potatoes. These are so delicious I could eat a whole plate of just potatoes. Beyond the starchy goodness, there's also bacon, scrambled eggs, sausage, fruit, pasta, chicken, made-to-order omelets and waffles with toppings. The service has always been great and the price is very reasonable. We come here several times a year and never leave disappointed.
