8J55FMsOXei4Xh1jHSpElw First time here.  Had a late lunch today because we had a gift card from our son.  This place is OK.  That's about all I can say . . . 2 pizza's + 2 beers = $30.  Crust is very thin.  Go if you love thin dry crust.  Don't think I'd ever go back.  There were a few tables with dirty dishes.  They weren't busy at all.  Wish I could say more.  I'm sorry but this place didn't excite.
