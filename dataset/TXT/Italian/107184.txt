FW_zg6VuyW5v_vM394gWAw I consider myself an expert, being born & raised on pizza from Queens, NY. This place is very good & I have to stop by here every time I'm in Summerlin. The availability of Wise potato chips is also pleasant surprise. There are Italian ices & zeppoles for desert to make Rocco's complete.
