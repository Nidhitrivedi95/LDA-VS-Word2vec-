If I had to show someone a good pizza place in town to go to, I'd choose this Barro's. The option of splitting toppings on your pizza is awesome too, though I'm sure most pizza places allow that nowadays. There's always been plenty of parking, it's never too noisy, and it seems like a great place to bring your family (I always see people there who seem to have just gotten out of a little league game or a family hang out).
