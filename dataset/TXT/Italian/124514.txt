Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ I had to try this place from recommendations from a fellow co-worker.  the outside is very underestimating as the inside is on a whole other level. It is comfy, cozy, and the music is awesome. keeps a positive train of thought as you wait for your pizza. the wait was long but expected as they make the pizza right in front of you.. Literally they have a glass wall and you can watch them make the pizza. I had no problems waiting as the final product was ridiculous! ! we had the 18" with cheese, eggplant, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, roasted garlic, pepperoni, and olives. along with their garlic rosemary knots. the pizza was great, the marinara sauce was very flavorful but not overpowering.  the mozzarella cheese tasted fresh, the toppings were very flavorful and did not disappoint at all! pizza was on another level from others ive tried in my opinion and is highly recommended. the garlic rosemary knots are awesome. the knots are a bit dense and tough but after all it is a knot lol! but I didnt mind as the garlic and rosemary was very intense and was a great surprise as the knots ive had around town fall way short on the flavor category, not these though! They are perfect and a must try with their pizza. oh I also ordered their cannoli and I am currently waiting to try them as I am stuffed!! we finished half the pizza and there was two of us and I am satisfied! ! if you like pizza and havent tried this place, put your usual pizza spot on hold for once and go here it will not dissapoint!!

Update: so I had the cannoli!  It was good. It did however taste like a twist on what a canoli im used to taste like. It has the look. The shell is good and crispy, very dense shell. The filling to me tasted like a cream cheese/ cinnamon cream filling. It was good, just not what I expected. Try it out and let me know what you all think??
