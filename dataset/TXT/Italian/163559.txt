lwpQQflP1CGJPV7QLybzOg Loved the pizza here. I first tried their food at the Yelp pleY date event and it was delishious! Their meatball, ravioli, mozzerella cheese sampler at the event was awesome. I just had to come and check them out.

The pizza is not quite what I would call a thin crust, but the dough is not too thick either. I may just be trying to convince myself that pizza is good for you here, but does thinner crust = less carbs? I think so, and thats what I'm going with at least. 

All their pizza's come topped with their home made mozzerella, and I finished mine off with meatballs, which seemed like a good idea at the time. 

I was right! The meatball pizza is nothing less than super. They seem to have different daily specials. Swing by on a Tuesday for buy one get one free pizzas and bring home some 'za for tha family.
