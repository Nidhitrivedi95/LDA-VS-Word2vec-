PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ Had the beef Wellington which was very tasty but not worth the $36.00 price tag! The steak my wife had was a bit over cooked as compared to what she ordered. Service was really great! Didn't make reservations, so had to sit at the bar. Lots of other people had the same problem. With the amount of people in this restaurant and to only have a one person bathroom is crazy!
