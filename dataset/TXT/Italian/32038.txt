5sTFevXhGx01eLT4wF7Urg Reservation was made for 4 of us for a birthday celebration. No reservation was needed! Lounge was packed, restaurant not so much.
This was our first and last time here. Questioned a particular vodka, server stated not available and never heard of it, of course after she served our drinks, she appeared with the vodka in hand, humbled. We began with the tableside mozzarella to share, was pretty decent, however, before we were 1/2 through, our entrees appeared. Seriously? What happened to dining? Not like they needed the table for the next party, plenty were available, 6:30pm reservation and we were out by 7:45pm. Has anyone ever seen rolled monkfish? Looked like two turds on my plate, had to use a knife to cut so tough and chewy, no I didn't send it back, not worth it. Monkfish is to be silky and smooth, almost like halibut. How about calamari served with capers? That's a first for us. Tuna Tartare? Tasteless. I will say the Tiramasu that the birthday boy ordered was ok and nice touch to include it. Don't waste your time or your money!
