We started off with an order of half a dozen oysters (I believe we had Blue Point), only to be served with five.  It was a funny mistake, but corrected without any hesitation from the waiter by giving us three more oysters.  I ordered the Penne with Crab, Shrimp and Scallops.  The dish was good, but I was expecting more than just a couple pieces of crab.  However, my friend ordered the lamb chops, and it was cooked to melt in your mouth perfection.  

We ended our dinner with a $7 Tiramisu which was definitely large enough for three to share and maybe even four.  If you prefer quantity over quality, then this is the desert I would go for.  

This is a place that I would go back to again, and next time I HAVE to order the lamb chops.
