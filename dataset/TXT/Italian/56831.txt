AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw went here for dinner this past weekend.  the ambiance was delightful and the service was excellent.  we started off with the antipasti appetizer plate, the dried artichoke did not look very appetizing.  we also had the water mozzarella which was accompanied by a golden tomato, and that was very good as well.  my friend and i shared the halibut entree. they were nice enough to split it into two dishes, and it was very nice and light considering this was our third dinner of the night.  it was her birthday so they came out with a creme brulee which was the best i've had in awhile.  you should make a visit when you're in vegas!
