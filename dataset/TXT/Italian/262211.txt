wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg Came on a Friday night. Place was packed on arrival, and was told to expect a 45 min wait. 5 minutes later, I was told a window table for two was open and I was seated. Waitress was very attentive and checked on me many times as I waited for my date to arrive. Food was very tasty. Night was a success. Will be back. Valet is a little unnecessary as parking lot is small.
