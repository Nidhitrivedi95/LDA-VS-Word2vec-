ARWLV46iIa3Dvt1y8-SPpA After walking around the Desert Botanical Garden this past Saturday night we were starving and my mom had this place in mind for dinner. With a bottle of Campaign in a cooler pack (love BYOB) we pulled up at 9:00 pm to find a closed sign at the door. We asked if we could still come in for dinner and they took us in. I do find 9pm a little early to be closing on a Saturday, but I didn't care. I had a table, a drink, and it smelled good. 
Hot bread was brought over with garlic & herb butter. Great start to the meal. I ordered the chicken parmesan and they gave me a side of the Alex Pasta. It was all de-lish! The portions are generous and while the dessert menu looked good, we were stuffed. Guess I need to save room next time.
FYI- cash only!
