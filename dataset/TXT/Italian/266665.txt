x4mhAhgIVUd205iXMoyzCQ What a wonderful surprise.  You can't tell from the outside, but the inside is quite nice with a comfortable bright atmosphere.  That being said, let's get to the only thing that matters, the food.

First off, we ordered one of their brick fire pizzas.  Absolutely delicious.  I never eat the crust on my pizza but found myself doing so.  The crust is fluffy yet has crunch and also very flavorful.  The pizza was our appetizer!  The next thing I ordered was the house special.  Stewed lamb with homemade gnocchi.  Oh my goodness this was good.  Gnocchi wad well prepared, the lamb was fall of the bone tender and the sauce was great. 

The service was excellent and I enjoyed chatting with the host and server.  The host made us feel like we should stay a while and do and typical 4 hour Italian dinner.  I and coming back!
