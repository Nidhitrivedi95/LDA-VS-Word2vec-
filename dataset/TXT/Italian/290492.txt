ZvtELJTUOh0yRrPxyyiakQ Normally I really enjoy oregano's just went to this location. My boyfriend and I ordered a salad and the alfredo in the dark. The alfredo was over priced for having a oily butter sauce. no cream  no flavor.  The vino bambino is usually my favorite but when we got it it was warm and the pasta that was tossed in was old waxy and melted in my mouth. Gross. .  I want to give oregano's another chance but not at this location!
