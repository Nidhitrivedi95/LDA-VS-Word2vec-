-dqK97OczNSfrfa71cuYmA We were waiting for this place to open near our building for a while now. When it finally did, we thought we'll give it a try. We asked about the contents of one of the starters and the waitress mentioned all of the vegetables and left out a very important ingredient, the meat. We ordered it thinking it was vegetarian. 

The starters arrived, my husband ate one in one bite and I used my fork and knife to cut into one. That's when we realized there was meat in it. We called the waitress to ask what kind of meat, since we don't eat pork. It was ham. When we told her that she didn't mention that, she started arguing that we didn't mention we don't eat ham. Huh? Imagine this, the waitress standing there for 5 minutes telling us that it's our mistake. To make matters worse, she called the manager who stood there for another 10 minutes telling us that it's our fault, and that we should of stated that we don't eat pork as soon as we entered the restaurant. What?! Just change the plate and let us eat in peace! 

The manager did offer to have the starter "on the house" after giving a lesson on how to order in a restaurant. My husband refused and paid full. We took the pizza "to go" and ate in the comfort of our own home. It wasn't that good anyway. Left a bitter taste in our mouth after what happened. The place was empty, we should of figured that much.
