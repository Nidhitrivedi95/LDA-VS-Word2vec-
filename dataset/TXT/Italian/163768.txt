lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg The restaurant itself was really cute and not crowded at all for a weekday around lunchtime; which was great! We were informed about the wait, if ordering pizza, before we were seated and that was perfect fine with us (approximately 45 minutes).  The waiter was pleasant, we ordered quickly and enjoyed the view of the strip.  We were a little disappointed after waiting for such a long time, that our pizza was cold when it came out.  Its as if it had been sitting back in the kitchen under a warmer for a solid 15 minutes..thats how cold it was.  Needless to say, I think we will skip it the next time we are in town.
