_7FdoBvlZH64Zx52ISc59Q I've come here a handful of times, the $5.00 all you can pizza slices for lunch is a deal hard to beat, whatever toppings you want.  The slices are so big however, I've never been able to eat more than two.  There is large array of toppings to choose from, from the standard pepperoni, sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms, to buffalo chicken & bbq pulled pork. All of which I thought were pretty damn good.  We have even ordered food from here for all whole office a couple times, with no complaints.
