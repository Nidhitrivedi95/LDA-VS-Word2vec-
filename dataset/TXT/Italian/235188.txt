TVKenh65WwJX3zEr36zKCA Visited this restaurant inside Sunset Station on Saturday 7-16-16 around 6PM.  I've been dying to try a pan roast and see what all the fuss is about.  This is the only Oyster Bar location that comes up in Yelp as "good for kids? YES" when you search for it.  

It is indeed good for kids.  It seems like the other locations just have a bar with stools but this location has tables.  The restaurant is modeled to look like a grotto and has water features all around it.  We got a booth that had a waterfall behind it and I felt like I was a mermaid LOL 

$76.79 got us two soft drinks, a caesar salad, a shrimp cocktail, two sides for my boy, crab legs, and a signature pan roast.  Service was fast, thoughtful, and pleasant. I like how our server brought out my boy's food first, because he is an impatient little thing.  

$20 signature pan roast - shrimp, crab, and lobster in a savory tomato stew.  The meats were so tender and sweet and the broth was so thick and creamy.  Their white rice is sticky and fragrant and pairs perfectly with the pan roast.  I loved every bite of this.  It's making my mouth water just thinking about it!

$28 (market price) crab legs- Hands down the biggest, cleanest, most delicious crab legs I've ever eaten.  They were even scored to make cracking them easier.  They came with potatoes, andouille sausage, corn on the cob, and a nice big bowl of drawn butter.  Upon request we were given all the lemons we desired.  Two sets of cracking tools were brought to the table automatically. 

$12 chilled jumbo shrimp cocktail- Very well executed.  The shrimp were huge!  It took me like 4-5 bites each to get through them. The cocktail sauce is so fresh and has a big hunk of real horseradish in it.  Made my eyes water!  It just might be my favorite shrimp cocktail of all time. 

Next time I want seafood I know where I'll be coming!
