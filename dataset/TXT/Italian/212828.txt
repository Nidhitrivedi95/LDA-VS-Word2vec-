The caprese was so tasty and the mozzarella cheese so fresh and creamy. My boyfriend particularly appreciated the spicy Italian sausage. In addition, I had the Birra Moretti...the queen of Italian beers, so light and regenerative. I'm Italian from Milan and for me was like feeling home again. I've noticed that all the products they have are really authentic imported from Italy, and I think I'll buy some of the products for some Christmas presents. We'll definitely come back! É stato spettacolare e ci ritorneremo presto. L'Italia é sempre l'Italia.
