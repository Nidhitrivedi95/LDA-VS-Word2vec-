DHP5gORcJBlpUacP33NjpA The place is not fully operating as of yet as there are some renovations that are still under way.  I stopped into this place to grab a coffee and some free WIFI.  The owner was very pleasant and seems very knowledgable in the restaurant industry.  The coffee and service was great and it was nice to not be rushed.  It has a nice/quaint atmosphere.  There are lot of windows and space.  I look forward to coming back when it's in full operations.  I will probably be back for another coffee!  Would recommend people to stop in and check it out.
