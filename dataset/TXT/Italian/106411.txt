fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I have been to Cherryblossom countless times for lunch over the past few years. I have to say the location kinda sucks, but that's because of all the traffic. Are they ever going to finish construction on Camelback?! 

Any way, I decided to get a to go lunch order today. Since it was actually chilly out, I ordered the cha-shu ramen noodles with a couple of their yummy bread rolls & also picked up a slice of their amazing blueberry bread. The rolls were yummy as usual & I ate half of the cha-shu, so good & a big enough portion for me to have it again for lunch tomorrow. 

Service can be slow there sometimes, it's best to go at 11am or after 1pm, to beat the lunch crowd. Other tasty items I have enjoyed here are: cali crunchy roll, double shrimp crunchy roll, grilled chicken salad (w/ginger dressing instead), calamari, edamame & I have tried a couple different pasta dishes which were surprisingly good!
