Set on an unassuming street, the outside of the restaurant blends with the repainted, plain tan walls of its neighbors - thank God for the lit up, color changing art deco themed sign that marked its entrance. It's a place you just are lucky to stumble upon. 

Our group of 5 went into the restaurant on a Saturday, right as the dinner/theatre rush was ending. Love the old school pictures of celebrities and sports stars that have visited this establishment. We sat down at a corner table and was taken care by the nicest of waitresses - an older lady who'd you think would be at your local diner. We quickly noticed the Zucchini appetizer and ordered those up. The thin and long slices of full zucchini was lightly floured and flash fried - absolutely light and delicious with their homemade marinara sauce. One order was enough for the five of us, but we were too excited and ordered two. 

The salads were basic and to that end, they were just no frills and solidly delicious. The Chicken Marasala that I ordered was delicious. The lightly floured chicken, pan fried and sautéed in a perfectly textured marsala sauce that was just the right consistency and taste - not overly sweet like some marsalas. The sautéed button mushrooms and marinara string beans were a great side. You knew that quality ingredients and an experienced cook really turned those dishes out. 

And what meal would be complete without some good tiramisu. 

Although I really enjoy eating at trendier places that have a new twist on food, sometimes you just crave the classic and simple. This was that place. 

Best highlight: Food that was fit for the soul and for the moment. 
Low point: None.
