nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Had a delicious dinner with my husband. The Venetian Hotel is a sight to see and the food at Buddy Vs was incredible- possibly the best I've ever had. I had the Bronzino and my husband had the chicken parm- Wow. My martini was incredibly good. No dessert- we were super satisfied from our dinner.
