6PQve0oFCLPSh4wnIzvJtg Love this place for the its NY style Italian restaurant atmosphere. When I'm there I always feel like I'm back in NYC eating in Little Italy. Everyone is friendly and plates are priced/portioned well. My girlfriend and I love doing take outs from here whenever we want to stay in and do dinner/movie night together. She loves their gnocchi with cream sauce and I love their rigatoni with mushrooms and sausage in roasted pepper cream sauce. Each entree comes with salad/soup and bread.

I want to try their pizza one day too, since I've heard many good things about it. Definitely give this one a try.
