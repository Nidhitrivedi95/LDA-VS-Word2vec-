RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q My husband has been bringing home a calzone from work to home in GoldCanyon for years from Spinato's and it's always been very tasty. Today we dined in and had a meatball mushroom calzone and was one of the best I've eaten. Just enough sauce to compliment the perfect crust. Rob our server was very attentive and helpful in recommending the best way to purchase and get a calzone to go when you have such a distance to go. I will continue to get them to go but definitely the best way to appreciate their calzone is to dine in.
