Tc511yME8axDPq2J6woxkg We have never had a bad meal at Lockkeepers so wanted to take my in-laws here for their 30th wedding anniversary. This experience certainly did not disappoint! Emily Q was perhaps one of the best waitresses we have had anywhere. The wine and food recommendations were spot on and the meal was very well paced. We will be returning for many a special occasion in the future.
