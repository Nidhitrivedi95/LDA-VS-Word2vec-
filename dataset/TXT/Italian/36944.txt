6XhlgvpC5dgIgKITz2024g I do not understand all the bad reviews! Perhaps angry pizza shop owners in the area who are jealous of this place... I've ate here now twice and both times have been perfect. Food came fast and hot. Pizza very delicious. Perfect amount of sauce and toppings. I love the salads and the dressing is great. The jojos are awesome! Please folks try Antonios! You won't be disappointed.
