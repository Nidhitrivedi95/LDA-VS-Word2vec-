Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A This place is pretty tasty... I went here tonight with the BF and another couple after wanting to go for months.. MONTHS! and it still didn't disappoint, so that's how you know it's good. We started with some drinks, I had a peach bellini, which was good, the BF had a manhattan, and he said it was very good, I thought it was good too, but I haven't had one before, so I don't know how it compares. We had the bruschetta, which was pretty good, but could have been better with some balsamic I think. The real star is, of course, the pizza. The BF and I split the fried pizza.... wow! What a brilliant idea! It was like pizza inside a light fluffy doughnut. Plus, the mozz they use is wonderful and so are the tomatoes.... very good. The other couple had a pizza with prosciutto on it and a pizza with roasted veggies (can't remember the names...). I didn't try the veggie, but it smelled very fresh and delicious like bell pepper. I tried the prosciutto and it was very good, and they didn't skimp on it either... this pizza was covered. It was pretty tasty. I would say that it is not the best pizza in phoenix... but it is good and worth a return visit. We finished with the tiramisu, which ended up not being great, but not being bad. So I would definitely go back and get the pizza... I would also like to try the salad, as the ones I saw looked really good. So yay pomo! Way to make tasty pizza!
