YSPwC1polC7TOwP1kkxkjg Pizza was bangin'!  Gnocci in rose sauce...delicious.  The best mochaccino I've had since being in Italy.  Quick and attentive service.  The fried calamari was a very tasty and large starter.  It was, however, more expensive than our main courses.  Good place to stop for lunch if you are shoping at Jean Talon market.
