M4mNS2LZPjpzQyiJgL8znw Not a good experience.  I took my mother and husband there for his birthday lunch.  I was not greeted very well by the owner.  It was like we were a bother. We were the only customers there at 2pm I requested seating in the wine room.   It was all set up but told NO it was not set up and we could not sit there. I said please it is special occasion to some guy with an attitude again the answer was NO.  I was planning on bringing a group of 10 back for a holiday dinner an sit in that room....not  now...not EVER.

The bread came    yuk. frozen processed rolls. I can get better from the freezer at Cosco.  I asked for some olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dip it in.  They said NOo they only do that at dinner. Wow, it was a birthday lunch.. a little olive oil and vinegar would not break the bank.  Instead we got pre-wrapped ice cold butter pats for the crappy roles.  Right then and there we should have left. If we did not have my elderly mother with us, we would have.
 
The food was a disappointment.  Our mushroom ravioli was cold, the sauce was thin and tasteless, the ravioli was the frozen kind it was gummy and  (once again) I could have gotten better at Cosco.  The iced tea tasted like the instant kind (Nestea).
My husband's spaghetti and meatballs looked like a child portion and the sauce was bitter.  

I did not complain, we were all very hungry, we had another appointment to go to after lunch, so we choked it down.  
There was another location in SouthPark that went out of business.  I can see why. 
This was a waste of hard earned money and a very disappointing birthday lunch for my husband.  I can't understand how they get away with this...maybe the people living in that area never tasted good Italian food? 

 Lest not forget Ajoojis loves the word NO. So in the spirit of Aroojis..... will we return? NO...will I take my staff there for our holiday dinner? NO. Is the food delicious? NO.  Are they accommodating? NO
