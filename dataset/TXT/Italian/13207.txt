15YuEFO59yXd7BTO5NZgYw Went last night for Birthday dinner for my daughter. We have been coming here for over 20 years but sadly we haven't been in several years. Very busy but very good service. Had a table for 6, Vito's takes great pride in preparing a great pizza. Their crust is one of the best, not soggy at all. Very crisp crust  and plenty of toppings on top. Ordered with extra cheese and still was cooked to perfection. Owner came over twice to insure everything was done to our satisfaction, We will be back soon, great place, I wish I could say the same thing about my daughter's boyfriend. Thanks Vito's!!!!!
