M-JeG20Ll_OLw9eMIGkKqw Informal, fast-casual Italian spot near all the action downtown. Menu is large, and the food is surprisingly high quality. It's traditional Italian so nothing is going to surprise you, but you can get excellent pasta and meat dishes for $10-15. This is easily the best deal in the neighborhood, and probably the best value Italian in all of Montreal.
