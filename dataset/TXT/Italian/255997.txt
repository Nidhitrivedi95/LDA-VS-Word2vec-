vzoAKt7ND2YPLYfnVRi_Cg I was visiting some family in Scottsdale and we stopped in here for lunch...gotta say - solid pizza! Got the thin crust with salami and mushrooms. Great price and the crust was nice and crunchy fresh out of the oven. Good tasting sauce and the sauce to cheese ratio was spot on for me. Beer selection is a little lacking if you're into craft beer, but hopefully they'll bring in some local stuff on tap. Definitely worth checking out!
