B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw Went around 6:30pm on a Friday evening for a birthday.  The place was packed already. Our wait time to be seated for table of four was 45 mins.  

The ambience has a rustic feel to it. There were tables outside, in the basement,  in the ground floor, and on the roof top.  The tables were so close to each other and you're left with too little space to move.  The place was loud,  but not with the sound of music.  It was loud cause of too many people chattering with one another. I would like it more if there's at least music playing. They only have the washroom on the basement, so imagine going to the washroom was a trip cause we were seated on the rooftop plus to manuever around tables was a quest.  

The service was okay.  The server was nice but we waited for our food for atleast 45 mins.  Maybe because the place was packed. 

I ordered their Rigatoni Bolognese as my main course.  We ordered tuscan fries and bruschetta to share.  The food was mediocre.  Nothing really special to it.  Plus, the pasta that I ordered was not even warm.  The plate was warmer than my food which is a bit disappointing.     Needless to say, I didn't finish my food.  

Overall, I'd say that I felt nothing special about this place. I won't say that I will never come back here. I will still give this place a chance.  It's just not on top of my lists of restaurants to recommend to others.
