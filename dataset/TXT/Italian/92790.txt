EhuKnhTKJTm_EZ_QGe7PvQ Food and service was great. Server was very accommodating. Here is what my problem is. There is a party of 18 people seated next to me. The woman has a "Service" dog. Totally get it. However, when your dog is barking and whining. Disturbing my experience, then I have a problem. She says to her companions, he wants more bread. 

A Manager should have said something to this party. The dog needed to be removed. It took 20 minutes before someone in her party, took the dog out. 

Maybe that's what Lassie was trying to tell you.

Dumb
