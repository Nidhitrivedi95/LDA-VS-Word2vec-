FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A This used to be my very favorite place for mac n cheese ever. I live in North Las Vegas and used to travel all the way to the old Warm Springs location (which was always better) before this one opened.  Today I wanted some comfort food, so I order some pepper jack mac to go, since I was nearby for an appointment. This is what I always order, as it's my favorite. I opened the container, after only 30minutes drive home and was horribly disappointed. All the macaroni was in one big clump and it didn't even look like there was much sauce on it. I tried to stir it and saw very little cheese either. I decided to call the store to ask for advice on heating it back up, which really wasn't needed as it was still hot, but I wanted that normal look and taste back. The gentleman told me he had no advice except stir it. He stated it's cheesy and it dries up. Well, needless to say. Nothing worked. It wasn't cheesy at all, it had no taste of pepper jack and still tasted like flour. This was a disappointment as I have noticed this restaurant in continually getting worse with its food flavor and prep. For someone to tell me on the phone, " I don't know what to tell you" makes me even more upset. I won't be traveling across town any more for my favorite dish, nor will I be getting it when I'm close for an appointment, as they just don't seem to know how to specialize in it anymore and they really don't seem to care. Saddens me greatly. Hopefully I'll be able to find my own recipe soon.
