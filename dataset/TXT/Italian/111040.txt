g-nzfTvso3-4c4gkhkmGbQ Been here before, but has been a few years.  Was here for a birthday party and food wise, I'd say it was 1 of the better experiences.  There are plenty of selections here, whether it is pizza, pasta, sides.  Roast beef was nice too, same as the seafood chowder. And I like the big cups they have for drinks.  This place gets busy though, and there does not seem to be much room to move around, luckily we were in the section by the door, so there was some room for stroller, and other items. Line ups for the food can get long as well, but moves pretty well I'd say. Good place to check out, that is for sure.
