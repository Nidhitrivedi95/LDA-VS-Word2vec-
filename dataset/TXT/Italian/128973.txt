i4hvmTd4RH9HvOyG8ndYGw This is my first visit to Raffaele's Pizza and wasn't sure what to expect from the previous reviews.  I Had a small Stromboli and while my first bite didn't wow me, eventually the flavor and taste grew on me quickly.  Maybe my palate was off this night but if I get to try another dish I will certainly write a follow-up.

Ambiance is lacking but customer service seemed up to par and accommodating.  Nothing to dismiss this place for from other reviews.  Looking forward to trying it again.
