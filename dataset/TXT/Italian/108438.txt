fzxvmA3Ygu3yrQQ6-cEpTw I was disappointed and I really want to like this place. I'm a big fan of Chopped. It may be for a younger crowd. My husband and I are in our 50s and it was just loud between the music and people talking. The music playing was fairly loud and you could feel the bass. Very pricey for what was served. We both ordered the short ribs and they were $26 a plate. It came with zucchini and arugula (way more arugula than zucchini). The ribs were not what we were expecting, looked more like flank steak or beef tenderloin. Basically, I paid $26 for meat. The meat was cooked okay but nothing special. Nope, we will not be going here again.
