G8vo5r543nQyTC24VNpBIg I think this may win the best pizza I've had in Phoenix since taking a job here in 2006! We did take out & got two vegetarian choices. One was a Venice with artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, goat cheese..& was a small piece of Italian heaven in my mouth. I loved the Chicago style crust... Yum! My friends raved about this place close to our neighborhood.. I'm now a fan...& I'll drive a bit further to get what I know is close to perfect:-)
