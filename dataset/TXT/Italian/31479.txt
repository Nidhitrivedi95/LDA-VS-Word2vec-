5p60nXyjQruKvEZix6ahVQ Until lunch today, I would have given Vallozzi's Piitsburgh five stars, but something has gone wrong since our last few meals there.  The restaurant was nearly empty today at the lunch rush, which may have been our first tip-off, but in terms of what was bad about our lunch today, here goes:
1.  The appetizer menu featured pickled rhubarb with the "cheese tasting," so we ordered it.  Instead of rhubarb, horribly over-salted pickled vegetables were served with the cheese.  When we asked the waitress for pickled rhubarb, she flatly told us that they didn't have it.  Also, it came with no crackers, bread sticks or otherwise.  
2.  The calamari was fried hard beyond recognition. ...When I say "fried hard," I mean that when we tried to use a fork, it shattered into burnt little pieces.  Also, the calamari and marinara sauce were brought with no serving spoons.  .....So much for sharing.  
3.  I asked for bleu cheese dressing on the side for my steak salad, but when the waitress brought it, she bluntly informed me that "(they) didn't have any."   
In all fairness, every meal we've had until today has been good, but I fear something has changed there.  
Finally, I went on line to e-mail the restaurant directly before "going public," but the have no contact form or e-mail address on their web site.
I really hope that today was an aberration, but based upon the lack of patrons, I'm afraid it wasn't.
