nDKcQkh8vZkY_u1kyww44g What a great night! Valentino's knows how to treat you right. We were lucky enough to get a table in their small but private "library" room in the back of the restaurant. I'm not sure if you could request this for a special occasion, but it is worth a shot. The room had cook books and guide books of Italy on the shelves with a bit of Frankie to be heard throughout the night.

The service was outstanding from beginning to end. We had some nice conversation about wine with the sommelier and found out he is actually from our neighborhood in LA.

A couple of their dishes really stood out to me. A must get is the Gill Spaghetti with Rabbit and Mushroom Ragu. The combination was perfect and the use of quality olive oil shined through. The Scallops with Polenta was one of the best prepared scallops I've ever had, and I've had way too many scallops! Perfectly seared on the outside and tender on the inside which really displayed the essence of what a scallop is all about. Lastly the tender Lamb Ossobuco was the best I've had and again this is a dish I hunt down regularly at Italian restaurants. We fought after each piece as it fell off of the bone.

Overall our experience was perfect and the food was good. Putting Valentino head to head with other top restaurants in Vegas I would still want to revisit a few others first, however if you are specifically looking for quality and authentic Italian food this is the place to go.
