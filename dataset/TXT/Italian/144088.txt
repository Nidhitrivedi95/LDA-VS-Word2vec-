jW4-bGuymLGlB9OBsTq3TA Always love coming here. Can never go wrong with one of their pizzas. Loaded with toppings and thin bubbly crust. I normally just get one of the pastas but decided on veal. Had an interesting taste but still not bad. We also had the salmon. That was the only meal that disappoint. It was a little fishy. I will be sticking to pizza/pasta from now on.
