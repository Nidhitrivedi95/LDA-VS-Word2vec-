9DHE9JieR80pYkpyr19iZQ I ate lunch here yesterday (a Friday) and the place was packed with people. The Four Seasons pizza was delicious, the right balance of crust and tangy tomato sauce, topped with a dream-team combination of artichokes, peas, mushrooms, roasted red peppers and mozzarella. I don't anticipate any further visits to Scarborough, though, which is a shame because I'd be back at Fratelli's for this pizza in a heartbeat. I wasn't a fan of the house white wine (Velletri); pay a little more and order something else.
