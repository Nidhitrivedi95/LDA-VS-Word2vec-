SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw I was in there during the Christmas break.  Owner was a nice guy and sat listened to my ramblings about my pizza propensities.  Crust was hardy and crisp.  Sauce was subtle and filling.  The cheese...great.  Atmosphere was a little lacking but hey what do you expect for a little joint like this.  Will definitely go back when visiting relatives.
