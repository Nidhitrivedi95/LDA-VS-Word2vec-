Uqs18_AgDYsByvtSSOMzkw we were visiting Montreal and our local friends took us to Bocaccino for dinner.

I like the location - it's right downtown but it's at the end of a not very busy street so sitting on the patio is comfortable and nice.

the hostess informed us in advance that they have seats but the wait time for the orders will be around 20min so we were ready for the wait.

the food was good. not something extraordinary but good and yummy. and the veg options very plenty.

the best was the service. our waiter Raffi was attentive and humorous. he was joking around and it made our day=)
