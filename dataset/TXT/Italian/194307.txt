PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ After my fiasco last night (check my earlier review of another establishment) I went to off the strip a little apprehensive as I was with some picky eaters.  It didn't help that I had entered the smoky gambling bar on Tropicana of the same name and owners.  We didn't even try the Tropicana one as it did not look very inviting for dining.

This was different.  No gaming, more of a restaurant feel.  We were greated by Megan who was cute, perky, bubbly and friendly and welcomed us warmly.  We were hustled to our seat and she answered all my questions about the menu with a smile, recommending the pork chop special which has been around for several months.  

Megan and the other staff were all friendly and attentive.  We never went without water or one of them asking us how we were doing.  The garlic cheese bread was exactly the way it should be, the scent of garlic arriving ahead of the service as an announcement that the bread was on the way.  

The salads were fresh and the dressing (which they put on the side at my request) was excellent.  Service was fast.  

I had the pork special.  The pork chops were perfectly cooked, the cream sauce had great flavor and the potato pie was excellent.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and we had a nice variety, lamb chops, spaghetti with sausage, chicken.  I regret I didn't try the Wellington (still have never tried Wellington) but it just gives me reason to go back.

At the end the waitress surprised us with a cheesecake slice that was to die for.  It was light, fluffy, with several syrups on the plate to dip.

It was the perfect end to a total package dining experience.
