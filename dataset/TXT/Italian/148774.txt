kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg We tried the new Grape Street in downtown Summerlin expecting a nice meal but it didn't turn out that way. Food is average, service worse and staff not so accommodating. Many other choices close by and more bang for your buck: Andiron, Hearthstone, Mercidito, Lucille's.....I'd put all these places, and more above the average and disappointing new addition of not so great Grape Street
