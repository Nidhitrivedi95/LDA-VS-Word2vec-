MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg It's been a couple of years since I had my first taste of Chicago Joe's, and their pasta with white clam sauce still sticks in my mind as being one of the best pasta dishes that I've had. However, on this last visit, one of the only memories that will stand out was some of the bland food. 

Appetizer - Mushroom Cap Escargot: One of the more flavorful items that we ordered. The mushrooms and escargot were practically bathing in a small pool of olive oil and Parmesan cheese -- order some bread and soak up all the excess because it's too good to waste!

Entree - Shrimp and Crab Ravioli in a Creamy Sauce (Special of the evening): This sounded delightful when the server spoke about it, but it was dull. Freshly ground black pepper and a bit more Parmesan cheese might've rescued this. 

Entree - Veal Parmigiana with Pasta: The veal was tough, and the side of fettuccine with Alfredo sauce was sadly, insipid like my order. It just didn't have that identifiable richness that Alfredo sauce typically has. 

Dessert - Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake: A decadent and heavier dessert than the others that'll fulfill chocolate cravings. It was the perfect finale to a dinner with more lows than highs. 

Service: Fine. 

Other: Reservations recommended. Also, enter through the back. It's awkward walking in through the front door. 

Overall: Despite the reasonable prices and the hole in the wall charm, sadly, the lackluster food isn't enough to lure me back.
