1VDP92FU2p8AqJw9vU11sw Our first visit was last Friday at the busiest hour on the busiest day and we were seated within 10 minutes.  The hostesses were wonderful and efficient.  The drinks were cold and delicious.  The service was great and quick and the server was very friendly.  The manager, Clint, was very attentive to everyone in the place and he stopped by our table at least 3 times making sure everything was great as we told him this was our first visit.  We will return often!  Thank you, Clint!
BTW... the food was DELICIOUS!
