lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ Got the BBQ pizza special and some soup. The soup was very yummy. loved it!

The pizza was nothing special IMO and i was starving. But we got a groupon for it and it was the cheapest lunch choice for us on the strip.

oh and tried some of my brother's cajun fries. they were pretty good.
