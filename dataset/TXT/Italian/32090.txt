The atmosphere was beautiful and an immediate draw when we walked through the door.  My friend and I were in for a couple casual mid-afternoon drinks when we met Michelle, the bartender. She was inviting and engaging without being overwhelming as some chatty barkeeps can be. I told Michelle what my alcohol preferences were and she made two fabulous recommendations that I thoroughly enjoyed. 

Great first experience and will certainly be back!
