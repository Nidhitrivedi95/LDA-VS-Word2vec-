_qA2HPqgLiBc-M4wRyml0g Had the Italian chopped salad which was excellent.  Entree was meatball panini which was fair at best.  Meatballs were below average and panini slightly burned.  My wife had the spaghetti and meatballs which she states was not very good.  

Service was good.  Place was very casual.

Not sure I would return with so many other better choices in the area.
