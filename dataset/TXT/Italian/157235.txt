lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ I dined at Buca di Beppo on November 24, 2012 at around 4:00pm. My server was Eric. Over all, he was great. However, we had an issue though with what we were served. I ordered a small Quattro al Forno to share with my friend. The menu said Chicken Cannelloni was included.  All of the dishes served were stuffed with cheese only, except the shells. When I questioned Eric, he said the complaint was common and that "the chicken is ground very finely and sometimes you can't tell it's there." I thought that was an odd response.  Looking at the menu further, I saw that the Chicken Cannelloni has spinach as an ingredient and nothing we ate had any spinach in it. As we were mostly finished with the meal, I did not press the issue. I don't know whether the kitchen made a mistake or the server wasn't familiar with the menu, but I am not sure I would return to this location.
