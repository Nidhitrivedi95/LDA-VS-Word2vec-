uuaH1UNcqcV-alT6nh42WA Terrible experience. The girl who took the phone order was wonderful, the delivery guy was fast. But I paid 22 dollars plus a 6 dollar tip for 1 pasta entree... It was the linguini imperial and it was cold with no sauce... Literally it was obviously clams that have been cooked from a frozen state on top of linguini with 3 shrimp. No sauce, I had to reheat and season despite the quick delivery. Called, didn't want my money back just a credit. (It was my first and now my last time here.) Spoke to a manager who was also the disgruntled cook- he said he was unwilling to do anything for me. People with no customer service have no business managing a restaurant. Made both of his other two employees null and void. It didn't matter how nice they were, he ruined it.
