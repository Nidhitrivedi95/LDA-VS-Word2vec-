e6MbizDdtMLDMnc8LDmYrQ I was looking for a quick cheesesteak sandwich and read the reviews here about Fannys.

Wow, I was shocked. The cheesesteak was fresh, hot and no freezer burn like many others in town.

They made it special for me as I don't like peppers and love raw onions. The sandwich was dead on!

Based on the reviews, I tried a brownie as well. WOW! This brownie was moist all the way through. Just the right amount of nuts too.

I like this place a lot and recommend it. I will be back
