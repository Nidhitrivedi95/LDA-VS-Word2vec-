I was looking forward to eating here for a year. The first time I stopped by, they were closing early. The second time I had my whole family with me, but they were full (didn't hold any of this against them, it added to the mystic actually) finally got to try it on Nov 2nd and man! What a let down. I wish I could have had the same experience as so many others but, with my visit, there was nothing to like, at all.
