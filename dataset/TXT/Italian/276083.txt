yd0g-FRSAdP9YKm7Z8-uUw I'm from Chicago and this was my first time eating here. I had the meatball sandwich with fries and my boyfriend had the pizza slices with garlic knots.  Being from Chicago I had high hopes for the food but we both thought the food was ok nothing spectacular.  The meatballs on my sandwich were good but unfortunately the marinara sauce that accompanies them was not that good very blah not much flavor. The pizza slices were thin crust (yes Chicago does thin crust) but unfortunately not crispy looked more like a New York floppy slice when you picked it up with less grease, and again the sauce was very blah.  They were supposed to come with garlic knots but instead came with garlic bread sticks. The bread sticks were ok your standard ones was hoping for knots with real garlic butter and pieces of garlic. The place doors look like it would be good to come and watch a Chicago game.
