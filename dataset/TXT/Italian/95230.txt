eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg I don't know where to begin from service to food everything was amazing. I had a friend come to town for her daughter spring break. First she had few expectations but let her have fun and take memories back to new jersey to share with her friends. My friend was pregnant and had a taste for everything but I digress. 


We checked out the steak house menu first,  we checked the BBQ restaurant next then landed in front of grotto menu. This is all after having explained and offered all to ms. Pregnant to FINALLY have her pick grotto because she finally had so many options sound she couldn't pick one.  
I had the lobster bisque and canoloni (sp) almost like a soft shell taco rolled up sided with chicken and spinach.  I could lick both plate and bowl.  Friends daughter had the tortellini with pesto sauce we ....yes we all tried one another meal lol. Then my girlfriend had a house salad that had fresh made dressing to die for and some chicken dish, I forget the name,  that had capers and angel hair pasta that all melted in your mouth. 

Lastly,  I tried the orange creme brulee for dessert.  It wasn't the best creme brulee I've had but it was delicious.  

Well definitely be going back.  Great find in what would seem the last likely place. I always tell visitors that residents rarely venture to the strip regularly but for Grotto my spouse and I will a little more often,  with or without visitors in town.
