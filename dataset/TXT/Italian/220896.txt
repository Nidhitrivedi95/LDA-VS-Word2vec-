SEH79jbg5Q8cCozCnhqMHA This is the best Italian restaurant in Phoenix. The place is very small and cozy, and decorated very warmly inside. They have a private nook in the back corner of the restaurant, as well as a full bar. Live music is featured most nights. All of the pasta is homemade fresh daily, and is very very good. One time they had Venison on the specials menu and it was so unbelievable I swear I can still taste it. Sima and Marcellino, the owners are great people, even if Marcellino is almost impossible to understand. The place is definitely not inexpensive, but in my opinion worth eveyry penny to actually get some high end Italian that is otherwise very hard to find in Phoenix.
