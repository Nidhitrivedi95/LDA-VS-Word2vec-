CSaVK9wgqe2_tQuuCDINyQ PS:  Review is for Frankies....... but I digress......I had tried "Avanti pizza" after reading all these great reviews about them...... no, not that great!  I should have known!  Avanti (a car maker name) needs to stick to making ugly cars, not pizza!  lol

So today, I was driving to the store, at the light on Wigwam, waiting to take a left onto Eastern and noticed Frankies Pizza sign staring me in the face across the street, as if to say, (said in an italian New York accent) "Yo, whats-a-madda-you?  Why doncha try some real pizza?  Other pizza? ...Forgetta 'bout it!"

So I was like okay THIS time I will try ONE piece and not buy a whole pizza just in case... Well I can tell you... I am SOOOOO GETTING THIS PIZZA FOR DINNER TONIGHT!!!  Its a really nice place with friendly people!   With all the "New York" friendliness, I had to check my location on my phone to make sure I was still in VEGAS!!!  It's like walking into a pizza place in New York.... I think.... I never have, but I am guessing it's like this!   The butchers back east in NE Ohio were very "Italian" friendly and I got this same great feel here!   (Sorry ADD moment) Yes, the knots are great!!!  While Grimaldis rocks, by the time you get a take out home its cold..... NOT Frankies!

I was also offered a water without asking.... cut IT'S HOT OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW  lol
