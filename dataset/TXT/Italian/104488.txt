This place is an exception due to their reputation of their original location in Arcadia and know how to create a relaxing cool atmosphere.   Great addition to the neighborhood as this "hood" seems to be an up and coming area with new restaurants and revitalization.  

I would really give Postino Central 5 stars, but I feel that the wines offered by the glass are only worth $5 as they are offered during the day.  They have done a good job making customers believe that they are getting a good deal at this price while this is what they should be priced at anyway.  It's not a huge complaint of mine, I just know what these wines really cost.

Overall this place should be on anyone's list of places to check out and experience "Uptown's" new swagger feel!
