JsUprRhyzQyukZmAhcOg0A AMAZING!! My husband and I were doing some holiday shopping at the San Tan Village and decided to try out Brio for dinner. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess and were told that it would be a short wait. We were seated within 10 minutes and were given a very comfy booth. The wine list was small but had some great options. Our server was very friendly, knowledgable and answered all of our questions on the menu. I had the salmon and my husband had the pork chops. My salmon was cooked perfectly and was served on top of a breaded tomato. It was to die for! For dessert we had a mini tiramisu and a mini cheesecake. Both were very tasty and the perfect size to finish off the meal. The service was excellent. They don't rush you or forget about you. My only complaint is that it is too far away! We will definatly make the drive again just to vist them.
