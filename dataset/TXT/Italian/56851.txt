With the restaurant a longterm member of my Vegas "to-visit" list and now scheduled to close in 2014 it was with a big smile that I booked Circo when friends from out of town perused the menu and agreed it looked excellent, a smile that would again emerge the moment we entered the whimsical room only to be led to the best seat in the house and a smile that would last throughout the subsequent three hours of pristine pastas and pizza, decadent desserts, and even a torchon of foie gras from Le Cirque next door.  Fluid in service from beginning to end despite our request for courses to be served family style it was with bread and a sturdy, aromatic Margherita that our evening began and moving through a silky round of foie with decidedly sweet accoutrements it was with a trio of pastas that the meal truly began to wow, each a textbook preparation of the respective noodle/dumpling and the sauces rich without being heavy - particularly the meltingly-thin ravioli.  Clearly over ordering but happy to indulge, a single secondi of lightly braised lamb arrived rife with grassy notes beneath a savory glaze while the accompanying bowl of polenta proved sticky, rich, and decadent - the latter carrying right over to desserts, each excellent but the towering cloud of banana truly special and every bit as good as the one being served next door, still one of my favorite soufflés to date.
