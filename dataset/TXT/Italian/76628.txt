cVlW0omVTRaVJqnT-OBBsQ suuuuuper pricey in my opinion ($17.50 for personal size pizza) but delicious pizza and delicious little pillows of gnocchi! 
i like how there were a variety of pizza toppings that weren't the common western ones but if you're vegetarian, i felt like there weren't many options :(
