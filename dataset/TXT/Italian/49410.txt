9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw I really like the ambiance of the place and was super hopeful about the food.  I have heard so many great things about this place.  I tried the Margherita pizza and the flavor just wasn't there.  The sauce was bland, the crust was super soggy, they didn't have any powdered garlic.  Just not what I was looking for in a great pizza.  We tried two of the appetizers and they also left a lot to be desired.  1 was the fried pizza crust...it lacked flavor and the other was a fried ball of cheese and white rice which was horrible.  The two stars are for the service and the ambiance.  I wouldn't go back for the food.
