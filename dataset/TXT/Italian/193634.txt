pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg Wow! This is THE place for groups! Hands down! Need somewhere to go with 15 people in a pinch... Here is the place. It is just absolutely enormous, and beautiful to boot. We were given a private tour of the place and I couldn't believe all the rooms that this place had! 

We were here last night so it was also nice to see some of the beautiful Holiday  decorations that were up. 

Since it was only the two of us the manager (Jesse) recommended a sampler platter. I forget the name but it had everything, and it was more than enough. (This place is used to catering to larger groups, and family style dinners, it can get quite hard to order for just two people, recommend splitting everything.) The favorite on this dish were the baked calms, absolutely amazing! The least favorite of mine was the cheese ravioli, I thought it was just a bit over cooked. Other items in this dish is sausage and peppers, fried polenta (soo delicious and unique!), mussels, eggplant, stuffed mushrooms and calzones. We also ordered a couple of medium carafes of wine which was perfect.

The manager (Jesse) guided us through the entire menu including our wine selections and everything turned out more than amazing! It was so nice to see a manger take pride in his work, not to mention his striking well groomed appearance! We will definitely be returning.
