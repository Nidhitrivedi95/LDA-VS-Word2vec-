Told me my pie would be to me within THE hour...I clarified within AN hour right?  Correct.  An hour seems a bit long for a place 2 miles away.  1:15 later, called in and aoh yes, the driver is just leaving now.  nice.  $5 off the next pie ok?  NO.  ok $10 off the next.  Fine.  Arrived 1:38 minutes after ordering.  No high hopes here.  

Pizza was luke warm at best.  Lovely.  and the wrong type!  We ordered DEEP DISH, got PAN.  Now if you read the menu, which I did, they have deep dish and pan.  Now I understand that.  called back and got a manager that tried to explain that deep dish means pan to them on their system!!  R U kidding me????  I am not interested in solving your corporate stupidity, I want the pizza I ordered and I ordered it exactly how it is listed on your site!

Now the only thing that kep them from a 1 star rating is the manager offered to send another pizza for free, which I turned into next time and I did not have the time to wait for another timely delivery.  So KUDOS to the manager for doing the right thing, however everything else left a lot to be desired.  I know I will go back for 1 more pizza at least...
