However, a friend has a rather hilarious story about being shooshed by the bartender who paradoxically insisted that he was not tending a "bar" as he scolded my friend's group. To experience this shooshing, I might just have to return someday and try to ruin the Parlor's beloved ambiance. Eh, maybe not, but I'm keeping this option open.
