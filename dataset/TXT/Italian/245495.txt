UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Came here for lunch today and couldn't be more pleased. Great service, great decor, great food and an exceptional Bellini. 

The soup of the day was tomato bisque and it was the 2nd best tomato bisque I've ever had, just delicious. I had the lunch special, Mezza Chicken with mashed potatoes and roasted vegi's and it was good, 4 stars.
The 5th star was for the amazing peach Bellini and tomato bisque. The next time I am in Vegas, I will definitely be back!
