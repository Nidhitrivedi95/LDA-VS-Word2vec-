2gzB4EE7B_QEFWZtJTG4dA I decided to stop in for lunch today as I work in the area. I looked online at the lunch menu before going and decided on the Crispy Chicken Sandwich w/fries. While the sandwich was good it was just toooo wet! They put dressing on the top bun, bottom bun and the chopped lettuce also had more dressing. Anytime you picked it up or took a bite everything slid off! Also, because of so much dressing the crispy sandwich was no longer crispy but a soggy mess. I sat at the bar and not once did someone come back and ask if everything was ok. 

Once I got my bill I noticed the price! I had a chicken sandwich and ice tea and it was $19! Once I got back to work I noticed they charged me $15 the dinner price for my sandwich and not $12 for the lunch price. I would have overlooked this if the sandwich and service was great but it just wasn't. 

One thing I noticed too that the moment you walked it it was FREEZING!!! 

I was overall disappointed which stinks because I wanted to like it since I work so close.
