-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw I must admit, I had high hopes for this place... and given the posh, upscale atmosphere, I was ready to be wowed. The only "wow" I had, however, was at how disappointed I was.

The food was far from spectacular; my Caesar salad had very little flavor (even for a Caesar salad,) and my eggplant pomodoro had just barely enough sauce to get some with each bite. The flavor on this, as well, was somewhat lacking. The spaghettini which came with it, however, was well presented and had a nice fresh flavor.

Then, of course, there was the service. I would highly recommend NOT going here for a quick lunch. We ended up being there for nearly two hours, 30 minutes of which was waiting for our check. In addition, the server was rather brusque when my friend asked for recommendations.

Overall, definitely not impressed. For as lavish as the decor is, and given the prices on the menu, I was expecting far better. Most certainly not recommended.
