rxcZiqu2hQDJgULxwtJqug If you're hungry go somewhere else. we were seated right away even on a Friday night. first of all that should have told us something... took almost 20 minutes just to get drinks, nothing fancy just coke. I'm an hour later when we finally got our food it was plated very nicely.. The food was mediocre bland at best. thank God we had a Groupon 20 for 40 worth of food. our bill for just a simple dinners would have been in the 60's.
