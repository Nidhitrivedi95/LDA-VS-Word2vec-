hlrZHM4D48XiQtXh6cRg_w I've been there twice as of now. My first time I was WOW-ed.

The environment is truly interesting. I was looking everywhere. I love the carousel and phone booth. Even my second time around I was still trying to decipher what was going on.

Service was friendly and efficient both times. However, it was most exceptional from the waiter who is tall, handsome, and wearing 
dark-rimmed glasses.

The food comes in amazing large portions - this could also be seen as a downfall. I barely finished my pasta the second time around.
I ordered Spaghetti and Meat balls the first time - AMAZING.
Chicken Penne the second time - not so happy with that. My friend recommended it and said she enjoyed it. I, however, was not a fan.
In your meal you get soup/salad, pasta, ice cream, coffee/tea, and bread. Yes, it's a lot. If you get full easily (like I do), do not eat all of your appetizer and do not eat a of bread. Your main course will be worth it.
Also, I ordered a Bellini and didn't really enjoy it. I prefer my bellinis with a thicker consistency equivalent to a slush - this was more watery.

The only improvement they should make would be with their menus. It's in fact a simple piece of paper folded. With amazing decor, I feel that they should have a menu that at least matches the theme they have going.

Overall, I would definitely be visiting again.
