g-nzfTvso3-4c4gkhkmGbQ If for some reason you don't know about the existence of Pizza Hut or you are just so tired of it already  you might want to check out Frankie Tomatto's. This being one of the cheapest buffets around town is probably the only positive thing I can say about it.
The food is an American take on Italian favorites, lots of bread, garlic, onion, pasta, Kraft dressings and not much else. It is very loud inside with lots of children running around, overall not my cup of tea. 
If I want Italian I go to Italian restaurant if I want pizza I call pizza delivery and if I want pasta I cook it my self, not much space left for Frankie.
