7o4SWZDKYHYfv6X0U21ErQ We had a party of 8 at 6pm on a Saturday.  Our server was busy, but not in the weeds busy.  Our drinks were seriously 15 minutes between refills. 

Kids did the pasta thing, was ok.  I ordered a 14 oz strip, was a tad overcooked and not the best cut of meat.  However my buddy ordered a filet medium and got it cooked dead.  no red.  which led to him sending it back and it came out perfect 25 minutes later.  we were all done.

Overall the server seemed frustrated because she put the wrong order in and it came our overcooked.  the replacement steak also was wrong but good nonetheless.

It was okay but the manager removed the steak from the bill but it did not help the dining experience.
