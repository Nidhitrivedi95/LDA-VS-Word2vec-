S3w4Pw1wSpYkICvtJAzG8A Nice comfortable place.  Not too fancy but yet a classy vibe.  We had chicken parmigiano which was not on the menu and veal parmigiano.   Both were delicious!   The waiter was attentive.   We enjoyed a bottle of wine with our meal but I thought it was a bit expensive.   I googled it and found it was a $10 bottle of wine that we paid $32 for.  Other than that, nice place.
