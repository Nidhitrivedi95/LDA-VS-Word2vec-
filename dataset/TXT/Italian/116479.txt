GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA I loved this restaurant.  At first I was a little intimidated because I couldn't understand half of the menu but my server explained every thing.  She was awesome!  Very warm, friendly, attentive and she kept track of time for us because we had a show to see.  My boyfriend and I ordered the house made cured meat dish for our appetizer.  The cured meats were delicious and they all had their own unique flavor.  They had this one cured meat that was the left over of making prosciutto and it was melt in our mouth heaven! It came with a "doughnut" square to cleans the pallet between meats or you could eat it with the meat.  I had the sweet breads with duck bacon for my entree and my boyfriend has the pappardelle bolognese.  Both entrees were phenomenal.  If you don't like sweet food or tripe, this dish is not for you.  But if you do, please try this dish, you wont be disappointed.  The duck bacon complimented the sweet breads with a little salt. All Italian cooks judge each other by their bolognese so B&B's was the best I've had.  It didn't seem like we ate a lot of food but by the end of dinner we were so stuffed we couldn't order desert.  I will defiantly come back to this restaurant every time I'm in Vegas.
