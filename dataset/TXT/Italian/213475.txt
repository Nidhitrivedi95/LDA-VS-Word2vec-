r6jbUGiyoN05mZ13apQGgw I've only ever ordered here via delivery. The first time was lunch at work and a co-worker and I split two different wraps. The Spinach Wrap was okay, though I would have liked it better without craisons, and the Veggie Wrap was delicious. The side salad that came with our wraps were good.

The second time I ordered from here was a few days ago. This time I was craving pizza, so I ordered a Sonny's pizza (Spinach, Garlic, Sun Dried Tomato, Artichokes, Grilled Chicken, Mozzarella and Feta Cheese with a Balsamic Vinegar Demi-Glaze) and one cannoli for dessert. Sonny's wasn't bad, I liked it, but it was a little too sweet and the balsamic vingear looked like it drenched the pizza. The cannoli was good and I probably will order another pizza to try.
