8cdiFhBfCwRW1xiktRtV_g I've had 2 experiences with Fellini's in Oak Ridges: 

1. Went for lunch during their advertised hours of operation and they were closed. Myself and another potential table of customers hung around the door for a few minutes but the was no one around so we all left.

2. Ordered two pasta dishes: one with rose and other with tomato sauce. It was about the worse sauce I've ever tasted. Mind blowing considering it's an Italian restaurant. Both looked and tasted like watery canned instant sauce with no seasoning. The pasta itself was fine but unfortunately the sauce completely ruined the dishes. 

Since we can never tell when they will be open and the food was lousy, we won't be back.
