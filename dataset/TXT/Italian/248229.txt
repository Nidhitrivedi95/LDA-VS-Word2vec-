I had checked out their menu online before leaving and had already decided on the Fettuccine with truffle sauce!  AMAZING.  However, when the waiter came to tell us the specials I was completely confused.  I love rack of lamb and of course that was one of their specials, along with a wonderful veal dish!  Almost took me away from my Fettuccine with truffles.  The person I was with had the rack of lamb that looked fantastic.  He thoroughly enjoyed it.

I cannot tell you how wonderful my dinner was!  The Fettuccine was perfectly cooked and the truffles and truffle sauce were amazing!   There was not a speck left on my plate.

Their house Pinot Noir was also very good..two glasses good!  Being a first-generation Italian I was raised on great Italian cooking.  Franco's did not disappoint.
