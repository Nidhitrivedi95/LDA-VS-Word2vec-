Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw In a strip mall across from UNLV, this casual family-owned shop is a great local eatery with easy parking. The garlic bread knots come with great marinara sauce. The pizza is huge with a nice crust, and they don't skimp on cheese & toppings. The chicken milanese is great. Lightly breaded, not oily, served on a salad with side of penne marinara and bread sticks. The food is served with orange trays, paper plates, and metal utensils, but don't let that fool you, the quality is there.
