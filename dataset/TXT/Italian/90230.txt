E9b73ETPw0VYUJ2_YSJJdQ - not bad pizza in a sea of towering concrete and glass
- their rustica (prociutto, goat cheese, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes) pizza and rosemary potato bianco pizza are my two favs. esp the rosemary one... hmmmm...
- bonus is that they deliver... downside is that their delivery time takes forever ("at least an hour"... is what i was quoted ones)
