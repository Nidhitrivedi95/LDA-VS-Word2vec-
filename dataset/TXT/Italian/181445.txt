O5_CKNQOmtRHY_CjOB6XYA Stopped in for brunch before the drive home. Well, was a little disappointed.

Not that the food was bad per say or the service was off but would have appreciated the heads up that the Steak and Eggs Brunch Special was 2x the price of most of the breakfast entree's. Steak and Potatoes were good, service was on top of things despite the fact the service was a "man" down due to a tardy server. My beef's... the eggs were small, "Up" means "Up" not one Up one Fried, and the bill big. 

If you are going to have an overly expensive "special" let the patrons know it is going to be so much more and make sure it is made exactly to order. 

Hope to stop in again and revise my opinion as I have heard great things about the place.
