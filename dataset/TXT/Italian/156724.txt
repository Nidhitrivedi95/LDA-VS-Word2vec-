L9qDnDHSnINNjePwrJz-uQ I can't believe these reviews! I can only assume these are either friends of the owners or they got a new chef! I ordered from here because they deliver and had good reviewa, when in fact we ended up picking it up anyway. We both ordered the carbonara with chicken, and the only thing good to say was the pasta was cooked right. The sauce has already begun to separate, there was huge chunks of raw onion and the chicken (which was like $3 each extra to add was 1000% the precooked perdue you buy in bags at costco- So easy to recognize by the fake grill marks! All in all it was extremely disappointing, and oddly for the area VERY expensive- $18 for that! It came with like a half loaf of stale, unheated, unbuttered bread and a "salad" which was (im not kidding) cut up lettuce and four slices of black olive- It was a sad view- Kinda wish a took a picture before we threw our $40+ mistake in the garbage! Though not soon enough..

I can't remember ever being so thoroughly disappointed with a meal as I was with this experience. My poor husband was up all night sick from it, luckily I was not able to eat much of it after the first bite!

Stay away!!!!
