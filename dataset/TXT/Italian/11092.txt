0PMKMyfX1j7Nc4esk1RaMg I hate to give 1 star to anyone but you be the judge. The server/waiter must have been forced to work  as he didn't smile at all during our entire meal. By far the worst service I've got in a very long time. After being seated on the patio the angry server showed up to take our drink order. We ordered 2 pizzas and appetizers. The pizzas were so good that we wanted to try an other one. I ordered a pizza with chicken on it. Bad choice. The chicken was passed its expiration  day and smelt rotten . My girlfriend took a bite not believing me and spit it right out. When the waiter made his rounds I flagged him and told him about the chicken. He rolled his eyes at us and left. I asked for the check and the pie with bad chicken was on it. I payed my bill and left.

Would have been a 4 star even with the bad service, but if you are going to serve me bad food and charge me for it then 1 star is all you get.
