JFNv5sKeKAf1ZVPnfbzpXw We ordered one of the specials 10 chicken finger, 20 chicken wings, a one topping large pizza and 2 liter for 39.99. I also checked in so I got an extra 2 liter for free. 

Pizza was good, crust and as soft and crunchy cooked just right

Wings were amazing!!! I ordered them well done and plain with the sauce on the side (I hate soggy wings) they were perfect. 

Chicken finger tasted like good normal chicken finger. 

Homemade ranch .... need I say more?! 

Soda selection was small but who cares we were already eating pizza we didn't need soda hehe. 

When I went to pick up they were somewhat busy and they still offered to help me out to the car. Food was ready at the exact time I was told it would be. Will be returning for some wings ! Yum!!
