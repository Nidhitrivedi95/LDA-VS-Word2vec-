mDiFWhywAziq9SKnj6am_Q We visited Il Posto for the second time this past Sunday evening.  This was our second experience with the same server.  He was very inattentive and seemed as though he did not want to be there.  We had to flag him down when we needed anything such as more drinks and bread because he never came around after taking our initial order.  The restaurant seems to be ran by a bunch of young people and no management was present.  The restaurant was dusty and there were flies and gnats everywhere.  The food was mediocre at best.  We will not be visiting Il Posto again.
