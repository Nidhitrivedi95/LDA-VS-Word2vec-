aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw i usually hate going to 'nice' italian restaurants because ive always seen pasta as rather homey, comfort food. three dishes at bartolotta changed my mind - 

gnocchi, carne cruda, lasagnette

not for the faint of heart, bartolotta unapologetically serves seafood for people who love seafood. if you are the type of person that doesnt like fish to be too 'fishy', consider yourself a moron and dont come here.

i dont understand how one takes potato and flour and goes about turning it into a dumpling with the consistency of soft cheese... but after tasting the gnocchi here... i guess its possible. ive had a lot of gnocchi in my day (ex-girlfriend loves the stuff) and this is one of the best.

i dont eat red meat often... but when i saw the carne cruda on the menu i just had to have a taste... and sure enough it was genius... i might never cook meat again and just eat tar tar for the rest of my days. this dish proves that truffle oil makes everything better.

the lasagnette would be one of the dishes at bartolotta that people would either love or hate because if its fishiness. brimming with sweet crab, lobster, shrimp and languostine it was like a seafood explosion in your mouth. it was a seafood pasta dish where the seafood was an actual flavor and not just a texture in a sauce.

my friends and i got a private room, which was nice, and the sommelier proposed a very good chianti for me. the bill wasnt too bad considering we had four bottles of wine and we all left in good spirits.
