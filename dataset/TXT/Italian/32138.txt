Starting off, the complimentary bread with chimichurri sauce and prosciutto parma samples were delicious. We decided on the tableside pesto mozzarella for an app. It was the best part of the meal. Great flavor and a unique experience. As for the main dishes, they were a bit of a let down. I ordered the herb roasted chicken, which had a pretty basic flavor profile. Unfortunately the chicken was a bit dry. We also ordered the braised short ribs, which were very good and tender with a decent sized portion. Our third entree was Strozzapreti pasta dish with a red sauce. It tasted like any run of the mill pasta dish you could get at any Italian restaurant for a third of the price. For desert we shared their red velvet cake bread pudding, which was pretty yummy.
