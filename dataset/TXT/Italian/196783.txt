pOhX1XjbBdPoO2Fyy8RGJg There are three kinds of pizza joints in this world: 
1) Great Pizza - the make your mouth water you're craving it, its so good kind.
2) Good Pizza - it will do in pinch.  Most likely they deliver.
3) Don't eat this pizza - do not under any circumstance eat this pizza, it does bad things to your tastebuds as well as your digestive system.

Geraci's, without a doubt, falls into category number 1 - in fact, its my number one of the number 1s.  Don't be duped, there are other good pizza joints in the Cleve, but this is far and away the best.  Let us explore:

What makes a good pizza?  Two things (Barring serving temperature - which is a personal preference -  and Geraci's is excellent at any serving temperature.):  

The Sauce (yeah, that's right, capital "S"auce.) and the crust.  

The rest, well, honestly, are just toppings. (And Geraci's toppings are AMAZING.  Try the italian sausage or the handcut pepperoni - its the real deal, and its perfect in flavor.)

I've never had a pizza sauce I enjoy more, its slightly sweet and has a very nice tang to it.  The crust hits the chew/crustiness ratio perfectly providing the perfect platform for sauce and toppings.  You just can't go wrong here.  In fact, the crust and sauce are so good that its tempting to order a pie without any other toppings!

My only ding on Geraci's is that it doesn't  take credit cards; where are we, like Italy in 1955 where an old Italian grandma is making stuff in the kitchen?  Actually, the way this stuff tastes, I just might believe that.....(bring cash or check, but there are a few banks just around the corner should you forget).
