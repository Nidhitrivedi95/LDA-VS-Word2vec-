kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ A couple of NOT GOODS, when initially seated (5:20pm), I waited 14 minutes for someone to contact me for water or a drink ? 
Once our server came over her service level was very good
2nd NOT GOOD (a huge pet peeve) wine vintage on wine list did not match stock on hand. You cannot list an 06 or 07 Cab and sub a 2010 or 2011 cab at the same price
Unfortunately those two NOT GOODS would have me rate Central Bistro as a 6 out of 10
