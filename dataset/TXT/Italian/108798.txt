G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Food is great.  5 stars for food.
Service is average.
Celebrating an anniversary and requested a window.  We celebrated there a year ago as well... at a window seat.
We were called on two separate occasions after they accepted the reservation to inform us that we must provide a guaranteed $100.00 minimum per person if we wanted a window seat.  If not we would get best effort at the time of arrival.
By the way two nights prior we dined at Ruth Chris.   Requested a window and were seated at same.  No phone calls, no extra charge and no extra drama was necessary.  Food and service was amazing.
We declined the up charge at Giada's.
We arrived on time - 9:00..  We seated 25-30 min later.
Got to watch them seat a single party at the window seat we ate at a year earlier.  Not sure if he provided a guarantee of $200 for the table.
Still we enjoy the meal and atmosphere.  We just prefer it to less of a hassle to dine there.
