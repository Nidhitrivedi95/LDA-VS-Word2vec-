lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg I don't understand what all the hype about this place is.
I came in for lunch during the week and it didn't seem too busy, we sat outside on the patio. It was a nice day out. 
That's about all that was good for this visit.
We ordered beers and appetizers knowing that our deep dish pizza would take 45-50 minutes to be ready. 
Our beer took 20 mins to arrive and the appetizer never came out. It took 90 mins to receive our pizza  and it wasn't bubbling hot. It was like it had been sitting out for a while. Warm but not hot enough to make that cheese pull. 
Yes, we spoke with a Manager. No, it didn't fix anything. 
Seriously, why would anyone eat here? Service sucks, food wasn't great. Not worth it. Skip it.
