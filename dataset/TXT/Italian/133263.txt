iLLzOJLU4tPAN9UUHlyZiQ We went to dinner with two other couples and this place came highly recommended by someone within the party.  

The ambiance is nice.  It's got a lively feel with upscale decor and a big bar. The food is designed to be shared and brought out in several courses. We obliged and took part in the process. 

The food was pretty good. We each had a cocktail, then ordered a salad, lasagna, flank steak, then a dessert. Definitely was full after the 2.5 hour meal, and also ready to get moving. 

It's a good restaurant, but nothing mind blowing. Their portions are decent, however the process is quite long. Definitely recommended for a nice dinner with friends, however it is on the expensive side and with several other good options in the area, I can't say it's the best.

Overall I would go back, but not as frequently as other places around there.
