jG1jcAeDw0pZTHCNC5kw_w The pizza here is one of my favs. The atmosphere is very romantic in the evenings....lights are dimmed down and candles are lit. I love how small and intimate the establishment is. Pizza is made fresh to order. Waitress has always been super nice. Highly recommend this place!
