POJL-N7Smw1UZMP_xldFwg It's a tiny place, lots of take out orders seems like. Small numbers of seating available with both counter and tables. I loved the food. Around lunch time, lots of high school students come in, so if you want to sit down to eat, you might have difficult time.  Still, good food though!
