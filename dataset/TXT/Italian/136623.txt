My biggest concern was the restaurant smell!  Smelled like sewer!  I smelled it stronger coming out of the restaurant when we were done.  Coming out of the sidewalk covers, but the smell permeates into the restaurant as the doors are opened.  I'm sure it's a landlord responsibility, but this will be detrimental to the business if not resolved quickly!
