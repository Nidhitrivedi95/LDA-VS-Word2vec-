SO5H4j7qgWBuZ-53ziXu4A I hate that I didn't like this place. It's around the corner from my house. I'm obsessed with Pizza and unfortunately this just did not do it for my tastebuds. Pizza was bland and sauce had no flavor, the crust was very soft and not crispy, I should of asked them to over bake my pizza twice more. The staff and owner were great and the bar selection was great!
