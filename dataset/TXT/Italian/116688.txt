GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q I LOVE this place!   Chicken Salad is amazing!   Everything I've ever ordered, have not been disappointed.  From the bread, to service.  I have driven 40 mins just to grab a sandwich. Best place hands down.  

One of the reviews on here said "unless you grew up eating slop you won't like it".   And some other inaccurate stuff. This person obviously doesn't know an Italian deli and should be banned for not understanding or appreciating real food.  After reviewing her other "reviews" clearly she doesn't like a lot of places.  She sounds like a person that should just stay home and eat her own food. Just sayin.
