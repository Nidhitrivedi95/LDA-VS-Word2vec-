RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ Blown away, Amazing, Beautiful.... and I'm not just talking about the views!  The experience my husband and I had for our anniversary was as close to perfect as it gets! Of course the views are breath taking, the ambiance is superb, and the food was delicious but I can't say enough about the outstanding customer service and special attention that we received. It was a perfect night in our books!!  
 
For those of you who haven't yet experienced or seen the Pointe Hilton at Tapatio Cliffs, you are in for a treat. Please treat yourself to a Different Pointe of View - you won't be disappointed!

1) Remember to make reservations in advance. This is a popular venue so tables DO get booked rather quick! 

2) Expect it to be a bit on the pricey end but you definitely pay for the quality, taste, and service!!

3) Don't forget to bring your camera because the Terrace room is exquisite!  
 
Thank you for an awesome 1st time experience Pointe Hilton - it was memorable & we will be back!
