pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg This review is only for their happy hour (2pm-6pm and 9:30pm-close at the bar). We sat ourselves at one of the high chair tables. This place is BIG so for the most part you won't have to wait for a table. At first no one came by to ask for drinks or anything so I got up and asked the bartender to order our drinks. When he came by with our drinks he also took our order.

APEROL FIZZ ($7) - surprisingly very good! I didn't know what this drink was but just took a shot in the dark and I really liked it. It has a slight carbonation and it was a refreshing drink.

MUSSELS IN RED SAUCE ($9) - a very visually appealing dish. The mussels were good and I liked the sauce that they were in.

GARLIC BREAD PARM ($6) - admittedly not the most visually appealing dish but the garlic bread was delicious and I really liked the melted part on top. Girlfriend wasn't a fan of the cheese so she took it off but we agreed the garlic bread was really good.

FRIED CALAMARI ($11) - my favorite of the dishes. The calamari was very good but I was a huge fan of the dipping sauce. You could tell that it was homemade and it had a ton of flavor. 

They have a ton of pasta options that were served in big portions and sounded delicious but unfortunately were not part of the happy hour menu. I do want to come back and try some of them though.
