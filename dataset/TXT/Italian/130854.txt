Ie00N1yErrmaOa44x5K8kA I ordered a large pizza half pepperoni and half cheese, 10 wings (sweet and tangy), and breadsticks. The pizza was bland like glass nickle and other Madison shops. Nothing like east coast pizza. The wings were super small! I feel cheated. If you know what a normal wingding looks like ....Itzza pizza wings are 1/4 that size. Lastly, the breadsticks were not bread sticks at all. It was a freaking loaf of bread with oil and cheese. I don't know what this place is thinking but need to up their game or they will be out of business like Gumbys.
