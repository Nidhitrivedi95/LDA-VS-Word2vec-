Dnq4w6ajMifZFFTIR5cGxw We frequently order from Dante's when we aren't feeling up to making dinner on a weeknight.

Service has been friendly and our order arrives hot and fresh.

I do wish they offered salads (supposedly they may in the future) as sometimes I need some veggies alongside my pizza, but it's not the end of the world.

Our go to order is the diavola pizza with a side of olives. The pizza can be a bit on the salty side (due to the dried olives and cured meat) but it tastes oh so good.

Until next time Dante's!
