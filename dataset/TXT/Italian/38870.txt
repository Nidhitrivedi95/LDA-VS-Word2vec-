7e5VezwFWmNyv5RvuHyFrQ First time at this local joint and I was very pleased with the decor, furniture and cleanliness. Their wide menu offerings vary from classic Italian sandwiches and lasagna to poutines and gelato. I ordered the classic veal sandwich with zucchini (+1$). I didn't really enjoy it, I found the veal very greasy and dry tasting. Luckily I added a vegetable in, which I highly recommend because meat + bread can get really tiring to eat. My friends ordered the roast beef and crispy chicken, they looked much more appetizing than mine so try those out! If you're looking for a nice side the fries are very crispy and delicious too.

The highlight of these sandwiches are that they are HUGE. You really get your money's worth here, so if you can't eat a lot I recommend ordering the baby sandwich. I will definitely be doing that next time as I only ate half of the regular sized one.
