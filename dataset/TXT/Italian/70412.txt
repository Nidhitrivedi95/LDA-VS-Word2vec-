Being in a pitch black room, totally devoid of all light, for such an extended period of time is not anything I have ever encountered before. Let alone feeding yourself in the dark. O Noir made a excellent date location, although I'd be reluctant to choose it for a first date (unless you wish to have a literal blind date that could possibly be quite unnerving).

Second, the food was excellent. Of course, without something delicious to devour, the O Noir experience would stand as a piece of theatre without a suitable payoff. O Noir does not disappoint. We enjoyed (and managed to share across the table) three courses that included salmon ceviche, beef tartare, lobster pasta, a surprise main course, chocolate cake, and profiteroles. Every dish impressed.

Third, the staff here were so friendly and helpful. From the moment we arrived until after we left all of the staff were very approachable and put up with our many questions. Gracias Alejandro, merci Maurice, and thank you to the others whose names we did not catch.
