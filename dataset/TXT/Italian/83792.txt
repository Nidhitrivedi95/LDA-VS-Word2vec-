DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q This was always a great place to get lunch, when i was working at Skye Harbor Airport. It was a hike for me coming from the US Airways A gates; all the way over to La Grande Orange which is at the very end of the concourse.(by South West airlines). But it was so worth it.My go to choices were " the commuter breakfast sandwhich" ,  the "kale quinoa salad" or the chickpea salad.  The commuter sandwhich has egg tomatoe onion and a little bit of mayo. You can add salmon or meat, your choice. It comes on their house made english muffins which are huge.(the way an enlish muffin should be) if your hungry this is the sandwhich for you; its filling and delicious. The 2 salads are both vegan and delcious. And surprisingly the salad portion is sufficient. If your not ravneously hungry one or two  of the salads will make you happy. They also have a whole bunch of bakery items and some are vegan and a few are whole grain and healthy. All the food is made at the moment you order it. You can see the chefs moving about in the kitchen doing their  best whipping up some yummy food. They also make delicious pizza, which is also freshly prepared right in front of you.
La Grande Orange is a little pricey. But if your particular about what you eat. Like myself and you want to avoid crap fast food. Take the time while your at Skye Harbor and cheque out La Grande Orange. They have got a little bit of some thing for everybody. And its all scruptious and filling.
