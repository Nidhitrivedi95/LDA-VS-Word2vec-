2bK1ng2mnRdtTh_BDNGmIg I'm really hurt. Came for lunch with coworkers after they raced on about it, and I knew this was it. Then I ordered for delivery. The pizza was cold with no warmth, a hair was in it (no it was not cheese). When I called to simply at least let them know about the hair, they said they'd call back. I got a call back but I missed it and when I returned the call I gave them the benefit of the doubt given its Friday and still no call back. :( sad to say it didn't work between us.
