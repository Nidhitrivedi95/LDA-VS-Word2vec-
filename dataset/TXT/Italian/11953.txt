0URIvKxCNT-AVgtdYFAX8w I went to a meeting earlier in the week and the food was catered from Harley's Italian Bistro and I must say, that Lasagne with Italian Sausage was stellar. I have had lasagne from Rosati's which is okay, but this lasagne was outstanding. I have not been to the restaurant yet, although their menu looks fabulous. They must be a little best kept secret sort of place. I definitely will consider this place for catering, holidays, gatherings etc. Excellent.
