During shot show this year I took a friend here because I remember it being so good and I rarely visit the strip now that I live here. The positive thing about going back is that they have expanded the physical restaurant and so it was much easier to get a seat. It just didn't feel the same however. I always loved the 2 Italian men that would serve us and they were nowhere to be seen. Maybe it's just me, but I kind of miss the ambience that used to be there. The food is still nice but I probably wouldn't drive out of my way anymore to go here.
