TAoN9nsibXOxsOnnG7Kd_g I finally went to this place after driving by it for 8 years.  I would always see it and say to myself "I need to go there one time," but never actually following through.  After reading some quality reviews on here we decided to bring some family there for a graduation dinner.  

We ordered some Mussels to start and those were very good.  They were tender and the sauce was good.  We also had the Caprese Salad to share amongst the 4 of us.  I was pretty full after the appetizers so the girlfriend and I split the Veal Piccata.  It too was quite tasty.

The entrance is very cool with the very large and old Ficus tree that had holiday lights woven through it.  Aside from some very loud, obnoxious and drunk guidos/meatheads that were there, it was a very enjoyable meal.  Bonus points for giving me a healthy serving of Sapphire on the rocks.  I will definitely be going back.
