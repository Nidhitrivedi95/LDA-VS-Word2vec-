fDkQcos3MqqCYGWfl64iiA I came to this restaurant for Valentine's Day this year. We came to the early sitting at 6 p.m. We were pleasantly welcomed by the chef himself. He was friendly and jolly and it was a nice treat to see him at the front. They had also decorated the place with rose petals on the floor and each table for the occasion. The restaurant was pretty busy and the tables were close together so we could hear the conversations of the other people throughout the night. In fact once the lady beside us had enough wine she started recommending dessert to us. I found this funny.

The food was magnificent. I tried the chestnut soup based on the recommendations here. It was good but a little bit sweet and a little bit cold. But it was definitely interesting.

We tried the beet risotto and this was for sure the most delicious risotto I have ever tasted. Perfectly cooked and full with flavour.

I then had the veal cheek and marrow cannon special which was also very delicious. I never realized how big a veal cheek is and I haven't had bone marrow before in a restaurant and I was very pleased with the presentation (in the bone with a tiny spoon for digging it out).

The wine list was big but not too big (some restaurants have way too much choice and you get lost in the list). 

Overall, the experience was awesome. I would recommend this place to anyone. Our server was very good and came to serve us at the proper times. There was one server tho for the tables beside us that was very chatty with the customers. Almost to the point of being annoying. At first I thought that the customers were his friends but when he chatted for too long at each table, I realized that was just his personality. Sort of overbearing.
