KiP4NjelCHqNAf36JxXUQQ I hadn't gone to the Bayview Village location in years because I was always disappointed, but thought I would give it another try last night ....to say I was disappointed is an understatement.  I ordered the ravioli for $17.00.  The sauce tasted like bottled Ragu and the ravioli I buy at Loblaws (the PC brand) tastes better,  

The dessert however was excellent - chocolate/raspberry tartuffo.  In the end, I will not go back, unless it's for a coffee and dessert.  I used to love this restaurant - don't know why it has detiorated to such a degree over the years.
