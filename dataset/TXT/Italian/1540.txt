-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q This place was heavenly. Like most others I saw it on an episode of Guy Fieri's Triple D.  I went with the Italian Stallion as shown on TV and it did not disappoint.  The sauce was great, the toppings heartily applied, mozzarella applied in big chunks, and pizza had the perfect char.

It was better than Pizzeria Bianco's.

There I said it. I know that I can no longer call myself a man and my "foodie card" will soon be revoked but the truth is the truth. And guess what?? I didn't even have to wait in line 2 hours for the best pizza I have had in Phoenix.
