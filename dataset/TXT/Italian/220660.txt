scoJNOqcw2peNlO31UYTaA Pizza People Pub is pretty awesome and has a great location in downtown Phoenix.  At Tour de Coops, I had seen their food truck, and my co worker ordered a pizza.  It looked really good that I knew I had to make a trip to the pub!

The day before Thanksgiving, me and Judy F. had a Thanksgiving Eve dinner at the pub.  Very inviting atmosphere with unique informal seating areas as well as outside seating is available.  A little cold outside right now, but can't wait when it's a bit warmer in the evening to sit outside.

I ordered the AZ Jackass, similar to a Moscow Mule.  Pretty tasty and it was a dollar off for happy hour!!  I could not resist ordering a mini mac!  It was so tasty with a crispy top and warm creamy middle.  My pizza had pepperoni and mushrooms and was a 10" pizza which I devoured all of it!  The crust was really really good.  However, they make it, it's probably the best that I've had in awhile, seriously!
