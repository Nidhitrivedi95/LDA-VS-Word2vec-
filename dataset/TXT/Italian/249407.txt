VjaHHmV-rSkFaOAnU3faxg WOW!!!  I have searched my adulthood for the perfect pizza.  Who would have thought I would find it in Sun Prairie.  Everything is local and fresh.  Terrance's Favorite is the my pizza of choice.  Their lunches are great also.  The bread they use for sandwiches is amazing and the meat can't be described.  I swear it tastes like WI.  Many times Rhonda and I have swapped meals because we wanted to try both dishes.

I hope with them growing so fast that they don't lose their uniqueness and quality.
