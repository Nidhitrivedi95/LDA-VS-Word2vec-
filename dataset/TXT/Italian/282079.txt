YXvXE2p6xeg6a11SMIjQ3w We went for lunch after they had only been open for a week.  Nice decor, friendly staff, good menu.  Service was a little spotty.  Had a party of 6 and we all ordered either wine or beer.  It took forever to get our drinks.  I saw them sitting on the bar for a good while before we finally asked someone (who wasn't our server) to go get them.  The greek salad was small for the price and compared to salads I order at other Italian/pizza places.  White pizza was really good.  We ordered it with the addition of tomatoes and pesto drizzle.  The pesto drizzle made it a little too oily for my taste, but it was really good.  Looking forward to trying it out again.
