aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA I would NOT recommend Oregano's!  There are much better options in town.  

On a Sunday night, I went there trying to get a casual bite to eat.  The server told me the wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Are you kidding?  

Then they had me sit at the bar table.  The waiter then kicked me out of the table.  Apparently, those tables were reserved.  He instructed me to sit at an empty bar stool.  It seems they were also reserved.  Rather than saying so, an angry mother PUSHED me out of the way.  Is that necessary?  A simple statement that there was a miscommunication would have sufficed.  

I really resent being kicked out of the table and being pushed.  The hostess had no other alternative than to drink in another section.  Would I really want to spend any money in this establishment after such an experience?  I will never go back to any Oregano's.   

A much better option in Old Town is the Daily Dose, just one block away.  The servers are very nice, the food is tasty, there was no wait and there were GREAT happy hour specials.  Check out the Daily Dose.  It saved my evening.
