1VDP92FU2p8AqJw9vU11sw me and my fiance have been regulars here for a long time ... the other night we met another couple  out for dinner before hand... decided after that we would have a drink at lakeside .. we mostly go in there for there sunday drink specials and appetizers . so are intentions were to have a few cocktails .. among sitting down ordering us all a round of waters we got apporached by a very rude younger lady, who claimed to be the manager, telling us that they could not serve us because they 'ASSUMED' we were drinking at another establishment prior... we had ONE drink at dinner and by no means were out of controll ... we all were almost in shock and being with my friend who is also a bartender she said that is not a law, and who are they to say that we were even drinking before hand ... when every other person in there was wasted out there minds. i honestly think it was discrimination he apparently didnt like our energetic energy and simply didnt want  us there needless to say us and everyone we have ever referred there will never be back.... what a shame . i have looked and loooked for an email address to contacact a supervisor or owner, the waty we were treated was unexceptable . any help  with anyone knowing or finding a direct e mail for there bar letme know th good luck guys
