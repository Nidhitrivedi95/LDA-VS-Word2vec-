Zja7ykq3icDzkN20XX6j1w I tried to pay about four times before I finally figured it out.  You don't pay when you order, you don't pay when you pick out a drink, you don't pay when you pick up the pizza, you don't pay until you're leaving the place. So bizarre, but whatever works for them.

Aiello's is a small little walk in pizza place in Squirrel Hill.  I went there after a hard Sunday afternoon bouldering, so I was hungry.  Four of us split a large pepperoni pizza which set us back about $20.  Filled us up enough, but not enough that we didn't go to Waffalonia after.

Neat neighborhood place, filled up quick with Steelers fans after the game was over.
