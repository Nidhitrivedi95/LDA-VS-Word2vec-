xLy6hAIyfva7fGuRrhI0dg Sure, this restaurant isn't right on the subway line. But it's worth the trek for the fresh pasta made daily. If you're looking to escape the downtown hoards, this place will do nicely for a date or a group. (Or if you want to bring your laptop and drink solo, that wouldn't be out of place here either.) The service was attentive, the food tastes like homemade and looks even prettier. The restaurant is small, but the tables are a good size and spaced out, meaning you're not stuck trying to eat dinner out of your lap or bumping elbows. I'd be okay eating here every night if eating pasta 5 nights a week was socially acceptable. I'll definitely be back for more.
