e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw My friends and I ate here on Friday, 9/21 for my birthday.  It was amazing!  The staff even gave me a hand written birthday card and a free desert.  I had the Cioppino (lobster, clams, and shrimp), everything about it was delicious.  The meal may have been pricer than what I normally pay, but in my opinion it was worth it.
