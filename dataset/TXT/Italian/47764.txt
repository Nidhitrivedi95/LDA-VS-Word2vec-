8yoe08nCUpjDQ56Y9qVPKg I have never been here before. I loved the simple charm of this place and it's a pure Hot Dog enthusiasts heaven. 

It's the perfect place to take a break and go get a very good Hot Dog. 

I had the Maxwell Polish dog. Absolutely delicious! The only reason this place gets a 3 instead of a 5 for me is the portion size of the dog vs. the price. No way that dog is worth almost $5. The $1 Polish dogs at Costco are twice the size and almost as tasty. 

Bring that price down to at least just under $3 and I would prefer this dog to anything else. Unless you decide to offer slightly better seating and friendlier service. That I don't mind paying extra for.
