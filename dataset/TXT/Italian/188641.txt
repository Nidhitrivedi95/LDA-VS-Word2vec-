oX7lSVsg4j7-SrSZVGWVnA Obviously from the name it is Italian food, but they do it rather quickly. Our visit was on a Friday for lunch and we took advantage of the lunch specials. I had the BBQ Style Chicken pizza and my wife had Mista Salad. As usual we ate family style and shared with our daughter who just loves to watch people moving throughout the restaurant.

The food was quick and the service was very pleasant. The salad was a full serving and sharing was not a problem. The black olives were a hit for Tara, my daughter and a great hit for my wife since she loves Balsamic Vinaigrette. The combination of greens, mushrooms, mozzarella cheese and croutons makes for a refreshing salad.

The BBQ Style Chicken pizza is also big enough to share as well. Made with BBQ Sauce, Roasted Chicken, Roasted Red Onions, and Cilantro. This really hits the spot. I prefer a sweet tangy BBQ sauces over the spicy type and this one fits into my preference.

The bill came in under $20 and we kept it to an hour. We were very happy with our visit and plan to return again soon.
