lgWB0yGXpZvupYREWxtV7g After my same-sex date and I sat down at the bar, it took more than 10 minutes (I was watching the clock) before the waiter first addressed us and only AFTER serving an opposite-sex couple who had sat down next to us FIVE minutes later.  I was very disappointed that we weren't served in the order in which we arrived.  We had gone to Pizzera Bianco the previous weekend and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the dining experience.  So, we had similarly high expectations for the Pane Bianco cafe.  We were disappointed.  If we weren't starving, we would've gone elsewhere.  We're not entirely sure that the unsatisfactory service was the result of our sexual orientation, but it was very suspicious.  The food was great, however, but we are certain that we will think twice before going to any more of the Bianco's restaurants.
