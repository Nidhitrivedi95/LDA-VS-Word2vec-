hTsZSiftorNUFb1VaHCHHg We came here for happy hour on a Friday and got seated almost immediately! The wine selection isn't that fantastic on the happy hour menu but I still managed to get a class of white wine. We then shared the most amazing spicy pepperoni pizza and chopped chicken salad. The salad was decent but the pizza was absolutely mouth watering! I would highly recommend this place but be sure to make reservations. When 6:30 rolled around the place had a pretty large wait. 

Service was excellent as well. There was 8 of us and he managed to give each one of us exactly what we needed! We will be back!
