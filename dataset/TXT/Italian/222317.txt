sH9aI3xg-POBMp8R-kSQZg This was our first visit at this location, but we love portifinos.. Our server was one of the best we have ever had. Our pasta was delicious.we ordered the caprese app and I love it. There bread is so good and I just keep eating that then when my food comes I am stuffed. But we had leftovers to take home and eat the next day which was great. Can't wait to come here again.
