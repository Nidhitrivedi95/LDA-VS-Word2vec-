7ZBh-3wWVQ5zkd6KZytW0g Extremely and very pleasantly surprised!

Made a reservation a few weeks ago to go to Cibo with my two friends. An hour before we were supposed to go I started reading reviews and they were very dismal. Major complaints about service and, to a lesser extent, the food. We almost didn't go but decided to try it anyway. 

Right away you could see how on point the service in fact was. The hostess sat us quickly. And our server (who's name unfortunately I don't remember) was excellent. Drinks came quickly, water was always refilled. I saw the two managers out on the floor helping out and keeping a very watchful eye on everything. 

The food was delicious! I had a arugula salad with Parmesan and when I asked for some more from the food runner I got a generous portion in seconds. For my main I had the lamb ragu with gluten free penne. First of all, I would never have known it was GF if you didn't tell me. But it was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in recent memory. (Though I did add hot peppers to give it a bit more kick.) My friends loved their apps and their pizza and gnocchi. 

We were raving to our server and telling her how great everything was. And the next thing you know they brought us a dessert on the house! I couldn't eat it so I ordered the semifredo and polished it off - it was delicious!

I hope they can keep up whatever they were doing because it was a fantastic experience and I can't wait to go back!
