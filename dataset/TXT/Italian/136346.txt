iziI_goVr962lPfxsAmAcg Not good. Had high hopes since we like the Chowder House. Aracini tasted like crispy fried nothing, had absolutely no seasoning. Calamari filling was tasty, but was overcooked. Gnocchi tasted like store bought stuff, sauce was good though. Pork chop was unedibly salty and shockingly off tasting. I really wanted to be adventerous and break out of our comfort zone of Russo's and Moe's, our two favorite restaurants in Cuyahoga Falls. $50 dollars wasted, dialing Russo's for a reservation for next weekend!
