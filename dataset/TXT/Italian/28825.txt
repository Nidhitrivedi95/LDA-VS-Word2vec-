59c3Cp-p5i18xFCKUuCkFQ La Vecchia is a couple blocks north of Eglinton on yonge street. 

I was here for a business meeting so we were in the basement in a private room. 

We had antipasto, I had the risotto and the beef with mash. 

The most offputting thing for me was the waitress who just wasnt very good. She couldnt really provide much input on the food and seemed to have attitude at the same time. 

The antipasto is typical Italian stuff. The Risotto was pretty tight and delicious.  The beef just wasnt a very typically italian meal.It was kind of a let down and the texture of the meat just wasnt great. 

I probably wouldnt come back. It was just ok.
