I love Italian food and been to many types of restaurants from Scarpetta to Olive Garden. Although I hate to say this because I really like supporting local spots, Ventano leans much closer to the Olive Garden side.

There was nothing creative or unique about the menu, everything tasted VERY bland and it was unbelievably smoky inside.  Service was decent, but I definitely won't go out of my way to return. Perhaps try the Pasta Shop (delicious!) on Horizon Ridge or Bratalian on Eastern.
