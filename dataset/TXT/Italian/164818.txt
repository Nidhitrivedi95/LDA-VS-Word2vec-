LzYy9DdprXyI2zXNSP267g I went there for a late dinner and we wanted to sit at a booth in the dining area but my friend wanted one of the specials you can only get at the bar.  I don't like that you can only get certain specials if you sit by the bar, especially when the place is some what empty, they should allow you those specials anywhere you sit.  It's a pretty ugly atmosphere, dark and boring.  

My friend and I sat at a high table close to the bar, and at that end they had a cart for dirty dishes sitting just across from us, gross!  but just wait it get's worse... I ordered the bacon wrapped scallop pasta with salad and garlic bread, and my friend ordered the pizza special.  Her pizza was dried out and nasty, and one of my bacon wrapped scallops had a hair wrapped into it. YUM YUM, I love eating other people's hair!  the pasta with my dish was pretty bland and boring.  

The salad that came with my dish was a ceasar with way too much dressing and when I asked for less on the next one they gave me none, also when the waitress brought another salad serving she didn't offer me cheese on top and completely disappeared, I literally had to go to the bar and get the cheese shredder myself and shred my own cheese.  

I wish I could give it a 0/5 but apparently that's not a possibility so it's a 1/5 for their.. um, well the garlic bread was good.  Never going here again though!
