wV5IYyqc35F1g3fSZjt41A I went with my wife and kids to this place for Sunday Brunch. We had to make a reservation in advance, the place is good for people with children and the food is OK and nothing special. 

The main issue though, "if you get to eat" then it would taste ok. This place has a buffet brunch during weekends but nothing there. Everything was emptied and you would literally eat one bite at a time. They would get you fries then a long time later you will get the sausage then wait for another 10 minutes till you get the eggs. They are very slow and no one was there to supervise or see how the food is gone. 

The price is EXTREMELY expensive taken into consideration that we did not eat a full plate or all the contents of a good brunch at the same time. I wanted to wait till they get some toast so that I eat my egg. All I got was cold egg warm toast no sausage and then I had sausage after a while just separately alone. 

Would not go back there and would neither recommend it. Maybe if it is not for brunch could be better but I won't risk going back there. 

I've put 2 stars just because I did not try their menu and just tried their brunch buffet.
