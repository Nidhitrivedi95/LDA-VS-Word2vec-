9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg We came here for a get together with my residence friends. Everything we ate was scrumptious and the presentation was absolutely amazing. They not only do a very good job with plating, but balance the colors and flavors to perfection. I also really like the ambiance of this place, with its exposed walls and dim lighting - it really is a great place to take a date for a tête-à-tête. I much preferred the seating arrangement and how it gives you an entire view of the restaurant.

To start, they brought complimentary focaccia bread with butter. For Appetizers, me and four of my friends shared Spinach and Artichoke dip and Chicken Parmesan bites. It wasn't enough for us but we were in for a surprise regarding the pasta serving. We ordered large Pesto Pollo to split between two of us. They willingly spilt it into two different plates and the serving was enough to fill us up. The flavors were so perfectly balanced - both in terms of texture and taste.   

The only reason for three stars was our waitress. She was lazy and not bothered to serve us on time. She was also super slow and would have deserved a better tip if she could be a bit more friendly.

Nonetheless I might come back to try the food again and I am hoping the service will be better. Maybe it was one of the places that's a hit and miss with service.
