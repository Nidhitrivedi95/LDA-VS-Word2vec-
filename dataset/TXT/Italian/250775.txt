VoXUt6TIJWyIf_lihbN5xQ I went here for my husband's birthday on a recommendation from a friend.  It was an excellent decision.

We made a reservation, but we still had a bit of a wait.  It is a VERY popular place on a Friday night.  The place was packed, but the server took good care of us.  The only complaint with the meal was that our calimari was overdone and a bit greasy.  I just won't order it again.

My hubby had a wonderful chicken salad that he raved about for 2 days.  And I had Linguini with white clam sauce and the roasted brussel sprouts.  I would get those brussel sprouts again just as a dinner, they were fantastic.  The clams were perfectly cooks and the sauce was devine.

We even took home a Nutella Calzone.  Super yummy, but they included ice cream in the to go box and didn't tell us and it was melted by the time we got home.
