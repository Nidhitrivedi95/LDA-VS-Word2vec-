82-wE5pkxyBKhfxyyZap_A Delivery Order 10/4/2015

Order was for 2 gyro sandwiches, cheese fries, regular fries, and extra tzatziki sauce on the side.

The gyro sandwiches had no lettuce or sauce on it despite it being called the "Big Fat Gyro with Tzatziki Sauce". The meat was good though. 

The cheese fries seemed like they were the first thing they cooked because they weren't even lukewarm and the cheese was completely hard. 

The regular fries were cold as well. 

We did finish our gyros, but couldn't eat the fries because of how bad they were.

Edit: Ordered through Yelp's Eat24 app.
