AN9sX6Dh8-QAoJssdyno8A The wait staff was friendly and inviting.  The menu was super & offered a very nice variety of dishes, food was promptly delivered and was absolutely delicious! We had the barrata appetizer, a green salad (balsamic dressing excellent) pizza; crust fresh, buttery, like I would expect at a really good quality pizzeria, pasta was absolutely fresh & delicious, and we topped it off with a dessert of freshly cooked dough with drizzles of Nutella, this needed much more Nutella but otherwise delicious. Very reasonably priced!!!
