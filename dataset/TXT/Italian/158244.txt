LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Called to make reservations for a party of 7, Hostess on the phone said they were booked and pretty busy however we can walk in and wait... 

On the way down I was able to make Reservation via Internet, however we still thought the Restaurant would have at least an hour wait for a "BUSY" Saturday night as the Hostess stated.... come to our surprise Restaurant was far from Busy, and we were sat almost instantly. 

Very pleased with the Food, Great sized Portions, Complimentary bread oil and vinegar, however being lied too over the phone was rude, and almost made us change our dinner plans for the evening....
