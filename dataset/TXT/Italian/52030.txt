9NGXZyn-GHYB-vKC63gOag I have been here for lunch and dinner and both times service was fast and the food was good. I've sampled a few of their dishes and have not had anything I haven't liked. You can't go wrong with an item on the menu. I also like that you have the option of ordering almost any of their dishes in half size or full size.

The complimentary bread is phenomenal but be careful because it is endless! :)

Happy Hour Deals: $3 House wine, $5 special cocktails and $5 food items such as 2 different types of pizza, meatball sliders and calamari.  Tuesday nights they have BOGO pizza and it applies to any size.
