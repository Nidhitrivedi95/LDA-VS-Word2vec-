9x1bWbbSgFCMLJlJR8mezQ I've eaten here at La Gondola's before and I can attest that the baked sandwiches are da bomb.  I wasn't all too hungry for lunch today but felt that I needed to get out and have something so I decided on a slice of pizza. 

The atmosphere is what you would expect from a Pittsburgh Italian family owned pizzeria. Clean yet a little cramped; friendly but not overly so; service not exactly slow but for a simple slice of pizza it wasn't "freakishly fast" either. The two waitresses and the two behind the counter doing the cooking seem to be having a good time.

My slice of pizza came and it looked so yummy. The crust was perfectly done and it had cheese artfully oozing over the pepperoni. Esthetically beautiful. Unfortunately when I bit into it, the taste was just average. It wasn't bad, the crust held up just fine but the sauce was lacking "oomph"... that zest that you look for when eating pizza (at least it's what I look for). 

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad slice of pizza, just average. Average in taste, average in size, even average in temperature. I wouldn't go out of my way for a slice of pizza here. But I wouldn't put up a fuss if I was with a group and they wanted to go. But I'd probably opt for one of their tasty sandwiches or maybe try one of the pasta dishes over the pizza.
