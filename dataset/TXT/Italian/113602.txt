ghpFh6XpH1TYZhjAGdx-xw This place is amazing. It was eight bucks for an 11-inch pizza with all the toppings that I wanted on it. Super good pesto, fresh mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes and spicy sausage. I was pretty surprised when I walked in that I was the only one there. I really hope this place blows up because it's freaking delicious.
