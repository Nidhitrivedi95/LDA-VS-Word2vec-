74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw We wanted to have a nice dinner in Vegas before a show, and this ended up being the place due to location and availability.  Lucky for us, it was a great pick.  We were fortunate enough to be in Vegas for restaurant week, so we enjoyed a nice 3 course prix fixe meal for $32.  The portions were excellent and food was very flavorful.  After traveling to Italy this summer, I felt their spaghetti was similar to some I had tasted in Italia.  Our waited, Caesar, appeared to be Italian as well.  Services was good with only one snafu- they forgot to put our calamari in, but they ended up comping it for us and bringing it out later.  The atmosphere in the dining room is slightly stuffy, I like the more modern aesthetic of the front wine bar.  My only other complaint was they had one of those people taking and selling photographs.  At first I thought she just wanted a pic of beautiful people enjoying dinner, but turns out she was selling the pictures.
