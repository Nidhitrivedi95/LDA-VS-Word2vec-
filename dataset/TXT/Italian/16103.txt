1VDP92FU2p8AqJw9vU11sw Great patio service with a smile! And a fresh bowl of cool water for the dog. What a great way to enjoy MLK JR. DAY by way of a leisurely family lunch! 
Our party ordered the Grilled Chicken Caesar Wrap, Turkey Cranberry Wrap, & Philly Cheese with sautéed shrooms....with French fries & sweet potato fries....they were all enjoyed thoroughly. 
We've decided on a return visit, possibly to enjoy some of the entertainment evening scene which includes dueling pianos, paint night, & karaoke! Check the calendar for this month's schedule!
