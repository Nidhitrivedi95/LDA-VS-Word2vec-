Then the mediocre service began. The server recited the specials while staring at the board and then walked away. They were inattentive as we tried for about fifteen minutes to catch one of the two servers' eyes when we were finished. Granted, we had eaten about half of the food, so it very well could have looked like we were still eating.

The reason we had eaten half the food was because it just wasn't that great. The market special sandwich that day was roast lamb with escarole, which I was stoked about. The bread it came on was kind of tough and the meat lacked flavor. It could have used some sweet peppers or something for some contrast. Just a bit blase, imo. The mozzarella salad was lovely as expected, and the pickled veggies were nice. I can't say I'd return, but it was nice to finally check out as it is right next to Lux.

Tipped the server well since she was putting up with a baby who repeatedly threw the menu on the ground, giggling.
