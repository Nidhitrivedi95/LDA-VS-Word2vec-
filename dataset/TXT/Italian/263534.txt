wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q Food was great, service lacked. We went at an odd time wasn't really dinner but wasn't lunch. Our server didn't seem happy we were sat in his section, he put on the best face he could. I did their three course lunch menu and it filled me up.! The complementary bread is so yummy! I had the rigatoni and sausage pasta so good! My boyfriend had a pizza and thoroughly enjoyed it. Everything was good, service wasn't bad but wasn't great!
