ZL-4ejIO3DCgSsdRWwsX-A Vincenza's is one of my favorite lunch spots downtown.  They have great pizza by the slice. My favorite is the thin crust with banana peppers, but you can add whatever toppings you want or get one of the premade pizzas. 

If you're coming for pizza, try to avoid coming right at noon. It's busy! However, all the workers are super friendly and know how to handle the pressure of a lunch rush.
