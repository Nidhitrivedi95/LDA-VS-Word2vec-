They have a wide variety of martinis and wines by the glass.  My mango martini was huge and, at only $8, was a good deal.  

After you order, they bring a basket of ciabatta rolls and balsamic/olive oil for dipping.  The bread was piping hot and good!

We started with a caesar salad for me, and the zuppa di pesce for my husband. Both appetizers were large, and the caesar salad had a few added touches, including roasted red peppers, red onions, and tomatoes.  The zuppa was filled with shrimp, calamari, and mussels, and it had a thick, tangy tomato broth.  My husband loved it.

For our entrees, I had the cavatelli with crab meat in a cognac cream sauce.  It was a perfect portion that was filled with crab and had a sauce that was delicious but not overly heavy.  It was my favorite dish of the night.  My husband had the linguini al mare, similar to your typical seafood pasta dish with a spicy marinara sauce.  He loved this as well.

I can't forget to mention the service, which was professional and attentive. Soft music was playing in the background that added to the dining room's appeal.  

My husband and I left Campania knowing we'd be back.  What a nice surprise!
