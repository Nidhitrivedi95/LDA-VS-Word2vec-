n_UkzLCAMCIqhUnu-iLQyw i am not from the Cleveland area, and finding out that the night life in the city is a little quiet around dinner time was a little disturbing coming from Chicago.  We ask the receptionist at the Double Tree where we should dine, and she recommended Bricco.  I loved the set up of the restaurant, and they seated us in one of those nice old school giant booths in the back. It is perfect when you want to keep your kids from running all over the place.  I had the scallops and shrimp over a bacon infused risotto that was to die for.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and litterally melted in my mouth with each bite.
