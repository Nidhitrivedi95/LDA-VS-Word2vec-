1. Bakery and deli on one side with small Italian grocery store.  This place came highly recommended by a friend especially the frutti di mare.  They are known for Italian desserts.  
2. I loved the bread basket, as I usually do, with the tapenade it is like crack in spread form!!
3. Bruschetta was a little soggy from the tomatoes.  The bread could have been a bit more toasty
4. I had the best best white zin here - Bel Arbor from California.  Usually I don't get anything out of a glass of wine but this one definitely had a taste of grapefruit, and I finally finished a glass of wine.  
5. Entree didn't have the best presentation but the piccata sauce was delicious nicely tangy.  
6. Desserts are Italian favorites!  I got the sampler 

Service
1. Server was great!!!  
2. Front desk and bakery was less friendly.  
3. I felt like it was harsh, maybe this is Italian style 

Ambiance
1. Ambiance in other photos mainly showed the deli but the sit down restaurant is more sleek and modern
2. See photos
