Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag We came here for dinner the evening of my birthday, because of it's close proximity to Aria, and gorgeous location inside Crystals. 

We started with drinks. My BFF got the agave julep which was fresh and tasty, but very sweet. I got the Drunken Pumpkin which was delicious, very flavorful, and not overly sweet. My BF and his BFF ordered a pitcher of beer. After about 10 minutes of the girls having their drinks and the guys waiting, a half pitcher came out because they ran out. They ordered another type of beer, and waited another fifteen minutes for that to come out. 

For appetizers, my fatty BFF got the soup appetizer, which was good, but not $12 good. My BF and I shared the insalada mista ($9) with cherry tomatoes and shaved Parmesan, which was good but not extraordinary. They split it for us though, which was nice. The complimentary breads, especially the sourdough, were remarkable. I am a huge sourdough fan, and they sure did it right! It was fluffy and flavorful, and I would have been happy just eating that all night. :) 

Our group loves food, so we all at least try, if not share, each others' meal. Our orders, orderers, and ratings: 
- Eggplant Parmesan (BFF) (*****) 
- Mushroom Pizza (BF's BFF) (****) 
- Italian Meat Pizza (BF) (***) 
- Swordfish Entree (Bday girl) (**) 

My favorites dishes were the eggplant Parmesan and the mushroom pizza. The eggplant was lightly battered and fried, almost tempura-like, and not covered in sauce, but accented with sauce. There was such delicious flavor from the vegetable! The mushroom pizza was really flavorful, and the mushrooms went really well with the combo of sauces and cheese. 

The other dishes, the Italian meat pizza and swordfish, were less impressive. Salami sounded good on pizza... turns out it's kind of a weird combination. They were also stingy with the sweet peppers which seemed to be the main source of flavor. I may just stick to pepperonis on my pizza next time. I would advise against the swordfish entree because it was somewhat fishy and a very small portion for $34. 

The restaurant shared a complimentary dessert for my birthday, and I chose the tiramisu. It was light and tasty, and had little malt balls mixed in, which was unusual for tiramisu. I, of course, shared it with my best friends and they enjoyed it as well. 

Service was good. Not our main waiter, but the back-up waiter (or whatever that title would be) was very helpful, efficient, and attentive. The regular waiter was not bad, but not wonderful. 

I would come back here because the ambiance is very unique, the decor is beautiful, and the food was good. It was pricey, but we had a nice dinner together making it worth every penny!
