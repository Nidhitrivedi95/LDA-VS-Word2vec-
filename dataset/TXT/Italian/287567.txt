zluk4cL7Ch-uRlRply42ZQ I was very impressed with this place. I ended up going there twice in the same week. The service was top notch and the food was wonderful. I was a huge fan of the Cesar salad with salmon. They also have the best deserts in the city. I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu. The GM also informed me they have a chefs table in the kitchen, I will be trying that as soon as I get a group together. If you're in Mentor this is a must.
