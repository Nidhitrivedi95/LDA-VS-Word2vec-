7B-suS0RHxqxZBBfVfiPLA I am not sure why this restaurant gets so busy. But I have to say this location of olive garden was the worst one I have been to. 
1. Water cup tasted soapy
2. Utensils not cleaned properly
3. The shrimp that came with our DIY pastas were super small, reminded me of the $5.99 bag of shrimps I get from walmart. 
4. The garlic and wine sauce was really heavy and not appetizing. Honestly my pasta would have tasted better if you just give me some olive oil dressing with a dash of salt and pepper.
5. The garlic bread were super greasy and honestly not very good
6. Salad dressing very sour. 
7. Minestrone soup was very bland I had to add an obscene amount of pepper to it to give it flavor
8. Games on the tablet that comes with every table, costs money. Seriously, before I was about to compliment their technology, this is how they get you. Some of the games are free apps from the app store, so why would I pay $1.99 to pay while I am waiting for the food?
9. Bathrooms at this restroom needs attention
