fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I go through phases where I eat nothing but CherryBlossom. Which would be concerning (and maybe a little sad) if they weren't so good. They're also fantastic for casual date nights, and several of our friends have gotten hooked after we brought them here.

Absolute Must-Tries:

Baja Norte Roll - Super-refreshing jalapeno with cool dipping sauce.
Extremely Spicy Gyoza Pot - Listed as an appetizer, but big enough for a meal. 
Cha-shu Ramen - Anything with BBQ pork here is a winner. Ditto with anything ramen.
Tekka-don - Slightly sweet and citrusy tuna bowl. My friends always steal mine.
Yakiniku - Perfectly tender Korean beef on a sizzling plate. 
Iron Pot Udon - Seafood and beef are both fantastic.
Spaghetti Bolognese - My partner sees me check in at lunch, starts craving this, and drags me back for dinner.
Dessert - Look at that cake and tell me you don't have room. 
Banana Bread - The answer to every question about hidden gems in Phoenix.

For a noodle place, I'm never super impressed with their yakisoba. I still order it sometimes, and you should try it, but it isn't the absolute best thing on the menu.

The owner and waitstaff are super friendly, but service can be slow, especially when it comes time for the check. If you have a show to catch, definitely ask for the check with your meal.
