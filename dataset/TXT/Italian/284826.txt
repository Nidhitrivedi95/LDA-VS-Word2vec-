ZE1n6H-4qgq_7z67qa4yUA Went here with my folks on a Saturday night.  Not super busy but it was delicious and I'm glad I came.  Had roasted mushroom salad, the Regina pizza and veal marsala.  The salad was sweet which was a surprise and I likely won't order it again as it was a pretty standard mix of mushrooms.  I was thinking there'd be somethign exotic especially if the mushrooms are the highlight.
The Regina pizza was delicious.  Prosciutto, Arugula, shaved parmagiano.  The real plus was that we had leftovers the next day and the pizza didn't completely fall apart like the ones I've had a Cibo.  No leftovers on the veal, and the sauce was so tasty that we kept going back for more with the little nibbles of bread crust that they serve to snack on (like pita chips but made of bread dough).
All in all, delicious and will be back!
