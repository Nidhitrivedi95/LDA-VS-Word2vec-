1WBVqmo7tgF0z0eGf4fPhQ I was excited to try this place a few months ago and saw they deliver (I live in desert shores) so it's right down the street. I called to order and the man was very very rude. 
I asked him for simple spaghetti and he said they didn't have any. I asked for a few more things and they didn't have those pasta/sauces either. 

My friend and I looked at each other and laughed. What a joke! How can you be a pasta restaurant and run out of SPAGHETTI. 
At least go to smiths and get some spaghetti to keep your restaurant going. Unforgivable.
