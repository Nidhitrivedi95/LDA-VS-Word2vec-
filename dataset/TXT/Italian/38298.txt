7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ One of my first memories here was many years back when I was still a youngin. My brother,  Jared M. took me here for some dinner. We ordered a pizza and continued to play boggle and hang out..a memory I'll never forget. 

So here are some of my favs;  pizza's always delicious but when you can breakfast all day, the commuter is my number one pick. Mixing the tea's is definitely a good move to make & they've e also got amazing pre-made salads for the ones who need something quick and on the go. Most recently i had  a delicious turkey sandwich & a burger with my roommate to share. Although they forgot the burger, the free cookies they let us eat after made it all worth the while.  Too bad I was too full to hit the gelato spot attached to the dining area but then again, there's always next time!! 

Though parking is often a b***h you'll lose any sense of anger after walking inside their doors. The workers are friendly and the music sets tone for great times. 

GO GO GO TO LGO even if your getting your food to go, they'll bring it straight to your car, uber convenient eh?
