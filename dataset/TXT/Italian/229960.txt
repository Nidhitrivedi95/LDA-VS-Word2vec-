I got their Funghi Misti pizza and it tasted exactly how it did when I got it downtown, so hot! The truffle flavour+cheese mixed with the rich nutty mushrooms are amazing. Definitely try this if its your first time, it is a little pricey but the ingredients are so high quality and fresh that its worth it.
