NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA My favorite place to eat before a show at the Benedum. It has such great ambience and the wait times are never insane. If you can't get a table, there are two bars to sit at and they'll serve you food at those. Awesome pizza and if you're not into that they have other foods too! Plus, they always have changing specials and desserts. Tons of different unique beers on tap and of course the regional favorites like Coors Light. It's just a great overall restaurant and in the dozen times I've been there I've never had a bad experience. Downtown restaurants tend to be pretty hectic, but I feel like this one handles the craziness and just lets you have a really good meal.
