DWWK7M6SsQwz0Dd2pOTOUQ I was very reluctant to order a take-out pizza from Barro's... had gotten a pretty lousy pizza from another location in Phoenix recently. But I'm glad I took a chance on it... the pizza was absolutely delicious!

Ordered two medium thin-crust pizzas, the mega meat, and the Kona. The mega meat was out of this world! Lots of yummy topings (bacon bits were my favorites). And the Kona was sweet and glazed over with lots of teriyaki sauce. Satisfied my sweet tooth!

Both were baked just right... uniform, not gooey. And the crust was just the right thin-ness. I've had thin-crust pizzas from other places that were like crackers. Barro's crust was still soft. Nice!

Anyway, great place to take out pizza from. I'll be ordering from them again.
