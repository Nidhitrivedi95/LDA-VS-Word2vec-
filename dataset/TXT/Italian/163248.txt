lwpQQflP1CGJPV7QLybzOg My niece and her baby girl were in town and she eats at Upper Crust in Nm.  I was not impressed; the waiter took our order via text which basically meant no personality just a person looking at his cell phone.

He also repeatedly put our HOT dishes within reach of the baby in a high chair putting her at risk to be burned.  He was not personable at all!!

However the food was decent; not fantastic and for the price plus the annoying lack of personality and experience I'd rather not go back.

Also why have high chairs but no kids menu? we paid for an entire order of noodles with butter ( about 5 noodles eaten by the baby); I just think for a "family style" serving restaurant they should be more family friendly.

In an age where everyone is on their cell phone and disconnected most families go out to dinner to have an experience.  This was just another disconnected moment in our lives and should have been an easy relaxing time to catch up with our family.
