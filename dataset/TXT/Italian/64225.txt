bCrMHwCLZzyKsAUOiAL0OA I tried Ray's Pizza for the first time yesterday. The dining room was very spacious and clean. The pizza was tasty--- a little bit old, but I was there at 2:30 or so, so not a typical lunch or dinner time frame. All of the staff was friendly and professional except for the woman that rung us up. She was very unhappy looking and was wearing sweats. That was a little weird. 

I'll definitely give them another try though.
