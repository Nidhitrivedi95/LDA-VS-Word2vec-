vE4WR05o_c0pL_l4Aq2BlQ I am not sure why or how my review is gone.  But I have been to the Glendale location several times.  I love the pizza and dessert!  My favorites:  MARGHERITA & POMO.  The pizzas are thin, light, and slightly crispy crust.   The flour-less chocolate cake is yummy!  The service there is always very friend.  No leftovers!
