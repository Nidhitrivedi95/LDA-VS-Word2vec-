a6SqJZTFMpSOR6Qb0STyFA I don't know why I never reviewed this one on Yelp.  I have only ever done it on Open Table.  Maybe I am being sub-consciously selfish because I don't ever want them to not have room for me when I wish to go. This is my "go to" neighborhood Italian restaurant.  My husband gave me 2 choices late yesterday and, of the 2, I chose this. We have been there regularly and they are always very accommodating. Last night we split the eggplant parmesan  appetizer - very flavorful and cut very thin. We each had some hearty minestrone soup followed by this "melt in your mouth" lamb osso bucco.  It has been on special before but I have always ignored it. While seating us, a plate for another table went by and it just looked so good, I had to break down and try it. I wish I had a way with words to describe how very tasty it was.  It was served with fettucini (which I believe they make their own pastas) in the osso bucco sauce.  I couldn't finish mine and asked to have it boxed.  We kept waiting and finally I had to ask the waiter where my left-overs went.  He went to check and they had accidentally trashed them but before he came back to tell me, the kitchen had already started on making me a whole dinner to take home. I didn't ask and I would not have asked - they just did it.  That is good management and caring about your customers. In the past, my husband has enjoyed their various fishes and I have always enjoyed their veal. Sauces are good; pasta is always cooked perfectly.  My favorite of all time though they only do on special occasions like Christmas Eve or Mother's Day, and then only if they can get the proper ingredients, is the diver scallops and shrimp in a champagne sauce over linquini. It was chancy for me to try as I do not generally like scallops unless they are fried, but these had a great sear and were cooked to perfection.  Do by all means try this place - just don't get in my way - LOL.
