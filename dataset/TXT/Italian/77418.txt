cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA We visited Giordano's for the first time yesterday and had a great experience! Being from the Chicago area and having had their deep dish pizza on Michigan Avenue, this was just like being home. The service was excellent, pizza was cheesy and hefty and the atmosphere was perfect of a modern pizzeria. We will definitely be back for more!
