t5Ip9ggWaam6qAUH0WPKVg Once again.....there's a reason Oreganos always has a wait and NYPD....well not so much. Food was ok. We ordered 2 large pizzas, one Sicilian which was very good and one hand tossed which was dry, hard and burnt. The waitress was very good and attentive. Music in a restaurant is a nice touch, here it was on but couldn't hear it. The waitress did comp the bad pizza which was nice. NYPD just misses the mark. With some tweeks they could be good.
