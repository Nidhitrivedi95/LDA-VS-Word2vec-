hX3qKoTnpzxTGiPuO2YVTQ Waiter was nice and did a good job, thats were the goid ends.. Wine menu advertised $45 bottle of wine which is already robbery, but then explained that menus were "wrong", and meant price was actually almost 20% more than what thier menu stated.

Then i ordered calamari, and wad SUCH A PILE OF SHIT, i couldnt believe it, but what was really a kick in the pants was even after i sent it garbage back, i wS still charged full price and manager wouldnt do shit about it!!

Liked this place before, but will NEVER set foot in this fraudulant SHIT HOLE again!!!
