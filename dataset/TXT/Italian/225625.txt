So132GP_uy3XbGs0KNyzyw ok so first don't go here when I'm town making this place all crowded and stuff.. If you can agree to that then you can read the rest of my review. did a yelp search for a restaurant with live music found this gem.. Called ..hostess was super nice and helpful made our reservations and got us connected to the shuttle to come pick us up.. shuttle driver was very polite and took good care of us was friendly with out being overly intrusive or creepy.. restaurant was dimly lit and romantic.. live music was oldies soul my fave but also took requests and came around to the tables singing.. food was delicious as were the cocktails (thanks goodness for the free shuttle) my only gripe was the remodeling of the restroom that was in the works and the drunk that couldn't wait and walked in on my girl in the ladies room talking about he worked there or was regular or some bullshit and they share.. wish she would have told me before we left.. anyway.. the waiter was very fun and friendly great recommendations on food. this place is a grand slam!! as far restaurants go. We spent a pretty penny here but worth it in every way. not expensive or over priced but we did drink and feast and hey that's what you do in Vegas!
