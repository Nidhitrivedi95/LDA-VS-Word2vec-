JTBxVGHe_fPZkfBN_EkA1Q I agree with the last reviewer. It's a little gem. The menu is very reasonably priced. Entrees include soup or salad and bread. I had a chicken dish that was tender and covered with a creamy mushroom sauce. It was great. The house salad was full of nice greens. The bruschetta was a little underdone, though. I could have been warmer and crispy. They did a nice job decorating. It was a small dining room, but not cramped. I will go back for sure.
