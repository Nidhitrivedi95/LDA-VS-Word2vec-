djKTruHtS4n_vlfOknxjRw In the years since I've last been here, nothing has changed: and that's a good thing! As before, the pasta is still cooked to perfection and I can still order my favourite dishes from long ago. The black and white fettuccini is one of the best dishes at this restaurant, followed closely by the angel hair pasta with smoked salmon. One thing that does change are the specials, and they're excellent, ranging from shrimp and lobster pasta to beef tenderloin. 

The ambiance is classy without being pompous or requiring an elaborate dress code. It's intimate, relaxing, and the restaurant sticks to what it does best: pasta. And that's about it. Delicious, perfect pasta. The service has stayed as friendly and laid back as it ever was, which is nice at the end of a busy day!

I still highly recommend this place and hope that they continue to serve the neighbourhood for a long time to come!
