x7pcgbbZoqKndNEDIHZB8w Wanted to try this opening day, but didn't want to wait 90+ minutes. Finally tried a pie for dinner with family the next day and was glad I didn't queue up. For the price, the pies are small, poorly constructed, and light on toppings. I got a single, tasty bite with all the topping flavors represented. 

The food wasn't bad, but there are plenty of direct competitors nearby that do everything better.
