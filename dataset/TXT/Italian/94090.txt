When trying meatballs, I always try to figure out what's a restaurants "secret." It seems that the secret here is simplicity, which translates to perfection. 

With a small menu, one could be weary there is nothing they will like, but it is impossible not to love the sauce, the meatball, and the salad dressing.

The location is odd for first timers--it's technically in between the bank and the church. If you're nearby, be sure to grab a meatball sub!
