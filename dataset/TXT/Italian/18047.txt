2JYszoQKgJj6pPbaN7cLwQ Wonderful find!!  The service was spot on! He was fantastic.  You have to try the homemade pizza roll baked as soon as you order it! Delicious.  We ordered the chicken param and tortellini meal. There was nothing left in our plates.  One of the better Italian meals we have had in the cranberry as well as Pittsburgh area. We will surely be back soon!
