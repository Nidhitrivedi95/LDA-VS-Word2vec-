fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg 5 stars!!! Luv all their food. Since moving from La, I have missed good Asian food!! The udong and katsu bowl curry is my favorite. Their Korean style dishes does not taste Korean but it's still good. And compared to all the other Asian restaurants in town, this beats them!! Still trying out everything on their menu!! Very good!!! Luv this place!! A little over priced but you do get a lot of food!! And for dessert, you can go next door to the Snoh place!! Yummy!!
