fe8jmKzXtGvMVQDUvW0pGw Upon arriving, it was pretty steady so we had a small wait. The hostess was very friendly and even kept updating on our wait time. 
We got sat.
Our waitress walked over and the first thing out of her mouth was "need menus?" Um, well let me just guess what you have to eat here. Of course we need menus. She takes our order, two large pizzas, two orders of mozzarella sticks, cheese fries, wings and two chicken Alfredo's. Over $130 in food and drinks. One chicken alfredo came out with a hair in it, other was just bland and terribly tasting. We sent both back after one bite. Other food was tasty! Got our bills and to our surprise the pasta meals were still on there at 14.95 each. We asked the server to please speak to the manager about this incident and she came back promptly with the answer that he wasn't going to take it off or do anything about it. We finally decided to go to him face to face and turns out he's the owner and not just a manager. He finally took them off. We will never be back. This place is a bad business.
