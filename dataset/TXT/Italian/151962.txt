KqxJcRmPEdiUTXHwsZcOZw I never went to their original location but understand this is a terrific upgrade.  Great atmosphere inside and outside dining.  Service is great and food is very good....the price is right.

Only one problem....I like to bring my own wine and I pay corkage, no matter what it is up to $30...but Annie does not allow it.  Her wine list is very good but I like what I like and I make sure I have it when I bring it myself and don't have the stress of turning a bottle away.

Our waiter was prompt and courteous beyond just doing his job....we did tip him well but her didn't know that we would.

Garden dining looks wonderful too and will try that next time...maybe I can hide my wine and a glass in a big purse....no that would be stressful too.

May 12th...a month or so later:

It appears the owner/manager responds the same to all comments, good or bad....there is a terrible review on yelp and her response was not appropriate to the big complaint plus horrible picture of his dinner.  ALSO....the patio welcomes DOGS???? I DO NOT frequent restaurants with dogs or children...that is what Denny's is for...FF drivethru's until children a trained...and over 10 years old and dogs...only legitimate SERVICE dogs please...not fuu fuu emotional support yippers and lickers.
