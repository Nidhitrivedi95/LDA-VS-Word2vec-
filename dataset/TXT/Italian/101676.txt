fDkQcos3MqqCYGWfl64iiA A group of 8 went out to dinner and almost ordered the whole menu. Many of the apps were way over priced for the portion. $18 dollars for 2 Artichokes REALLY!! I don't care if you flew around the world and back again that cant be justified. I very surprised their aren't more Italians out there yelling WHERES THE FOOD. Taste on some thing was ok considering pricing. The only thing that was exceptional was the duck confit. It was very well portioned and perfectly cooked. Unfortunately it was my buddies dish but was kind enough for me to try. Service was pretty bad. She was too busy and couldn't handle her section.
