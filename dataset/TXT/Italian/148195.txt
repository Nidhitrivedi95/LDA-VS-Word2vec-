KDF3qxIYv1OkqtSUl4PwGQ I wish the scale went to seven. This is my favorite restaurant worldwide. 
The food, music, atmosphere and service were firing on all eight. 

The fruit soup was amazing, like a healthy fruit gazpacho. 
The octopus appetizer almost had me out of body. 

Try the spicy spaghetti lobster was like nothing I've ever had, but have been looking for my whole life. 

I drink a lot of espresso all over the place but this was the best I've ever tasted. 

Service was perfect. Great crowd, cool lights and bar

Very busy, even late at night. Call ahead. 

If in Montreal, go there!
