Ih0f0UyhFufm3C7kR72DSQ This is basically a way to impress a date. Its only good for happy hour besides that. I had the Salmon, which was very good, small portion and close to 30$. Really?! I have no complaints on the service, it better be good for these prices. Im definitely not cheap, but I know high prices for no apparent reason when I see them. Ill definitely be back, probably complaining in my updated review also, so don't not go because of this one review. Theres 100+ others to give you a better sense of what to think of this place. 

Other positives, they have a lot on the menu and ok beer selection, great wine list also. I suggest try it out for happy hour and make your decision, unless you're looking to impress a date like I said.
