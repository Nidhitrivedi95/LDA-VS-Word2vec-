sbm0jmhWui8YrvFgxnJ4kQ I give Glass Nickel five stars easily, but only one star to their Sun Prairie location. One of their Glass Nickel pizza driver nearly side swiped our vehicle, honked and flipped us off. All this being about three blocks from the restaurant. He then drove into the parking lane passing us and the van in front of us. The van had to hit his brakes and the Glass Nickel pizza driver nearly hit a parked vehicle. We followed him and parked to report the dangerous driver. I went in and learned as he got out of his vehicle, he yelled at my boyfriend to learn how to drive and F off. The manager inside ensured us that he'd talk to the driver. About a week later we ordered Glass Nickel since we had received a coupon in our email. They didn't apply it, when we called to tell them they said we can use the coupon on our order. This was a coupon that can be used multiple times. They didn't apologize or seem to care. There are other local pizza places in Sun Prairie that will give you great pizza and great service.
