UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ I ate here on July 14. I had been wanting to try this place out forever. It took about 10 mins to seat us which was fine. It was just my son and I. My service was horrible through the entire meal. I'm surprised my server even showed up most of the time. My son ordered a cheeseburger that was charred and the bun was stale and crispy. I ordered a Caesar salad and the lobster with shrimp risotto. My salad never showed up and my risotto was still hard. The lobster was cooked perfectly. I will also add that my peach sangria was wonderful. Our deserts were pretty tasty. Overall I wouldn't go back.
