Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A 1st time trying this buffet and I'm not really much of a fan for buffets but it was good. Def worth a revisit and mainly because of the unlimited Krab leg. Some of the other dishes were good. Some weren't. But I tried a little bit of everything and for 22.99 a person I'll say it was worth every dollar.
