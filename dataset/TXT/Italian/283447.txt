z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ Top notch!!! Make your reservation and make them early! Andiamo's is small, quaint, and classy. Marco was our server and I'd request him again. We had a group of 10 people and everyone walked away full and talking about how wonderful everything was. 

Appetizers we ordered: oysters on the half shell (we ordered a 2nd bc everyone loved them), Calamari (good - I liked the sauces), Banana Peppers and Sausage (very spicy but one of our favorites), Lobster Bisque (delicious), and the Caesar Salad was tossed table side (big portion - def shareable!).

Most of us got the filet or surf and turf - everyone said they would get it again! Let me tell you - the ZIP sauce is a must!!! Don't skip that as it is amazing on their steaks! 

Favorite sides- white truffle whipped potatoes - amazing! Asparagus- ok, & the lobster black Truffle baked ziti was very good! 

Desserts: limoncello Tiramisu (amazing!), normal tiramisu (I'm just not a fan of tiramisu but everyone else loved it), creek brûlée (normally my favorite and it's good here - but I'd stick to the limoncello tiramisu) , kit kat (another great choice!). 

Excellent service and phenomenal food - as I said make your reservation NOW!
