0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q We visited this restaurant a year ago and gave it 5 stars.  Recommended it to so many people. So we were looking forward to another spectacular evening. Unfortunately, something has slipped there.  We once again shared a black truffle risotto and white truffle tagliatelle "tasting" ($69). it was spectacular, as we had remembered.  And our antipasti was wonderful again.  But the entrees were disappointing.  I had the dover sole, finished table side.  It was very dry, and boring. My husband's pork was uneventful.  We since found out that the GM who was there a year ago is no longer there.  So maybe that has something to do with it?  The wines were very good, however, recommended by the sommelier.  Next time, we'll most likely try another Italian restaurant.
