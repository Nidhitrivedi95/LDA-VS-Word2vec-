SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog I'm periodically  in town for work. This year I happen to be in town on father's day. My family in California  was not able to join me so I was hesitant to go out to eat but I did so anyways. I'm Italian and usually requent Italian  style restaurants, the hotel I stayed at suggested Rigatonis  in tempe. I had been here before and it was good. I went to the bar and thought I'd have a quiet and quick meal to avoid looking out of place. I was amazed on how welcoming and at home I felt by the bartenders. Chris and Trisha were a pleasure to talk to and sold me on the special. Chris asked about my work and made light conversation. I thought this was just an act he does for every guest, but then some regulars, I'm assuming, came in and sat next to me. He talked to them like he's known them for years. He introduced me to them and we started talking. I was there for 2 hours, but it seemed like 30 min. All this and they were very busy. You don't get service like this anymore. Great job. I don't usually write reviews on restaurants, if I like it I go back, if I don't like it, I won't go back. I will be back. 
FOOD: 7/10
SERVICE:10/10.
