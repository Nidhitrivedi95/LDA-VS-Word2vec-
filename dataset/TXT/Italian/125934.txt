HrR_2-HUE6cqnoz1zMN9AQ Very disappointed. So looking forward to trying a new pizzeria w/in close proximity to our home. This was a takeout order. Ordered online and picked up at designated time. Live less than 2 miles away but pizza was cold when we arrived home.
Our order:
Margarita pizza- liked the thin crust, flavor was emerging but very little cheese ( sliced extremely thin) and very few basil leaves (thank goodness I had a herb garden and could add my own basil)

Cheese and mushroom pizza- good amount of mushrooms again very little cheese

Fior di latte- cheese and balsimac glaze ok tomatoes were not ripe and not flavorful. 1 small basil leaf for the whole dish- needs more basil
