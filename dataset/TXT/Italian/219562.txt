Haven't tried the food, but sitting at the bar perusing the history lesson-cum-cocktail list, a tear almost came to my eye. If I were to open a bar, certainly this is the way I'd do it (oh wait, I did open a bar once, and we almost did it right--H&R do it better). 

From classic to creative, H&R mixes with finesse. I'm a fan, and how. Oh, and the drinks cost easily half what they'd be on the Strip.
