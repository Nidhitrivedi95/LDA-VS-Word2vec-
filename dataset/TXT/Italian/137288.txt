I live in New York City and my parents took me here because I loved the pizza they ordered last week, and I was so impressed with our dishes at the restaurant. I had the scallops special which were cooked perfectly and the presentation was beautiful. This is a place to take out-of-towners and pizza snobs. A great addition to the neighborhood!
