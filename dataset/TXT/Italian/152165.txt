kR4NBNFf5SLpeAtZ-uPoPg What a cute little neighborhood place!

I had heard about this place but it is tucked into a strip mall that I zoom by too often, so I was beginning to believe the place was just an urban legend.

But it is real!

I had to laugh at the two tastes only sign. With so many flavors to try I could see myself asking for a little taste of each before selecting just two.

We were there early on a Saturday evening, and the place was packed. But there is enough seating and people moved in and out fairly quickly since it is gelato. But they do serve sandwiches too, I just don't see why with all that gelato!
