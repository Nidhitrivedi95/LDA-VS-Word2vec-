0s1DqJlSSgR1Ftg9Q_HEOg Stopped in to grab a bite with the family before a movie. I had had lunch here before but it was the families first time. I give it up to Enzo who does everything himself. First was garlic knots which were great crisp and perfect amount of butter and garlic. The pizza is so good perfect crispy ness on the crust and the sauce has such good flavor! The chicken fingers were not too sauces and nice crisp. This is our go to pizza place for this area!
