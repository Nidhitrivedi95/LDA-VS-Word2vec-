NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ Unless you have money to burn on "just ok" food, skip this restaurant.  I ordered the chicken Marsala that came with no pasta.  I asked for a side of pasta and they brought a minuscule plate of spaghetti.  The chicken Marsala was $38.  The minuscule plate of spaghetti was $12!!!!  TWELVE dollars!  Enough said.
