My friend and I went at 645 and it was busy but we barely had to wait 10 minutes and they suggested that we stop in at the turf for a drunk first(the bar next door). It was nice in there but a lot of green lighting, which doesn't really make anyone look good. We got our table and sat outside. The service was quick but not very careful. At first when our pizza came out, there were no plates, napkins or the toppings they are supposed to bring  with it. We asked for those things and the napkins didn't show up until we were almost finished.

The pizza was delicious, we got the one that starts with an a, I don't recall the exact name. I would defiantly eat here again. 

One other thing was we both ordered a glass of the White House wine and it tasted like what I imagine pee tastes like. It was pretty gross, I'd suggest you splurge a little and go for a more expensive wine, you will probably have better luck.
