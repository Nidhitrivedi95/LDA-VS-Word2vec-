WNnkyVvBfY1vTqiqSufZQA Pretty good place for dinner with the girls! We were 6 people and some of us wanted drinks some wanted dinner. We had a reservation for Saturday night last week of December and they sat us right away. 

The ambiance and decor in this place is flawless. They have this incredible wine room with an acrobat in it. The tables aren't crowded and there's plenty is room to move around. Music is great, not too loud and obnoxious and everything about the atmosphere was fantastic.

Our server was full of charm for us. He was super sweet and helpful but he didn't write down our orders and a couple times made us repeat it to him. He didn't come back to check on us after drinks or dinner but the food and drinks came very quickly which was a plus. I understand the other reviews about the not great service. He was super friendly but not so attentive. 

I'm torn about how to review the food. I don't have a taste for fine food so keep that in mind. I love love very easy simple Italian food and found the food to be good just not spectacular. I got the Arancini and margharita Pizza. The Arancini was very good and all the portions were huge. The pizza was really so-so. It got very soggy very fast and was a little chewy. Some of the other things we ordered were the veggie calzone, some salads and gnocchi. Everyone said the food was good but we didn't rave, and truly the portions were quite big. The dessert was a little dissapointing, the gelato was freezer burned and the coffee too bitter. 

All in all a great place to meet for drinks with friends and fantastic atmosphere but slightly lackluster food.
