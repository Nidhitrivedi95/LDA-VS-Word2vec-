I8QpDTJUZ6Mk5IQuQSG2pA Let me start by saying, SAVE YOUR MONEY! We ordered the garlic chicken calzone and have never been more disappointed. I'm not really a picky eater and it's rare that I complain about food but this was disgusting. This is an Italian restaurant so you'd think they would have at least the dough down, WRONG. This was a disgusting excuse for a calzone. Soggy dough, zip loc Oscar Meyer pepperoni, Ragu Alfredo sauce over loaded with garlic. I've never seen a more sad calzone. I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone I know. It sucks because it's so close to our house (within walking distance) but we will never return. This dinner made my boyfriend and I sick for two days. Thank you Streets of New York for living up to your standard, we thought you'd prove us wrong.
