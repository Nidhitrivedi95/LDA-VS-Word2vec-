EGIJ7sfXa5ha89fBxJsTuQ such a throwback... imagine if all the chain pseudo cafes were like caffe italia. then there would be no long waits for the the skim - soy milk, iced macchiato, frappucino drinkers,... and hopefully no devices and WiFi,... just great simple "hot" coffees and conversations. one can dream.

aside from the amazing drinks and the personable barista, they also make killer sandwiches. its such a throwback that they even sell hygienic products, that's super old school,... and we wished there were more of them still around.
