yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Cool spot to visit while in Vegas. It is a much cooler bucca di beppo. Meals run about $25/person and comes with house wine. Friendly service. Very dark inside. The area itself is kinda shady but nothing a yelper can't handle. 

I enjoyed my meal. Cheese ravioli with white sauce was easy to handle and not too heavy for the night of drinking that followed. Also, you may need to wait a bit for your table. While you're waiting go next door to the Stage Door Casino where it is cash only at the bar and the drinks are dirt cheap. 

Have a great time!
