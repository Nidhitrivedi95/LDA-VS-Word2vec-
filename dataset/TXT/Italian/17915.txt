2I7QtHJI-izdThjghMaT1g Came here with my best friend and his parents for a celebratory dinner.  It's situated back from the road, in a little plaza, so be attentive!  I passed it up the first time I drove by.

The service was just alright, the waitress didn't seem that interested in serving us, but it was also around 7 pm on a weeknight.  Overall, she did an okay job.  She wasn't unfriendly, but it wasn't an over-the-top experience, either.  Didn't make or break our visit.

The dipping oil for the bread was amazing, apparently they are somewhat famous for it.  I could have been happy eating bread alone that night.  The Goat Cheese Trio appetizer was really good (an eggplant dish), and the Caprese salad was pretty standard -- it's hard to go wrong with that one, although the mozzarella and tomatoes were just a little wet.  I think I was the only one completely happy with my entree -- the shrimp and artichoke cappelini.  Both my best friend and his mom had to ask for extra sauce, and my friend's dad's lobster ravioli actually came with a lot more sauce than he preferred.  

The dessert was the best part, probably.  I couldn't decide between the creme brulee or the peach gelato, so our server let me have both on the same plate (although I didn't end up paying, so I'm not really sure if she charged us for one dessert or two).  They were both pretty delicious, but if you have to pick one, go for the creme brulee.  I have yet to find a gelato here in Cleveland that tastes like gelato and not ice cream.

I'd probably go back if invited, but stick to what I've already ordered.
