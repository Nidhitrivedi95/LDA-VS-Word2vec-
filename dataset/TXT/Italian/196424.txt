pOEL97ld-FJMKO8Ki8JmYg This is my first time at Oliver and Bonacini Cafe Grill. It's located at Bayview Village. I decided to give this a try because of Winterlicious 2017 menu was priced reasonably at $28 and that free parking is always great!

When we first got there it seemed like it was very busy for a Wednesday night. The restaurant was packed and we heard that for others for a party of 2 without reservations was a 45 minute wait. Since we made reservations we were seated immediately. 

We took our time with the menu and finally ordered. Our food actually came instantly. I think because they were shelling out the same 3 apps, same 3 mains, and same 3 desserts. We literally ordered and then the food showed up almost instantly. I ordered the seafood chowder. It was good.

I then ordered the braised beef gnocchi. It was my first time having gnocchi and it was wonderful! The braised beef was a little dry. I suspect that it was made and sitting under the lamp for a little bit because my plate was very hot when it got there. 

I finished with a chocolate torte. It was also delicious, but it was a tad hard. Overall the meal was great, but the portions were a bit small. I was not full when I finished my meal. Neither was my friend whom I ate with. 

Also on Wednesdays is half priced bottle wine, but we didn't end up ordering. It was $40 for a Jacob's Creek Moscato White Wine. It costs $12.95 at the LCBO and even with half price it was still 40% more than retail cost so certainly not worth it. 

For $28 dollars it was really worth it, but the portions could be a little bigger or they could add some extra gnocchi pasta to fill you up. There was probably 6-8 pieces of pasta only and the rest was veggies. I would only come here for Winter or Summerlicious. Their regular menu is not really worth the cost.
