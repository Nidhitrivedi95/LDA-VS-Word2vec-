aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw Beautiful setting, ambience, friendly and professional service - and most importantly, incredible food. We did the chef's tasting menu which included a TON of food over several courses. The gnocchi was melt in your mouth outstanding, the ravioli was delicious, the penne was delicious, the fish was so fresh, the tuna tartare melted in your mouth, and the octopus with potatoes was AMAZING! Their gelato at the end was divine as well as the other dessert options that accompanied it. Just a really memorable dining experience with terrific food that makes you savor every bite. **side note: be sure your party is all wearing "appropriate attire" - men must be wearing long pants and close toed shoes, FYI! One of our party members unfortunately had to run back to the room and change. They should definitely be more explicit and clear about their dress requirements, but other than that little hiccup it was a great experience.
