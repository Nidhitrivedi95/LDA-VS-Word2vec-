If you like saving money definitely park in the parking garage in back, it's only $1 with validation instead of the $5 valet parking in front.  

They have a nice selection of Arizona beers.  

For pizza we got two- the margherita and the 2nd pizza had 1/2 Biancoverde and 1/2 Wiseguy.  The pizza was fantastic, thin crust, cooked perfectly.  The margherita was very simple but tasty, the marina sauce was delicate and a tiny bit acidic and blended great with mozzarella.  

The Wiseguy had a thick layer of wood roasted onion that enhanced the fennel sausage.  The biancoverde was almost too salty but the arugula on top was a nice counter point.  

We had leftovers to take home, I think the perfect amount would be 1 pizza and an appetizer for 2 people.  

We had rice pudding for dessert, creamy and delicious.

Prices are not cheap ($18 for a pizza) but worth checking out.
