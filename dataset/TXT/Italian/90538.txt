eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA My family and I were celebrating my mother in laws birthday, when a pigeon that had gotten into the restaurant pooped on my sister in law!  It did it twice; the first time we thought someone had flipped sauce on her, and three of us helped her get it out of her hair.  The second time, we looked around and noticed the bird above her head.  The staff was disgustingly unprofessional, insulted us with a 20 dollar gift card after we spent 500 dollars on food (that's not even enough to go back and have the meal paid for!!), the waiters and waitresses laughed, told other guests, swore, and mocked our family.  Your staff implying that a filthy disease ridden animal defecating on guests near the kitchen of your restaurant is out of the company's policy to make things right makes me shudder to think what else you would not help on.  I've had better customer service in every single other restaurant I've ever attended.  To make matters worse, when posting complaints on your Facebook wall, after talking to my sister in law who ever manages that account LIED and said she was fine with how things were handled!  Your customer service is disgusting and as we now see on more than just your one restaurants standard.  We are a family of 20 adults with in laws, 30 grandchildren and have been established in Las Vegas.  Your lack of class and neglegance has lost all of our business and all of extended family and friends business.
