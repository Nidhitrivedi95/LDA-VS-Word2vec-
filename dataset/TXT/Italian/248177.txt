VeRHiEbUe_vHprYn8mnezA I decided to pick Franco's for my birthday dinner on October, 30th, 2014.   All I can say is that they went above and beyond my expectations!  There were two tables of about 8 each and they handled both without a problem.  The waiters were amazing and very patient.  They explained any questions we had about the menu very thoroughly and always had a smile on their face.  The food was excellent. I highly recommend the lasagna!  Everyone loved what they ordered.  But the best part of the night is when they dimmed the lights, brought out 3 desserts on a plate  and sang happy birthday!  Franco's hit it on the nose.  Excellent service, quality food, and great atmosphere!  We will be back!  Thanks for making my birthday special!
