D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA Food was mediocre. The prices did not justify the portion size. They need to make their portions bigger or lower their prices. I would not go back. We ordered the Margherita pizza and the Bolognese pasta. I thought the size of the pizza was a joke. It's enough for an appetizer. The pasta was a small potion as well & it was ok. We then ordered the pepperoni pizza because we were still hungry. The service was excellent. Very nice & friendly staff.
