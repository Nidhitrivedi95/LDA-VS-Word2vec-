RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q What a lucky find! We stopped in for supper on Friday night. It didn't look like anything special from the outside, but don't let that fool you! 

We had a salami and mushroom calzone, which was amazing! It was just the right ratio of crust to filling, made with quality ingredients, and perfectly cooked! One of those meals that, even though you're super full, you're still sad when you take your last bite!

The staff was very friendly and took wonderful care of us! I would definitely return if I'm ever in the area again!!
