Mi5uhdFB9OJteXPd0_IKfw I'm part Italian...so as much as I love it I am really picky. Maccaronni Grill is Blah, Olive Garden is ok, but Carrabbas is MMM MMm GooD! I went with my friend Matt for the first time and he introduced me to some of the best Italian around my area. I got a glass of Cab. We ordered the Sampler, everything was good, but mostly I ate the calamari. I am mostly into Calamari steaks strips or rings...i don't like the tentacles. Their's I made an exception. The bread they bring out is also very fresh, right out of the oven hot. Salad came with the means and I got the Italian. I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side, but it was really light. Most places put too much dressing. Then we got our meals...CHicken Marsala was amazing. I was already full before the main course came out. If I ate anymore I was going to have to unbutton my jeans. I got a to-go container. Matt orders tiramisu, took one bite and died and went to heaven. Wish I could have ate it, but again I would have had to unbutton my pants. Caution: eating here can lead to happiness and extreme feelings of fullness. I recommend just taking the main course home and going strait to dessert :)  Oh btw only open for dinner.
