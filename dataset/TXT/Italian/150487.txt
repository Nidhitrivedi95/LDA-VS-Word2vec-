Kl3mlPM1YeGQjcekJ1vZiw I was there for a birthday party on February 21st and it was a great time. 
You have to BYOW (Bring Your Own Wine). 

Because we were a large group we had a semi-fixed menu. 3 appetizers and a choice from three main meal options. There was also dessert and coffee included as well.

The food was *amazing* and it started with the warm bread at the beginning. The appetizers we had were fantastic: Sausages, pizza, and a quality cold cut variety plate. We had already eaten a full meal just from the appetizers! My Husband & I both chose the veal with mushroom sauce and that came with delicious pasta on the side. Unfortunately, I don't know what the dessert was, but it was very good!

My neighbor chose the pasta duo meal choice and I heard it was 'bland'. The duo was penne with tomato sauce/cannelloni with cheese.

Everything was SUPER fresh and I would definitely love to go back! 
100% Return-worthy!
