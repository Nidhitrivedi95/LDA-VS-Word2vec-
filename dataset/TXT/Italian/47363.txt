8xyRFdmF_9boBaPx0jBhHQ I'm hanging my head in shame as I open this review with full disclosure...I've lived in the Valley all my life which, so far, has been about, oh, let's say forty-eleven years. I've been aware of Red Devil since the 70's, but I've always lived on the west side and had never visited before. Making plans with my Bestie, I decided this would be the day. We were going to a movie in Scottsdale anyway; let's have lunch at the original McDowell location....except the website sez they don't open until 3:00 on Sundays. Drats! Backup plan: visit the one on Bell Road!

Greeted and seated without delay in a friendly fashion. Major props to Amber for excellent service throughout.

The bruschetta appetizer was huge. I expected, perhaps, 4 thin slices; this order was the size of Cleveland! Fresh tomatoes, fresh garlic, fat bread - deliciously presented.

I would not have guessed that the soup of the day at an Italian joint might be clam chowder. Let that be a lesson to me, and yes, it was mighty tasty.

B's order was pasta with white clam sauce. It comes with about 475 clams and just as much garlic as you care to request. Manna from heaven.

I had seafood marinara with linguine. The sauce was perfect - not too thin or thick. Several Olympic-sized shrimp, and scallops one could shoot hoops with. My parting comment about the clams above? Oh, yeah, this, too.

Enormous portions. We didn't finish anything and took all of the rest to go. In order to pay penance for all those years I neglected to visit (and because I live 60 miles away and have no idea when I'll be back), we ordered a pizza to take with us. Everything else is delicious; how would you expect the pizza to be? Thaaaat's right...
