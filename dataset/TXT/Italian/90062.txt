e8kK01COAK614-RuKlXHug Outside seating is very noisy. Had to shout to have a conversation. Appetizers were really good. I liked the chili cheese fries more than the cheesy bread, but that's my opinion. I had a panini with the classic meatballs. I enjoyed this, but the marinara that came with it was awful. Easily the worst marinara I've ever had in my life. My family didn't enjoy it as much as I did. I'll hopefully be back.
