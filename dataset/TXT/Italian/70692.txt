c-l4nDPZcEwapEiV-Xf08w Had a wonderful date night here just a couple of weeks ago. It had been years since I've been there but only because I'm rarely in the area. The special that night was swordfish on a bed of creamy cheesy risotto with a sauce over the top that was buttery and delicious. 

I can't forget the falafel appetizer. I've been to many restaurants and eaten falafel. This was the best. Most and flavorful. Each bite melted in your mouth. 

The server recommended the red blend house wine as the most popular. I recommend it now too!
