T7yKffTuhiIZclsgjfgowA We were at Via Mercanti on Augusta last night.

for what they are worth, I offer a couple of comments.

1. I have to scold you (severely) on your wine markup. How in goodness name can you take Cavallina (LCBO $7.60) to $36 a bottle? That's a 4.4x markup. That's just ridiculous and leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.

1a. by contrast, your beer pricing was fairly reasonable I thought and your selection quite interesting. Keep that side of things up.

2. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their pizza (or didn't comment) but I found the crust on mine (Quattro Formagi) overly thick and chewy. Not at all as I remember a good pizza in Italy.
