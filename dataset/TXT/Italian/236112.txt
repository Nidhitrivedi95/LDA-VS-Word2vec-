Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA One of my favorite places in town and it's walking distance from my apartment, which is a huge plus. 
Food and service is consistently on point. I had always come for the pizza but recently ventured out and tried their salads and sandwiches. Crazy, I know. Everything I have tried was delicious. Never a complaint, and never wished I had ordered something else instead.
They make their own wine coolers which are fun and tasty (and quite a bit stronger than the B&J crap you get at the grocery store.
Its just a fun, hip restaurant with friendly staff and laid back atmosphere and I look forward to every visit here.
In fact I have reservations for 10 for my birthday tonight!
