WX8cx6tfFcEn0cK4cIbWag Had a really good experience dining here! My family and I wanted to sit outside to watch the performances and the seating provided was perfect for that. It was interesting how the complimentary bread came in cans and the breadsticks were simple and tasty. We ordered calamari and bruschetta. The calamari was really good, the bruschetta was alright. It wasn't quite what we had expected but was flavorful. For our main dishes, we ordered prosciutto pizza and shrimp penne pasta. Both were delicious and nicely made. The dishes weren't too heavy and it was quite enjoyable dining here along with the entertainment so close-by.
