ARWLV46iIa3Dvt1y8-SPpA Super small place and make sure to bring cash. The food was decent and I wasn't too impressed. The meatballs were grainy and filled with too much bread. The owner sat at the table next to me. He thought that shouting expletives with his friends and drinking a little too much vino was a good idea. I definitely won't be back. In the end if you want to drop $80 for 4 people and mediocre Italian food then you've found the right place.
