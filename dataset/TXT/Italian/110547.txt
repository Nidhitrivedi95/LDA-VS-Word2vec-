No explanations and never saw the waitress Stephanie for over 30 minutes.  Finally, received an insincere apology from the waitress after asking for the assistant manager, Greisy, who also did not show any genuine concern that they set us back 2 hours waiting for some scrambled eggs and a waffle.  The treatment from the staff was simply rude and dismissive.  When the food finally arrived, it appeared thrown together, there was another delay in getting salt and pepper (?), and the meal was mediocre at best.  Dined at numerous high end restaurants on the Strip and this is hands down the most unprofessional and unpleasant dining experience of the bunch.  Skip this place, plenty of other great options to enjoy weekend brunch.  Zero stars.
