G099MT9cwtwgdsR71JLp6w This place is perhaps the best restaurant for its price in Madison.  I love coming here for lunch, the prices are very reasonable and everything is always really, really good.  For Dinner, this place is great for a party or just for a date.  The portions are light, but the price reflects this.  The smaller portions make sharing fun and it is always fun to check out the daily specials (usually there are at least 5)  

One of the reasons their specials are always changing is because they buy fresh produce from local farms like Harmony Valley and local organic meat producers.

The Chef, Francesco has come by my table on multiple occasions to offer daily specials and make sure everything is up my standards (which are high)  I hear he is from Italy, which makes sense because the food is so good.  I love their home-made bread!
