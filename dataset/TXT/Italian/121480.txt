hBRJ2WMUlEloi3yaSMscpg We've been to this Prezzo a few times and while there's no denying that it's a chain restaurant along the same lines as Pizza Express, Zizzis etc. there are a couple of highlights which keep us coming back for more.

The food is fairly standard, with a good selection of pizza and pasta dishes, and a nice specials menus to keep things interesting. There's also the reliability that comes from a big chain; we've never had a bad meal here.

The location is the real bonus; grab a seat by the side window if you can and you'll be rewarded with great views of North Bridge and Carlton Hill.

A couple of comments mentioned slow service but we've never had a problem. In fact on our last visit we watched one waitress deal with an incredibly difficult customer with the grace of a saint, but there does seem to be quite high staff turnover which could explain the difference in experiences.

Overall, I don't think Prezzo is ever going to blow someone away but it's a solid pick, with decent food at reasonable prices.
