You can see them working on your pasta, cutting fresh prosciutto and they have all this freshly baked bread on display (make sure you buy a loaf to go- We did it and had some pesto mozzarella sandwiches at home... Delicious!).

The food's really good and I believe it's priced accordingly to its quality. We were there for brunch on Sunday and everyone enjoyed their meal. We were a big group also so we got to try all kinds of different food but their pizza seems to be the queen (or at least for our table it was!).

Make sure you bring some cash to tip the valet parking guys. There's no parking on the street but their valet parking's free (you just tip and that's it). I'm not a fan of valet parking myself but I understand some people like the convenience/feeling spoiled by having someone else bring your car for you to the door, specially when eating at a nice place like this.

It's a cute place for a date or an anniversary or just because. The food's delicious so just go anytime!
