aYjZc-3aVbPIPaJgGiUK_A Ate here for the first time, after having heard great reviews for years. Had the martini (amazing), the salad with the pork cheek (fantastic), the lamb paparradelle (great), and the rabbit plate (good). Also some dessert but it's hazy because of the wine. A little pricey, and the ambiance is kinda meh, but the food and service was great.
