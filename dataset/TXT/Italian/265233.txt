wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw The food is definitely a 5 for me.  I adore their bruschetta and pub board. But the service is a 2 for me.  Man alive this last visit a few days ago was ROUGH.  Hardly any refills, terrible customer service and it took forever to be brought our checks and even longer for our to go boxes. I adore the food so much, so I'll be back but hope for less arrogant service next time!
