This place looked interesting- Japanese and Italian fusion- so we wanted to try it out. Following Yelp recommendation, we got the grilled calamari in butter and garlic sauce. The two of us couldn't finish this dish - we probably are like 3 pieces. The sauce didn't have much flavor- it tasted like just butter and garlic. The calamari was very chewy and didn't taste fresh. For the main courses, we got the Uni pasta in creamy tomato sauce and beef hamburger. The uni pasta was good- the pasta was cooked just right, the sauce was creamy with chunks of Uni. It was a bit too creamy for my taste. Once again, we didn't finish this dish. The beef hamburger was pretty good. My boyfriend liked it a lot.
