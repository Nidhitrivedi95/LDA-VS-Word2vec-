fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg It is not often I am a visitor to Phoenix. I do come here for work often and recently I was stuck here for two weeks. So I once again invoked the yelp gods and discovered this little gem.
Now you would not expect a good Japanese place way out here in Phoenix but here it is.  The decor is friendly, the menu - short and simple.  The cooks....not Japanese. But the food is somehow still very authentic and delicious!
I had the curry beef which was pretty delicious.  The hint of cumin, the soothing miso base and those delicious soft yet just chewy enough udon noodles.  I also had to try their supposed banana bread.  Let me tell you, this place would get only 4 stars from me but one bite of the banana bread elevated cherry blossom to 5 star!  It isn't as good as my wife's but holy cow it comes close!
So next time you are in Phoenix and slowly melting under the laser beam focus of the sun, shelter yourself under the friendly atmosphere of this noodle heaven.  You will be glad you did.
