aJU9eRgtY6wH-5m7a6ZeEA Had dinner with my friends here this evening. I chose this place because it was central to where we all worked and conveniently located along our routes home.  I was more inclined to try because of the reviews... and it was definitely worth it! :)

Great service and really good food. I had the shrimp risotto which was probably the best I've ever had.  And the creme brulee was just right.  It wasn't too sweet.  Some places over do it and make it to sweet.

The restaurant is quaint and cozy.  Lots of parking in the plaza too. 

Definitely going to come back :)
