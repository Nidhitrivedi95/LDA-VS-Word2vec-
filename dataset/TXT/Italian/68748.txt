BsvCTCVG7lrzXZ68VyyIcg I guess I am in the minority on this one but Lago was just alright. This was perhaps the first time as a Yelper that I really couldn't decide on a star rating. After mulling it over, 3 stars seems right, it was just "OK".

To start we ordered some cheeses and a couple selections of salumi, which were both average. I would suggest they add a sweet spread of some sort to cheese plates such as a chutney, jam or honey as this helps to round out the salty flavors of the cheese. We ordered the Caesar and chopped salads and both were your run of the mill salads, nothing extraordinary. I was really hoping the main entrees would make up for the average start but sadly that left me wanting more. The star of the meal was definitely the lobster gnocchi with its pillowy gnocchi and chunks of lobster in a cream sauce. The service was very good however a little slow which was odd considering there weren't more than 5 other tables of diners. But as with all new restaurants, these growing pains with get ironed out hopefully sooner than later. For dessert, I chose the coconut macaroon and was really let down, it was really hard (stale maybe?) and after having just one bite decided that was enough. And I NEVER eat just one bite of dessert! Would I go back? Maybe for a glass of wine and appetizer but not for a full meal.
