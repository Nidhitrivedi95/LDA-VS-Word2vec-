VX6DcQETQbuPbTC4hUoREg First and probably only visit. There were only 2 other customers when I arrived at 4 pm. The salad and Italian bread came out quickly. The bread was delicious and the salad was tasty though unremarkable. The meat ravioli was warm, not hot. The meat sauce was also warm, not hot, and it was very bitter with way too much meat, more like a ragu than a sauce. The waitress never returned to my table after delivering the food. I had to ask the hostess to find her 20 minutes after I finished eating just so I could get my check. She said she got sidetracked. I left a 10 percent tip, which was generous all things considered. It wasn't an awful experience, just completely underwhelming when there are tons of restaurants from which to choose. Oh, and it's also tchotchke heaven--I could hear Gorden Ramsey saying "bloody hell" in response to the decor.
