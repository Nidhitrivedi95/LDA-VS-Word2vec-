2LOTz08OPRyA0ibJImJRbQ Great food, excellent service, nice decor. I went with my entire family (Step mom, dad, sister, brother, brother in law), and they are incredibly critical restaurant eaters, but luckily for me generous and polite to wait staff so regardless of how they felt, I was quite pleased with the meal.

I wanted a variety of things, so I shared a lobster pasta with my brother that was definitely one of the better lobster pastas I've had. That whet my appetite for the next course which was a cold octopus salad...DELICIOUS. I've only had octopus salad a few times but this was definitely the tastiest and most generous portion I've had.

At this point I was getting full but I still ate my carpaccio which was very good. I tasted my brother's sous-vide crispy pork shoulder...if you like your pork and are hungry this is the dish for you. My sister had Swordfish that was cooked so it was raw in the middle so it almost was like eating seared tuna. 

I had a double espresso as well and my brother liked it so much he drank 2. The waitress was friendly and patient and let us try different wines before ordering. It was a little loud but had a friendly atmosphere.
