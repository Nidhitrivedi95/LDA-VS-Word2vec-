WPV0ucYjnb2HOrNxSopv6A I went in late last night, around 10:30pm on a search for my style pizza. I am happy to say I was not disappointed with my choice. Large pepperoni pizza, garlic knots, mozzarella sticks, and tiramisu. Everything was hot and fresh and really good. Except the tiramisu, it was out of this world ! It was absolutely the best I have ever had. Ever. I will be returning. Garlic knots swimming in butter and chunks of garlic, great pizza prices and heavenly tiramisu; so happy to have found you Hawthornes!
