GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA I keeping thinking that the most memorable part of this meal is that the service was nice. The staff was knowledgable about their product.

I only wish that the food matched the service. I was surprisingly disappointed... After the second pasta dish, we called the night short, opting not to order the main entree or dessert.

Roasted Kabocha Squash-- had a roasted pumpkin seed pesto, burrata, and some frisée on top. Burrata was milky with a tough skin. Squash and pesto did not mesh well. 

Garganelli-- pasta was perfect al dente and fresh. The mushroom medly was well seasoned. Could not taste the fancy butter/butter sauce. Missing the wow factor.

Goat Cheese Tortellini-- rich. I thought it should have some more acid/citrus to balance out the dish.

And then we quit. No main entree.

Don't recommend.
