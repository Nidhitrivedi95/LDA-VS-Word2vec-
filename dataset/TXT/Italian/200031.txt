pt4YdbpVeU6P7j8g_Bvsmw We were stuck in Scottsdale doing some laundry. This place hit the spot. It was cozy, comfortable, and the staff was so nice. The pizza was tasty and they had a decent selection of beer to go with it! 

The buffalo wings were also pretty good too.

I hope that you will give this place a try. For the good pizza and the very nice staff who made our meal pleasant. 

Thanks!
