xjjxHavx4RIiW6zS6rasGA My favorite place to eat in Scottsdale. Had the lobster special, it was amazing. Excellent service. Our server nick  was so accommodating and really cute!! Can't wait to go back and try one of the many amazing choices. Nice wine list, moderately priced as well. Truly a gem and an old town must try!!!
