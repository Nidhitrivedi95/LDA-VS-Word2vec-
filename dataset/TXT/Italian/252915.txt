VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Nice and swanky!
The food is good also. It's pretty much a bar scene, but hey, it's Vegas!
It's loud so probably not the best place for a romantic meal or a business meeting. 
You go here to have fun, eat good food and drink until you black-out. Ok maybe that's a bit extreme, but the place could do it to you.
Oh and the selection of food and drinks are enormous. You will find something here to satisfy you.
Don't forget to try one of the delicious desserts. Yum!
