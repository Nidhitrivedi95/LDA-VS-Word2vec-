KT8Lyc7lhL48SXalBSwLfw Good, solid choice for authentic Italian.
Ambiance: A little crowded and fills up quickly after noon. But clean and appealing.
Service: Considering the amount of people it was very fast, but the staff were clearly a little stressed out.
Food: Nice flavours while being more traditional in the sense that most dished only have a few fresh ingredients and it's not hidden under loads of garlic. I had the pasta nonna which had tender pieces of steak and fresh pasta. My friend had a pizza which was done in the Neapolitan style. It was huge and very tasty without being greasy or over the top with the toppings.
Price: A little more than the other Italian joints nearby but better quality.
I would go back if given the chance.
