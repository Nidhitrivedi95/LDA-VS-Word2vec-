ES8JP18I4sz72HEAWjk_KQ Went there by chance:  had meant to go to L'Avenue Bistro a few doors down, but it was closed for a private function.  

Server was gracious and friendly, and the atmosphere was good (dimly lit, tables not too close together, lots of wood).  

Food was OK, but didn't set the world on fire.  Mixed greens salad was alright.  They used stewed tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, which on a freezing January evening was a nice touch.   I ordered the rib-eye...I always advise people not to order a steak when at a non-steak house, and yet I didn't follow my own advice.  The cut of meat was decent enough, but you could tell it hadn't been cooked at a high enough temperature, and lacked the charred bits of fat that can make it so tasty!   My friend had bucatini with chicken, which was OK, but without any flourish or style.  I am a mediocre cook, so if I see a dish at a restaurant that I could make myself, I can't help but wonder "why bother coming here?" 

Prices were reasonable, so I suppose that tempers expectations a bit.  It was a decent enough place, and I wouldn't say no to returning, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return.
