dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw I think this is my fav restaurant in Vegas.  This is the second time I've eaten here and I was not disappointed.  My favorite is the gnocchi, and I know my gnocchi.  I think the truffle oil is the perfect touch and the portions are the right size.    My friend had the short rib raviolini that were just little bites of heaven.  I asked for my panna cotta with strawberries instead of the figs, and they were more than happy to do it. 

One of the nice things about Fiamma is that it's well priced for a Las Vegas restaurant.  I thought the service was good, food was great, decor nice.  Just an overall great place to enjoy some food.
