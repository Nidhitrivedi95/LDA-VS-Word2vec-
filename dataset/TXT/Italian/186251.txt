OpCWTpPscK2WCAO_XlztUg Holy Moly Batman! I have been here a few times and I leave feeling like I ate a cow or whole chicken.  The portions are enormous and the extra toppings...enormous but I am at an Italian bakery so it should be expected!

Looks like a family owned place with Nonna making the sandwiches with her daughter and grand daughter.  The service is above and beyond and that makes you want to go back.  As for the food...amazing!

You can get sandwiches, pasta, salads, pizza, dessert, bread, and much more.

It is hidden in a corner at Finch and Pharmacy so it is easy to miss but if you know of it spread the word.

P.S. always a line up at lunch time.
