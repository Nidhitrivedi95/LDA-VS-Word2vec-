It was my friend's birthday and I took her out for some pizza, the restaurant is a BYOW so I went to the SAQ and picked up my faves. We had no idea what a perfect night we were going to have ahead of us. 

When we arrived the line up wasn't very long, so we probably waited 10-15 minutes before getting seated. We were automatically served a simple salad that kept our hunger at bay until our delicious pizzas were served. I ordered the Italian sausage and she had the 5 Cheese, or the "White Pizza" as it is also known as. Both were D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S. Anyone who knows me, knows that I love me some good saucisse. From the dough to the cheese to the meat, it was just... magical. Perfectly rationed, perfectly seasoned, the taste never got bland, every bite made my pizza dreams come true.

For a little appetizer we shared the garlic bread au gratin, which isn't REALLY au gratin and more like... sprinkled with parmesan. It was still good, but my friend and I have a very special place in our hearts for true au gratin. 

The restaurant is medium sized, warm, and full of happy faces and chatter. It's a lovely, relaxed dining experience and they truly do a good job at what they do best - PIZZA! Amelios even delivers or does take away. I would totally order from them instead of nasty Pizza Pizza, Double Pizza, or Dominoes. At least I know I'll be eating something authentic and loaded with flavourful, good quality ingredients.

Do it.
