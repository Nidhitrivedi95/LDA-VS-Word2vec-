SSFI9syOoz84W9UnptYEPg Normally we love pizza hut and their stuffed crust pizza, this time will probably be the last time we order pizza from them. We chose to do a staycation with our family at a hotel and decided to order pizza. It was 1030 when we placed the order so I know it was late, but they close at 12 and it was a friday night so I figured we would still get quality pizza. The pizza arrived on time, however when we sat down to eat it the pizza was squished in the box. Wasn't fully cut, and wasn't fully cooked. The middle of the pizza was raw, their was an off taste to the cheese. The breadsticks we ordered were burned though. Not sure how those two were complete opposites. The pepsi however was cold. When I went to call the store no one answered the phone. This was at about 1130.... the store should have still been open for another 30 minutes. Very disappointed and will not be ordering again.
