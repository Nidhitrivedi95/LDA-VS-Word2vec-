t4QsZYXgOGR7nMQuTKO_pg Following up on my last post, the risotto balls, pizza, wine and chocolate mousse cake are great. The risotto balls are crispy on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside with a delicious marinara sauce. The pizza crust it perfectly thin, crispy and soft and the topping are always fresh and flavour full. 

I tried the creme brûlée and was very disappointed. The dessert was completely cold because it was just taken out of the fridge and the texture was not creamy at all, it was too eggy and spongy.
