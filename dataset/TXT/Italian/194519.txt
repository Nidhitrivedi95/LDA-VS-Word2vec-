PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ This place is my home away from home. Great food, huge portions and ausome wine pairings. Never been disappionted. It's nice to have a quality restaurant in a sea of fast food and garbage taco shops out in SOHI. If your lucky enough to have Stephenie as your waitress you will no doubt be treaded like family. Happy eating!
