OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ I wish Rocco's was closer to where I live, but its pretty far for me so I have only been once. 

I was running errands on this side of town and decided to try it since I read nice reviews about it. I was in the mood for beef so I ordered the roast beef sandwich. Yummy yummy, the roast beef was indeed housemade. It had a great beef flavor and was juicy. On top of this the bread they used was warm like they just baked it. Then I realized it was! It was their pizza dough made into a sandwich bread like a hoagie. Genius! 

I really want to come back to try the other menu items, but until next time I have errands in the neighborhood.
