3qTSOuJ-ZyU1L7o62KHSIg I live right around the corner and I used to think this place was an art gallery. I mean there's tinted windows and a huge paper mache nose in place of signage. 

I came here for my birthday on a Saturday night and it was PACKED. Got there around 8 and waited til 9 for a table for two so I was pretty starved. (Host was nice. She kept coming back to make sure we were not dead from hunger and offered us drinks menu and such.)

The interior of this place is beautiful. Very dim with rustic/hip look and decorated with artwork and vintage photographs. Incredibly LOUD with music and chatter but also kind of cramped feeling.

Our waiter was nice. But since the restaurant was busy and noisy, he didn't come by very often. We ordered the beef carpaccio ($10) for an appetizer. For the main, I got the duck leg ($15) and my boyfriend got the beef tenderloin steak ($22). (You have to order sides on top... - our waiter advised us to get one to share - we got the Yukon potatoes for $5.)

Beef Carpaccio: The plate was a bit smaller than I expected to share for two. I think it was meant for one. It was okay but the vinegar and cheese were really strong and there was a lot of it. It blocked the flavor and texture of the beef so I just rubbed the vinegar/cheese off. Arugula, however, was a wonderful compliment.

Duck leg: First off, I like my duck cooked very specifically so that it's very tender. The duck was just okay and a little hard/dry in some places. Skin was very nice and crispy but hard to cut with the knife I was given. I did not like the jus.

Beef Tenderloin: YUM! If I came back, this is what I'd get. A hunking piece of juicy and tender meat that was cooked perfectly as requested (rare).

Verdict: Not bad but not worth the hype. I left feeling somewhat ripped off (which is not how you should feel after leaving a restaurant).
