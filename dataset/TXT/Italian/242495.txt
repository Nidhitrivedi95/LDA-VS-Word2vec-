umxki_So2--o08q9bkXK6Q Gluten free - my favorite restauant in Scottsale, AZ. Always have great food and it's all gluten free! Staff are friendly enough arnd do make sure that the order is correct and if not they do it right (only happened once) and I go there very frequently.The food is TASTY! I always hit that place up when I visit AZ.
