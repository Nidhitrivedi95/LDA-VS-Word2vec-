faTB5Lg-blm8MG-y6KUOrg I agree, this is the best Italian restaurant in the Pittsburgh area. I think it is because they aren't in it for the money, they are in it for the convenient cash flow.

Prices are incredibly reasonable, and every dinner comes with garlic bread, wedding soup or soup of the day, salad, and a side dish as appropriate. It would be worth coming here if they added $8 to the price of every dish, but most meals are under $15. I'd like to try the Italian Hoagie sometime but I have always gotten a dinner.

Entrees are big and uniformly delicious.  Chicken and veal parmesan are excellent -- it is cooked so the breading remains crispy even under the melted cheese and sauce. Everything is good.

It is crowded during the evenings. You need to make a reservation. Definitely worth the drive.
