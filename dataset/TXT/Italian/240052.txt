Ud2r44vcEX9mPCmk62bPuw Amelia's looks like a neighbourhood place to get a slice of pizza but I found it wholly lackluster. The pizza has an incredibly thick crust that doesn't have a lot of flavour. I love a good Hawaiian pizza but this one came with maraschino cherries inside the pineapple slices?? 

The service was very mediocre and they didn't take cards which meant I had to get cash out from the atm located awkwardly in the middle of their restaurant. Paying $20 for a personal sized pizza with minimal flavour and toppings is not my idea of a good meal. Would not recommend for people who are pizza lovers and for those who enjoy bold flavours.
