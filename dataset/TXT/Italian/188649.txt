oX7lSVsg4j7-SrSZVGWVnA I love Babbo's. The first time we ate here was about 10 years ago when we first moved here and it was so-so. Well, thankfully we gave it another try a few weeks ago and it has become our 'go-to' for Italian food.

I was craving meatballs in sauce and didn't have time to make it. (I'm Italian and always make my Italian food from scratch.) So we ordered spaghetti and meatballs to go on our way home. In my mind there are 2 dishes you should rate an Italian restaurant on -- meatballs and sauce. If those 2 are good, they can probably handle everything else. And Babbo knows both!

Since then we've ordered 'to go' and had eat in. Their salads are delicious, especially the roasted brussel sprout, beet salad. I'm addicted to it. I also love their free focaccia, although it could use more toasting. There is also a wide array of pastas and a happy hour that I'm looking forward to trying. If you haven't gone to Babbo in a while, please give it another try!
