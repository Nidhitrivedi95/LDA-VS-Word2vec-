F5BCXUpQpCRPeFmWnQmSJA came here in September for my birthday dinner.  
The place is very nice....located in the plaza behind Walgreen, Pink Donuts, Starbucks and an array of other shops located off of Lake Mead and Buffalo.
We walked in to a romantic setting.  Service was excellent and so was my steak.  The reason for 4 stars was because our appetizer platter was just blah.
Will definitely recommend.
