Ih0f0UyhFufm3C7kR72DSQ Dante's been my best restaurant experience in Cleveland by far.  Part of why I love this place so much is that no matter how high my expectation or anticipation, Dante has never let my palate down.  Consistency is not something to be poo-pooed (I can't imagine anything worse than psyching yourself up for a great repeat dinner, only to have said culinary fantasy obliterated by inconsistent kitchen output).  Repeatability is the true mark of a great chef. 
 
This is the place to go if you gravitate towards complex yet clean tastes(a distinct departure from Michael Symon's & Zack Bruell's restaurants).  Nearly every dish has a pitch-perfect balance of flavors, along with just the right portion.  Every time I go, I leave not only satisfied, but also happy.  Really, my spirits are lifted--and that's what truly excellent food is meant to do, right? 

The Happy Hour is above average (mussels in miso broth are a very good deal--you get about 10 shellfish), but I'd recommend going there for a full meal. Try the oysters (get a full dozen!) and the polenta with spare ribs.  Also, the Aviation cocktail is a super-duper, olive-drab gem.  Delish!

My only criticism of Dante is the god-awful art on the walls. The previous faux Modiglianis have been replaced by some truly mundane photos of pasta-making.  Please Dante hire some interior designers and visual artists who are as good at their craft as you are at cooking!  I'd like some pretty to look at while noshing on your delicious food. :)
