GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA I love coming to B&B, and used to come here every time I met my best friend in Vegas, until we started branching out and trying a variety of new places. The atmosphere is relaxed, and I never ever feel rushed. The waiters take their time to explain the nuances in the menu, and also to explain Chef Batali's philoshophy on different menu items.

The bellinis are absolutely to die for. The peach nectar is alwasy at the peak of freshness, and I honestly have never had a better bellini. Anywhere.

We always get a bottle of Kerner, and start with a few pastas. My absolute favorite in the papardelle bolognese. Everything is made from scratch, and the bolognese is creamy and rich without feeling too heavy. The mint love letters and black spaghetti are two of their best sellers, and neither will disappoint.

The last time I was here, I branched out and tried the quail. The mascarpone polenta was out-of-this world, and our waiter did not let me down when he raved about this dish. I love the branzino; it's always an excellent choice, and my friend raves about all of the beef dishes, especially the short ribs. I have never had a sub-par here. Never.

The thing I love about Vegas is that sub-par restaurants simply don't make it (in general). There are so many food options, and the competition in such a small radius makes it quite difficult for mediocre restuarants to be successful.

We're generally too stuffed at this point to do dessert, but I'm sure the desserts are fabulous as well. Now I am craving B&B for my next trip to Vegas! I should look at flights right now.
