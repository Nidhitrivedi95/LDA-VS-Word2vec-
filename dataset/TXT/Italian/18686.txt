2pmFvzumIrtallbmbu41-A Ambiance:
The restaurant is very pretty and when you walk up there is a huge fountain out front. Typical AZ, a nice restaurant in the middle of a shopping strip. I was turned off that the bar wasn't really separated from the dining area and I could see and hear the bar TV from my table.

The booze:
We ordered a Kir Royale to start dinner and it was tasty. I was disappointed in the wine list that was separated by Italian and American choices. I didn't recognize any of the Italian and all the American wine choices were options you could buy at Basha's or Safeway. The options didn't offer anything really wow and special unless you jumped to the $100/bottle options.

The menu:
There were a lot of options, but I was disappointed to still see so many Winter options and it didn't seem that there were a lot of Spring updates other than an Spring value menu inserted into the main menu.

What we ordered:
We ordered the crab cakes, they were good, but not amazing. We then had the Lobster bisque, it was delicious. He ordered the veal ravioli and cleaned his plate! I thought he was going to slop his bread in the sauce. I ordered the seafood risotto. My seafood was chewey and the one lonely prawn on the plate was so over cooked that it looked like a knuckle. Most of my shell fish didn't have meat in the middle and there was so much calimari that the dish should have been called calimari with risotto.
The dessert we ordered was a ricotta cheesecake, the menu read with cherries. I was excited because cherries are coming into season and I thought it would be fabulous. What was delivered to our table was a chocolate strawberry cheesecake. Which was disappointing in taste and simply disappointing because it's not was we ordered. The waiter to make up for it compted our coffee :/

I've experienced better for $150. Off hand, I'd recommend Cork in South Chandler instead.
