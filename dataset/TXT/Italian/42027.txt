7PRse3yCQbEprAj1DWrEQQ Yummmmm-hum. This review is for drinks and dessert. Which should be enough for you to get an idea because it was for me!

Dish is fannnnncy but I think the service, food, ambiance, furniture, etc. are all in accordance with the price. 

The bar is copper. Probably not to the core but it's copper colored or plated! Pretty and shiny! I had a ginger old fashioned. Highly recommended over their sazerac which was just okay. 

The chocolate bread pudding was really really good. Hot but not dry, spongy but not gummy, and topped with chocolate sauce and fresh, delicious blueberries. Eating blueberries in February is cheating but if no one hears about it then it's ok. They were like tangy gifts from Mexico. The fruit kind. 

Next we asked for espresso Martinis but I kind of wanted just an espresso and maybe another drink. Next time I won't have a coffee martini. I feel like my brain was confused by the chemical combination, like, I'm tired! Noooo I'm up! Nooo I'm wired! When all I ever really was was full. 

The dinner menu looked great too. Many options for all diners. Maybe will try again on a visit to Pittsburgh. It will have to wait some time but the place comes highly recommended so it won't be forgotten.
