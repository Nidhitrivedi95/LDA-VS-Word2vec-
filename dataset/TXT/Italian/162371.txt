lop2cMZ8mml0PqY1epavbA i don't like sausage on a pizza, or i thought i didn't until i had the Chicago (deep dish pizza) at Danny Boy's. 
this may have been the best pizza i've ever had in my life - honestly incredible. i want another and i'll have another. soon.
Danielle had a Chicken Philly and Fries pizza. Brian, our server, came out to let us know her pizza had gotten slightly burned while cooking. he boxed that pizza up and gave it to us to take home and then had a new pizza made for her to eat there. he also offered her a salad, which she declined, but it was nice of him to offer. the customer service was incredible.
