Maybe the quality is significantly better here, but the taste really didn't convince me. I'm not a big fan of thick dough but it was OK. The topping was very cheesy and greasy, practically overpowering anything else on the pizza. I'm not saying it wasn't yummy but it definitely wasn't a gourmet style pizza. You can get the same kind of "dirty" pizza for half the price at a less fancy place.
