yFUvKpW66cNsYXD6inDsog By far the BEST Italian restaurant in Phoenix. The homemade pasta is to die for! The ravioli de Nina, the veal canneloni, the lasagna. OmG!!!
Entrees come with a salad or soup. 

Ashley the hostess helped us out in a pinch. A.mazing! I screwed up and made a reservation at their other location on Valentine's Day by mistake and she still got us in within 20 minutes. Mateo, who works the bar is so personabke. Love this place! Thank you for an amazing meal!
