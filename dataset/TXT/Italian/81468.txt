dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw My personal favorite Italian restaurant @ Vegas. Been there multiple times and had wonderful experiences. Go with the Chef menu or family style if you've enough people at your party. Always save room for dessert. Fiamma has the best dessert dishes on the Strip! Top it all off, they also have great wine selections.
