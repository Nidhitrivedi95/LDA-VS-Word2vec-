9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg For a very long time I looked straight past Scaddabush because of a few key reasons:
- the fact that it's a chain
- its close proximity to unremarkable establishments such as Reds and Elephant Castle and the non foodie part of town aka Yonge and Dundas

I'm sorry I judged you Scaddabush because I could not have been more wrong!

A few things aligned that led to me trying this place. Firstly I caught wind of a recently held event here where everyone raved about the food. Secondly my friend who was visiting me in Toronto wanted a restaurant with a good vibe for her last night in town...a Monday. I thought to myself, well Scaddabush is always pretty full and open late so they must have a little something something going on on a Monday night. I was right...and I've since been back at least six times in recent months.

Things to like:
- they make their own pasta and mozzarella daily and have signs up telling you who the craftsman/craftswoman was
- professional and friendly hostesses and servers who treat you well regardless of whether you have a reservation or not
- the staff seem happy to work there, are attentive and I find I can always have a joke with them
- great vibe, tunes, noise level and lighting (the right amount of dark)
-  a nice big space with multiple floors
- a very consistent experience with regards to food quality and service
- a lot of variety for vegetarians and innovative menu options e.g. meal companions (sides) and the *cheap pours* aka discounted wine carafes

What I like:
- the burrata mozzarella
- the bruschetta (so many options)
- the red *cheap pours*
- the arrabiatta pasta (but be warned it has a slow burn spiciness)
- the polenta tots
- the charity bread

Definitely give this place a go. I think it would be a great place for a first date or a larger group dinner.
