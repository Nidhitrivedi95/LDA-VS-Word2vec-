Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg This is more of a customer service review since I ended up not being able to eat here because of an allergy. I realistically didn't think I could eat here, but I figured the worst I could do is call and find out if I could eat anything at a party I got invited to. The guy I spoke to was very nice about answering my questions, but wasn't very knowledgeable about the ingredients in the food. (he seriously started talking about ranch and blue cheese when I asked if any of the salad dressings were dairy free, lol!) So obviously I won't be eating here any time soon, but I did want to leave a good review for the customer service since I have encountered restaurants that aren't so nice about answering questions about the food.
