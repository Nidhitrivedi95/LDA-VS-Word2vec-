4IXTkqYmAO4XH4nXnwc67w My husband and I went here this past Saturday for my birthday dinner and were less than enthused. Our waitress was just.... Odd. First neither of us could hear what she had muttered when we entered the restaurant. She asked us if it was just the 2 of us. Then we were sat and she took our drink order. I had asked for a glass of the "Pink Table Wine". She looked at me like I was nuts and insisted that they don't have pink wine. I pointed it out on their wine list and she said, "God I hate that he calls it that". My husband ordered a lemoncello. We waited about 10 minutes before she came back and asked if we decided on what we'd like to drink. We told her that we already placed our drink order with her 10 minutes ago. We told her again what we wanted and she tried to rush off, but by that time we had decided on what we wanted to eat. The food was served to us by someone else. The waitress kept trying to take away my husbands unfinished lemoncello, just to bring him another "on the house" later. After we were done picking at the food, which was actually pretty good, we ordered Creme Brule. She brought the desert to us, we said, "It looks delicious!" she said, "It better be!". We fished that. Sat for another 25 minutes waiting for her to bring our check. Nothing. No acknowledgement. So we walked to the front of the restaurant where she met us. The bartender/manager? Checked us out. I would order food to go, but by no means do we plan on sitting and waiting inside of this establishment like we did this past Saturday.
