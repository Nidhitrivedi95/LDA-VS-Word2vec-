7qo6rqDjlHds8ObxzxBD4A The Proper Care and Feeding of Italian Eaters.
It's been awhile since I "yelped" this joint!  So, I think it's about time for an update..
Vito.. Seriously the nicest pizza owner I know (and YES, I know a few!) !  More than a few times, he's come out and greeted the patrons of his establishment checking on us, making sure we've been taken care of and fed properly! The food is amazing.. my favorites are still White Eggplant Pizza.. it is to die for delish!  The other sOOper nummie is the lasagna!  But most importantly, you cannot leave this establishment without having some Cannoli! Molto Bene!
Oh and Anna, she's still our #1 reason for dining in!  LOVE her!
