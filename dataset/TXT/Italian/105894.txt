fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I had the beef udon soup lunch special. Food was ok for the price. Lunch special came with typical cali roll, and the udon soup was ok in portion, the broth is pretty flavorful. 

I was not totally happy with the service my waiter provided. Not once did he stop by to ask if my food turned out ok or if I need anything else. 

When I finished my meal, he asked if I wanted dessert, so I asked what they have, he pointed a few items out in the display case and walked away. I had decided to try one of them, but instead of asking what I have decided for dessert, he came back with the check. 

I was turned off by his lack of service, and decided not to get the dessert and just pay and leave.

There are so many items on the menu, it was hard to pick. So, I think I will give it another try. But probably will make sure I am not seated to the same waiter again.
