-xbQQR_ydEJGqYzHSF4DnQ I had a chicken parm sandwich here that was really good.  Way to big to finish by far.  Had a side ceaser with it that was enough for two meals also.  Went back a few nights later and had spaghetti with bolognese that was really good.  Huge serving would be an understatement.  While waiting for my sandwich and a pizza the first night sat an visited with the manager and had a couple of cokes on the house.  Really nice guy and had a great time talking with him.  Will go there again for sure.
