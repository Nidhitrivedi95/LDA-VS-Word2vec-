rxcZiqu2hQDJgULxwtJqug I just had a great evening celebrating my son`s 20th birthday at Natalia`s 1912 Restaurant.  It was our first visit and we were vey impressed.  There was a nice live music.  The waiter`s were very nice and attentive.  The food was very good the helpings were generous.  I would highly recommend.  It is locally owned and the owner came over to meet us and check on out needs.  We will definitely be back!
