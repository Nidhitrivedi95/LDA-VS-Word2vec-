BcK6nlLOs0RC3hxeVLaNdg While walking up the Danforth deciding where to have a romantic dinner it was the coziness of the Italian wine cellar like interior that caught our eye. Upon being seated we were pleased that the service was fast & that the waitstaff & host were very helpful & enthusiastic about the menu options. We ordered a bottle of rosé to go with our meal which was chilled & very refreshing after our walk in the warm autumn evening. Everything from the appetizers of stuffed arancini to our eggplant Parmesan & pancetta carbonara had that delicious home made taste. Definitely a new Danforth favorite for us.
