yY9XOQ1Baozl8HGK4mN76w If you are from New York and you want 1st class pizza and amazing service look no further than Nicantoni's pizza. I've be coming here for 25 years. The pizzas are 5 stars all the way. Desserts are amazing as well. The environment is very friendly and they make you feel like your at home in mamas kitchen. Beautiful patio area to enjoy some drinks and have some snacks. Victor the owner is a car and motorcycle nut so stop by for a slice and drink. You will not be disappointed and you will be hooked on it. As the sign says you don't like our pizza you can sleep with the fishes.
