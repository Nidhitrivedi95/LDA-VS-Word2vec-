LWwAMZUiH6iBaL4a6jGRWw My husband and I have gone here a few times and loved it. Healthy portions, good taste, nice wait staff and a manager who is often visible and both times has checked on us to see how our meal was. We were waited on by a sweet girl named Jessica both visits and will definitely dine with her again. Prices are reasonable and My husband and I have learned to order just one dinner and share it or take home leftovers. The only thing I wish was different about the place is that because it is open to the Casino you can hear the Casino music.
