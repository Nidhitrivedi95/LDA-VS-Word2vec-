HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q I enjoy Espressemente Illy thoroughly.....  IMHO it doesnt get better than this... I have had their espresso (on multiple occassions), normal roast coffee, pizza, panini's and gelato....   I have been impressed by the quality of their food and coffee.  My wife LOVES their Vanilla Latte's too.  if you are near The Palazzo, hit it up....
