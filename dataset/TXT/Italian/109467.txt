G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Amazing service and amazing food!  

I really  wasn't expecting such great food from a celebrity restaurant.  The meat and cheese plate was so delicious, the risotto scallops and crispy polenta were all so wonderful.  

Our server, Nancie, was the best service in Las Vegas!  

Thank you for a great night!
