dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg I came in with my husband and in-laws to celebrate my birthday a few weeks ago. We started with a cheesy artichoke bread spread app and some hot wings. The wings have been much better in the past but weren't nearly as meaty as I remember. I ordered a spicy shrimp pasta but subbed the protein for chicken and it was delicious!  I shared some of my sister in law's Pablo Picasso salad, which is just the best salad ever! My husband shared a thin crust pizza with his mom and it was very disappointing but the others at the table that ordered deep dish were very pleased with their order. For dessert we were treated to a pizza cookie with scoops of vanilla ice cream (I ordered half and half peanut butter and chocolate chip). The service was good even though we had a large group and the prices were reasonable for the portions. I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants but this is one of the better ones for sure.
