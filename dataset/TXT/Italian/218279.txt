s_CFR6l-ecfGZ3tw16PJDQ Doughboy's is easily the best pizza place that delivers in the West End.  I started ordering here just because of the glorious online ordering, and now they deliver to my place at least 3 times a week.
The pizza is a little different than the norm.  It's a little thicker, with lots of cheese and heavy toppings.  However, aside from occasionally getting smothered in toppings, I have no complaints about the pizza.  Bonus points for using real bacon.
The sandwiches and wings here are also very good.  Nothing particularly stands out, but nothing has ever been bad either.
Honestly, my biggest beef is that they're closed on Sunday, AKA National Hangover Day, which is a crime against hungover humanity.
