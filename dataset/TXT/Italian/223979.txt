Sm2k1ijcnK17Ro5paN2_qQ I originally had a 5 star review for Grand Pizza but have changed it due to them taking over 1 hour to deliver my food to me. Previous to this time, I ordered and received an oily pizza that even soaked through the box. This place definitely has gone down hill not sure what's happened but i wont be buying anymore food from here. This last time that I ordered, I waited and waited until finally after over an hour i called to tell them not to bother coming anymore. The girl over the phone was not even apologetic more like "whatever" attitude.
