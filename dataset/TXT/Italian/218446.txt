S1zlGFu9fi5-QmVpGqsKsA I was in from out of town visiting family, had been looking forward to restaurant based on majority of reviews. I was informed AFTER our drinks had been brought that they were out of both the Osso Bucco as well as the veal canelloni. This was 7:30pm on a Sunday. I ended up ordering my default in this instance a steak which was cooked well, but I hadn't really wanted a steak at an Italian restaurant. Based on the other dinners that came, the shrimp in the sauce on the lobster ravioli did not taste or smell very fresh, the remaining dishes were overall average. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great and I won't be returning. If you decide to go I would recommend calling in advance to be sure EVERYTHING is available.
