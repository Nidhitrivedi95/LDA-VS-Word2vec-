9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw I'm not certain how many times I've reviewed Cibo, but every time we go there, I feel like the experience is 5-Star review worthy for a different reason. 
Tonight: The Saffron Scallop Papadelle. Is it possible to concoct a more deliciously simple yet exquisite dish? This dish was off the hook amazing. I would eat it every day. 
Never had it? 
Get your ass down here and get it before Chef moves on. 
Second great thing about tonight: The live music. Two dudes playing some extra entertaining interpretive classics. A keyboard & guitar is all. Brick House & Use Me, both classics and skillfully adapted by these guys. Anyone know who they are or where else they play? I mean these guys were Rhythm Room worthy.
