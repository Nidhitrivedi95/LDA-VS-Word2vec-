HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA Visited for the second time recently. It was early on a Friday evening. Party of 4. We had 2 meatball parm subs, a pizza, and something else. The food all came out cold. It was horrible. The sandwiches were cold, had very little sauce on them, a few pieces of meat. The food comes out sporadically. One sandwich came out, then the pizza and a little whle later the other sandwich. All food was cold and not good. Was really disappointed. It was not a busy time of night. It was before the rush and there were few other people in the place. It took forever and was bad food. Never again.
