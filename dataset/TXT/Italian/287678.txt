 " A GOOD THING NEVER LASTS FOREVER"

Got a pizza  and was nothing like the ones in the past,  the workers looked off beat and didn't care and the Pizza showed it. tasted like a cheesy piece of cardboard!
 Time to look for another pizza place, this one has its head in the clouds but soon to fall.. 

Save your money and go somewhere else!  Domino's might even be in the run with this one!
