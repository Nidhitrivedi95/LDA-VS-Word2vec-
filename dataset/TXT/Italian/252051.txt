VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Long winded. Hmmmmm, Lavo was not bad. When I was in Vegas last year, our delightful cocktail waitress at Spearmint Rhino said that Lavo on Tuesday Industry night was a good scene. I sent an e-mail to the address on the website, asking to be put on the "guest list". Got an e-mail back saying that we were on the guest list, $10 for her, $20 for me. Now, honestly, I don't know how the whole VIP/guest list thing in Vegas works, the VIP guys and bouncers looked awfully busy with their clipboards. I told them we were on the guest list. They pointed us to a short line, next to an empty line, next to a line going out the door. The group in front of us (mostly dudes) was taken out of line and set aside (purgatory?). A good looking couple came up, said something to the VIP guy and was ushered in. A group of 5 attractive girls, all dressed in their tightest designer best came up thinking they were going to get right in but was placed in line behind us. We came to the front of the line, our names were on the list and in we went. No money was collected. The bar was cool, though my girlfriend's Grey Goose dirty was her least favorite of the trip. There were clearly a handful of obvious "tourist" types just checking the scene. After a few drinks, we went upstairs to the actual club, which was packed and definitely happening. We stayed and danced for a bit, then our age got to us (well, my age) and we left. She pulled out her flip flops and I put her on my arm and carried her Louboutins back to Encore, where we had a drink and cigar. I am sure that weekends are run a bit differently, but my time spent in Vegas last year, 2 guys, 2 girls (no one of any particular importance) and a few phone calls made ensured that we had a good time and got in to a few high end clubs on busy nights without waiting in ridiculous lines. Dress the part I guess and leave the sausage fest at home?
