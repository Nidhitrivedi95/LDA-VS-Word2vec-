q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ I've been here a few times and have been happy every time. The first was with a large group. We didn't have a reservation, but they graciously accommodated our group of 12. To get in is a bit gimmicky, but goes with the speakeasy theme. 

The second time I went with my girlfriend for a romantic dinner. We sat by the mic, and the singer serenaded us with a love song. While the singing isn't exactly my thing, I love a place that is queer friendly! 

The food was good. It was pretty standard Italian fare. I had the chicken parmigiana, which I recommend. Overall, it's a cute place that's different from the average place. I recommend.
