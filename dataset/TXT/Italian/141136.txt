jM6JjZXFAQQANwdlEwbH3g I like it here.

I have been here numerous times for dinner, brunch, and lunch and have left happy every time.

The food is good and they have a pretty decent menu. I like the coffee, especially the specialty coffees. I agree that they could improve a little bit on the customer service side of things, but it's nothing that would stop me from going back.

I've also come here with both adults and children and would say that it is good for any sort of group.

It's a welcome spot in an area that doesn't have too many restaurant options.
