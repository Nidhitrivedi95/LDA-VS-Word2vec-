Party of 7 all together. It was packed since it was Labor Day but we were seated within 15 minutes. Not bad! From the minute we walked in, everyone from the hostess to the bar tender to the waitress and bussers were extremely nice, attentive and courteous! Our waitress, (wish I would've caught her name) was amazing! She was also the bartender and did a great job! The kitchen forgot to put in one of our pizzas (it was busy and we are all human) and the waitress came to our table was honest and we still wanted the pie but got it to go. No charge! 
Some of the food we got were the wings (delicious) the thin crust pepperoni (for the kids) also delicious! The pepperoni deep dish was amazing! I got the Lou's classic which even after i brought it home and want it up, it was super delicious!  My first experience was amazing and I will be coming back!
