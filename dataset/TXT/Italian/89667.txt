E0YuuRpK_4RpaUF7JK3mhg I've been going to Bratalian since it opened, and I have never been disappointed. Some of my favorite dishes are the spaghetti and meatballs, penne alla vodka, and the squid umido. I always get good service. The food is very consistent. This is a great neighborhood restaurant.
