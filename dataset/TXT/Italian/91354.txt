EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw Had the tuna and the yellowtail sashimi and both were tasty... more because of the sauce/toppings vs the fish quality.  I thought the butterfish sashimi was the best tasting fish but the toppings were less interesting.  Had the burrata which was amazing!!!!  Great drinks too.
