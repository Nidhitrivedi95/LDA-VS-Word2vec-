esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA As we were on our way back from a day of exploring the strip, we got the desire for some fresh oysters. Our favorite oyster place with buck a shuck at Caesars closed so we decided to try the oyster bar at Harrahs. We walked through the casino and easily found it. Immediately it felt like a dive bar. 

We sat ourselves and were excited to see a few familiar oysters (blue point, Kumamoto, kushi). We wanted to do a pair of each but since their computer system can't handle that, our choice was limited to ordering 6 or 12 of each kind of oyster. This makes no sense for any food establishment ever conceived. 

We ordered half dozen kushi and half dozen blue points. The woman shucking the oysters seemed completely disinterested in life all together. I understand that shucking oysters is not a glamorous job but she avoided all customers around her, engaged nobody and worst of all, left shell pieces in each and every single oyster she shucked. We were given the oysters, asked for mignonette (had to be made separately) which tasted like pure ACV. Thinking this was Vegas we took a risk on this place but lesson learned.
