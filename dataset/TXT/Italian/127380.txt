HUWLnKD5LSZY134amUO2Rg Love this place!!! The owners and atmosphere is like a New York attitude which you got to love. First time eating here about 5 years ago just by reading reviews from yahoo trying to find a good New York style pizza. Once you walk into this local spot of a hang out you see how everyone feels so comfortable.  In one corner you have family/friends enjoying their time laughing and catching up on gossip and in another you see a regular come in and sit down at his usual spot. And at this particular time the wife and I came in to try it out the place it felt like we've been there before by just the way we were greeted and the whole atmosphere. The waitress was great she kept ending her questions for us with "doll". And when we told her this was our first time there she asked, you wanting pizza...yes, slice or pie...pie, a lot on it...yes, then you'll like "The Works". After that...the rest is history. After meeting Anthony and Jimmy you feel like your apart of the place. Anthony has such a regular following for the way he makes his pizza he'll even half bake and not slice it so you can enjoy it hot when you get home. Thus, everytime I come into Vegas I stop off there to eat and when I leave to head back to Cali I get my half bake for the trip home as well as an order of garlic knots(so so good if you love a lot of garlic) for the drive. Oh and if Anthony is working don't ask for ranch dressing for his pies haha.
