We ordered, the polenta app, seafood stew, pumpkin crusted salmon, veggie risotto for mains. The menu is hard to read frankly. It's an interesting touch that somebody wrote it out - So couldn't they have chosen someone with better handwriting? 

Risotto was way too al dente. The waitress came to take our order, give us food, and get us to pay the bill. No real service in between to ask if needed anything else, didn't like the food, needed water refills. The resto was moderately busy. 

The floors look nasty, Some areas do not smell great. The bathroom is comically tiny - look at the sink! 

When the plates were being picked up by another employee we told him that the risotto was undercooked. Our waitress overheard and came over finally. She offered to re make the dish but frankly that would have worked over 20min before as we were waiting to have her come to the ya me to check on us. Instead we declined and she was kind enough to remove the cost of  the risotto from the bill. 
Service wasn't attentive, food wasn't great
