fuBpjG-lsD94_BdpjHxbuQ I tal' ian you that this is da best Italian food I've ever had, the best.  

There was a wonderful event thrown by fellow Yelper Jenny N (who is an awesome host) and the restaurant gave our entire party of 25 the entire back room.

The atmosphere here isn't cookie cutter modern and chic but rather an upscale homey type of feel.  You can sit down, enjoy a conversation without feeling overwhelmed by loud music.  

In terms of food, everything ranged from okay to great but my two favourite things were the suppli and the spicy lamb pasta.  The suppli has pork and cheese in it and was deep fried.  It was like a high end falafel with cheese and I LOVE falafels!  I also thought the pasta was amazingly tasty.  I've never had true hand made Italian pasta and boy what a difference it is from the store bought pasta.

Verdict:  Seriously, you are still reading this when I said it was the best in the first line? Just go.
