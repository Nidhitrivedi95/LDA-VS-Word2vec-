Actually, I took my friend's advice and went with a seafood pasta dish:  squid ink pasta with mussels, pork jowls, chili, mint, and I think that's it.  It was amazing!  Squid ink pasta is a little frightening at first because nobody really wants to eat something that's black (black usually equals rotten) but it was so delicious and I patted myself on the back for going adventurous that evening.  
The menu is always changing which is good but also disappointing to find out I couldn't have the delicious calamari again.  
We dined with a Groupon and I feel that's the only way your bill will be priced fairly.  If you don't have a Groupon, I suggest the Sunday dinner or tasting menu to get the best for your money.
