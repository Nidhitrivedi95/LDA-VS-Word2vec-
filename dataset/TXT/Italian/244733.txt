Uvef4Sr4uz21HqVj8U2rKA What a cool find! I had been trying to think of something new to try today and just by chance ended up at Beechwood Mall. I am so glad I did! 
Pastativo located in the food court upstairs, is not your ordinary food court meal. Pastativo is the latest in eateries to try and take a "chipotle-esqe" approach to how you order your meal. But in my opinion, they do it much, much better! 
You can choose your sauce, choose your type of pasta, choose the size bowl you want... The smaller portion limits you to 5 veggies or additions to your sauce and the regular size gives you unlimited. You may add chicken, meatballs or shrimp for an extra cost. 
I chose the regular size with their TIVO sauce. This is a marinara/Alfredo mix of a sauce that is a rich and flavorful combo. I chose penne for the pasta and added chicken for $2 more. For my additions I had mozzarella,  and parmesan cheese. You could also have added bell peppers red peppers, mushrooms, you name it they had it! Fresh tomatoes, broccoli, etc. they cook your dish to order so it did take it about 5 minutes to cook but it was worth the wait. I made mine into a combo with a breadstick and a drink. The breadstick you do not want to pass up. It's a lightly toasted breadstick with garlic butter and Parmesan on top... And mozzarella in the middle.  I loved dipping it in the sauce with my meal. 
I had originally planned to only eat half and go back for dessert. They had a lovely looking Tiramisu but I was too full! I will have to have it next time! 
I made it a point to go back and thank the staff and I am glad I did! Chef Dee and the gang loved hearing how much I enjoyed dinner and Rachel told me they would soon be starting their own food truck! I hope they will be at Walnut Wednesday's because I know they will be a huge hit! (But they better stick around in Beechwood too -- I would miss them!) 

Check them out!
