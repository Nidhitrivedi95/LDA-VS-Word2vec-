KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg I went here the other night with a group of foodies. The pizza dough is really REALLY awesome. Soft and doughy but not thick and heavy... it was perfect!

We tried 5 pizza among the 6 of us and also had 3 appies (if Olives count!).

Margherita - good benchmark for neapolitan pizza -- 4 of 5 for simplicity..but 3 of 5 relative to the other pizzas
Cremini - very aromatic and cheesy - 4 of 5
Nduja sausage - 4 of 5! its like a spicier, meat version of the margh.
Duck confit - my fav!! 5 of 5
Berkshire ham - cool idea with a sunny side up egg - tasted like a breakfast pizza -  4 of 5 for uniqueness though I would not order this again if I was craving "pizza" pizza.

Calamari is overrated - i don't like fried cala tho so maybe that's just me.
Butternut squash rice balls - err... they are not so good. 

In general, all the toppings were all very fresh and generous! I also tried the fig gelato and the espresso-cinnamon gelato. Both were great! The fig was a bit richer and sweeter while the espresso was light and icy textured. 

I forgot what type of wine we had... but I really liked it. I think it was the Ripasso but it was Delicious!!

Definitely go there early because it can be a wait. We got there at 6:45pm on a Tuesday and stayed till 9:45pm. I think only 20min between 7-8 was there some empty tables.
