eqQnIjAAhOUuHqK6gTWRXw Classic Italian Restaurant.  Dimly lit for the romantics. Loved the red and white checkered tablecloths 
Large portions of food. When you purchase a traditional pasta dinner you get a 2nd dinner to take home..compliments of the chef.  Lasagna was hearty and seasoned well.  Winding staircase to the banquet rooms and the restrooms. After dinner stroll over to SAKS for a little shopping. Service was fast and our sever was attentative and very pleasant.
