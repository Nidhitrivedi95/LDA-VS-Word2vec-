2IHmggMLM-hDq4dFmwgzDw Walked in to grab a couple of slices of pepperoni pizza before getting to work (I was a tad bit early) I myself was not going to put down a whole pie so after being greeted almost immediately after walking in, I inquired with the gentleman at the counter. He went so far as to open up a menu and walk me through different lunch specials including a two slices with one topping for around six bucks. That's the one I replied. He offered a large drink in which I was inclined to request a mr pibb. Haven't been served yet but so far customer service is enjoyable, fast, friendly and efficient. So far so good
After getting my order I walked nearby to my workplace. Everything was awesome. From walking into the place- ordering- receiving order-enjoying- smiley face. All good
