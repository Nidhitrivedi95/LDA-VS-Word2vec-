XlvpNPAZnzm-DJmKYmK2nQ Tosto Quickfire is a chain and I'm rating it with this in mind. We've eaten many of the items and been there to eat,  or ordered for pick up many times. First we have always found the service great.  However, I rarely eat the pizza,  as we choose the appetizers, salads and pastas. The Calamari has always been good as well as all of the salads. My favorite pasta is the the losbster followed by the spicy tuna. My husband like the Bolognese and the Carbonara. They are quick and the price is reasonable.  If you have any problems and let them know they will immediately fix it.
