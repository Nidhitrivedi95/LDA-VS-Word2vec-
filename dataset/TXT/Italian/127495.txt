I found the Italian beef sandwich to be pretty average--a far cry from something that deserves a title of "award winning." The fries were pretty good, if a little oversalted.  The worst part was I saw "Chicago style Tamale" on the menu and thought I would try it. It came wrapped in paper, so picture my surprise when I opened it to find a plastic wrapped microwavable tamale (imagine 7-11's microwavable Mexican food)!  They did do me the service of microwaving it for me, so that was nice.

The total for a very average large beef sandwich, a large fries, large drink, and a convenience store tamale came to over $17.  Not a great value as someone else has noted.  I don't think I am likely to return.  Two stars for the fries.
