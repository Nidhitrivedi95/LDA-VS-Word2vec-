As I concluded the call, the employee said it would be 30 minutes.  Strange that it would double in the two minutes it took me to place my order, but I live very close by, so no big deal.  I arrived right at 30 minutes.  It ended up being over an HOUR, from the time I placed my call, to the time I got my pizza.  I get that it was busy, but they should train their people to be able to provide semi-accurate estimates so customers don't have to wait around and waste their time.  Also, when I placed my order, I had asked if I could leverage a specific promotion that I had seen online, and I was told that it was available online only.  While I was waiting for my pizza,  a man came in and provided that same code, which they honored. (!)   I could have saved 50% off the price of my food.  After all that, I did not get a single apology or any sort of empathy.  At least I would think they would offer a simple "I'm sorry for your wait."  To top it all off, the pizza was terrible (according to three starving teenagers, who for the record eat just about everything!).   My kids love Pizza Hut but this experience was very disappointing, and I will never frequent this location again.
