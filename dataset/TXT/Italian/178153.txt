nOkSC1GtMUJ_I70sb0SaeQ As long as there's that $20 for $40 Yelp deal Pizza Natali will always be one of my favorite pizza spots. I might just have to stock up and buy a few more of this Yelp deal for a later time.

For 20 bucks, actually about 23 or 24 bucks with tax, I got 2 large 16" gourmet pizzas usually $19.99 each so totally worth it. They have some really delicious sounding gourmet pizzas on the menu.  I looked for something a little different from my usually 1 or 2 topping pizzas and went with the Tuscan Chicken and Natali's Special Pizzas. I already knew what kind of pizza I was expecting with the Natali's Special but the Tuscan Chicken Pizza really a surprise. It was so delicious that the box was completely empty before I even got my second slice of the Tuscan Chicken.  Even the Natali's Special box was almost empty. 

Watch me come back again this week I'm feeling Mediterranean Pizza and Spinach and Feta Pizza are next.

This is a family ran pizza shop, I came here for dinner and everyone was there I like seeing that. Also remember this is a small shop I'd suggest picking up if you come with a large group but if it's only a few dining in might be fine, they have a few tables inside and outside.
