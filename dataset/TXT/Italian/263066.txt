WVi8G1QuTYsaIuOLUAfG-Q Harrisburg Family is always a solid option for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. You really can't go wrong when it comes to this family owned and operated establishment. It is a gem to the locals who have been here a time or two. It is obvious the owner, Nick, cares about his customers and works hard to keep them coming back. 

With an incredibly friendly family atmosphere you can expect great service upon arrival. There is always a smiling hostess waiting to greet you. With dozens of homestyle meals to choose from as well as classic Greek dishes, there really is no bad choice here. I really enjoy the salads, but be sure to choose the small-trust me it is plenty. The large is enough to feed two.  

P.s: Don't take a look inside the dessert glass if you're dieting or counting calories!
