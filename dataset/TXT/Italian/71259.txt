c5x6HWB8MTZvlTgabihaSw We dined here several years ago and were pleased overall so we thought we would try it again.  We had an early reservation and were promptly seated.  The restaurant décor is old, tired and bleak.  The chairs are some of the most uncomfortable I have sat in.  The wine prices were fair.  We received our entrees within five minutes of ordering.  Obviously the food is ready to go and quickly heated in a microwave.  My husband had an appetizer, which was very small and he said that it was fair.  Our son had the Fusilli Bolognese which he said was spicy but good.  I had the cannelloni.  The lukewarm pasta was gummy and dry which indicates it was sitting out too long.  The filling and sauce were terrible.  I could barely eat one of the three tubes.  Overall, it was a disappointing meal.  Service was very inconsistent and we had to ask for everything. We had three issues here that never should have happened in a restaurant like this:   server never asked how our meals were, empty plates were not removed in a timely fashion and the server reached his arm across the table in front of me to pick up the bill after I had signed the credit card receipt and stood there checking out what the amount of the tip was.  That rudeness really did it for us.
