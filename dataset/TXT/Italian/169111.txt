Mq1_dvcg5mbeplEmCEoUtQ We ate here because my cousin gave us $125 worth of gift certificates.  Well you might say we went overboard with the orders; our bill ended up being about $165 for three people (and not because the menu is overly expensive).  In any case, the food was all very good and the service was excellent.  I'm incredibly full as I type this.
