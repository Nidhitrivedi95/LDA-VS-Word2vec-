pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg The bad:
The service, particularly the hostess stand.  They are all young and seem uninterested.  When we went to put our name in, and again when we went to ask a question, the feeling we got was that we were bothering them.  Not friendly either.  This is the only reason for 4 stars, and not 5.  The waiters were nice enough.  James was great and really friendly!

The good:
THE FOOD.  Everything is family style and the portions are HUGE.  For a party of 4, we only ordered one salad and one pasta entree and had difficulty finishing it! 
We were only in Vegas for 4 days, and we came here twice!
The bread is good; be sure to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar!
The Caesar salad was amazing.  Not overdressed and the croutons were just right.  The dressing was great too; you can ask for a side of it.
The spaghetti with bolognese sauce was amazing.  The pasta itself was al dente and the sauce was pretty freaking good.
Wish there was a Carmine's in California!
Will definitely visit here again the next time we are in Vegas!
