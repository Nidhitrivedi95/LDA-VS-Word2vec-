eGTAC8EzcHiYnnZ52tijiQ I have no clue what everyone is raving about. I went with  friend who heard it was good. I have only been once but I hated the order at the counter before you sit down idea, they do it a lot in London UK at cheaper places. I can also see that being a mess on busy days. 

While the menu sounded tasty, I ordered the Florence St. sandwich and a ceasar salad. Left two dollars in their tip jar, no drink, got my own tap water and that almost came out to $20.  I was shocked, for a place where you don't even get table service. 

The food came and the caesar salad wasn't very good, pretty tasteless, I have hadbetter at most chain restaurants. The sandwich was basically Chicken and lots of red pesto aioli, it was heavy because the amount of what tasted like loads of pink mayo. After eating it for a while I had to open it and check if the other toppings were even inside. The tomato, artichoke and rocket. There was one small piece of each.


My friend got the lamb sandwich and didn't really comment much when I asked her how it was, it seemed 'ok'.

I would maybe give the brunch a try but really there are so many great places out there and I'm kinda worried it'll sound good but be overpriced and disappointing when I get it.

The chicken was tender and staff was nice though.
