RHcfJ-l69RbBE4viU0-jwQ Afer reading all the reviews here, I HAD to make the stop on my recent trip to Toronto. The first time we went there they were out of Veal!!!
Crap! We went somewhere else and made plans to come back for the touted veal and eggplant sandwich. There was a stack of veal in the window so we figured we were in luck and ordered one to share.
I gotta say it was just ok. The veal was dry. Sorry but dry veal has no charm, the sauce was good, the bread decent but I had to ask myself if any of those who wrote the rave reviews knew anything about a good veal sandwich, or they were just having a bad day at Mustachio's.
Nothing offensive or overpriced but, so not worth the calories.
We had a much nicer veal sandwich at Cafe Diplomatico. When I get the address etc. I will write that review.
Still scratching my head over the raves for this place.
