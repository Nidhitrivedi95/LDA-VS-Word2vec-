The result was a hot and fresh, delicious pizza accompanied by chicken parmesan with noodles that weren't overly cooked.  The pizza came out soft and fluffy with a bit of chewiness. Instead of overloading it with toppings we chose to keep it simple with a half cheese half mushroom (Absolutely delicious mushrooms btw), which allowed the sauce to shine through (It's a very good sauce and it was too bad we could barely taste it the first time).  The garlic knots were cooked very well this time without too much butter.  

Overall we enjoyed the meal very much and would definitely come back again.  Thanks again, Tyler.

It's probably recommended to not order delivery and invest the effort to go get it yourself.
