YstdDnNa6h_ms3Ys7Pz4uQ Time of a good quick and no BS review of this place I have been to before.  
What can I say this place is really good.  The service has always been fantastic too.  We came here after watching a movie up the street.  There were four of us with all different sorts of taste.  My meal was the following.  A cup of the sausage and lentil soup.  Which is the bomb by the way.  I make a similar soup but add prosciutto also.  My main lunch was the Pollo Rosa Maria.  It was good.  They went back to the old way of preparing it by stuffing the ham or prosciutto inside of the chicken breast.  It had good flavour and it was really fresh.  The kavatapi pasta was good too. This place has good separation over other Italian chain places here.  I am not sure what it is, but it does separate it self a lot.
