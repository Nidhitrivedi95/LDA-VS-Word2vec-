k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ I was so freaking excited (aroused) upon seeing (drooling over/on) The Parlor's menu that I really don't understand how the experience ended up being so "shmeh" (the technical term for the feeling of being passively disappointed but also pretty unmotivated to do anything about it.)

To be fair, the pasta I had was amazing... but then they took it off the menu. Just so you know, the chestnut and sheep's milk raviolini fandango that you will never have blew my mind thrice over and now it's gone forever. Dead. 

Here's the part that didn't work out: the pizza. What the deuce? It's a pizza place that's supposed to have great pizza. 0/3 liked it. The tomato sauce was weird and clashed with the toppings, the crust was forgettable, and I didn't finish it. And I am a human garbage disposal in the presence of fancy pizza.

Would I give The Parlor another try? Maybe probably, but I'm heading straight to the pasta department this time.
