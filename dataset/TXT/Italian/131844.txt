ii9kqE9s4456Jn9asz-BPQ I came here after checking-in at my hotel, so I was a bit tired and hungry having flown all day. I like pizza (ok, love pizza - all formats, be it thin crust wood fired to deep dish Chicago) and Italian so having read reviews was optimistic this would make me feel better. And it did. I had the meatballs as an appetizer and salame pizza. Both were great, I just wish I had had room for their Nutella pizza for dessert. I guess it's just an excuse to go back.
