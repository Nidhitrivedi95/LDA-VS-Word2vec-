JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A This place has always been one of my favorite spots in Toronto. How can you beat "Open 24/7" 

This is my 4th time here , always dinner. I have yet to get bad food. Service is questionable. Sometimes you'll get the nicest server and other times, you get a 19yr old that feels far too superior to remember being asked for a fork. +_0 wierdddddddd.
Brushetta & the hummus dips are my favorite apps here. 
I love the pesto pizza. It comes with a lovely salad thats got chicpeas and green peppers :D
desert - Carrot Cake -The most delicious organic Carrot Cake EVER!.

note: They have a really good early grey tea here. I'm a huge tea drinker so It was a brand I was not familiar with. To my surprise, it was delicious. The aroma was perfect and you can tell it was fresh. No dry gingery aftertaste.  

The feel of the place is perfect for ANY occassion, so you really cant go wrong. Don't go in here expecting a 5 star type of deal. Its a low key, casual, hip, chilling place with good quality of food.
