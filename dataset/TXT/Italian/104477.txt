FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA I am in love with this place. My sister took me here when I visited and she says she comes weekly! They have the best deal on Monday & Tuesday after 8 pm. A bottle of wine & bruschetta for $20! SO good and such a good deal! My fave was the burrata, bacon, arugula & tomato bruschetta. And we tried the tempranillo cause it was one of the more expensive bottles but I loved it! My sister usually gets a whole bruschetta and bottle of wine to herself but I think sharing was fine for us. I like how they let you get your bottle of wine first and drink it while you wait to be seated. They told us it was an hour wait and it does get super crowded  but if I have my bottle of wine while I wait I'm happy.
