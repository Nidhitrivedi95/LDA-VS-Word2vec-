_mg5bYknpZgaWSfjQVmrJQ When I have a coupon or deal, I like to double check to make sure they'll still honor it. I had to ask three people here if they would honor it no one knew and no one offered to find out. Food was fine but the sauce is very sweet. Not what I expected. Booths were large enough to be comfortable.
