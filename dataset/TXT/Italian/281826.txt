I'm hardly ever impressed with the local pizza, but this is really good! Very affordable as well, you don't get charged an arm and a leg. 

Service is always friendly and helpful. 

I've tried the knots and wings as well. The knots are good but greasy sometimes. The wings are okay, cooked well, but the hot isn't that hot and I like my wings HOT. I'm really picky about wings so I'm not complaining really. 

Decent place! I'll definitely come for a slice of pie anytime.
