76u0BfurPWxXTEUdkRTefA I was fortunate to have Babbo's at work last Saturday, catered to us by a generous big-wig there. It's some of the best Italian food I've ever had. Period. The ingredients were fresh, the dishes appeared to be on the healthy side, and the flavor was marvelous. I've never had such delicious meatballs in my entire life.  I would absolutely want their food again.

My only complaint? Their east valley locations can't possibly open soon enough. I can't wait to bring my family and friends to this establishment. 5stars.
