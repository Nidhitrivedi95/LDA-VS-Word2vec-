My experience with Picasso Pizza & Pasta was the absolute worst ordering experience I've ever had. I ordered a Colossal Cheese Fries, and Spinach and Artichoke Calzone at 11:12pm on 4/19 for my boyfriend and me. The order still hadn't arrived after about an hour, and the restaurant is about 9 minutes from our home, so we were getting a bit frustrated. Finally, around 12:30 the delivery driver called and said that she couldn't find our address in her GPS and that the restaurant had given her the wrong zip code. I confirmed my zip code, and she asked what court I lived in, which indicated to me that she knew about the gated community where I live. We waited for another 40 minutes for her to arrive. The driver (Cheryl, as the receipt indicates) didn't even get out of her car to give us our order. My boyfriend and I walked to her vehicle and she handed us a medium sized pizza box with a smushed up pepperoni pizza inside (NOT OUR ORDER AT ALL) and repeated her story about having been given the wrong zip code. She showed me on the receipt, but the zip code was correctly printed on it. Her car was dirty and smelled heavily of smoke. When we asked why our order was incorrect, she replied (in a very rude tone) that "this is what they gave me. I'm just the driver." This is absolutely unacceptable. We had paid almost $30 (and the driver got a prepaid 20% tip) for a cold smushed up medium pizza that took 2 hours to get to us, when we ordered something completely different. I am especially irritated by this, as I am a vegetarian, and can't even eat pepperoni.
