VA95qAV2PRH9gtTi2Vfv4Q The service here is appalling; save yourself the experience.

We were sat during a busy but not overwhelming lunch service. Our server did not look at us even once. For 20 minutes, we watched her serve the tables on either side of us, without ever acknowledging us. Although all three were all sat within minutes of each other, both tables on either side of us received water, wine, bread, and had ordered food while we struggled to get our server's--or anyone's--attention. After 20 minutes, we gave up and walked to Sassafraz, for their reliably excellent service.
