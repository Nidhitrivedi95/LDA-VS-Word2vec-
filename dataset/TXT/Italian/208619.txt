QReGruZEFxovIm9FJVa1kw Zio (which means uncle in Italian) is a fantastic AUTHENTIC ITALIAN restaurant nestled in a Myers Park strip mall.  The owners moved to Charlotte from upstate New York 5 years ago and their food is truly a reflection of their roots!  Simple, delicious sauces, fantastic pizza and the prices are ridiculous (Stuffed Eggplant Parmesan for $8.95!)  If you are in search of some REAL Italian food, you owe it to yourself to try this place out :-)
