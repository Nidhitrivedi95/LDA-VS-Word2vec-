It is a hidden gem in the area as it is stowed away in a non-descript row of shops.  There were plenty of people that stopped in to pick-up their orders so I could tell it was a popular place amongst the locals.  This has a family-style atmosphere and I think it is a family-owned labour of love.

They do thin crust style pizza and their menu offers a lot of white sauce style pizzas.  The toppings are not your text-book pepperoni and etc combinations but rather more Italy-inspired like Shrimp Scampi or Clam Casina.

Between the four of us, we settled on ordering a medium chicken alfredo and a medium mediterranean pizza.  They brought it out fresh out of the oven that the cheese was still bubbling.  The toppings were plentiful (especially the olives on the Mediterranean!) while the underneath crust was crispy and crunchy.

Would definitely drop back in here when I am passing through the neighbourhood.
