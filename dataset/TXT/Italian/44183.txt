88Mq2edCXyXRtjmY_Vkarg I grew up in Pittsburgh eating at Rico's, and it's still the place I want to go to when I go to visit my parents. They have the Pittsburgh zucchini appetizer - I've never seen it anywhere else - of zucchini cut length-wise, very thin, lightly battered and fried, and it's perfect with just a little bit of lemon (although my mom and dad like it with marinara sauce and grated Parmesan cheese). The calamari are just as good and I dare you to eat just one!

Pastas are great, and classic - alfredos, marinara, tomato basil, and pink sauces, all of which are wonderful. Rico's has amazing seafood - strange for a restaurant so far from the ocean, but I would put the softshell crabs I've had here up against any I've ever had. Chicken and veal are also great here.

The one negative (and this is true of many otherwise wonderful Pittsburgh restaurants) is the quality of the dessert. Most Pittsburgh restaurants haven't bought into the idea of a pastry chef, and Rico's is no different. Skip the frozen Mississippi mud cake, cheesecake, and tiramisu, and head to Squirrel Hill (or home) for dessert.
