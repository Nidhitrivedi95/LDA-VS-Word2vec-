LH8S1sUwxg2_TotePOFLvg Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. They have a great selection of slices  until 4pm. The white pizza with a side salad (tip, ask to add mozzarella) was amazing. They made us a fresh order of garlic knots despite having a plethora on display. The sandwiches come on amazing soft, yet flaky bread. I dipped everything in a big bowl of marinara and was in heaven. The staff was super friendly. 

Definitely not a first date place, but the best NY style pizza I've found in AZ. I'm a little bummed I've driven by so many times. We'll definitely be getting takeout and delivery regularly.  They'll also sell their dough to take home. I'm in love with this place.
