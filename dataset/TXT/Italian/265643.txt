wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw Awesome bruschetta boards and wine! Pruscuitto fig and mascarpone is a must! Also awesome environment to hang out with friends or for a date. 

Service was extremely friendly and accommodating. We came in after the kitchen had closed but they were so kind to still make us our bruschetta board! 

Overall great experience!
