xly3K2HgsjvZs5Mu9kSFxg J Bella is one of the better restaurants in Strongsville; certainly top 3.  My wife likes the spinach and goat cheese salad and loves the basil vinaigrette salad dressing. I am a big fan of the chop salad and also the pappardelle alla vodka. Their chicken Marsala is also very good. The service is usually good and there is usually a decent crowd so I know we are not the only people that like this place.  My kids like it too and don't have a problem finding something on the menu they will eat.
