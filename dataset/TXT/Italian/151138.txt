KLivsKKkFU3XxHM3eukVLA I called to order delivery during lunch time.  Because of the great reviews, I decided to try the cheese steak......and got a side of fried mushrooms.

I was told it would take 30 minutes to deliver.  I pre-paid for everything and included a $5 tip on a $15 order.   After 45 minutes passed, I called to see where my order was.  She was suprised it hadn't arrived yet and even said how slow they were today.

About 5 minutes later it showed up.  Don't know why people rave about the cheesesteak because I thought it was pretty average.  And the fried mushrooms were almost cold because they were so late.
