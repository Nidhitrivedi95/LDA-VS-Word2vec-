dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw I had a delightful meal at Fiamma last night with some coworkers.  I had a good feeling when the greeter told us our server would be 'Dallas', since I live in the DFW area... it was just meant to be.  Dallas was a great server, very knowledgeable about the menu - I always give servers at Italian restaurants a menu-workout since I cannot eat basil which is ubiquitous in many dishes.  But, she knew right away which dishes I would be fine with and which I should avoid.   She also gave me a great recommendation when I asked for a cocktail that was sweet and not too strong -- the pear martini was AMAZING.  It tasted like a slightly spiked pear juice.  Probably my favorite boozy drink I have had in years.  I could have drank a 32 oz. big gulp of that stuff (though I probably wouldn't have been able to walk afterwards) -- so a martini size portion was very nice.

I ordered the grilled tiger prawns for a starter and the osso buco as my entree.  Both were terrific.  The prawns appetizer comes with four good sized prawns over a bed of a puttanesca/marinara type sauce -- tomatoes & capers.  Very, succulent and tasty.  The osso buco comes in a bath of sauce with vegetables and mini gnocchi/spaetzle - I think I enjoyed the bath even more than the meat itself, though the meat was fork tender, melt in your mouth.  I think Dallas said the meat was marinated many hours in Peroni beer, but it did not have a beer taste.

There was a good delay between courses but Dallas did ask if we were in any kind of hurry, so presumably service could have been sped up if necessary, but this is the kind of meal you want to enjoy casually and not hurry.  I may try the prawn & scallop risotto next time as that sounded awfully good.  I have to go back for that pear martini though, regardless.
