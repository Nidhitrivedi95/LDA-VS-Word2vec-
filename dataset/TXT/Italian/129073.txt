i4Jb_b28YAphS9_jPPzwkQ I decided to order from this restaurant using UberEATS. I order a meatball parmigiana, Italian cream soda and a cheesecake. Over priced reheated food is all I have to says ! 
The meatball parmigiana was like 14 bucks, it tasted like the meat ball marinara from subway, which could have been cheaper and the cheesecake looks like the one from the assorted cheesecakes from Frys. 
I feel like this business just buys food from elsewhere, reheats it and just vamp up the price to make profit. 

Just got elsewhere and save money
