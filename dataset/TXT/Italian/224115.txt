smBsHggLvIuABgntBvlYLw This is the worst Italian food I truly think I've ever been served. I am insulted that I left them with the $50.00 I paid, for the meal that was placed in front of me. This place is right around the corner from our house so we thought we'd give it a try. 
They were really busy when we got there, which I took as a good sign. We sat at the bar and had a drink while ordering our meals. I ordered the Parmesan Chicken and my husband ordered the Garlic Mushroom chicken. 1 hour later, our food was finally brought out. It was hot, and looked appealing. It all went downhill when we tasted our food. My husbands chicken was SO BLAND, you can tell they used frozen chicken, defrosted it, and boiled it..( there were absolutely no grill marks or browning anywhere on the chicken), very disappointing. My chicken was not much better, you can just taste the difference in fresh chicken and the flash frozen chicken that comes in 10lb bags... Yuck. The most shocking thing was the flavor of the marinara sauce on my pasta... I'm telling you, it was the WORST I have EVER tasted!! A bottle of Ragu would have tasted better.. And it had this layer of grease floating on the top of it... Lots of grease.. Seeing how my chicken was so dry I would have welcomed a bit of grease just to moisten it up a bit.... I'm still puzzled as to where that amount of grease came from?? There was no meat in the marinara sauce... Hmmmm. I am happy to wait 1hr for a great meal, with fresh ingredients. But NOT for food of this quality! I will NEVER give my money or time to this place again! I would have received a faster and higher quality meal at the Wendy's next door. I'm not sure where all these 4 and 5 star reviews are coming from... Don't be fooled, and DONT order the Parmesan chicken or Garlic Mushroom Chicken if you do take the risk and spend your time and money here! Yuck!
