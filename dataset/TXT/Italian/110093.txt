G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Went here for lunch while on vacation last week. Lunch reservations for Friday were all my husband and I could get. We tried two weeks in advance and the dinner reservations for a party of two were completely booked. Completely our fault for not calling earlier, was just disappointed since the lunch menu is a limited menu and I would have liked to have tried some of her fancier dishes.

I am giving 2 stars because of the terrible wait (with a reservation), the crappy server, and the general lack luster of the food.

I REALLY wanted to love this place. Our reservation was at 2pm and when we arrived they said they were a little behind and asked if we'd like to wait at the bar, so we did. The bartender was great! I ordered a white sangria and it was fabulous. Then it was all downhill from here.

A server came to the bar with a returned drink, loudly complained about the guests at his table, and told the bartender to serve the drink that was returned to the next person who ordered it! I don't think the bartender did, but it was completely unprofessional on the part of the server. 

We were finally sat 45 minutes after our reservation, and guess who our server is, the same server with the returned drink situation, disappointing but wanted to give him a 2nd chance.

The food was so-so. We ordered a little bit of everything and there was nothing that I feel is worth writing about, good or bad.

The server was pretty awful. Lunch was over a 2.5 hour process, for appetizers, pizza and salad. Then he mischarged us on the final bill, to his detriment, which we pointed out. When he fixed the bill, he left the cash left by other customers in our check, which we also returned.

As I said, I really wanted to love this place, but it needs some work. Love Giada, hope she gets it right.
