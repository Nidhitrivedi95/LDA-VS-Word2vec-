kz7O0_o6WrDQk1Kl8dKeHQ Another new place at the Colony in my neighborhood.  Great decor. Love love love the music--lots of 70s Blues and R&B.  Great service.  We had the garganelli, fresh greens, frites and the steak.  Everything was fresh, tasty and well prepared.  Good wine and beer selections.  Looking forward to exploring the menu.  Recommended.
