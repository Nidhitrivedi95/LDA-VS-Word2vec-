The entrance is hard to find, but that just makes it more exclusive as it only draws in the savy diners.

There were so many mouth watering entrees and pasta dishes that we had a hard time deciding. That's the great thing about Chinato...the menu comes in two sizes...small/large. The prices of two small dishes equal to that of a large; unlike other places where the delta is so minimal, you may as well get the large; but this doesn't leave you much room for food tasting.  Having two sizes available allows you to try a couple tasting dishes.

The "Col Buco with slow roasted pork shoulder, tomato and white wine" was perfectly seasoned with the long spiral pasta cooked al dente. The pork pulled apart easily and melted in your mouth.

Other dishes we tried were the Mussels with saffron and fennel, gnocchi, and scallops. All were equally delicious.
