q0n882G2DVBD8DMH8NOaVQ Happened upon this restaurant while out Christmas shopping this evening. What a pleasant surprise it was to find this gem in Gilbert. I don't think I've ever been to a more authentic Italian restaurant, everything was amazing from the staff to the food!! The calamari was the best I've had in years and our entrées were out of this world, we were so full we took Tiramisu to go and it was amazing!! We will definitely be back and next time make a reservation, we were so lucky we happened to get in as a walk in tonight!!
