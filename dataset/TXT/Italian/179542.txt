nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Was super excited to come here being a huge lover of Italian food and a Cake Boss fan.  We were seated relatively quickly in the "patio" area for their happy hour.  We started off with small bites right away, but our waiter never came back to take our freaking entree order.  We sat there patiently for half an hour after finishing our appetizers.  He specifically knew we were ordering more since we said we'll start off with the appetizers and asked to leave the menu since we were still ordering an entree.  While we were waiting for him to come back, the host grabbed the menu off our table and gave it to the table next to us, without even asking if we were done. We continued waiting and were so annoyed we didn't even order more food. So after 60 minutes of waiting for them to take our order, even though we told someone to grab out waiter so we could order earlier, we just asked for the check, which took another 30 minutes.  It's not like it was busy. Maybe 25% of the restaurant was full, and they had a separate person seating, a separate person taking order, another delivering the food, and another cleaning the tables and refilling water. Not to mention he was one of like 4 waiters, and the place isn't that big.  He charged us $16 for a medium beer, which is totally fine, but other waiter told us it should've only costed us $12, and then they said just kidding.  Seems kind of steep to go from $9-small and $16-medium. I'm a waiter so I'm pretty big on tipping.  Didn't bother to tip as the service was awful. I think our waiter's name was Danny or something. The host sucked too for grabbing our menu without asking, like dude, come on.  They were middle aged people so this was most likely their full time job since we went on a Thursday. You suck at your job guys.
