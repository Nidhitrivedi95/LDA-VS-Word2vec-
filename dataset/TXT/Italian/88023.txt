DWWK7M6SsQwz0Dd2pOTOUQ Pizza is very good. The best thing though I think is the prices, which probably makes the pizza taste better! I'm here just about once a week and get a large slice with a drink for $2.49-can't beat that! Pizza everything has been excellent. I normally eat in-that's prob the only area to not write home about. But there sports on TV so who really cares???
