-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw Outstanding service by Chase. Truly exception for our group of six adults and 2 tired kids. 

The atmosphere is comfortable and food was tasty, as always at Brio. We had the Gorgonzola beef medallions, 5oz filet, pasta far diabolical with chicken and chicken Milanese. Several substitutions (fries for mashed, etc) and no problems at all. 

Service was quick and friendly. Food was hot. Overall a great experience for a family on vacation. It was my sister in law's birthday and it was the perfect place for a nice evening. The free app with Yelp check in is also a nice perk. 

With the free app, Chase made several recommendations and adjusted it to our needs. We ended up with the bruschetta sampler with 4 steak and 4 roasted red pepper. Omitting the ones with bacon. 

I highly recommend this location.
