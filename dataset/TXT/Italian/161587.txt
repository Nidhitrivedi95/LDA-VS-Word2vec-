llCxryWr8j1S39tusYCWxg I would say 5 stars if we're purely just talking about the pizza, but I have to drop it to 3 when you consider customer service as well. After having ordered delivery from Yo Pauly's multiple times, I have concluded that the owner, Pauly, appears to be aggressive and simply rude at times. If you're okay with possibly running into a not-so-friendly environment or lackluster customer service, but AMAZING pizza, this is the place for you. It's a shame Pauly isn't nicer or more helpful because that would easily bump this 3 stars up to a 5. 

P.S. For all those ricotta lovers who don't like giving up the marinara with the typical white pizza, order the "Not So Whitestone Bridge" pizza. It's on their secret menu and TO DIE FOR!
