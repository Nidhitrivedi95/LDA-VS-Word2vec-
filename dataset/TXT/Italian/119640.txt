H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g This was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We were in town on vacation and ended up in the Venitian. We saw Otto's menu and decided to give it a try. We pretty much allowed our server "Ginger" to pick out our meal and she picked nailed it!! We liked it so much we went back again the next night to try some other items. It is reasonably priced, has terrific service and outstanding atmosphere.
