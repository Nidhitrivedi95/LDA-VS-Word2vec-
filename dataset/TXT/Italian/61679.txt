azE1DNVQFBU8boVbaJhj7w Was staying near the Convention Center and decided to try Lidia's.  Glad I did.

It was busy but was able to get a table immediately.  Ordered the Mushroom Risotto, which was outstanding.  My colleague had the Italian Sausage which he said was also very good.  The menu had some great choices, will definitely go back again to try other dishes.

It's a bit pricey ($100 for two meals, a split appetizers and two drinks each) but worth it.  Probably wouldn't take my kids here, but would be a great date spot.  It's spacious and even when it's crowded, it's not too loud.

Service is very good, food came out at a reasonable pace.
