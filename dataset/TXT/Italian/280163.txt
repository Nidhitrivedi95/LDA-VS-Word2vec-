yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w We arrived a few minutes early to a very crowded establishment. But atvexactly 6:30 PM, our Open Table reservation was honored. For $26, I got home made minestrone soup that was excellent.  There is complimentary red and white wine that my husband enjoyed  (I don't drink wine). I had the ravioli which were cooked perfectly and in a thick, rich tomato sauce. It was served with a very flavorful home made garlic bread. I took home half of the ravioli because I was stuffed. To finish the meal, they save complimentary cappuccino. I would have given 5 stars but the service fell short one our main meal was served. It was nearly impossible to flag down the server after the main course.
