Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag We were looking for a casual dinner spot for our first night in Las Vegas. The menu at Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria and Cucina appealed to everyone in our party. The food did not disappoint. I had the caramelized onion, guanciale, and goat cheese pizza. The crust was light and chewy, the toppings were delicious. Husband was very happy with his Italian meat pizza. Other entrees enjoyed were the eggplant parmesan and linguine with steamed clams. Service was excellent. And the people watching opportunities were fantastic.
