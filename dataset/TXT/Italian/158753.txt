LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Went to this spot with the wife and our friend on Sunday afternoon for lunch. 

I went with the spaghetti and meatballs with meat sauce. I ordered a side Italian sausage. Talk about HEARTY! I have quite the appetite and I stayed full for 12 hours. It was a delicious dish if you're looking for good spaghetti. 

Although I love a lot of different foods, I don't eat any cheese at all. So that limits my choices at Italian restaurants. Regardless, I was very happy with what I had. 

They were very accommodating of my wife who required gluten free. They even sent the chef out to speak with her about any other allergies she may have to make sure they got it correct. Kudos to them for that!

The server was great, the food runner was very nice (came out on a separate occasion from the chef to advise that the meatball is prepared with flour so the wife should refrain from eating it) , and the chef as I previously mentioned. 

Great location, great atmosphere, delicious food.
