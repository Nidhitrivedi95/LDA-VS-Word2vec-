UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ Just got back from lunch after church on Sunday. It tells you something when the place is packed and people are waiting outside.
This place is a gem in a fast food world populated primarily by chains serving the same ol' stuff. This is a legitimate neighborhood eatery churning out food not found anywhere else...yahoo for diversity.
This was my 3rd time back and I had never tried the pizza muffins and decided to give them a shot. Oh baby, an order of those and a salad is a GREAT meal! Unfortunately I ordered a calzone to split with my wife....too much food! But, was it ever good!
Everything has that handmade, mom and pop look ...and taste...to it which is delightful.
I may even go back for Senior night if I can find one of the BOGO coupons out there.
Definately a place to put on your dining experience list. Highest praise!
