eQCYur0033RkZdh5VjbF8A I've been to this O&B 3 times now. I have mixed reviews overall. The food is good, but you pay for it so nothing to be too excited for. Pricing is very comparable to Ki or Jump though, maybe even a bit less expensive. 
The location and decor are very nice. The patio is beautiful and one of the top for core downtown Toronto.

The staff are generally friendly although one of the hostesses we encountered was a bit snotty - maybe she had just come back from working in Paris?

Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars based on the night.
