V_6gs6mUnUwrTQFVvWKW1A It's such a shame this place has poor management.  I used to love getting salads from here until the day my meal was inedible because of store error.  This could have been remedied by simply refunding my money.  The general manager left a message stating she had done so, yet this refund never materialized.  When I called to inform the manager of the missing refund she argued with me that she had processed it the same day.  No idea what the gain is by lying about it.  I'll never eat there again.
