_4n7K_UdRSEMw4vJdsU9jQ We thought we'd try Ray's Pizza as they were one of the closest places to where we're staying and the pictures posted of their NY thin crust pizza looked amazing. And the pizza WAS amazing! Toppings were plentiful and big (particularly notable was the ham, mushrooms, and anchovies... mmmmm!)

Then there was the wings. Another win! "Mild" was more of a medium Buffalo which was perfect for me but just a little hot for the DW. The price while reasonable seemed a little bit higher than a nearby competitor, but the meal was better. We WILL be back and will be looking forward to trying some other items that we fully expect will be just as good.
