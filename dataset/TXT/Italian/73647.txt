CO8MpD1bSkBPArXKBKkIfA Went here for lunch the other day and tried the Japanese Pan Noodles. It was a decent meal. I love any kind of noodles so of course it was right up my alley but I not love that the main vegetable was carrots and not the broccoli and bean sprouts that were pictured. I also love Japanese food but usually the flavors are so mild and clean but this bowl tasted like it had too much seasoning. How can something have too much flavor you ask? Well, it usually involves MSG. According to their website they don't use any artificial ingredients so I am assuming it was msg free but I found that my meal had a shocking 2,010 MG OF SODIUM. The calorie count was 710 calories not including the steak I added so I can only assume the actual calories was over 1,000 (that info was not readily available on the website).

I am giving them an extra star because the place was clean and the staff was friendly. I do see they have other options with more vegetables and no pasta or noodles so I will probably give them another try. Just don't be fooled into thinking this place has healthy food just because they use hormone free meat.
