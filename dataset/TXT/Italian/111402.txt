G0tUd_gFsRMGY3HXQQ3FJQ Not bad for a chain at all, this joint used to be stuck in a gas station down the road if you can believe it. 

We got the typical pizza, wings, hoagie combo.

The Italian hoagie was decent. Some would say they skimped on the meat, but I didn't mind too much. It was a fine hoagie. 

The wings had lots of meat on them and were flavorful. I got the Garlic Parm. 

Now for the pizza itself. It was a thin crust, but was thin without being floppy. It was very soft too, the cheese being creamy and melt-in-the-mouth good. 

No complaints here.
