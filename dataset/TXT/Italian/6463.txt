09E4gjiUN_nSqaTprCLD9A Not your typical Shadyside restaurant, this quaint little place off Walnut is as almost as good as it gets for delightful homemade Italian food, a cozy atmosphere, and BYOB. From the moment you walk in you get the pleasant scent of olive oil and garlic (on a warm diffuser) to get your taste buds' attention. Daily specials include appetizers and our last visit we had a wonderful homemade bruschetta that was fabulous. As a connoisseur of calamari I have to regrettably say that the serving here just doesn't measure up. Rubbery, inconsistent breading, and a fairly small portion don't warrant a $10 charge. Needs serious work.

The spicy pappardelle with wide homemade noodles, spicy sausage, banana peppers in a terrific red sauce is just amazing and highly recommended. My wife ordered the shrimp fettucinni alfredo, which is always risky since the sauce can often be thick and very heavy. Pizzutti's version is light and quite a surprise. VERY GOOD!

The best dessert isn't listed on the menu but ask. It's bread pudding and it's not your typical bread pudding. This will knock your socks off.

Service was very good - just the right amount of attention. No rush to vacate the table, sit and enjoy your wine and good conversation. 

If you want a place that makes you feel at home and one that you can't wait to get back to, try Pizzutti's. You'll be glad you did.
