6We2O5X62J_gduXU7jvf8w I picked up pizza from here tonight so my review is regarding take out only. 
Ordered a medium create your own pizza- thin crust with roasted peppers and red onion
also ordered a gluten free with roasted peppers. 
The pizza was not cooked evenly when I brought it home. Almost tasted like a frozen pizza that was baked halfway. Half the pizza was cooked well but the other half was barely cooked through. The sauce is too sweet for my liking. Overall these pizzas were nothing I would spend $30 for. 
I can't believe I ordered from here and not Nello's...my usual pizza joint which never disappoints. 
NEVER AGAIN.
also, the staff were kind of rude on the phone when I placed the order. Lady sounded really rushed like she had a million things to do. When I picked up my order the lady helping me also seemed really rushed...but there wasn't anything she would have been doing. This place needs better customer service.
