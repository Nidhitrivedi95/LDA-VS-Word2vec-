UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Came here to meet up with a couple of yelpers.  We sat at the bar area to try their happy hour bar food.  I had a strawberry lemonade and as far as happy hour food goes I had the spicy shrimp and eggplant, beef carpaccio, and shrimptini.  

The spicy shrimp and eggplant wasn't that spicy, it was perfect.  The sauce was great, if I was at olive garden I would grab a garlic bread and wipe the plant clean.  The beef carpaccio was delightful.  I wanted to chew on the beef like a piece of bubble gum until the flavor ran out.  The salad had just the right amount of dressing.  The shrimptini is your regular shrimp in a martini glass.

The happy hour goes: 
Monday - Friday from 3:30pm-6:30pm & Monday-Thursday 9pm-Close.

Stop by, if you can find a seat, and enjoy a quick snack while you shop around!
