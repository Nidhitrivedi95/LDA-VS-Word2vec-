RXyM7VrCiEFthJxQ4bGmBg Middle of the road dining, not a place I would go typically, but I have friends that like it so when they want to go, I go. The portions are ample and the price is ok.  I don't like to rate a place based on portion size, but I would have to say this is their best attribute. If you are hungry, not too fussy and want lots of food, this is the place to go.
