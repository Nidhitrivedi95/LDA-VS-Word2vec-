MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg Have eaten at Plantone's several times and even taken it home! Highly recommend the Angry Sicilian sandwich or any calzone or pizza! While you're there grab a yummy hot dog! Yes, you heard me.... a hot dog! Talking about them makes me want one now! 

Great neighborhood restaurant with terrific food and a super staff! Trust me I'm picky so give them a try!
