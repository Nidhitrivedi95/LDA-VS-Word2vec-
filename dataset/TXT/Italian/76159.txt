CS2oAjAiFrJiG2HUtKJUHQ Awesome Italian food.  Freshly made pasta (not from a box), great sauce.  Went in for pizza but was so tempted by the special (sauted chicken breast with spinach, zucchini, topped with fresh, great tasting tomatoes & feta).  It was a pleasure to eat there.  Go & enjoy the pizza, but don't miss out on trying the other amazing options on their menu!
