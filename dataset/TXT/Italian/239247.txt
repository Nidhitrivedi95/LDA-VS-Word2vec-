u71djaZjecGVU1MqMevQ4g Sotto Sotto is one of my most favourite restaurants in Toronto. I've been dining at this restaurant for over 20 years. All the staff including the hostess, waiters, owner, manager, bartenders and the kitchen staff have amazing vibe and great attitude. Such positive vibe and great atmosphere.
The food is excellent. You must try the Branzino with side angle-hair pasta. The grilled calamari is so good. Everything is cooked to perfection. I love the tiramisu cake and chocolate lava cake.
 You must go!!!
