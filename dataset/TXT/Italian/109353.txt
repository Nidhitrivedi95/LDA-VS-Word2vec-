G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I have watched Giada on TV for many years and been waiting to dine at her restaurant ever since it was opened. After several attempts to make a reservation I was able to eat there and I was very disappointed. 

The restaurant is beautifully decorated with a California beachy vibe and felt very welcoming. 

The service was alright and the bread they offer was above average with a tasty pesto sauce which we liked, and then, things started to go downhill...

We ordered the eggplant parmesan which I was very surprised to see was improperly cooked and the eggplant was raw and gummy and the sauce was nothing special. Very simple flavors. 

We then had the octopus salad. The octopus itself was cooked nicely but the sweet potato puree and olives did not add anything to the dish and the salad lacked flavor. Very uninspired. 

Next we had the beef tenderloin on potato chips with curry sauce. It was a cold piece of beef which was overcooked, I could not taste any curry flavor either. We couldn't even finish the dish. 

We were so disappointed up until this point and I suggested with give her another chance and decided to try her pasta and aranchini. We ordered the spaghetti with shrimp and the lemon crab aranchini. The shrimp was over-cooked and the paste although made well did not have any flavor. I couldn't taste the basil or lemon. Just bland bland pasta and overcooked shrimp that did not smell good. The crab anarchic was alright, the lemon sauce was nice, however, by the time we got to it I had totally lost my appetite and felt so underwhelmed and disappointed with the whole experience that we only a few bites and left the dish unfinished. 

I was so looking forward to this experience and had made our reservation 3 months in advance. I wish I could write a great review but unfortunately it did not get close to what I was expecting.
