IqH-J1D0HIP9wyJs2q_uGQ Terrible service.  Insulting people should not work in service.. This last time I gave them another chance they said they don't deliver to me (1 mile from thier store!)

So I ordered from the other store 5 miles away at Park Road Shopping Center.  Anyways they took the order ok and said itll be 45 mins. I called at 1 hour and 20 mins asking where the delivery was..they said the driver came to my house and we didn't answer? (didn't ring doorbell? My family was here with me on New Years Day ready for a movie night, hungry just waiting to call.  We finally called at 1:20 thinking something wrong.   When asked why didnt they call if there was a problem, they said they tried to call my phone but it stated it wasn't in service?  This is the same phone I'm using right now to type this review and rings all the time.

This operation is terrible they'll be out of business if they don't hire some better people.  I think they just lost my order so they lied to me and said they couldn't reach me. They were rude when I called to check!  The guy told me he was the manager who sounded like a teenager. Who knows.
