5p5YW_5bMOSuLIQjkJPO3w It's hard to write this particular review because we did have problems with service and food.  I wanted to like it because it seemed so warm and inviting in the beginning, but then our food order was completely messed up in that we didn't receive our salad for 40 minutes of which are entrees didn't come out for another 10 minutes after that.  The waiter apologized several times and even comped some of our drinks, but the mix-up was a little disappointing.  It was extremely nice of him to try to make up for it and for that, I gave three stars.  I just think the servers/cooks got overwhelmed with the amount of people there - even though it wasn't packed?

But then our food was only so-so.  We started with the Insalata alla Naples - spinach / oranges / strawberries in a balsamic dressing.  It was good.  I then had the special Ziti al Re di Napoli - ziti with pork, beef, San Marzano tomato, mozzarella, ricotta, fresh basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, and extra virgin olive oil.  The meat ragu was a little overwhelming and took away from the pasta part.  The pasta itself was good and overall - very filling, but the meat was too much.

My husband had another special - the Aragosta alla Don Salvatore - Fresh lobster tail served with cherry tomatoes, garlic, and parsley - baked in the wood oven.  It was fine, but nothing he thought was memorable.

Maybe they were having an off night?  Others around us seemed to like their meals, so maybe it was just our meal / experience.
