MYyJ9orpiRq0prjVq4ku7w Great pizza crust, and love their onion rings. My go-to pizza is the special two-topping medium pizza. I order onion and sausage and ask them to make it a white pizza. I've never been disappointed. Solid four-star plus all the way. Delivery is fast and friendly. I like to order online to get the free delivery.

Update 9/6/13: I've ordered from Pizza Fiesta probably eight times since I posted my original review. Was disappointed once when their onion rings were overcooked, and once when their fries with cheese and bacon were overcooked, but I just added a note in subsequent online orders asking them not to overcook/bake, and the next order was fine. This place still gets two big thumbs up from me.
