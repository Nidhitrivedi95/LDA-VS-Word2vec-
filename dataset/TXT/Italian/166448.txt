MDoI5wE1eCLEZUNL-IVerg The address using navigation is a little off, but the restaurant is here! Ordered the garlic knots as an appetizer which were delicious and came with a side of sauce for dipping. The restaurant is set up for dine in but M-F 11-4 you can buy slices and combos instead of a whole pie and get your meal much quicker. One recommendation I would make to everyone is look at the menu beforehand and be ready to order pizza as soon as you sit down because it takes 25 minutes to cook one pizza! This was a fun restaurant and I found it interesting that they match the water PH for cooking of that of New York, New York! The decorations of the building feel like a New York City subway and is fun and interesting. This is a fun restaurant to take friends to and the service will keep everyone happy!
