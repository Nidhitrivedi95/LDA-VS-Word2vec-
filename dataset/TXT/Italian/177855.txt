NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA After reading about this place in Pop City, I was really excited to try it out.  A friend mentioned she wasn't the biggest fan so I was a bit skeptical after hearing that.  They have a great beer selection and while I like how each beer on tap is written on chalk boards hanging at the bar, I do wish they had a beer menu at your table. This was very hard to see. I tried the Sarnac Pumpkin and it was just ok.  We didn't venture far on the menu and ordered the specialties that were boxed. The candied bacon for a starter was delicious-unique flavor. I was disappointed with so few pizza choices. We went with the Black and Gold but did not like the beets-I thought the flavor was too overpowering.  I recommend this place for drinks as the bar had really nice seating and a cute yet trendy decor.
