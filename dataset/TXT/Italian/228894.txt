SZ5KO1KNiwtrktKo5mpuLA This Place is kinda hidden and you have to ride the creepy elevator up... O_O.... but the food is alright.. it is kinda more expensive than chinese food should be but its not bad. Simple soup costs 8$ ^. The pork fried rice was good! Came to this place twice!.. Not bad.... The restaurant looks kinda modern/newish. Not many people come up here... But you should give it a shot.
