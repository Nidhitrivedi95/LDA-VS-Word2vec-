3cbsPfoUUrysf-M8FI_0IA Perfect neighborhood joint to walk to for brunch. Noisy. Tight seating. Often a wait. Beware of deep fried doughnuts & beignets -- quite tasty if hot hot hot. (Nasty if not not not!) Seems to have a constant brunch menu that doesn't change much even if it is chalkboard based. Frittatta, quiche, omelet, french toast, farmer's egg platter, etc. Most served with a decent portion of spring mix salad and burnt-grilled Italian bread. Satisfying and reasonably priced  between $10-$12 per dish with additional sides ata $4-$6. Food is locally sourced. The Polenta Pepperanata has a tasty sauce that is heightened if the egg is cooked correctly, over easy or soft. But often egg dishes here are over-cooked. The Risotto cakes are tasty. The Italian hoagie seems to sell well, tastes of quality ingredients, but otherwise is just an Italian hoagie.
