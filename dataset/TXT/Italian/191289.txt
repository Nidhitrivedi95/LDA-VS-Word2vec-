PebX-Sf_h4FJGgsRAA5Fng What a gem this place is, from the look of the restaurant, the wait staff and the food!!

My family and I went there yesterday for a birthday party.   We were the first to be seated for Sunday dinner.   Their wait staff is superb, giving us plenty of time to order, bringing crayons and pages to color for the kids, splitting checks, whatever you need!

Everyone in our eleven person party loved their entree.  They have the best lobster ravioli....complete with fresh cheese if you want it, scallops and shrimp in the sauce.   My husband had a lobster 
spaghetti special, with a half lobster, mussels and clams on their shells, shirimp and scallops.  Everything was scrumptious, hot and perfectly prepared.

And did I mention that Italian is NEVER my first choice when we go out.  This restaurant will definitely be on my short list of favorite places to dine after last night!   Do yourself a favor and check out this little hole in the wall place, you won't be sorry!
