7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA I've been here twice, and I have to say 'meh'! The food is OK, portions are a bit excessive. Coffee is poor. I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about and why there seems to be an eternal line outside this place on weekends - there are much better places - try County General or venture over to the West Side. Definitely not worth the wait!
