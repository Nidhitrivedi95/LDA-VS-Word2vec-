m6rffQy85HUq82DjLq-YJg So far, I've only been here for lunch, but it's the best lunch spot I've found in this area.  

The wife (M) and I had the chicken pesto sandwich and a wrap the last time we were in, both of which were really good, and this time we were looking for salads. We both wound up with the chicken caesar and the cream of chicken florentine soup.  I told M that the next time I'm sick, she has to come back here and buy a bucket of the soup.  It may be the best soup I've ever had.  

The staff has been very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is very comfortable and inviting.  The food is excellent. It's not a place designed to get you in and out as fast as possible, so if you're in a hurry to get back from lunch, just let them known and they'll make sure that you get done and out in a reasonable time.
