-PUPEpMsjBjk_rX5lFaWng Had dinner from Pesto's last night.  Was quite surprised to be so disappointed in the meal.  Previous dine-in visits and carryout from them were much better.  Let me break it down for you, we ordered by phone for carryout service as we didn't want to miss the State of the Unions speech.  Our order included The House salad, Greek Pasta, Eggplant Parmigiana and Tiramisu for desert.  Yum right!
The House salad was made with Iceberg lettuce that was still in large clumps garnished with out of the bag croutons. To its credit the lettuce was crisp and very fresh. With a name like Pesto's I expect romaine and homemade croutons.  The entrees of Eggplant Parmigiana and Greek Pasta were flat in taste, no personality at all.  They came in large portions as if to divert the lack of flavor with size, no bueno.  We counted on the desert of tiramisu to save the day.  This turned out to be tiramisu layer cake, delicious but not classic tiramisu by any stretch.  This meal cost $50, my expectations were higher and I know they can do better, I've tasted it.
