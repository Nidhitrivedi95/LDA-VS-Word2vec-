PFt0wew2GqfPpesuUC9-cg My absolute favorite place. Anytime I go anywhere near Pittsburgh, I go here. Breakfast, lunch or dinner. Hands down a place that you should try because they have Mac and cheese anyway you want it! Love their deep fried picked, their pretzel bites and their place is so cute. I've never had to wait to sit. Parking could be better but you def need a short walk to the lot after your meal. :)
