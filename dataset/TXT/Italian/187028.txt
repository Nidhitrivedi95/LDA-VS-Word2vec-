oryS4vX0xkKC4tOekgowDQ What a dump! I felt like I just walked into 1313 Mockingbird Lane (The Munster's house) Bizarre decor, old dusty chandeliers, creaky old wood floors and Mexican style colors on the walls. The booths were almost Old English style and I was waiting for the guy in the protective armour to pop out any minute. Service was SLOW for not a busy night. The bathrooms were disgusting. and there were homeless guys out front begging for leftovers. STAY AWAY!!!
