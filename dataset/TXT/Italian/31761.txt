5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ this place is creepy.  there was a cop standing around patrolling all the pizza eaters last Saturday.  what kind of restaurant has police officers parading around to intimidate its patrons?  Hire private security like every other establishment.  Seriously a cop at 2 in the morning at a pizza place on a Saturday.  No thanks.
