7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw An absolute delightful Sunday lunch. Our server was attentive and knowledgable.  My wife and son raved about their Bloody Mary's. Our Chefs plate as an appetizer was a perfect assortment of compotes, cheeses, grilled vegetables, Marconi almonds, fresh toasts, cheese, olives and Prosciutto.

We each ordered three different salads and all were wonderfully prepared and attractively presented.   

My wife and I have dined here a number of times and have never been disappointed.
