ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Great Saturday and Sunday brunch vibes. Perfect for outside dinning on a nice day! My friends and I sat at the community table outside, which did not bother us as there was only 3 of us. However, if you want to sit outside with a big group, you may have to wait for a spot in a Sunday or Saturday morning. 

The Saturday we went, they happened to have a live DJ there. Not sure if that's a common thing but it definitely added to the ambiance. The food was a bit pricey but you do get what you pay for unlike some other places in central phx that charge too much for the quality they serve. I had the breakfast Chimichanga and it was A-MAZ-ING! My friends and I all shared a bottle of Champs for mimosas as well. 

The waitress told us they plan on opening a late night bar that'll be open til 2AM and I def plan on checking that out once it's done!
