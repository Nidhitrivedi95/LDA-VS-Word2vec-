366FaRQ1MWEHBhaEKTcriQ Good pizza. Small pizza is a good deal during happy hour and is a generous portion for one person. The super six pizza was awesome. We dined there and the only downside was that it took them quite a while to bring our food out. I will be going back soon and would definitely recommend it to a friend.
