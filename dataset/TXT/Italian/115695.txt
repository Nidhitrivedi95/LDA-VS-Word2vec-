gtfLQysuCBEAQk3wwWxwTg Outstanding Neopolitan pizza!  So much to choose from!  A real neighbourhood find!  Definitely try the antipasti Eggplant Parmesan, you will be trying to lick the plate when you get to the end.  As for the pizza, there is very little say other than bravissimo!!! Quite simply the best Neopolitan outside of Naples itself, thirty four different pizzas to choose from, you would have to come once every week for over 8 months to make your way through them all - every one a tasty gem!  Alesia, our waitress was outstanding, gave us a wonderful "homemade" ice cream for dessert (gratis) that finished off the meal beautifully!  What a treat.  Dine-in with charming quiet atmosphere; or the incredible take-out deal of 4 of their more modest pizzas for only $40!!!!!   Hard to choose!!  What a great local place for our South Eglington & Mt. Pleasant area!
