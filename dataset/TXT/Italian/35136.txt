6j7kmNdr0aods0C45KWYpQ Simply delicious. I went there to celebrate the end of a session with one of my friend. Close to the metro station in the old port of Montreal, the place is welcoming to say the least.
We started with and entree of calamari and polpette. The calamari while small in comparison to what I'm use to were fresh and crispy. The sauce that was going with it, a kind of arabiatta sauce was just spicy enought to tickle the palate.
My friend had the prociutto pizza while I was delecting  myself with the lobster and bacon one. I'm use to wooden oven pizza but that one, great just great. The lobster was bacon were tender enought and the dough cook perfectly.
The only downside to this place are the seats, we had to change place twice before finding a comfy enough seat to give a proper salute to that meal. Definitely a place I'll return
