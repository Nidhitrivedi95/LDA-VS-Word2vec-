ppT0Rbx0-_W0W8DqY2fPiA Woo-hoo!  This is the best pizza that I have had in years.  The last time I had such good pizza was in San Diego at Ocean Beach where all the poor college students congregated for 99 cent slices.  The jumbo single cheese slices were out of this world... dripping with sauce and goodness... i love the crust too.  And this place remakes those memories with wonderful, tasty, delicious pizza slices.  The crust is simply to live for!  Chicago has great pizza too but for me nothing beats this pizza in CLT!
