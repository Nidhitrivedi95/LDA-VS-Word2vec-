I told him that's quite the hefty statement and chose to go with the Italian Combo sandwich and also told him I'd give the ol' Cheesesteak a shot next time. This guy seemed to know what he was talking about. I then decided to grab a side of two of the pasta salads and try them both. I also got a side of their marinara. My bill total was $19. So cheap!

So I take the food home and I am really expecting this to be absolutely amazing since the reviews on this place are off the charts. And...the hype is real amigos. I tried a bit of everything and I couldn't find one thing to complain about. I hate going to hyped up places because I'm afraid they'll disappoint but I stand by this hype. I'll be trying that Cheesesteak next time!
