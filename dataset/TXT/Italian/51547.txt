9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg Excellent fresh tasting pizza and good service in Saved By the Bell/The Max and/or poor man's Chuck E. Cheese setting. However, I was bit disappointed with stinginess of veggie toppings. Judging from the peeling walls, carpeted floors and location, this is definitely one of the older locations. But fellow patron, don't eschew it because of that; it's actually a glowing gem hidden amongst a dilapidated shopping plaza. No wonder it's beloved by Vegas citizens.

I ordered the Green Valley pizza but what came was Death Valley. The pizza was layered with lots of black olives and sun dried tomatoes. I asked for added broccoli, too. A pizza with an adjective green should be green, right? Not this one. I wanted to feast on a fucking evergreen forest. Nope, it was a vast black desert with patches of green. The ratio between canned and fresh cut veggies had to be 4:1. At least it tasted great and the service was prompt and kind. Next time I'm asking for no olives and sun dried tomato and extra zuchinni.
