abA0s0uxoeOn7zNm-1dDxw The last few times I was there Mia Za's almost always messed something up in our order.  The last straw was when they included nuts in my wife's salad -- I explained to them that she was allergic, they took the salad back and I watched them just pick the nuts off in the back when they thought I couldn't see them.  When they gave it back to me I explained to them that was not sufficient as she is highly allergic.  They very rudely took the salad back and made a fresh one.
