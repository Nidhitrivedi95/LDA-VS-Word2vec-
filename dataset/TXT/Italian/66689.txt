BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg This place is great. 

I ordered a starter of bruschetta, which looked amazing. The crispy pancetta on the top was a nice touch; however the toast points were lacking in flavor and texture, and possibly freshness. I would have appreciated it more if it were served with fresh, toasted (possibly in their Italian oven?!) bread rubbed with garlic or olive oil.

The pizza was dynamite and could not be improved upon. I had a margherita, and my husband had a Diavolo. My son ordered a smaller cheese children's pizza - nice to have a kid option.

Service was good. Decorated nicely. Next time I'll take care to wear something better than shorts and flip flops.
