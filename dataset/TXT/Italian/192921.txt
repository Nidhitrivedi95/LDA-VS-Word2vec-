pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ My all time favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas but don't be fooled by the outside. I've never had a meal there that wasn't awesome but my favorite of all is the Chicken Carciofi.  The service staff is very friendly, the bartenders are cool and the atmosphere is that of a comfortable local hangout that's your go-to place to relax and have a great meal at a reasonable price.
