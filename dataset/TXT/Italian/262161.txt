wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg I took the family here for our daughter's birthday and was very impressed.  The wait staff and hostesses went out of their way to make sure we had comfortable seating for our party and our server was extremely knowledgeable about the cocktails and fully explained every dish and what could be modified to suit specific tastes.  We got there near the end of happy hour and ordered a couple of the pizzas and cheese boards which ended up being a great value!  In fact, almost too good of a value because 8 of us almost got full and started discussing what plates to share for dinner.  Every entrée we ordered was prepared perfectly and was delicious.  North executes on every level that an upscale restaurant should.
