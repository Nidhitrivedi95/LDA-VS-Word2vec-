jRmDrZt6w5cKTJTDfX2X2A I don't know what I can say here that hasn't already been said. This is a great little restaurant, with chefs that are passionate about the food that they make and attentive wait staff. It's one of the shining stars of Pierrefonds. 

On one of the only occasions that we ordered takeout from the restaurant (instead of dining in), we ordered a pasta and a dijonnaise dish. The chefs were so concerned that the quality of food would degrade on the drive home that they wouldn't prepare the packages until we were standing in the restaurant. They built a box with insulation to keep the food hot, layered each item in with extra protection (and insulation), and insisted that we drive straight home (we live minutes away). When we got the food home, it was just as fresh and delicious as it is when we dine in.

As an FYI, this is a BYOW restaurant, meaning "Bring Your Own Wine." People in Montréal understand the concept, but when you are from another city (like us), this is new and will catch you off guard... especially if you order a meal and expect a wine pairing.
