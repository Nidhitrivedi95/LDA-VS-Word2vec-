j54J0Ky4ruVbN_NTJ3daFg My sister and I went out to eat in Shadyside last week and we stopped in Girasole because I heard good things about it.  Since I am a vegetarian, I asked the host if we can see a menu before asking to be seated.  I don't think this was too much to ask but the older gentleman who was the host that evening practically asked me to leave.  He told me that if I wanted to know what they served, just look at the people's food while pointing to the food at a couples table that were sitting right next to us.  He practically put his hand in their food.  I explained that I was vegetarian and just wanted to see the vegetarian options and he shouted that if I'm looking for vegetarian to go next door to the restaurant.  I was appalled!  I turned around and looked at my sister who was just as surprised to hear such rudeness coming from the host of thisrestaurant.  I then turned around and walked out.  I have never been treated so badly as a consumer.  I will never give my money to this restaurant no matter how good the food is.  I will also never recommend this restraurant to any one who asks.  Actually I will make sure to spread the word of this terrible experience.
