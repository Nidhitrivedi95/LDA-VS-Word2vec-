UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ I hosted my sister's bridal shower here and they were absolutely fantastic to work with especially considering I am located in Los Angeles and not familiar with the area, they were very considerate of working with me in order to make this a fantastic day for my sis.

They have two private rooms for private parties that are very nice and elegant.  Since our group was smaller in size, we opted for the public outdoor patio which was very nice.  They also let us bring in our own desserts to celebrate her.

Our food was great which included an aritchoke dip appetizer and then I had their Citrus Green Salad which was really flavorful.

The service was excellent.  Crystal was our catering coordinator who was great to work with leading up to the event.  Michael, the manager, was also super friendly.  Our day-of server (I can't remember his name sadly) was also great to us and very patient allowing us to occupy the table for a long time.  

Would definitely go back there the next time I am in the Vegas/Henderson area.
