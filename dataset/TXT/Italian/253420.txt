VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w When I spend $200+ dollars on a meal, I expect everything to be perfect...not the case!  They burned the garlic bread, and their calamari was of poor quality (lots of squid bodies, not enough meaty rings).  I cannot even remember what I had for the main-course (and Valentine's day meals are usually memorable for me).  The food is priced entirely too high considering the quality and it was just not worth the money.  Overall I say meh...the service was great but that's about it.
