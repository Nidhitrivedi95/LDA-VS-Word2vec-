pvCcrHFAGCml492qoQBsQg Stopped into Ricci's a while back.  Tried the pizza and panzerotti.  Loved the pizza... very similar to Frank's Pizzeria in Niagara Falls.  I was disappointed with the panzerotti.  The presentation was excellent, but the dough was a bit thin... taste wasn't really there.  I think most people would enjoy it, still a good product, but I've had better panzerotti at a number of other places, including Comino's in Whitby.

Friendly service, family atmosphere, counter ordering.  Pretty good experience overall.  Would definitely have the pizza again, maybe try the veal sandwich.
