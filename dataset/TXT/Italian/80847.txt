dcFMlXIEun1ax2ebW_Y7-w Food seemed like it was left out for a long while.  For the price my friend and I paid, we deserved a fresh one!  Lame that they brought both our food out at the same time although we ordered at different times.  There were coupon deals for the whole food court on the tray.  Gayness.  My other friend received the deal late too.  Had we known, we would've saved a little.  Oh well.  At least I'm tipping you off for the future!

You're welcome lol
