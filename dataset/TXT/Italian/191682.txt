pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ I am a little surprised by the negative reviews because we had a great experience. We arrived pretty early (we were on Texas time so we were starving), and it took us a bit of time to be seated. If you open at 11, and I come at 11:02, I expect you to already be open and ready. 

We started out with the free foccacia bread which was great. I really enjoyed it, and it was a huge portion. 

I ordered the paglia e fiene, and my husband ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. We both really enjoyed our meals. Mine was super creamy and fresh, and I loved the mushrooms. The chicken was tender and had great flavor. My husband raved about his spaghetti and meatballs and actually wanted to go back the next day. (I nixed that. Too many restaurants too little time.) He said the meatballs were not dry at all, and had great flavor.

I was also confused by the complaints about the patio. It's a mall, people. I didn't mind it at all and thought it was nice to sit by the fountain. 

We would definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas.
