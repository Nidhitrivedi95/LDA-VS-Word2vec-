lwpQQflP1CGJPV7QLybzOg Be warned.... This business includes a line item for "rounding" on their bill.  According to  the consumer-protection folks at the state Office of the Attorney General that rounding up without an explicit and clearly visible explanation to customers is a violation of the law because it amounts to an undisclosed charge and a deceptive practice. The amount may be just a few cents, but that consumers have a right to a bill charging them for the total of what they ordered, nothing more.  When I questioned the bartender about the rounding practice and stated i didnt think it was ethical or legal his quote was "Whatcha gonna do?  Sue me?"  Hummmmmm...
