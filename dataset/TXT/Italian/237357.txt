u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Postino's is my go-to carb-load-locale.  While the decor is rather industrial for my delicate Rococo sensibilities, it's always a warm environment for a rainy day--or the more frequent sunny day.  As for food, I always opt for bruschetta: great to split for a great price.  My personal favorite is the Sheep Milk and Tomato Jam.  A bite of this is like a bite of Christmas.  Try it and you'll understand.  Of course, everyone is nuts about the Pear and Brie, as well as the Proscuitto.  If your a vegetarian or keep kosher, opt for the Proscuitto without the proscuitto, as the figs and mascarpone carry boatloads of flavor and delectability on their own.  I'm also a sucker for the Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios.  The NYC Grilled Cheese is always a great choice as well--a savory treat that brings you back to childhood.  For non-wine drinkers, go for the Cucumber Honey Lemonade (and don't be intimidated by the icky sci-fi bright green color--the sweet and fresh taste is well worth it).  Of course, if you are a fine wine connoisseur or just a recreational drinker, hit up this classic Arcadia locale on Monday or Tuesday when you can get a bruschetta board and a full bottle of wine for just $20... incredible, I know.  Overall, everything at Postino's is pretty incredible, and so I highly highly recommend it.  Happy dining and wining!
