PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ We went here from my cousin's recommendation it's down the street from his townhouse where we stay at when we're in Vegas. It's casual atmosphere with fine dining type of italian food!! The owners are from brooklyn they're great and super hospitable and just great overall service!

Some Positives: We ate for dinner the first night we arrived I ordered lobster ravoli it was delicious with great chunks of lobster you can totally taste it, it tasted fresh and authentic! My cousin custom ordered crab cakes on pasta with vodka sauce it was awesome all crab crab cake delicious!! My bf ordered spaghetti and meatballs and it was so yummy moist and flavorful!! We enjoyed dinner and was stuffed!! Large servings of pasta are hard to finish. The owner was teasing us for not finishing our dinner and happily packed it up and was just as great as leftovers! Dinner was fine dining quality and was of great value under $15.

We came back for sunday brunch and let me tell you I didn't think a restaurant could get any better!! I ordered creme brulee french toast and I've had this before and really doubted it could be found somewhere else and they blew the other restaurant out of the water!! It was great tasted exactly like creme brulee!! But I would recommend getting the maple syrup on the side it can get too sweet. But I loved it and I loved the price it cost $7.50!!! And as usual we were greeted with a warm good morning and offered free drinks I got my fill of mimosas!! Yummmm!!

My cousin may start working there that might be even better!! Great place a must try don't judge a restaurant by it's strip mall location!! 

Some Negative: it's in Vegas and the pasta is too good to resist I may be a fat whale glad it's in Vegas then!!
