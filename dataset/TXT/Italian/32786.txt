5ykOWYZ44sUvu9qxD8rPeg Needed to find a new lunch place in Scottsdale so I searched YELP..found this one and we tried it.. 

Very charming little spot. We ate outside and that was absolutely pleasant! Asked what to have and we were recommended to have the Biaggia. (Fig, prosciutto, arugula oh my..!) it was perfectly devine. 

Prices were perfect for the individual sized wood fired pizza. Def going to go again! We have been looking for a good wood fired pizza with similarities to the el Vicino Pizzas(CO) styles. yaaaa :)
