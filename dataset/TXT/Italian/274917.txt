y8ELffgkORhv6G8oZGJwUA If you've never eaten in a top notch Italian restaurant I could  see why this is a 5 star.
I've read other reviews of bad service and bad attitude. We had a great experience and good service. The young lady that was acting as the head server was wonderful. She took our order, suggested a wine, and made sure throughout the dinner we were happy.
It's a very impressive little, intimate place. I do like the atmosphere.
The most important thing, obviously is the food. Reading the menu the variety was impressive and different from the regular Italian restaurants. Unfortunately the food missed on flavor. Everything seemed quite bland. It seamed like there was one thing left out of most of the dishes. The only thing that had a lot of flavor seemed to be the Caesar salad. I couldn't eat it all, because it was actually over powering.
