xkiYAerQQXL25legNhVsSw The pizza is good (which is why I came back) but the service, especially in such a ritzy part of town, was not so great. I even went back a second time just to give it another shot and bought a gift card for a friend too but the service was still not good. We stood at the door a long time while the hostess was on the phone taking orders. My pizza never came out and I had to eat it by myself when it eventually did come. The calamari was good and so were the salads. Just wish the service was better, much better.
