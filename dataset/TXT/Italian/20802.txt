366FaRQ1MWEHBhaEKTcriQ My sister has been telling me to check this place out forever now. I'm glad I did! Ordered a personal pepperoni pizza and it was delicious.  The cheese was just right and that sweet sauce completes it. I got the thin crust which was a little thicker than I'm use to but still good. Rarely does restaurants  have RO (reverse osmosis) water, the water tastes clean and fresh which is probably why their crust taste bomb. Will definitely be coming back!
