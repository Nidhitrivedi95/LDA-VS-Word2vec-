G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Ok to start reservation made for 4 at 9pm. We got there and they said they had 3 people for 915pm.   At 945 pm still had not been seated  MGR paid for drinks and finally sat us.  We live in Las Vegas and can tell you the atmosphere is pretty good. The food better than average.  The management a little lacking.    Would we go back.  Probably if there was event there but I doubt we would make a special trip as we would not want to wait 30-45 minutes after reservation scheduled to eat.   I mean if the food was a 10 maybe.  But it's better than average so there is no reason to wait that long.  I think once the "new factor" wears off they will have to step it up to compete in that market against stiff competition.
