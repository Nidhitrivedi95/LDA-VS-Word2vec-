0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw I've been to Joe's Farm Grill several times and is usually pretty decent but my last experience was awful and I will not return.
First problem.. my wife always gets a pizza, we stood in a long line and she was decided on what she wants. . We get to order and was told no pizza available. Ok she has to figure out something else while people are waiting behind us. She orders a salad, I order a burger.
Next problem.. there is a 3 year old that was just rolling around on the floor now STANDING on the counter where people pick up their food. Lovely.
Next problem... I notice several people that were behind us in line have received their order. I go ask what's the hold up and was literally told "we forgot your burger".  It's finally made and rudely shoved at me as if I am being impatient.
Lastly.. as I am eating outside the next table has a dog standing on top of the table. I love dogs and all but not where I eat. On top of the table.. really? Wow.

I will not ever be back.
