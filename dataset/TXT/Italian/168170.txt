MjAuGkgPjNLyMrN74_0YbA Again, I was shocked that this place was rated so low! I just adore this place! The bf and I went for our anniversary last night and it was my first time! 
We shared a bottle of champagne; they had a great selection!!! 
We started with the calamari, which was spectacular! The sauce is sooooo unique but completely delicious! I had the potato crusted grouper. It was simply outstanding!!!!! Cooked to perfection and served with a delicious sauce. Wow. My bf had the lamb and he raved about it! (I don't eat red meat so I can't weigh in here..) 
The service was extremely attentive, never letting our water or champagne get low, never letting a dirty dish sit too long. 
I applaud this place for being an old staple of Cleveland and continuing in being outstanding!!
