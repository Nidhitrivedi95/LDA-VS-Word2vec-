N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg Went back to give it another try, this time we ate in and when we arrived was told there was a 30 minute wait, was advised that we could put in our order while waiting and was also given the option to order from the bar.

Decided to wait to sit in the dining room and put in our order of a large deep dish pizza with sausage and mushrooms on on course butter crust dough.

Instead of waiting 30 minutes it turned out to be around 10 minutes. 

Our waitress whom I did not get her name was fantastic and took care of us. In fact the customer service has always been great.

The pizza arrived shortly after we were seated and it was definitely not the same pizza we had for take out, was just like we remember from Chicago. A lot t h icker than the first time, the tomato sauce was much fuller and the sausage was much better, but the major difference was the crust. So much softer and the butter crust that we love. 

When I had my first review, Meghan, from Lou Malnati's responded quickly and asked to make things right. I also received a letter from Marc Malnati which I was totally surprised and impressed that they cared so much about customer care.

Hat's off to Lou Malnati's, they made tremendous corrections to up their quality to what you would expect from the Chicago Pizza Stores.

We will be back for more.
