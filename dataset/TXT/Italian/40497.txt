7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ This place is a joke.  This is a late review but I was there for dinner with my wife for our anniversary and a show (phantom of the opera) the last showing. We ordered dinner to eat there. We asked the server who was the only nice person about salad size and was good but cost for 6 lettuce cut in a square and an anchovy and toasted bread on top. Was told good for two but not for one.  Got the side of mash with the egg and bacon which was the best. My wife's steak was cooked good and mine was cooked four times!!! Never right. I had to watch her eat then when mine was right she watched me.  I paid 290 dollars our bill which I should have walked and missed 15 mins of the show!!! Called next day to mgr and was told sorry come back we will make your meal with no mistakes. What pay 290 again hell no!!! Mario own restaurant was disappointed. Ppl walk away save your money
