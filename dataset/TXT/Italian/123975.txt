HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q Amazing selection of gelatos!

You know the expression "your eyes are bigger than your stomach"? Well, everytime I go into an ice cream parlor and see a looonnngg stretch of various flavors, I get excited and start imagining getting a multiscoop behemoth to eat. All by myself, too!

The gelato counter is the first thing you see from the entrance, and all the bright colors are just dazzling. Once you get over the hypnotic display, you take a closer look and realize just how many different flavors there are.

I was torn between the amaretto or the tiramisu flavors, but ended going with the tiramisu because it had a certain "bite" to it. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it was laced with a bit of marsala or some other alcohol =).  I only got one scoop because I was full from dinner, and I was a bit startled by the sticker shock. Almost $6 for one scoop??

Then, I got the scoop and it was pretty big. In fact, my single scoop almost looked like the size of my friend's double scoop! 

The gelato itself was definitely rich and creamy; everything you look for in a good gelato. It had tons of flavor (along with the "kick" mentioned earlier). I would definitely recommend that you try out the tiramisu flavor if you stop by.  Also, a single scoop is definitely enough for one person, because I couldn't even finish mine completely (and I can eat a whole Ghirardelli's Square sundae by myself).  However, I think that is due to the richness of the gelato itself.
