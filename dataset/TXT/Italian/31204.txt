 What isn't great? We had very slow service, were told we were getting drink refills that never came. I've never seen so little soup for $4, I could see the bottom of the bowl when it came out. I thought the sausage in the soup would be flavorful but it was quite bland. 

My coworker ordered a full salad and got a much smaller portion than should be expected for a main course. And the pizza is a complete embarrassment, looked like it came right out of a grocery store freezer and tasted like it, too. You should think that a place like this would have great Italian sandwiches, but another coworker remarked that it tasted no better than what's available at your generic pizza place. 

I definitely won't be coming back, despite frequenting this area often for work lunches and to visit friends.
