wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g I was going to a show at the Venetian and wanted to try some place different and Canaletto came to mind.  I made a reservation for 5:15 and was seated promptly when I arrived at a two top table on the patio where I had a good view of the Venetian's "street performers" and the tourists walking by.

I was quickly brought a nice bread basket--more than enough for one person--and the server asked if I wanted balsamic and olive oil.  Declining the balsamic, I went with the olive oil and put some salt in it for the extra flavor I like.

I asked about the soup of the day and it was broccolini and that sounded good so I ordered that.  For the main course, I got their three pasta dish with pennoni al ragu, house-made ravioli filled with roasted pear, and pesto gnocchi.  My two favorites were the tubes topped with ragu sauce and the ravioli.  There was a bit of tomato/water mixture from not draining completely but I was surprised how much I liked the traditional meat ragu.  The ravioli were very good, also, and they had a very nice flavor given the pear filling, something I wouldn't expect in pasta.  The gnocchi were the least favorite of the trio.  They were heavier than I like them and the pesto sauce was lacking.

For dessert, I got a wonderful lime tart that had a tasty cookie crumb base.

These are Strip prices but not as bad as one sees some places.
