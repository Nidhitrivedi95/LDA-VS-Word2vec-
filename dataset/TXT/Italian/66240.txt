bNNF6Z91L7Omfdi8QSo2_w Il Terrazzo is located within the Phoenician.  We had a continental breakfast here on Saturday morning before our hike up Camelback and had brunch/lunch here on Sunday so we could watch football. 

Saturday morning was fine, the continental breakfast is quite pricey ($17 per person) but luckily we had two coupons so we got it for free.  The breakfast has the normal oatmeal, cereal, fruit, muffins sort of thing.  Sunday morning was much better because we ate at in the bar area.  Sunday they have bottomless mimosas included in the price of the breakfast, which was great since it was our last day and we were leaving in the afternoon.  We were able to use our voucher value towards the price of lunch instead of having the same breakfast as the day before.  I had a turkey club on foccatia bread and the BF had a cheeseburger.  Both came with fries and both were quite good.  The service was fantastic.  

All in all, the only reason this is a 4 instead of a 5 was because their hostess is quite unpleasant.  Not only that, I'm highly confused as to why this seating process takes so long when there are tons of open tables in the dining room and most people are going for the buffet area.  

Tip: Sit in the bar area, you get the same menu, same prices and better/friendlier service without the wait :)
