NHzdf87ObSNIXrT5axTubQ Their customer service is awesome! I usually order carry out since I live pretty close and I just get great customer service every time I've gone. Their food is what one should expect, it's Pizza Hut, so it's as good as that goes. They always have me check out the pizza before I walk out with it to make sure it's correct, and are good about offering their sides (Parmesan cheese, crushed peppers, napkins, etc.) This is a great location! Keep up the good work!
