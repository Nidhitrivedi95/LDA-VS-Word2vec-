SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw The calzone I ordered was good, but only mozzarella cheese.  Our table also ordered a small pizza, which smelled great and I'm told tasted great.

The owner and an employee were both friendly and welcoming. It's a small strip mall, store-front place.

Minuses: They were out of sub rolls so I could not try my first option of the chick parm sandwich. The dining area was too warm as if the A/C was off that day.
