jluEI1ZDQDeJlbl-M3YH3Q I am staying at the hotel so I decided to try despite average reviews.  Wait was long but finally the hostess showed up.  Be prepare for a long wait which isn't bad since the view is incredible.  I ordered the seabass.  I wish they clearly say Branzino.  It was over cooked but the vegetables was perfect.   I'll come here just for the view and the ambiance but the food isn't all that great!
