aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ Soo, last night was my 2nd dining experience at NoCa and it definitely blew out my expectations!! 

On Sundays, they do a "simple supper" where the menu is limited to only a few choices of entrees...everything else is set! The best part is that the price is set at a bargain $35 for all 3 courses and they offer a simple cocktail (last night was a cherry lime martini) and a simple red and white wine each for $5! (The rest of the wine list is available though!) 

As always, the service was impeccable and I really enjoyed the Bartender! He was super helpful and even clued us in on one additional special starter they were offering of a sea urchin panna cotta with lobster for $14. Now the BF and I love sushi, but aren't huge uni fans. OMG am I glad we tried it! The BF described it as the ocean with a touch of cream! Pure heaven! 

Our second course arrived as a simple salad of beets. It was fantastic and we both nearly licked our plates clean! For the entree course, the BF had the flat iron steak, while I had the halibut. Both were simple, delicious and wonderful! There was nothing left of either and specifically, the celery roon and parsnip puree was amazing! 

Next came the standard cotton candy course which is always fun and then dessert! Who doesn't like an ice cream sundae with all the toppings of your choice!?!? The BF literally ate all the hot fudge while I indulged in the roasted pine nuts, strawberry sauce, cookie crumble and cherries! So delicious!! 

Really, this food is great and I love the idea of the simple Sunday menu! It changes every week, which is posted on their website, and it is a great, less expensive way to try some of the best food in AZ! Can't wait for Sunday now!!!
