Wait staff was friendly, and the Baklava for dessert was very tasty. The only reason that I refuse to give 5 stars is because the whole time we were there (I shit you not)the same song played over...and over...and over. I mean Zorba's Dance has a tendency to make anyone tap their toes, but not when it's on perpetual repeat.
