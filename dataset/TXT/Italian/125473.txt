Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A After reading all of the wonderful reviews on Caffe Boa I am sad to say I didn't have a good experience there. First off, let me mention I didn't taste a morsel of food. I was in the area with 4 other friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30 - on a Tuesday. Our friend had called for a reservation for 4 and when we showed up with one extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress - She would have to push two tables together in a practically empty restaurant. She sat us and we sat, and sat, and sat. 

We were never greeted. Not even a water.  We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes.

Well, we got up and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our odds of being acknowledged will be greater. :)
