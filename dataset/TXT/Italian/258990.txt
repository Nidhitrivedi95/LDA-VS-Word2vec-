WH6TE8U3B5BLRU2Ih4b4mw Your resident 'za expert/lover/religious follower here! I'm generally a VPN girl (i.e. no stranger to floppy pies) but I'd heard good things about Falasca, so I came for supper on a sweltering evening. They were serving their dinnertime thinner round pizzas (the "R" in S.P.Q.R., which stands for Specialità Pizza Quadrata Rotonda - now you know).

I tried the Salmone (Scamorza cheese, fior di latte, smoked salmon and arugula, $13.75) and the Quattro Formaggi (also $13.75), both of which were too salty and fell apart immediately. They were still good, but the cheese consistency (note: I'm also your resident fromage expert/lover/religious follower) was very weird. Bouncy and squeaky and so rubbery. I've never met a cheese I didn't like, but I wasn't totally into this. I don't think I've ever said that about a pizza before so I'm pretty much questioning everything I've ever known right now and wearing a tin foil hat.

We also had an unremarkable house wine and another member of our party ordered a red pizza that she enjoyed.

Reviews are so positive that if I'm in the neighbourhood again during lunch hours I'll totally give it another shot with the "Q" pies (the al taglio dough is sturdier), but my dinner experience was average.
