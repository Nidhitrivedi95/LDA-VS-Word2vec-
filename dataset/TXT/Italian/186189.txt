oP0eUhf44jU71-I8DwKU5A We gave this place one more try after two mediocre meals over the past couple years. This was definitely the last time we waste our time and money. First off, we had to wait in the entry at the hostess station to be seated for way too long, having to smell the cigarette stench from the adjacent bar area. After being seated, we were handed menus that were worn and disgusting. The pasta entrees were overpriced and bland and were served without bread. I asked for bread and after 10 minutes, some stale generic Italian bread arrived. 
Save your money and avoid this place.
