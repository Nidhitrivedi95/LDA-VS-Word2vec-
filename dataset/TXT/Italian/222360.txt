sH9aI3xg-POBMp8R-kSQZg Fantastic osso bucco, grilled chicken cutlet parm. I heard that they have chicken cacciatore so definitely have to try that!! It's alot of work so can't wait to test it out. The bruschetta is wonderful and I want to try the calimari as it seems to be made in flour. Awesome restaurant and I can not believe I missed this gem.
