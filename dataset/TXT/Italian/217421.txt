RyTEGJz5tG7zC73BdXt-cQ I came here with a co-worker for lunch today. He raved about the wood burning oven and how good the pizza was. We arrived prior to 12:00 pm since, in my co-workers experience, the restaurant is very busy at lunch. After a small wait time, we ordered the Gorgo Shroom pizza. This pizza comes with Gorgonzola cheese, mushrooms, red onions and black olives. Finding a seat wasn't difficult for us, but by about 12:15, there was no longer any seats available, so I'm glad we arrived early.

The pizza arrived and after taking a photo (for my review), we dug in. Thin crispy crust, mushrooms and the bite of the salty olives are a delicious combination. This pizza puts to shame all the "chain" pizzas, they cannot compare to the flavours of not just the ingredients, but the crust itself. 

The restaurant is clean, bright and the shelves are stocked with lots of items you buy for home. From pastas to olive oils.

The staff are friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. I plan on returning again and can't wait to try another pizza or maybe a pasta.
