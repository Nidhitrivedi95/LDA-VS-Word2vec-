P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw I used to love this place, I would frequently order from here weekly!!!!! On Friday evening I ordered a sheet pizza and sub which was delivered and not right.  I called to complain and they said there was nothing they could do since bitesquad delivered it. My mom then called again complaining they said they would remake. So we went to pick up pizza and an employee of naked city pizza gave us an attitude and then gave us the finger!!!! This attitude and behavior is completely unacceptable for the customer service industry! I don't think I could ever return even tho I was born and raised in buffalo and this is my only little piece of home I have out here. Completely unacceptable.
