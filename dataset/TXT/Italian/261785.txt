wSpUTl9Bho2WRo9C5p_-Pg I stopped by Sauce the other night in a search for a new pizza place. Sauce is a great choice for pizza. Fresh ingredients and cooked perfectly.   The service time frame is just right and the atmosphere is inviting and relaxing. The staff are friendly and I received superb service from a young lady, I believe her name was Lauren...personable, great smile and came to the table to ensure I was happy with my order and asked if I had everything I needed. As I was leaving, she thanked me for for coming in and once again hoped I had enjoyed my meal. It is rare to experience great service such as this at most establishments. I will be dining there again!
