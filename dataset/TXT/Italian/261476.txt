ws09HDqOIfyKMN0TSp3YKQ Fitchburg has always been good service. The challenge I have seen is the new staff is still learning the ropes. The staff is working hard to make sure 'consistency' is in their focus. If you are a foodie, local management is very much a excellent food, excellent service type. Many a time I have had the excellent experience of quality thought out food and service. Though they are working to create a consistent staff that is trained, they do a rather good job as they build up the staff. 

Beyond the local. . .concerns.

Beyond the Noodles in Fitchburg and wider Madison, it seems the upper management of the "brand" of noodles is taking the company into a more 'fast food' approach. My concern is that food quality and customer service will suffer for all Noodles nationwide.  

Remember, if you like noodles, you are the one that can make it great. speak back to the feedback on noodles. Speak you mind to what kind of food and dinning experience you want. 

I love my noodles consistently and good staff. Smiles, good service and a of course EXCELLENT service.

NDLS. Have you seen these gift cards? You know why? that is there STOCK Symbol. This unfortunately shows where their mindset is when giving a high quality experience. Upper management has changed over the years and now the response to my concerns are "oh i am sorry you had a bad experience, we can get you a $20 gift card and you can try again". I don't want their money, I want the company I use to know that was about customer service. 1. Food 2. Customer Service. It has been difficult to get a consistently good meal from the Noodles & company "brand" for sometime now. They are not training cooks to cook consistently. When they can't get mac-n-cheese to be done correctly something is seriously wrong.
