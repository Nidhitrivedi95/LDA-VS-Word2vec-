8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA We ordered the 4-topping thin crust pizza for delivery and we found a piece of pebble in our pizza. Absolutely unacceptable and dangerous! I called the next day (we got our pizza, 10 minutes before their closing time) to speak to the manager, Tiffany and the person that answered alleged that the manager won't be in until tomorrow. If I don't resolve this issue the next day, I will contact the BBB.
