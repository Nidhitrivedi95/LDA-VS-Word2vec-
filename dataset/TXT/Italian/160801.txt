I like that the slices for the lunch special are larger than the slices you get if you just order a whole pizza from them (although their whole pizzas are a great deal too). So basically you're getting 4 slices when you get 2 for the lunch special. All for $8 for the two of us.

As far as dining-in, I don't usually like to. The place is run-down and not so cute. But I love supporting local businesses and this is a great one. Beats Domino's or the recently stingy Papa John's any day.
