GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ I was at the Venetian yesterday for the Consumer Electronic Show.  I decided to try B&B Burger and Beer instead of driving somewhere to eat.  

I was surprised that the place was not busy at 12:45 PM.  I sat at the bar and ordered their Bar Burger (build your own), an order of fries and ice tea.  I mentioned my server that I don't want salt on the burger and fries.

It took 17 minutes before my lunch was served.  The burger was average.  I ordered it on a sesame seed bun with lettuce, tomato and added Provolone cheese.  The bun was not soft and chewy.  The lettuce was iceberg lettuce - no nutritional value to it.  A single slice of tomato - could not taste the tomato.  The burger was cooked medium instead of medium-well as I requested.

The fries had six to eight full length fries.  The rest were broken pieces of fries.  The fries were good and fresh.

The cost:

Bar Burger (burger, lettuce and tomato)  $10.00
Provolone Cheese (all cheeses on the menu) $2.00
Fries $2.00
Ice Tea approximately $3.00 

My total bill with tax was close to $23.00 Wow!

I would have been better off with convention food. 

A much better place to go is Bachi Burger in Las Vegas.
