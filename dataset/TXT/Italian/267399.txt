XD0LjNuPPwJPsTAHecUh7A I really like the buratta here is delicious! Was a little disappointed with the duck ravioli but the gnocchi with the ricotta was amazing!! If you haven't tried their croissant stuffed with gelato and Nutella... it's a must! Also their tiramisu is one of the only ones I like in the whole city! 

Definitely a great place to get some dinner
