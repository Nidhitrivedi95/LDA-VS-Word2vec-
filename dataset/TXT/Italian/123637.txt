hmfAdo6LuVOvBLiu75C8ZA We stopped into Luca for the first time, and WOW! I cannot say enough good things about the entire experience! We started by calling them because, with some road construction, our Garmin wasn't helping find them. The staff was so helpful from the start. We didn't have reservations, but luckily we were early, so they worked us in. This is a lovely venue, with great views, nice ambiance, and wonderfully presented and delicious dishes. There are lots of choices on the menu, and the waitstaff went out of their way to answer questions and make suggestions. Every member of the staff was friendly and courteous, and treated us like royalty.

We love Italian food, and the meals we chose were really amazing! This is a top-notch restaurant. Too bad we were visiting from Chicago, or we'd frequent Luca often. We may decide to take a weekend drive just to come back from time to time for dinner!
