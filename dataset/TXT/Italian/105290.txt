FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q Great food, subpar service. The food was delicious. They start you off with garlic bread that is savory. I got the lasagna with the side salad, my partner got the chicken Parmesan. The side salad was legit. They gave us a big bowl and we tossed it at our table then plated it. They also give you the dressing and Parmesan cheese in small bowls which is a great perk. You get to add however much you want to your salad! The entrees were both succulent and tender. The reason for my 4 star versus 5 is the waiter. We had to ask 3 different people for our check and repeatedly kept getting passed up. He would check in with the tables at either side but not us.
