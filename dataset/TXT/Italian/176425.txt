nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ This was a great decision in an area with so many options. Fine dining Italian at it's very best with a beautiful decor. 
 We didn't have a reservation on a Friday early evening and we were quickly accommodated on the patio which has heaters. We shared a few dishes including the fantastic meatball app, some of the best ever! Gnocchi with pesto was perfect, finished with fresh roasted pine nuts and the pinot noir matched nicely the dishes we selected. 
 Service is top notch and the staff works as a team. Our server was right on, checked on us and knew when to leave us to enjoy. She was awesome! I'm very picky with Italian, this was the best we've had in the area. We had a very delicious and comfortable experience and we'll be back soon. Highly recommended!! 5 star all the way!
