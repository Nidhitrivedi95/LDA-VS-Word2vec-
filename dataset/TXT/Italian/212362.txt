It is my favorite deli in the Phoenix metro area.  Anyone that moves here from a place with good delis (like say... New York or Philly) will be sold after the first trip.  It's not dirt cheap, but high quality food is worth the moderate price.

If you're wondering what to expect, imagine this: a mafia informant got relocated to Arizona. His wife was feeling lonely so he brought his father-in-law over from the Old Country to keep her happy.  Being a cranky old codger, the pater familia became annoyed at the lack of quality delis in the Phoenix sea of chain restaurants.  So he started a little place where he could get good pasta, good sandwiches, and quality groceries when he wanted Mama to make some stuff at home.  And it's staffed by people who all speak english clearly... even if they have a mexican accent.

The service can be a little slow, but it's worth the wait if you've got 20-30 minutes to spare.  I don't have any kids, but I would gladly give up someone else's first-born for one of their "il purista" sandwiches.
