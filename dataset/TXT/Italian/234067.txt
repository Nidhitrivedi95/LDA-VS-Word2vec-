tpGr6-jVv_dFSnDGcVL3rw This may be the worst Pizza I have ever had. The salads look like they are the same quality as Mc Donald's pre packed in plastic in a refrigerator case. Service is SLOW and this is really just another junky pizza place with marketing that is far better than the place it's self. 
Go to Grimaldi's or Humble Pie instead. Even papa Johns is better.
