ohEGwJtSqrVd2SD-FKKrUQ We wanted to have a really good authentic pizza and didn't want to revisit Pizzeria Libretto; they are overrated.  Found NC through Yelp and we are so glad we decided to try them out.  NC had the most amazing pizza ever! Parking was a breeze, restaurant was clean and spacious, a really pleasant restaurant for a family, couples or just hanging out with your friends.  They have a nice flat screen tv so you can watch as you wait for your food and a really nice bar.  The service was excellent, we were seated right away and the food didn't take long after we ordered.  My boyfriend ordered the Ragu pizza and he loved it.  I had the Ortolana pizza which had Mozzarella & grilled vegetables (they are very generous with the toppings!), it was delicious.  Although we were both very full we could not resist the restaurant made tiramisu.  The tiramisu was amazing!  The mascarpone was velvety, the ladyfingers were perfectly moist with coffee and the chocolate syrup was a delight.  It was the best we ever had, it took us back to Rome.  Make sure to ask for NC homemade hot sauce to add to your pizza, it is the best hot sauce I ever had.  They sell them in a cute small jar to take home if you like.  We would highly recommend Napoli Centrale to anyone who is looking or craving for really good authentic pizza.
