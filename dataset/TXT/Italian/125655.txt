Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A First time here.  Service was impeccable and very timely.  Read other reviews about the water - but server greeted us with fresh cucumber water immediately.  He was less knowledgeable about the wine, and the glass he helped my husband choose was the most expensive, and not good (we think the bottle had been opened from night before, it was warm and not pleasant).  But he was very helpful, gave wonderful recommendations, etc. 

We ordered oysters which were marvelous.  My wine (Merlot) was the right temperature and great tasting.  I ordered server's recommendation: Agnolotti Pasta: Mushroom Ravioli with Tomato Cream sauce, and added meatballs.  Superb - al dente on the fresh pasta, the sauce was more tomato than cream (bulked with cheese, not so much cream, he told me), and the meatballs were wonderful. We also shared a SoCal salad, which had light champagne dressing that was perfect. 

My husband ordered Fettucini Bianca, after reading another Yelper's review.  He added salmon.  It was bland, he had to ask for pepper, and still couldn't get it to perk up.  He said the salmon was the most flavorful part (I'd questioned whether adding salmon may have hindered the flavor of the dish).  

Told our server, when he came to offer dessert, that we just realized we were late for a show, and he returned the check and the credit card transaction happened so quickly, I didn't even notice it.  So he was very in tuned to our needs, responsive, and a delight throughout the experience. 

The only reason we didn't give this a 4 or 5 is because my husband's meal was less than stellar (could be our taste buds, but....) and at $16/glass of his wine, it wasn't good. If the review had been based from my meal alone, it would've been a 4-5.  

We'll be going back and giving it antoher shot - the atmostphere is really great.  Service was wonderful.  Food tasted fresh.
