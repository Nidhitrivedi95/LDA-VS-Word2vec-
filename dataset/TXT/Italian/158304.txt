LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA I love this place. It's perfect for a date or even if you want to have a nice dinner with family. They play really nice music like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin and the overall ambiance is perfect. Oh! And the food is delicious. I have gone several times but most recently Hailey was my hostess and Martin was our server. They gave great service. It was my boyfriends birthday and Hailey was so nice and courteous when she made my reservation. Martin was very attentive to our table and helped us chose which good wine. Great place to eat! I highly recommend.
