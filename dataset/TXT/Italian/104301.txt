FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA I went to Postino Central on a date last night and it was great. The bar is really spacious and the staff was very attentive. I had the Bruschetta which offers many to choose from. My date chose a great selection: Brie & Apples with Fig Spread,Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese,Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios,Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese.  We also shared the Vegetarian Panini which was great. They have a great wine selection as well. You can order by the glass or bottle for a little more. I recommend this as a great spot to go out, especially if you are in the area for a venue.
