6PQve0oFCLPSh4wnIzvJtg I'm going to make this short and sweet, due to the fact that I don't feel a need to put any more thought or effort into this horrible establishment. 

Pros: 

The party napkins were a nice shade of red that appealed to the eyes. 

Cons:

Service
Dining Experience 
Soup was terrible and cold
My mom makes better meatballs and she's a vegetarian 
Food order was completely wrong 
Restaurant doesn't know the difference between ziti and penne 
Total lack of knowledge from staff
Low quality taste in food 


So many more negative thoughts on this place. Just want the owners to know they ruined a much needed family dinner, and that I will never be coming back nor recommend this place to anyone.
