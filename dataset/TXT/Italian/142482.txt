jpOT1ctnCzl-zWXR4Uyu1A Chain Italian restaurant.  Friendly hostess and waitstaff.  They have whole wheat pasta, which is fabulous--and can get any pasta dish switched to that.  I had a chicken, artichoke dish-asked them to make spicy--they used crushed red pepper flakes.  I could have done that myself, but it was good.  Hubby had a creamy gorgonzola pasta dish that was fine, but unremarkable.  We both finished our pasta dishes, and I ALWAYS have left overs to take home--so that tells me portions are small.  House salad, bread and garlic oil is a-okay, too.  Will I go back?...eh...I wouldn't make a special trip there, it was fine, not fabulous.
