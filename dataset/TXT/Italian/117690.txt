Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw So I went to this restaurant with a small group (7 people) and got reservations on Open Table. There was plenty of room when we arrived but you can't be too sure with a group. The restaurant is located right near the canal in the Venetian shops. It was small, intimate and had good decor. 

We all ordered different things off the menu which was good, since I got to try multiple dishes. I got the gnocchi which was good and also tried the Casanova fettuccini. The real show stopper was the carbonara. That was the best dish I tried there and it was one of the best carbonara dishes I've had. If you go here that is the dish you need and you won't be disappointed. 

Service was good and quick. We reserved at least an hour and a half of our time for dinner and were in and out in less than an hour.
