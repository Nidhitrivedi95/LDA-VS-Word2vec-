XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ Decided to give this new restaurant a try and was not disappointed.  The portions are not huge,but large enough to fill you up. The menu selection and specials give you a wide array of Italian dishes.  The wait staff was very attentive. Giuseppe and Nico the owners are present and actively involved. The decor is simple and modern the open kitchen concept is really nice. The live music was a bit too loud but very good. Everyone that went in our party had different main courses and enjoyed them.  The desserts were amazing
