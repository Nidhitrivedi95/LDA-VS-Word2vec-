1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag Well I can't write about the food because I never went. I bought a Groupon and it states you must make a reservation to use the Groupon. I called during business hours 3 days in a row with no live person answering. So the 4th day I called I finally left a message on the answering machine that says 'if you'd like to make a reservation leave a message and some will return your call'. Nobody ever called me back. Then I used the restaurants website to make a reservation. Today at 11am, I made the reservation for 5:15pm but didn't get a confirmation email until 4:00pm? So I just cancelled it. How does a company have a business and not have a live person answer the phone and if you're going to have people leave messages, call them back! What a waste of time. Thankfully Groupon returned my money.
