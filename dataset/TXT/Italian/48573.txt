98V9R-7YT20KmcmJyMiJmg Disappointing dinner Friday night, food was ok but nothing spectacular. Speaking with people around us and nobody enjoyed their meal. We had the asiago chicken and salmon meals. Asiago chicken was tasteless, I did not detect a hint of asiago, my wife had the salmon which smelled fishy... Not a good sign for 'fresh' fish. My meal was cooked ok just tasteless and no wow factor. We won't be back.
