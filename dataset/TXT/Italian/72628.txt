I haven't ever had a truly amazing experience at an East Side Mario's but this was particularly bad.  It was a quiet Monday night and our guests wanted to go to a reliable chain restaurant, this being their suggestion, so out we headed.  

On arrival we were greeted by teenagers in very slopped very wrinkled white shirts and handed menus - with four inserts apiece.  It was a very awkward greeting as we fumbled with menus towards our booth.  

My guy and I usually enjoy their sizzling calamari al diavolo appetizer and we enthusiastically ordered it again only this time the calamari was soggy and lifeless.  As the waitress put down the little cast iron skillet, another staff member was shouting at her about something or other and she was yelling back across the restaurant (which certainly wasn't packed).  Not 45 seconds after our appetizer was served our mains followed.  I cannot describe how irritating I find that.  I realize that food should be served quickly, but I hate being barraged by plates and generally feeling rushed.

My main was a chicken alfredo dish which was rather tasteless.  The sauce was under seasoned and the noodles claggy.  

I won't be returning any time soon.
