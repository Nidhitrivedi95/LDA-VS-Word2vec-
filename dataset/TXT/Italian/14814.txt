1kVicFRGjgUrB6IezlTTdw I've been to Focaccia several times now. (It's the sister restaurant to Bloom, another favourite place of mine.) The place is tucked away on Hayden St, in what looks to be an old house. The dining room is fairly small and cozy. (There is a larger dining area up stairs for private functions.)  The service is great. The host is always (as far as I can tell) Larry, an (incredibly) friendly waiter. If you don't like having conversations with the wait staff at places you go, then this might be a place to avoid. The food is Latin American and sort of Italian in style. I've always been impressed with what i've had. The menu changes with some frequency. Prices are pretty reasonable for a place of this caliber. They also serve brunch, which is pretty fucking awesome. The place is probably worth going to if only to try brunch there. (Picadillo empanada Chilean style FTW!)
