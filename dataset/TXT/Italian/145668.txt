k4PFaATcPO0tvTetNbdm8Q I'm an Italian woman living in Toronto. 

Table of 4. Saturday evening 7pm reservation. We got seating outside, which was very nice. Our waiter however brought down the experience to 3 1/2 stars 

He wasn't friendly. Seemed irritated, could have been a bad day or that's just him. 

You can't order your apps first. The kitchen wants everything ordered at once. So we did, no big deal. 

NO WINE LIST - you have to choose by picking a bottle from the wall. Wine by the glass, red/rose/white is kinda chosen for you...

***  DELICIOUS Italian food ***
The food was the best part of the visit. 

When we asked for parmesan cheese for our pastas, our waiter started to argue that it would take away from the taste of the dishes....... BS

So, Food GREAT, service slow and not the best.
