AYLxEeVq8NKG2UhcBiggrA This spot was on the radar thanks to the good word spread by super CM Kris U.  With a long shopping trip at CostCo followed by a draining stop at IKEA I was ready for my dinner here. Made a reservation via Open table which somehow didn't reach em but since it was a weekday and we were kinda late we were seated immediately. 
For starters we got the freebie of garlic bread thanks to the check in offer. Good indication on the quality of the dough as it was quite good. For the mains we went for St. John's (margherita) and group of seven sans the olives pizza.
Wine list is OK and is all Canadian wines (read you need to order a white here) wasn't in the mood for a beer though the limited beer selection looked interesting. 
On to the pizza the dough itself is decent though I wish it was cooked little bit longer or at higher temp as it did have a slightly soggy feel. The tomato sauce base on St John had bit of acidic finish the group of 7 had decent toppings. 
I would say 3 stars for the pizza. Kudos for the service here as we were checked on consistently and the staff was all smiles.
