Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA This place is great!  I love their pizza selection - a lot of new and interesting combinations (one of my dining companions noted that their pizzas are too weird) but if you like that kind of thing, then this is your place!  I got the brussel sprout pizza that came with pancetta, and it was so good!  My only complaint is that the crust was a little too large and took up too much of the pizza.

I also got the half TLC salad that had mixed greens and beets.  Yum, I love beets and always enjoy having them in a salad!

I also appreciate that they take reservations for lunch.  Servers were very friendly and although the parking lot is small we had no trouble finding a space at lunch. All in all, a great experience!
