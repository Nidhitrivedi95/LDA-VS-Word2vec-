HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q I go back when I am in Vegas because the coffee is good but this last time over Thanksgiving, the customer service soured me on this place. We waited for someone to help us where we thought was the right "line", we waited and waited. Finally, the counter lady said the line was some where else, a few steps away. She saw us there waiting and let us wait and made us go to some other lady to order. Then after ordering, waiting some more for our coffee, we notice the other lady helping customers after she made us go somewhere else! Basically, service sucks. Please refresh on your customer service skills or get new employees so I can return and enjoy your coffee.
