yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg The Chicken Carolina you cannot go wrong.  They need to change out their table balsamic as it seemed a little stale.  The table bread was decent, the butter was really good.  The house salad was also very good and a little different from traditional Italian house salads.  The service was very good.  Go to places like this while you can as they are few and far between.  You cannot have a bad dinner at a place like this with this atmosphere.  A hidden jewel in Old Town.
