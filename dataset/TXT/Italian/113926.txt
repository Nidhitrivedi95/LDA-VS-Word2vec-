gjATEWAllTfxfxhGqJ93sQ I've always wanted to go to Italy to sample a pizza, and if it's half as good there as it is at Il Focolaio then I need to book a ticket asap. Actually, scratch that I'll just keep coming to Montreal.

The restaurant itself has a great atmosphere and the staff are helpful and friendly. I was seated immediately and served really fast.

I ordered the Hawaiian pizza which comes loaded with ham and black olives as well, of course, as a generous helping of pineapple. The pizza was cooked to absolute perfection and I was more than impressed. 

I opted for a cappuccino after dinner (which tasted fantastic) instead of dessert but was definitely tempted by the fare on offer. 

If you are in the area you definitely need to try this restaurant.
