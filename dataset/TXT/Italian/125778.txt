hrNIDao4XnOhrv7aaFehTg Good pizza and kind staff. Shoutout to the blonde chicks working night shift. There was a mistake in our order and they immediately remade the pizza and gave us the mistake for free! Not a lot of places would do something like that to accommodate their guests. Will definitely be back!
