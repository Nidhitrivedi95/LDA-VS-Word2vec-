Osrd8qGmr49JCucc6tTTYw Great place to get a giant veal or meatball sandwich...love the taste and freshness except for the mushrooms which are definitely out of a can but the veal is delicious and the bread is soft, love  sweet sauce but not a fan of the green spicy sauce it ruins the sandwich...owners are really nice and glad to see a mom and pop sandwich place spreading instead of typical smart centre crap
