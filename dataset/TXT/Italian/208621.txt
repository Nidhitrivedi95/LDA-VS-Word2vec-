QReGruZEFxovIm9FJVa1kw I love our CLT Yelp crew and we could probably hit the crappiest 'raunt in town and still have a rad time. It was also snowing, or trying to. Still had the regs show up ready to nosh.

Zio was good, accommidating, comfy. Our annoying questions and distracted ordering were handled with aplomb. The bruschetta puree was, I'm assuming, intentionally chilled, and I dug. 

Thanks, TR, for getting us here - tucked away where it is, I'd probably have never made it here on my own. Parking looks like it could get rough but there's another lot next to the one directly in front of Zio, so I imagine you could stick your vehicle there in a pinch.
