-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g Some friends and I traveled to Montreal last weekend and ate at Le Serpent on Saturday. Every aspect was fantastic. The space is super cool. Great cocktails and amazing food. Probably the best foie gras I've ever had and one of my favorite restaurants to date actually. Sam was our waiter and he was the best. Super knowledgeable and so fun. The whole staff was so welcoming. Thanks Sam and Le Serpent! Highly recommended!
