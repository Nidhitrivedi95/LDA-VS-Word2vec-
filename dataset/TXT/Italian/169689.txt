mRrgBIT8vsYdI3YSfzCQhg Everything about this place was amazing, from the service, ambiance, drink and FOOD! I had the Chinese pancake as an app, maple glazed salmon for a main, and the eton mess for dessert. I was with a table of 4 and each of us got something different and we were all impressed. Will make the trek back!
