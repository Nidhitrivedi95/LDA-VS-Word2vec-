OL_dFyhAt3CVtbbS-DpgUw I had such a positive experience that I've taken the trouble to post a review on a few different websites. Great ambience and food, and a very courteous owner! 

I was really impressed by my experience at Hogan's restaurant. It's a really neat, historic spot that I don't think enough people know about. We met the owner who's a really nice guy and he told us that there's even a ghost... named Patricia! We're from Niagara where there are a lot of ghost walks so this was a really fun and intriguing story to hear about. 

Everything that my husband and I tried was really good. I'm a bit of a salad girl and I love that they offer 3 "serious" salad options at dinner. I always try the kale salad everywhere I go. I'd like to try the mushroom salad next time too which sounds delicious. My husband was excited to see Beef Bourguignon on the menu. A++

Don't hesitate to check this place out. Not just the restaurant -- the pub looks very lively too.
