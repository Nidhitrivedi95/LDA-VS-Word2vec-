HSoKTWnsu7f3yvywWvBQ4w Tried this place out yesterday and went in and had 2 slices of their pizza.  The place was surprisingly completely dead in the heart of lunch hour.  I mean, it was just me for a full hour?!?!  I guess that should have been a sign.  At the very end of my lunch hour, 2 more customers finally came in.  The inside of the place is very nice, especially for a strip mall location.  While waiting, I asked about the delivery radius and gave the lady my street address and she said "I got you" that they could deliver to me.  I was excited to have a new pizza place to order from in the area.

Ordered from them today at 2:10 pm.  They said it would be about 40-45 minutes.  No problem, that's pretty fair.  After exactly 1.5 hours I called to ask the status and they said "Oh you're 1 mile out of of delivery range".  That's pretty frustrating considering yesterday they said it was fine, and today when they took my address, no issues at all.  They didn't call back to tell me, even though it was fine yesterday and fine today when they took my order.  It's a husband/wife owner, the husband asked his wife if she tried to call back and she flat out lied and said she tried to call back to let me know, but no missed calls on my recent call list.  The male owner was very argumentative and unapologetic.

As many of the other reviewers stated, expensive for what you get and very poor customer service.  I don't expect they'll last too long, so hopefully the next pizza place in this location will be able to deliver better honest customer service.
