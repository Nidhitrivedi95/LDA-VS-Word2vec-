TVKenh65WwJX3zEr36zKCA Incredibly nice staff. My husband and I have been here numerous times and always have great service. Tonight however, we were disappointed. We waited over an hour for our entrées while sitting at the bar and had to leave disappointed. I understand that restaurants get busy but when people are seated next to you, twenty minutes AFTER you've already been sitting there and they get their food BEFORE us, something went wrong. Unfortunately, my husband says we won't be returning even though I love the Oyster Bar. :(
