mOFCSkPUPKjISMDhvz02HQ My husband and I decided to try this place out since it's not far from our house. We got there about 5:45 and noticed they had happy hour on the appetizers, so we got some spinach artichoke dip. The dip was fantastic! Very flavorful with big chunks of artichoke. 
For the main dish, we decided on a margarita pizza on traditional crust instead of thin. It was brought to our table and it was thin crust...? We didn't say anything, we were hungry. So we both dug right in. It was so loaded with balsamic vinegar that after a couple pieces I couldn't do it anymore, so I stopped eating it. Between the olive oil and vinegar, it was dripping making the crust "soggy". 
So we finally get our bill, and she had charged us full price for the appetizer which should have been $5 instead of $8. 
Overall, it's a cute little pizza joint, but for the quality of food and the lack of attentiveness from the staff it's safe to say, go somewhere else. We won't be returning.
