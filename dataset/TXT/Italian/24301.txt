47Uu-2MceSRFmohdzCOvGQ We have eaten at Mamma's several times over the years and are never left wanting. We thought it would be a mixed bag during the Festival, but we were seated within minutes and the staff were very helpful and polite - which can often be hard to find in the city on a Saturday night - especially in the Grassmarket.

I was a bit disappointed with the lack of spinach on my pizza, and finding out after asking for more that I was charged for it. Also, they automatically add an optional 10% gratuity to the bill - however, if I ran a restaurant in the Grassmarket, I'd probably do the same.

Mamma's is the only pizza place I've seen that does a gluten free crust - which I'll definitely have to try next time.

Now to eat my left over pizza...
