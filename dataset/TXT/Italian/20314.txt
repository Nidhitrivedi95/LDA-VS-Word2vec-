I got a #1 and my cousin got a #6 so I got a taste of both. Both of these were pretty plain, I was still hungry when I left the place. The bread was pretty toasty and crunchy however I wish they would ask us if we want the bread toasted or not because it's really hard to chew on it. My jaw got a workout that wasn't needed. If the bread was softer I probably would have enjoyed my sandwich a little more. I think $8.25 for some salad and a little sandwich that isn't the GREATEST is a bit pricey. 

They have chocolate which is pretty good but also pricey I believe it was $25 a pound. 

I wouldn't go here a second time and if I did I'd try pasta.
