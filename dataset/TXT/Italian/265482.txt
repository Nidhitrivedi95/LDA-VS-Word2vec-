wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw This is going to be my first Postino Visit not counting Windsor or Churn. I rarely get into Gilbert for work but this downtown area has some good stuff all around like Joe's BBQ, Liberty Market, The Farmhouse Restaurant. Everyone here was pretty cool.

I had the vegetarian white bean hummus with cucumbers, yellow heirloom tomatoes, olives, greens, tomatoes with an artichoke secret sauce.$10. Loved the meal. HH in this wine bar of course brings $5 glasses of vino. I ordered a California Pinot Noir. 

I rarely sit on the patio but this place has a beautiful outside area and open air seating. I absolutely love the towering Gilbert Water Tank, giving up a great rural feeling. Good bye, city life. Something else here is the large grassy area. Plug some fast growing mesquite trees and the yard will be all that.

I am going to have to give the Central Ave Postino's a try, in the old Katz's Deli building and reminisce over the $2. egg plates.
