pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg Came here with a large group to celebrate a birthday and we were seated upstairs. We were seated about 30 minutes after our originally scheduled reservation which was a little bit off-putting, but we were greeted warmly by a waiter as soon as we were seated.

We ordered several salads and fried calamari, all of which were tasty. We also ordered several pasta dishes, none of which were that impressive in my opinion, with the exception of the meatballs which were pretty delicious.

I tried a couple of their blended drinks and was very underwhelmed and disappointed, especially since this a restaurant located in Vegas.

Overall, the portions are big, the prices are high and the food is decent, but nothing to write home about.
