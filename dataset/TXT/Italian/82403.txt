DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw I had my wedding on the patio at Ferraro's! it was spectacular from beginning to end! The patio is a beautiful setting for a wedding!! The Ferraro's are SUCH gracious hosts for a special event like this. The waiters...arent waiters...they are professionals! The caliber of service is impeccable...they know how to provide EXCELLENT service without being intrusive. The quality of the food just simply cannot be matched in Las Vegas or elsewhere...this family brought their expertise and passion for great dishes to Vegas thirty something years ago i believe...and I bet the quality only goes up with each year! IF you are considering a beautiful family birthday, wedding, anniversary or just want to take someone out for the most elegant of experiences...go to Ferraro's...you will NOT be disappointed!! Liz J
