Very disappointed. It's been a while since we ate at Nora's. Used to be regulars. Food is not the same as it used to be. Sauce was bland. Marsala was salty. The anti pasta salad is still very good. Ravioli could have been better.  

The service was mediocre. Never came to refill water. Very slow.  We had to ask to get dessert.
