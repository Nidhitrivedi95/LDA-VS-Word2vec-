fnPefa87H-3CJnDungeetQ My order total was only 28$ dollars and they charged me 36$ on my card. I called them and asked them why it was that much they said I wrote an 7.-tip even though I never wrote a tip on the receipt.. I told them that I never wrote a tip and they said there was nothing they could do about it... wow worst customer service ever...
