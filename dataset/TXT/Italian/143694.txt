JTKzGJvIK9yuoUf-erV2qQ Wonderful pizza! Very rich crust with a good helping of cheese. My wife and I wanted a good pizza for dinner and this surpassed our expectations. The peppers and onions they used were obviously freshly chopped and were the perfect consistency. I called ahead for take out so I cannot speak for the service. I would definitely recommend.
