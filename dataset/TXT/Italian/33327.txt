5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA The design is nice, the view is great, the staff is fine. If you like traditional Italian food this place is going to disappoint you. Probably even traumatise.

I had spaghetti carbonara and that was the most upsetting experience. Past was way overcooked and was soaked in molten butter. Believe me I eat a lot of food with high fat content but this pasta with dripping fat was horrible. Please don't order it if you had a normal (not American-style) Italian food before.
