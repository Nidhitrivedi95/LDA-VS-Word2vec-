laSyDWzuKb1wo1XWFEUsWQ My wife and I stopped by for a celebratory drink and were pleasantly surprised  The bartender was cheery and engaged us in conversation without being overbearing.  The beer selection was more than adequate (10+ selections on tap), and prices were very reasonable.

We looked at the menu, but just decided on an appetizer for this trip, but the options seem very good.  The garlic knots that we did order were delivered quickly (within 10 minutes) and were hot and tasty.  

From our experience the service is top notch and the food was good.  We definitely intend to return on an evening for dinner to give this location a proper chance.
