hmfAdo6LuVOvBLiu75C8ZA We chose this restaurant based on the great reviews it had and the supposed great views of the city. We were severely disappointed in our dinning experience. The food and views were mediocre at best. At the start of our meal, the bottom of the bread was burned- it was beyond crispy to the point of charcoal. The veal tortellini dish was inedible as the only flavor that permeated the dish was asparagus and there was no trace of veal. The gnocchi were swimming in the tomato sauce. Finally, the squid ink ravioli filled with lobster was a disappointment as the crab and lobster meat that accompanied the pasta were over cooked.
