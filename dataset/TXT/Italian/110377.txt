We were seated for a late dinner around 9:45 and were rushed into ordering because the kitchen closed at 10:30.  For this price, why would you seat people when they cannot order at a comfortable pace?  They were also out of a few dishes that we very much wanted to try.

The food was unique and delicious, but not up to the level that the prices and atmosphere would suggest.  I enjoyed the food, but it was nothing compared to what I have experienced at similarly priced restaurants.
