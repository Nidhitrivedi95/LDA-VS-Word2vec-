UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w Oh boy!! Are you looking for a place that has true Italian food. Well I got the place just for you! Oh yes I do! It Papa Pinny's Pizzeria... The food oh so good it feels like I just walk into Italy kitchen. Each bit you take you can taste the fresh products. They make everything fresh when you order. They are all very friendly and welcoming as if they had known you forever. The food is not slapped together like some place but made as if it they was serving their own family's. Best place that I have found so far...  The prices are very good to. Very reasonable..
