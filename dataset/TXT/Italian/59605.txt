AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw OMG!!  I really love this place.  I've been here twice within like a month.  I really wasn't expecting this spot to be anything.  But me and my brother have restaurant battles and he definitely 1 up'd me with this one.  The exterior design of Okra is so cool, very simple, modern and upscale look/feeling.  You walk through the hallway and enter the restaurant and you are welcomed with the savory smells of their fantastic food.  My favorite part was the bar (I promise i'm not an alchy lol) where they make amazing hand crafted drinks.  I honestly can't tell you the names of all the drinks we had except for their version of a pisco sour.  What I can tell you is that you will never be disappointed with any of them.  Side note, ask for the dates and the fried chicken skins, oh my goodness!  I can not express how awesome this place is.  I will make this a ritual to come here at least once a month lol.  Keep up the great work guys!!
