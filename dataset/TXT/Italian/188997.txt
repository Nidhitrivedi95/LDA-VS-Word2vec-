OXrFWgoz533T8tMRemkiww If you are able to sit outside, or in the main dining area, it is a comfortable and warm environment to have delicious verde gnocchi (smaller portion and very filling) or eggplant lasagna ( huge portion & very filling ). 

My boyfriend and I went during the busy dinner time ( a little after 6pm) and were greeted and told we could sit at the wine bar for quicker seating. We followed the waitress past the traditional dining area in the front and past the cooking/ dish area to get to the stairs for the wine bar seating. It was much darker inside and somewhat noisy (as a bar typical would be with a TV and dim lights) , but the food is ALWAYS worth the wait.  

Overall, 5 star meal. 4 stars only for the walk to get from dining area #1 to #2 .
