_mg5bYknpZgaWSfjQVmrJQ First time trying out the new local pizza restaurant. My daughter is the pizza expert so we ordered a cheese and sausage pizza. We had been ordering from NYPD for years because we like thin crust. Overall the sausage was tasty. The sauce was light. The cheese was really good. They delivered in a timely friendly manner. Will go there again. Next time I will dine in. It looked nice inside when I peeked in once.
