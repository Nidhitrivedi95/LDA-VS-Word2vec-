1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ I have eaten at three different Maggiano's locations.  This one was the worst!.  The first server was just plain off her rocker weird.  We didn't come there to learn her life history or hear her complain about different customers.
Food was terrible.  I ordered the four cheese ravioli. A different service dropped off the plate and literally ran away.  As soon as I could get the space cadet server's attention, I asked the plate be returned to the kitchen.  She asked why.  Seriously.  It was plainly clear; it was burnt darn near to a crisp, I was like "why don't you look at my plate and tell me what you see?".   Then she said, oh my it's burnt..   And that was an understatement.  That plate should never have left the kitchen, unless you all like dark brown burnt cheese covering your entire meal. 
It was lunchtime and the place had plenty of open tables, now I know why. 

We left and never went back.  Then in Vegas last weekend, saw another Maggiano's at the fashion mall and thought we would give Maggiano's another chance.  Only because the one in Washington state (Bellevue) was so awesomely good.  Well, it was a bad idea, as the cook did not properly drain the pasta and the dishes all three of us had were so wet/mushy it was gross to look at and this one dish, Tuscan pasta with shrimp, was served in a bowl so full of water it looked like soup......Chicken Parm - had no flavor, crust was burnt on the bottom and the pasta what was supposed to come with it was wet, mushy and hiding under the burnt chicken - the entire plate was just worthless.  No flavor at all.  Burnt chicken, mushy pasta, watery sauce.  I have made it better myself....

It was a complete waste of my time and money. Both the Scottsdale, Arizona location and the Las Vegas strip location.
