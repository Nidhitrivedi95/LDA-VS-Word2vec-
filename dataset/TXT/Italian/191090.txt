pCWg4B0R5gauQR4SJ9VDmw I always come in for the spicy Italian sub. I don't know if it's the vinaigrette, the fresh meat, or the right amount of mayo but stumpies has it figured out! 

I also recently tried the wing ding pizza. I'm not sure what a wing ding is but holy hell it's delicious! It's chicken and cheese with a buffalo like sauce. That's the best way I  can describe it. One of my favorite pizzas now. 

And the service is always A+! It seems like it's mostly high school kids that work there but they are trained right and held to high standards. I have never had a bad experience here!
