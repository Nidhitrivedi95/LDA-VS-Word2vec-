duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ As a college student I definetly couldn't afford to eat dinner at this excellent but expensive restaurant. I was lucky enough to be invited to dinner by a friend of mine, whose parents were in town and were staying at the Four Seasons.  I loved the ambiance the wait staff was professional, courteous, and attentive and provided the level of service you would expect from a luxury hotel restaurant. I think what's unique about this restaurant is that you can have any dish in an appetizer size or an entree size, and the dish is priced accordingly. I had the clam linguini, appetizer size and it was delicous the white wine sauce was superb along with the pasta, freshly chopped tomatoes, and clams.  Verandah also serves excellent bread while you wait for your meal. If you have an expense account, I highly recommend this restaurant.
