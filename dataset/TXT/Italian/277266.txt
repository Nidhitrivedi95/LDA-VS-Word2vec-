Just got home from our Date Night.. we love Italian food and we wanted to try something new.. 
love love love the vibe, it's not too bright not too dark, it's just right.. friendly, happy and good music.. we started with appetizers ARANCINI AND OCTOPUS delicious! My husband ordered the chicken piccata and I ordered the braised short ribs both ahhhhmazing.. for dessert we had 
Panna cotta with strawberry drizzle, tiramisu, & lemon poppy sugar donuts w/ blueberry drizzle
Our server was thorough.. 
Manager Diane is very friendly and professional and checked on the guest to make sure we are happy and satisfied.. We will be back next Tuesday for the $1 oyster specials and happy hour from 5-7
