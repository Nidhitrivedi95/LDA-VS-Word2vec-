VA95qAV2PRH9gtTi2Vfv4Q Imagine that it is 9pm on a Friday night in Toronto, and the majority of the city's most coveted restaurants aren't taking reservations. You have tickets for a show at 10pm, and you don't have much time to spend waiting in the queue with other starving patrons. What do you do? Do you risk showing up late to your show in hopes of satisfying your tummy, or do you opt-in for other restaurants with a quicker table turnover? In our case, we (regrettably) opted for the latter. 

While this Yorkville restaurant boasts a beautiful rooftop patio and multi-leveled dining room, the food selection and quality at Trattoria Nervosa pale in comparison to its wonderful ambiance. Even with the kind and courteous servers who are relentlessly charming their guests with their smiles, I just couldn't summon enough energy to love the food.

So, what exactly did I order? I tried the Montanara pizza, which was topped with berkshire sausage, gorgonzola dolce, roasted red peppers, and red onions. The good thing was that we had the pizza on our table in a very timely manner. However, I wasn't too impressed with the sporadic clumps of onions and peppers, which were submerged in a cavalcade of sausage. In the future, I'd suggest that the kitchen staff better diffuse the toppings across the pizza so as to maintain some consistency in its taste. I also washed down the dryness of the pizza with a Peroni, which is the quintessential beer of Italy.

All in all, my experience at Trattoria Nervosa was "meh." I sincerely hope this restaurant improves the culinary experience for its patrons, as it has A LOT of potential. For now, your safest bet with this restaurant is to enjoy a beverage on its patio with an appetizer!
