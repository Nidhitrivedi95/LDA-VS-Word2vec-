Bs8AvNO3xWoURWpqiGd_4w I went here to meet a client for lunch recently. The service was quick and the food was okay, but I think it's a bit pricey for what you get. I got a half sandwich and a cup of soup with an ice tea and by bill was $16 out the door with tax and tip. At similar Italian restaurants you can get an entire sandwich and a bowl of soup with a drink plus tax and tip for about $3-4 less. It's not drastic; just comparing apples to apples.
