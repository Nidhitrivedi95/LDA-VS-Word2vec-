c-l4nDPZcEwapEiV-Xf08w We had an excellent dining experience at Ilios Noche. The food was fantastic and the service was excellent. The restaurant was very busy when we arrived so we opted for seats at the bar. The bar staff was very friendly and attentive and they answered several of our questions about the menu. I had the Chicken Lemonata and it was absolutely delicious! My son had the Hanger Steak and my husband had the Ilios Pita with Chicken.....to which he is still raving about because he loved it so much!

My only complaint is that it took almost 45 minutes to get our food. Luckily, we had the friendly and entertaining bar staff to keep us preoccupied while we waited. 

We will definitely go back again because the food was really excellent. However, we will only go on a night that we're not in a rush.
