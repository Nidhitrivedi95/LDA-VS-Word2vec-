wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw We decided to do a girls day at Postino's and we started out with a server who was very knowledgeable about his wine but seemed rushed. He was at the end of his shift and we were lucky enough to get Jason who was very friendly from the beginning and he was even kind enough to save us from a bee! He was very thorough with helping us choose the right wine when others would probably would have given up. We thank you so much for the extended amazing service we really appreciate it! We aren't always blessed with such great service so we are truly grateful for your service and we will only request you from now on! We will be back
