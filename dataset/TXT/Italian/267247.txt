xCFdXTSHEMA-8VMrUrQUiw I've been doing this place for about 6 years now. It started with me hearing about the football sized panzerotti, which is exactly that big, no joke. Then after getting the same thing over and over again I branched out to the hot table and started getting sandwiches, sausage, meatball, veal, chicken... you cannot go wrong, the sweet peppers are cooked down JUST right, they almost taste buttery, its awesome. Then another branch out got me to their pastas, amazing sauce there.... GO TO THIS PLACE!
