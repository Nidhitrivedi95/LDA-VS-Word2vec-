Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA Well this is not NY pizza - more like a bigger version of the Wood fired pizza craze. The two pies we ordered all were eaten, but didn't blow anybody away. The free garlic Bread was small, but it was still free when you check-in. I opted for a Chicken Parm sandwich, which tasted good despite a soggy roll. Unfortunately when I was still in the restaurant, all of it came flying out in the tiny one seater bathroom. Felt bad for the guy waiting to use the restroom, but they need more restrooms. Oh the French fries were great. We only ended up here because it had no wait, not the first choice or the best choice, just average.
