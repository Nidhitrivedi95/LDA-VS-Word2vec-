Ew9YPQV9g4a-L8NjigV0NQ Don't let the outside of this little gem scare you away! Once you walk inside everything is amazing! The restaurant is clean, roomy, and has nice music at a comfortable volume. And the food<U+200B> is nothing less than excellent!! The potato soup was thick and delicious, the salad was fresh and had a great variety of veggies, and the house Italian dressing was perfect! The bread and butter was excellent and our main course was fantastic! I had zucchini parmesan...Yummy!! And my husband had ziti with meatballs... Delicious!! And, to top it all off, the offer creme brulee for dessert!! We will definitely be eating here again!!
