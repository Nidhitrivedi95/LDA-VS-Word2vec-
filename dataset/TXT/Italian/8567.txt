0iM8uF2D9iL8eau_tkPlRA Really Tasty pizza probably best I've had in North LV. Ordered Garlic Cheese Bread but they gave us just the regular garlic bread, which was good- the marinara sauce was amazing so much so that I would order spaghetti or something that comes with that next time. Only complaint was salad was warm and wilted when it arrived, maybe the driver had it sitting on top of the pizza boxes or maybe because it was packed in a bag with the garlic bread. 4.5 overall experience but taste was def 5 stars!
