4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg Two nights of amazing club fun was followed by two very late night (or early morning) meals at Allegro. I always seek out macaroni and cheese when in a drunken haze, so was bummed when the menu didn't have it listed. Whether it was the adrenaline still coursing through my body or the alcohol, I insisted the waiter ask the chef if it would be possible to make macaroni and cheese. BOOM. Ask and you shall receive. And it was sooooo good. Totally legit 4 cheese macaroni with a baked top. The second night there, I once again asked the Allegro server for macaroni. He insisted it wasn't possible only to return from the kitchen saying, "Been here 3 years and still learning new things." :). Have a feeling I'll definitely be back in the future!
