XPLSNGSClW8gR5BTcvyOhQ I went to Buca for the first time with my boyfriend last night and I loved it, it was so good! We had an amazing server named Peter and he was such a great help for recommending good dishes to us! We started off with the garlic cheesy bread and it was so good, and had he delicious chopped antipasto salad, than went into our fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and that was so good, and of course we had to finish up with the cannoli for dessert which was amazing! Definitely very large portions but that makes it all the better because you get leftovers! Can't wait to go back again!
