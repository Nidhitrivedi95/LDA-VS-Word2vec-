SKpg4zgr83YPZ14uzhmn9g I passed this place many times, but never thought to go there until my friend invited me for Tuesday ladies night.

This restaurant looks like get the traffic from people live in DC ranch & the surrounding area and of course the snowbirds.

They served mostly pizza and some salads as well as appetizers.

It was mellow night passed the happy hour by the time at 9:00pm the employees start cleaning up and ready to close the door.

I had Emiliana salad which is arugula, baby green, red peppers, pine nuts and shaved parmigiano reggiano in balsamic vinaigrette, it was good actually.
