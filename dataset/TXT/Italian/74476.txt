cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q For a huge corporate run chain this place has awful service. My 2nd and last visit here ended even worse than the first visit 3 months ago. Server spoke 2 words the entire visit, had to ask for refills which the the server filled with a completely different beverage, bread sticks burnt, soup was never refilled and the server never offered. The picture is of my empty soup bowl sitting on the table while 4 servers watched sports on TV and chit chatted amongst each other. I could have went to Fazoli's and had better service with better food and saved $30!
