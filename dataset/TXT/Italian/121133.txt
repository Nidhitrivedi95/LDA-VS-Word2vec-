HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A Solid Italian food spot in Summerlin :)

We started off with the Complimentary Bread with Olive Olive and Vinegar.  Good!

Pasta E Fagioli ($5 Cup): Cannellini Beans & Pasta. This was good overall. Heavy on the beans...it was not finished.  I would skip this personally.

Grilled Chicken Sandwich ($12): Chicken Breast, Roasted Peppers, Baby Greens & Goat Cheese. Pretty good! Good flavored chicken with lots of greens/veggies.  Fair portion size as well. 

Veal Parmagiana ($16): Baked Breaded Veal Scaloppini, Marinara & Mozzarella.  This was good, with thinly sliced veal and lots of flavor in the baked cheese.  Recommended!

Penne Marinara was my side choice with entree. The pasta was under-cooked, and the sauce was a bit on the sweet side. I'd choose the steamed veggies or sauteed spinach next time.  Skip this too.

Give em a try if you are in the area.  I wouldn't drive all the way across town for it again though.
