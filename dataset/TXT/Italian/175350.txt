nDZWoEznY5-oSCc2HvoMtA We ended up at this restaurant at the suggestion of the hotel we were staying at, about 5 blocks down the street.  The direction we approached it from seemed like this was not going to be what we were looking for.  As we came around the corner, it appeared to be a decent place, so we figured we would go in and give it a chance.  

Our waitress was phenomenal.  She was super friendly and make some great recommendations.  As with any Italian restaurant, you get a lot of food.  Their bread and oil is to die for.  Garlic Knots are amazing.  I got the Eggplant Parm, which I thought was delicious.  The person I was with got one of their specials at the suggestion of the waitress, which he was loving the entire time.  We both ate well beyond the point we were full because the food was so good, but just couldn't stop

I highly recommend this place.  And the next time I'm in Charlotte, this is one of the places I'm going, for sure.
