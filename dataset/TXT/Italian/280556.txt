YOD9dXrnpu8HTRILpF0onw Such a great Italian restaurant! Our family was introduced to Times Square at their Deer Valley location when there was only one location.  We found them on Yelp and happened in there on Valentine's Day several years ago.  Awesome food, and we were thrilled to learn about this location on 7th St. and Union Hills.  It's bigger and just as delicious.  No matter what you get, you can't go wrong.  Everything is delicious.  We frequent this location quite often and are happy to see business is booming.  If you serve great food, people will come.
