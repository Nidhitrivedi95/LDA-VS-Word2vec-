hWsG4A-7x0i8wRBBtNBYeQ I have to agree with other reviewers about the ambiance.  The room is way too big, and the decorations are plain and sparse.  BUT.  The moussaka and the eggplant Parmesan we enjoyed was somewhere between "way good" and excellent.  

The moussaka had a creamy, custard topping which complemented the eggplant and lamb fillings as well as the spices.  I can honestly say I would go back and enjoy it again and again -- and try other dishes.  The servings were generous and the price was very fair.  The eggplant was similarly generous and delicious.  The dinner salads were generous portions, and glasses of wine were 5 bucks a glass.  The waitstaff were friendly and competent, but not overly unctuous like so many chain restaurants are. 

If you like to support local independent restaurateurs, Mike's qualfies.   If you are looking for a fine dining experience with fancy tasteful decor and a wine list, this is not your place.  But if you are looking for real food, nicely prepared and at a reasonable price, give Mike's a try.
