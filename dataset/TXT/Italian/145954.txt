K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ Came on a Friday for a bachelorette party rolling in 10 deep. I came late because of a delayed flight but our friend's promoter Fred totally made it happen for me. I called Fred when I got there and he met up with me, organized my in, then escorted me in to get to the group of girls at a TABLE! (Hardly any wait, yuhh) Vodka and assorted juices with service! Confetti drop was great although covered my open drink, but I didn't care I was having a great time dancing. Hip hop music selection was perfect. Thanks Fred for making my friend's bachelorette party night so special!!! She definitely felt it that night :D
