ElFjivhz41XfFiOogtTCvg We had a three course meal here for lunch.
Nothing special. The menu said "crabcakes" but it only came with 1 crabcake :(. The chicken parmesan was a bit dry. The dessert was not memorable. 
The service was slow. I ate 2 baskets of bread by myself waiting for our mains to arrive, and I was still hungry leaving this place...

Not worth $25.
