SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg I organized a brunch for 12 ladies and the service was fabulous! I love the style of the restaurant and that the fountains are visible while you are eating. The cocktails were also unique and yummy. I got the caprese salad and added 4 jumbo shrimp and I also got a side of mushrooms. I would love to come back!
