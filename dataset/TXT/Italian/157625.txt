Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA **Review is only for BREAKFAST!

A solid 2.5 stars for food, but 5 stars for service and environment. 

Came here with my parents and it felt like we were sitting outside in a nice little city! Such a great environment to dine at with great service. 

Unfortunately, the food failed to even remotely impress us.. The best part of our meal was sadly the basket of bread in the beginning - warm, toasted deliciousness! 

I don't remember the exact name of the items from the menu since they're all in Italian so....

//VEGGIE OMELET (1.5/5): literally so meh. The omelet was extremely thick, overcooked, and had no real distinct flavor, besides egg.. And cooked vegetables. We had to dump hot sauce and ketchup on it to make it more enticing to eat, but my mom still didn't finish it. Oh well. The potatoes were really good atleast! 

//SMOKED HAM BENEDICT (2.5/5): This dish had a LOT of potential.... The cream-Parmesan sauce for the Benedict was addicting and the potatoes they served with it were crispy and perfectly seasoned. However, the eggs were overcooked, bread was too hard until I let it get soggy, and I had to soak everything in the cream sauce to make the Benedict taste good. The yolk didn't even spill out..... 

//BUTTERMILK PANCAKES (3/5): Very meh. The pancakes were moist and not dry at all, but that was the only good thing about them. Besides that there was no defining flavor and the pancakes were a little too soggy. Oh well, atleast they didn't stick to the roof of my mouth like most other pancakes! 

Overall, I don't know how the rest of the food is here, but I wouldn't come back for breakfast. Thanks for the great service and atmosphere though!
