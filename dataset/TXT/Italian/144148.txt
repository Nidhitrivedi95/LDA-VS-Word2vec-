jWlErd3TOkO4C0MgP8eDvw First off.... "What a view"...I went here at night time, the city lights were really cool.  Go P-Burg!

I thought the food was great!  I got some form of pasta with some form of steak tips... It was really good.  The inside of the restaruant wasn't very fancy, but it was quaint.
