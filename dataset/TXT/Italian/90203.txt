E9b73ETPw0VYUJ2_YSJJdQ Been there a couple of times and on both occasions the experience was less than ideal. Pizza they serve is supposed to be premium but Ive had way better at places like dominos and pizza pizza :/

It always smells like burnt bread inside and outside the store whenever I pass by, they should seriously consider installing some proper ventilation to address this issue. Also on both occasions I visited place was entirely dead. Decor is mediocre.

From what i remember the place wasnt the cleanest. On our second visit we were sat next to the main windows and upon immediate arrival we noticed a big dead fly on the one of the windows metal panels. None of the staff seemed to care enough though as that thing remained there for the remainder of our visit. 

Havent visited in two summers now and wont be going back again.
