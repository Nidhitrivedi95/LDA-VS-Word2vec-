k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ Went here on a Saturday night.  Got the cauliflower app -tasty and cheesy but was missing something (I added pepper). My boyfriend got the pizza it was good but wasn't blown away pretty standard in comparison with other pizza joins like Bianco across the street. I ordered the pesto pasta good flavor I would order it again. For drinks I got the red sangria I prefer a sweeter sangria this one wasn't that sweet.
