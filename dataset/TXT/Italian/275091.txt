Y9kXVlU4xPfSZvkZH6C_2Q Ate here on St. Patrick's Day because of the awesome Reuben sandwich this placed posted on Facebook. Hubby ordered a pizza. We waited for over a half hour for our food. The place was not packed either at that time, 4pm. Here is what we received. Burned pizza and a sorry looking Reuben with cold fries. The almost non-existent corned beef was tough. The marbled rye was the highlight of both items. And this place was on Triple D? They must have seriously gone downhill from there. Not recommending this place to anyone.
