HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q I really enjoy the crepes from this place and visit this place often because of that, but within the last year it seems that care for their service and quality of their menu has declined.  

Mainly the people behind the counter make it a horrible experience.  There are a couple employees that provide great service, but the majority are rude.
