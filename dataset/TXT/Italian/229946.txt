TAoN9nsibXOxsOnnG7Kd_g Riazzi's was a place I had wanted to go for my birthday for over a year. When I finally went there, I loved it aside from the prices. The food was fantastic, the patio was gorgeous, the staff was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere was perfect. It had a mom and pop feel and allowed me to feel relaxed and family oriented. I really enjoyed having my family experience Riazzi's with me! All around fantastic experience aside from the prices. The prices were a little steep for the amount of the food one received. Other than that this place was amazing.
