k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw Very good Italian food, a bit on the pricey side, but what I didn't like is the slow service (I was there for a late lunch), and a five minute wait in the front without anyone greeting us or telling us to wait or that they'll be right with us.  I think the setting is outdated and the service is slow, however the food was delicious.
