O7oel6U2R9egvZcW9qNrww My family and I are here for lunch on 7/17/17 and we're all shocked. There is only ONE person, Kristen, working the entire restaurant. She's cooking, cleaning, waiting tables, answering phones, ringing people out, everything. There's no way in hell that this is safe! If something were to fall off a shelf and knock her unconscious- no one would have a clue! This poor woman is working her ass off in here and trying to maintain a happy attitude and of course there's rude and Obnoxious people in here who don't care at all. As a business owner this is terrible to see, even in the slowest locations of you are going to be open for business, you need to have more than one person working In ANY type of establishment- in case there's any form of emergency. I will be contacting the corporate office. 
As for the restaurant itself- it's clean- other than this one woman having to deal with us, carry out orders and the phone ringing- she has one table she simply hasn't been able to get to. I feel bad for this woman, most people would wear their irritation on their face and in their tone- but she is pushing through. I hope Pizza Hut takes care of this situation.

-UPDATE-
After an hour we never received our food and we left. Called corporate and they filed a claim. Hopefully this will get resolved.
