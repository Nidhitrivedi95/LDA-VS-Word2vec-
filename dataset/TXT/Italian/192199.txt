pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ We love Nora's.  We've been eating here for many years, and it is our go-to spot for special occasions.  Nora's catered a 50th Anniversary party that we threw in our home, and everyone raved about the food.  Portions are more than generous, and the food quality is outstanding.
