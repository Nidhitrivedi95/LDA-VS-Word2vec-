v2xh5qtrlRJSU3OnixJH2g Our friend suggested we check this place out as it had opened not too long ago.  Even though I was trying to lay off carbs, he made it sound amazing & since he's a cook, I trust him!  It was pretty empty when we got there, but as it was new I figured not many people had heard about it yet.  

The macaroons were fantastic (I liked the pumpkin the best).  We had chicken pesto rigatoni and Steak in the Grass, which was quite honestly one of the best things I've ever had! I had no idea what garlic chips were before this and they are amazing!  I also love that they grow their own sprouts in house and they locally source pretty much everything they serve there.  

I see that they've updated the menu and now have paleo options so I will have to make a trip up there again to check it out.
