GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA I've read reviews of this in which the person said the food was great but the service was not so much.  I completely disagree.  The service was excellent and the food was even better.  I highly recommend the linguine with clams or the venison.  The wine was one of the best I've ever had (which was recommended by the bartender).  I would very highly recommend to anyone!
