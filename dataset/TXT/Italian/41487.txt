7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Had been hearing about this spot for a while, so I gave it a shot for the first time yesterday, and I'm impressed. It's a great little trendy Leslieville location, and my first impression was that it's exactly the kind of relaxing, casual brunch spot I want to find myself at on a lazy Sunday morning. Chalkboard specials, a nice lookout view of Queen East, mismatched chairs and tables, and families couples of all types. 

The menu was great, I actually had a hard time picking what I wanted to eat. Several types of all kinds of your standard brunch classics, including five or six kinds of eggs benny. I opted for an Avocado Brie Bacon Eggs Benedict, while my two compatriots had the Vanilla Raspberry French Toast and the Baked Crepe Croque Monsieur.

All three were on the best side of great: The french toast was dense, flaky and almost pastry-like, and soaked up the ("real and organic", according to our waitress) maple syrup as a french toast should. The poached eggs on both the Croque Monsieur and Eggs Benny properly popped into a river of runny egg yolks just the right consistency, and the hollandaise sauce on the Eggs Benedict was also appropriately thick and zingy. A little lemony, a little spicy. Pretty much exactly what I think a proper hollandaise sauce should be. Everything else was similarly right on cue.

The one notable let down for us was the potatoes -- all three of us agreed that while serviceable, they weren't the best we've ever had. They were "just potatoes". Roasted, and lightly fried and seasoned, but without any real texture to speak of. Not a huge blight, but there it is for those of you who really appreciate your hash browns and potato wedges crispy. 

Great little spot, highly recommended if you, like me, have an addiction to hunting out good brunch spots in the city.
