C6jKwYmzHztO7OCex9j-YQ I have ordered here in the past and the pizza is okay. But this evening was a little different. I ordered an Italian hoagie, because I didn't want pizza. I remember in the past I was not a fan of the hoagie, but I had received a message from the owner stating that things would change. I decided to give it another shot.

Let me tell you, nothing has changed. If anything it's worse than I remember. I requested mayonnaise exactly as before, and didn't get it. No pickles either. The hoagie was a hot sloppy mess. I'm not sure why it was hot, because nowhere on the menu does it warn you that it's toasted, and I certainly didn't request that. Gross. About four slices of meat, a mealy tomato slice and slimy warm lettuce. The lettuce and tomato must have been heated with the hoagie because they were so soggy they were mushed into the soggy bun. There were no onions or cheese to be found in this mess, although that is a detail the menu promises comes standard. 

I will not be ordering from this place again, and unless you're sticking to pizza and are drunk enough to forget even that mistake soon, I'd advise anyone to avoid it as well. There are so many great places to eat in this city, and Mia Pizza just doesn't keep up.
