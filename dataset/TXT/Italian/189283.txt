OyiOg9GYKzHI19EbnWqL8A Overpriced generic Italian food is putting it lightly.  

I was more or less interested to go in because of the name and was superseded that the decor was so adorable with all the zebra print and all.  

Paid $14.00 for a plate of pasta and a pile of cheese that they whipped up so quickly after the starter was served.  Didn't even look like they mixed it..  it's piled it on top like who cares.  

My boyfriend for the rose chicken of some sort and that was OK but again a pile of tomato sauce and cream of some sort with no imagination or regard for aesthetic value whatsoever.  

I was going to save the other half of my overpriced pasta and cheese if are not throw out because it cost so much.. but they did that for me! 

Waitress came to the table to tell me that she placed it down and someone from the staff must have thrown it away! 

1 starter, 2 drinks, and 2 dinners came up to around $60... minus the $14 they deducted for throwing out my meal it came up to like $52.  A price too high for a piles of spaghetti they probably sourced from Walmart.. might as well stay at home.
