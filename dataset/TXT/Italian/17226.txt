2alo9GzeOsbg4jeKYFQmxQ My husband and I were looking forward to eating dinner here ,  He grew up in the area and raved about the food.so we stopped in.  Very disappointed.  Way to much cheese on the salad, the veal parmesan with a side of spaghetti was fair and the spaghetti tasted like it was reheated.  I had the Seafood Manicotti  with the alfredo sauce.  The sauce was the texture of glue and where was the seafood?  Tiny bits of shrimp & scallops that I had to dig to find in the thick sauce.   We will be frequenting the area for the next few months but I do not know if we will be back.
