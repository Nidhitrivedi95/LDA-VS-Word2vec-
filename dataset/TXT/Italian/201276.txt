PxTKXsdYqoFHWAG2amz0XQ Where do I even start, there is so many great thing about Nook Kitchen. First of all the GM Nick was outstanding, he accommodated everything to what we needed to make the bridal dinner amazing. His energy is what brought me into the restaurant. At one point in the night we ended up being the only table in the restaurant, Nick kindly asked if we would like to play other music and let's just say the bridal party loved it!! Nicks hospitality was outstanding and I will for sure be coming back because of him. The food was to die for, the green olive appetizer dish is amazing. Everyone's food was amazing, couldn't go wrong with anything food wise. The drinks are out of the world as well. I highly recommend Nook Kitchen and I will be back for sure with more friends and family!!!
