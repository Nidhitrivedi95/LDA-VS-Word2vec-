Mg2woU0AFrHGlp7qmlIHXA This restaurant was the best Italian restaurant I've ever been to(just doesnt beat NYC pizza) but starting from the cocktails to the food to the service and to the dessert, it was excellent. Everything seemed so fresh and homemade, too. The staff was great and the atmosphere was small, but cozy. Definitely coming back the next time I'm in Montréal.
