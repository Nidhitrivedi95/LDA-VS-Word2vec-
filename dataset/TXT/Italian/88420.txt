dZNA2tF7kXo7urqKytVHhQ Two and a half years after opening, this place has really turned itself around!!

My husband and I moved into the area & visited for dinner when Pertino first opened and we thought "good value and pretty good food".

Well, things have changed since then...

We now say, "great food at a great price" (they haven't upped their price even though the quality has improved 5-fold).

Their menu is almost all 100% fresh, unfrozen using local ingredients. Very few of their pastas are dried and the quality of their ingredients is impecable. Take their caesar salad for example - fresh dressing every day, well balanced acidity and a heavy and tasty punch of garlic. Wonderful.

My hubby and I visited for lunch and had homemade, fresh lasagna (soft and tasty), caesar salad, chicken parmesan sandwich with fresh hot peppers and fries.

Everything was wonderful - we couldn't decide what our favourite was so will have to go back again soon to do it all again!

Nice work, Pertino's!!
