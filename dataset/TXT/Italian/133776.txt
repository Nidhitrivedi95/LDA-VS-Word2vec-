INU7l2FWbISp9xnJpmqlsg 8206 Providence Rd Ste 1600, Charlotte NC 28226 This complaint is for the store at the  Arboretum.  I ordered online at 830pm.  I called them about 10pm and they said my order would leave the store soon.They said it was backed up because it was a Friday.  I told her it was Thursday, not Friday. Then about 1030pm the lady arrived and she only had one of our 2 pizzas.  She said oh no, I will be back in ten minutes.  Then I called the store about 1030 and they said she had left, but she never showed up at our house.  Finally at 11:15 I called the store and talked to a man and told him we were going to bed. So we never did get the second pizza & the first one was 1 hour and a half late. They did say they would give me a credit, but how do I know?
