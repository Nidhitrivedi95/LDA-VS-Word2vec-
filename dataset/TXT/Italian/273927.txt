Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A I was incredibly disappointed with the selection and quality of food.  I'm really not that picky with buffets.  As long as I can find 2 or 3 items that I genuinely like, I walk away happy.  I could barely find one item that I truly enjoyed.  I should clarify that this buffet isn't terrible.  I just expected better from the Palms.

EDIT: I received some free buffet coupons in the mail, so I gave the place another chance.  It was night and day.  I actually enjoyed everything I ate and some dishes were even spectacular.  I particularly enjoyed the scallops and bowtie pasta dish, the root beer pulled pork, and the drunken mushrooms over mashed potatoes.
