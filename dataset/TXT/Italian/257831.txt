w3h2_nxxqnmxZZaaQi2Pag My wife and I love this quaint and charming restaurant. We eat there often but in the past found the dinners to be hit or miss but the past year the food and service has been consistently good. Last week my wife and I had lunch. I had the spinach sausage pasta which was outstanding and we both ordered half caesars salads which were as big as a large and they had anchovies, excellent. Service was very attentive.
