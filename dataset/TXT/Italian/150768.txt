klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw I found this place through Yelp! And I was not disappointed..

We got all appetizers - Shrimp cocktail, fried rock shrimp and calamari, sweet potato fries, and the MAC&CHEESE bites. And a watermelon mojito was my sweet treat. Everything tasted great and their service was superb! 

I would definitely come here again just for the mac & cheese bites. Mmm...
