Zt4ljpwfmBufatNM1zPNcQ My husband and I go here every week for a great 'neighborhood bar' dinner. The staff is always courteous and helpful and seem to be having a good time. I enjoy a place where people like to work! 
We go on Monday or Tuesday night to get the summer special these days. Join the Picazzo's club and you get 25% off your order and a bottle of the house wine (which isn't a bad one!) for just $5! 
Last night we had the Thai chicken pizza (with the thin crust) and the Italian chopped salad. Delicious! Another favorite of ours is the Veggie Pizza (with thick crust) and the blue cheese salad. You can order a small salad (plenty for 2 to share) So,,,for $30 we had split a small salad, a large pizza and a bottle of wine! 
By the way, the summer special is only for dinner on Mon/Tues (after 4) and through September.
