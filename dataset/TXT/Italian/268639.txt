XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ Ate there yesterday, as usual.. great food, excellent service and fantastic atmosphere.
I laughed so hard after reading a review from a chef from San Francisco that didn't like the food but want a free dinner with his family there again for FREE.. LoL that was amusing and real funny.. I love reading the reviews on Yelp, there's always an free loading idiot there..
