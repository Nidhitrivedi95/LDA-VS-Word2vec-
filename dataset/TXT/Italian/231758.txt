THyomCEEq4W9pJvXy6YoNw I love Mojo's! The food is clearly made fresh and in ample portions. My friend and I went and were able to split the lasagna between us quite easily. It was clearly made from scratch and reminded me of home. For dessert we got a cannoli that like the lasagna was delicious and quite big, well worth the calories! All in all we were more than satisfied and will definitely be back. Great food, fun atmosphere and good looking guys for the trifecta girls night out!
