zi_qqjCzkerE2dT-ViE2JA I've driven past this place countless times and always wondered how it was. Heck anything stuck in an old church sounds cool. So when I was flipping through the pages of my entertainment book the other evening I seen Bellini and thought now would be the perfect time to try it out. So I talked with my fiancee and we agreed it's worth a try.

I call a day in advance to make reservations which weren't needed judging how quiet it was this evening. We looked over the menu and I ordered the Tortellini alla Maria, it was delicious and recommend by our server. She said it's the most popular dish. My fiancee ordered the Pollo e GamberiI alla Pietro. She loved it and I loved mine. Each came with a salad. I was expecting small portions that other yelpers mentioned but these plates were by no means small. 

I gave it 3 stars because our server was pretty darn nice, she could have been a bit more personable though. The food while good is definitely not worth $23 a plate. (I had a coupon). 

So if your looking for some great food head here. The interior is pretty and they had really dim lights, with candles. I have to say it's very romantic. Make sure you dress nice, and guys that means your Dockers too!

PS leave the kids at home, this is a nice quiet place.
