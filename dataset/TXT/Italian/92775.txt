EhuKnhTKJTm_EZ_QGe7PvQ I've been here three times already and the pork tenderloin I got last time was delicious. It was cooked just right; I was able to chew on it easily and the wine sauce was very nice. We also had complimentary bread with olive oil/oregano dip to begin with, and bread is always good. (:

The service though, wasn't too spectacular. The guy server we had never smiled during the service and seemed very unpleasant. He also only checked up on us once throughout the whole meal. Every time we needed something, we had to look for him and wait for him. 

It's a good family lunch/dinner place, but I wouldn't recommend it for dressy dates; maybe a casual date.
