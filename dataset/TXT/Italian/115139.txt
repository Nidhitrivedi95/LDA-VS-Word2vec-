GQAvKHDfuBws7312iIqX6Q TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! My boyfriend and I have been coming here for over a year and the food has always been superb  and convenient as its right around the corner from our house. Yet over the course of this time the customer service and food quality has quickly diminished. We put in a order for pick up at 507, arrived at 530 after being told 15 minutes however once we went to the register we didn't receive our food until 540. I asked the server/cashier how long the calzone had been out and he said a few minutes before we arrived, if it was out before we arrived why weren't we given our food in that moment???? And why was our food cold??? To that he replied that he had other customers and that he couldn't just worry about us???? NOT TO MENTION, that this was right in front of the owner who didn't even acknowledge the situation. Trying to disregard the fact that our food was cold and cheese unmelted, attempting to eat this was like chewing bubble gum due to the excessive cheese in this calzone. Overall terrible experience.
