1Ok2EXqdH-R0sy-_tyOrMg Been going to the 2 other location and I am so happy they open downtown I love the food there the pizza is so good and you would also try the butcher board if you like cheese and cold cuts and there is a great atmosphere on the terrace my favourite thing is the Nutella pizza it's a must !! The service is always good and very friendly
