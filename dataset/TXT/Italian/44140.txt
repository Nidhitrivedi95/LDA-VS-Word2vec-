86W-L1l70wL-7n0lSfoY-Q Went there on our anniversary and got Brazilian steak and Portuguese steak.  Most excellent. The waitress honoured the occasion with some free port.  Very cute place - not sure if extension ladder over the bar was meant to be ironic tribute to Portuguese construction worker neighbourhood, but I liked it.  We'll definitely try this little place again.
