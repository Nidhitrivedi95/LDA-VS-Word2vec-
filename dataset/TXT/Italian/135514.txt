IWDA6Tp8aFIaIqJJnZF0oA I know Pizza Hur (REALLY?!?!).....

BUT, This is one of the only last standing Pizza Huts around in CLE where you can walk in and sit and eat the delciousness of piping HOT Pizza. And, YES it is STILL served out of that black serving pan. Obviously we ordered the breadsticks as well as a Large pepperoni and green pepper pizza. I must admit that they skip you out on the pepperoni, but it was still delious. Unfortunately, we heard that the 117th will be turning into a take-out only by the end of the year. So make sure you go and EAT IN before it turns- It's WELL worth it!
