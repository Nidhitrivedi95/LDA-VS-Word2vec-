cd5Utm93d5Ta_F4e8A3pCA I always enjoy the Olive Garden! Out waiter was great and went out of his way to make sure we were fully stocked with breadsticks and of course the zappa toscana soup!  The main dish the chicken lasagna special was definitely solid! I actually love the table top payment system gets me out in a hurry when I'm ready to hit the road.  As I've heard real Italian men say "manja" I don't know what it means but it think it's good!  Don't over think it og is on point.
