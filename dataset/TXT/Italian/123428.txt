hlrZHM4D48XiQtXh6cRg_w I hear the Toronto location is nicer than the B.C. location and has better service: P
I gave it 3 stars for the very simple reason the food is consistently ok and reasonable price.  Consistency means a lot to me.   No, you won't think you are in Italy, but what do you want for an all in meal for $20.00.  If you want a cheap place to bring the kids to celebrate a birthday, this is it. The pina coladas are real good and if you have enough of them, the food will taste better.
