oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ A-OK is a fair enough rating. I won't say "don't go to Cibo!", but I won't rush back either.

Let me start with the good points: servers were attentive and friendly, which was great considering we had a group reservation for one of their "party rooms". They were prompt and attentive, had some good knowledge of their wine offerings, and given that we were celebrating two anniversaries, they were also nice enough to bring out complementary prosecco for everyone at the end of the meal.

The place itself is beautiful, which isn't a shock since it's part of the Liberty Group and they're known for that. The wine bottle walls, exposed brick, unfinished ceilings, and interesting art on the way to the washrooms all make you really take note.

The food was hit and miss. Beef carpaccio was good as was their really nice bread, some of the other antipasti we ordered didn't go over so well. Mains varied. The spaghetti carbonara (a simple enough thing) was a hit, but the margherita pizza ordered by another in our party - well - it looked like a cheese pizza from Pizza Pizza someone had thrown some basil on. Not really what we expected.

As for me, I had pappardelle with a lamb ragu, and it was a satisfying meal, nicely done really.

The wine selection is quite impressive and has a broad range of bottles available - from about $30 and up - decent bottles in the $40-60 range as well, and lots seemed to be available by the glass.

Prices weren't outrageous for the food either - pastas were good portions for $14-20, secondi were mostly in the $20s - so you can go for a nice meal and splurge a bit on the wine.
