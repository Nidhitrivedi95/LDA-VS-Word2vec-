I have been there four times now... most recently was last night.  They have had multiple specials each time, the kind of specials written on a marker board written at the front of the restaurant.  I love quaint, little touches like that.

Instead of simply bringing out bread and butter, or bread with olive oil, they bring out toasted garlic bread and fresh, flavorful bruschetta.  I LOVE their bruschetta.  We had two bowls of it and would have had more, if we hadn't ordered dinner.

My girlfriend had penne alla vodka, an item on the menu.  It was a plentiful plate with a substantial amount of pasta in a thick sauce.  I didn't try any, but only because I inhaled my own portion, probably before I even looked up for the first time.  I don't remember what the dish was called, but it was cheese tortellini in alfredo sauce with spinach, and a drop of red sauce in the middle.  The sauce was a bit too creamy for my tastes, but I think that's only because I am used to 1% and skim milk these days.  It tasted pretty incredible.  I mixed in some of that bruschetta too.  Loved it.

No question that I'll go back again.  I love Mom and Pop places.  I love non-chains.  It's a bit hidden, but look for it!  It's worth it.
