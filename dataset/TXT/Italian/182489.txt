oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw We went here as part of a big company dinner.  Unfortunately, we couldn't order off the menu but had a specially prepared smaller menu for us that included only two main entrees:  a chicken or lamb dish.  I was disappointed that there wasn't any pasta on our menu and/or there weren't more choices.  I ate the chicken dish which was flavorful while others had the lamb which they said, was excellent.  The rest of the entree was sparse.  Outside of the meat, we received a small amount of spinach on the plate, that's it.  I'm not sure if that's how it is or the company didn't pay for anything more.  The service was excellent along with the wines, antipasti and bread sticks.  Overall, the place has potential judging by what we ate and drank that night.  I would like to go back and order off the main menu and see how much better it really is.  It's located in the Mandalay Bay casino which is also very nice.
