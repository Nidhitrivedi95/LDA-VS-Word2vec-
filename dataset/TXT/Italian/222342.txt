sH9aI3xg-POBMp8R-kSQZg My boyfriend and I had a date night here last week and it was wonderful! It was raining but we sat outside anyways, they have a cover over the outdoor seating. I had the chicken gorgonzola but substituted spinach for mushrooms and penne instead of cappellini. The waiter had no problem accommodating my substitutions. The salad that came with the meal was fine but no tomatoes which I thought was weird. The bread was hot and AMAZING! I was astounded by the huge portion size of my entree, I got two and a half meals out of it! In addition to the gargantuan amount of food, it was extremely tasty. My boyfriend's eggplant parmigiana was equally huge and delicious. The service was quick and friendly. We've found our new go-to Italian place!
