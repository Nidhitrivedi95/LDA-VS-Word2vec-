obzBY9Pea6nUXsjtEjo-Cw I really wanted to like this place. The previous reviews were promising. The small-ness of the place didn't bother me. The server was friendly enough. The cocktails were decent. My halibut was COLD in the middle. I'm not expecting super fresh fish in the middle of Boulder City but at least thaw it first. It turned me off so badly my appetite was ruined. This was my 1st time at the Bistro and it will be my last.
