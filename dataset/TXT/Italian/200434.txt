Pueu_ofuGNpX2dRf-GHt_A Came here with a friend while we were in a huge rush waiting for a show at the Princess of Wales (just like everyone else, hah. I see they are used to it).

Server was very helpful.

They brought out "complimentary" appetizers, which were pizza squares, and not that great, but our dinner (the seafood antipasto appetizer, and the pizza with scallops) was delicious! We had to eat it so fast that we nearly inhaled it, but the server was incredibly understanding with us trying to make our show, and wrapped up so quickly!

I would like to come back here when I have more time and actually savor the food, but it was very good, with great service (although I felt so sorry for the poor girl who had to stand in the freezing cold and try to get people to come in! I think that's ridiculous).
