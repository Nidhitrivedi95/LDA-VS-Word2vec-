1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ What a great experience. I was able to make a reservation through Yelp while we were driving there.  The decor was beautiful with linen tablecloths and napkins.  There was great soft Italian music playing in the background.  Our table was stocked with our own grated parmesan cheese and olive oil.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  We were really surprised at how fast the food came.  I had the roasted chicken, which was cooked perfectly, with crispy red potatoes, best ever!  My husband and mother in law (who are both Italian) had the eggplant parmesan which they both raved about.  They also have family portions that are very reasonable.  The price was a little bit more than the Olive Garden but it was so worth it.  Especially, when the waiter cleared our dishes and said that since the eggplant parmesan was a classic pasta dish, we would get 2 more to take home.  So, 3 of us ate for $65 and we took home lunch for the next day.  We will be back!
