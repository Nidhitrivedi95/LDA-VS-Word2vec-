I love their wide selection of wines and cocktails. The decor inside is exceptional and the patio is perfect for a warm summer days/nights. For me, the complimentary bread at the beginning of the meal is the greatest thing ever. It's super tasty and leaves me craving my next course. I've tried several of their pizzas - the pollo being my favorite. The shrimp salad was delicious as a side. Overall, it's the perfect place for a date night or for a group of friends out on the town.
