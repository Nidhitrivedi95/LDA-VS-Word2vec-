mAhu38hHUQyOatamyQsOww Oh Citta, your taste is great but your combinations mystify me.  Came to Citta for brunch and ordered  Egg's Benedict.

Good Hollandaise sauce, good tomato focaccia bread that could easily be eaten on its own. Okay, great start. The two together however with runny eggs and roasted red peppers thrown in, completely disguises any of the Hollandaise flavour. It ends up as a mushy mess in your mouth. If you're a senior who has lost your ability to chew or are just plain lazy then this is the meal for you, otherwise skip brunch.

Also not a big fan of the Sunday brunch playlist.  Nirvana's "Smells like teen spirit" followed by Backstreet Boys' "Everybody"?  Hey don't get me wrong, I like a little Kurt Cobain and boy band music as much as the next person, but again I'm not sure this is the combination mix that goes with a relaxing Sunday brunch at a restaurant attempting to create a 'chic' environment.  

Will I come back for brunch? No Citta, I will stay away from your strange mixtures of both food and music.
