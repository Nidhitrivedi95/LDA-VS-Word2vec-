e3gLd-8XXC_HnvcWtjnrKQ I love Pizza Pizza but lately this location has been lacking on consistency with our orders. The last time I asked for a medium crust pizza but instead my Pizza was half thin crust and some parts the dough was thicker, very disappointing. Also if you haven't tried the jalapeño poppers, do so they are the best!!!
