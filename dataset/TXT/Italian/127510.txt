HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA Great to have Al's Beef in my neck of the woods.
Greeted with a welcome from behind the counter....nice touch!
Ordered 4 big beef with hot giardinara, dipped and 2 Chicago Style Dogs....to go.
Needless to say....the sandwiches were the best Italian Beef in Las Vegas!!!!!
Although, I did have to add extra hot giardinara (Vienna Brand) to my sandwiches at home.

My wife loved the Chicago Style Dogs....the only style hot dog she will eat.

Yes...I did eat the 4 beef sandwiches in one day....when I'm jonesing....I don't fool around.
