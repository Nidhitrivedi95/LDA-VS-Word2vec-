The space is nicely distributed, designed, and decorated. It has an inviting atmosphere that includes a clear view of the special oven that fires up these babies in just 90 seconds. Views of Bay and Bloor and the Yorkville area take your mind off of whatever you were thinking (besides pizza of course). If you come here during peak periods, expect a lineup to form with a few minutes of wait time. Outside of that, it's enjoyable to sit here and dine in on some authentic 'za.

Crust that is perfect is hard to find, but theirs definitely comes close. Your meal will have good texture to it depending on what you select. Grab a beverage cause you'll need one to wash the grub down. A caprese salad come on the side for $6 or you can customize your own for $7/$12. They do good pi, try 'em out for yourself.
