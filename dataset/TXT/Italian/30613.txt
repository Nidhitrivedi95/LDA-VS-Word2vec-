5keoVVM81g-nJw0Zdpl1nA My new favorite pizza joint in town!! I thought the cheese was so delicious and its stretchy and delicious and I want it right now! The service is pretty good for downtown, considering the hipster vibe of the place. You get what you pay for, as far as quality, it was 5.50 for a medium slice but it was so worth it! I recommend getting two slices if you are hungry. 
They have a nice selection of beers, fancy and non fancy and a couple of generic wine options. Its definitely a must do if you are in the down town area. You know what?? stop by even if you have to go out of your way, it is well worth it. Way better than the cosmopolitans over hyped "hidden pizza wedge" or whatever the hell its called.
