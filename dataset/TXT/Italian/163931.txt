lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg Second trip here on 10-26-17.  Not much has changed.  Pie as good as it gets for deep dish, but service and cleanliness of the dining area still need attention.

The servers show no sense of urgency, and when you are only 1 of 3 tables at open, getting refills for the 45 minute wait shouldn't be so difficult.  Luckily, we will be hitting this place every time we go to LV...for the pie, not the service 

Original 3/30/17 review:

As good as the Chicago original.

We went to a Giordano's in 2015 while in Chicago for some Royals games.  Just fell in love with this deep dish pizza...very worth the wait.

Visiting Henderson/Vegas this March and found out that this had opened on the Strip.  Because we visit Vegas fairly often, we don't really go to the Strip anymore.  But, by god, we were gonna trek our happy asses anywhere to get this pie.  We got there at opening, so our pizza that probably would have taken 45 min took exactly 1 hour because it was the first pizza in the oven that day and because we ordered a large so we could take some back "home" to our friends that we were staying with (they've never had Giordano's).

I'm telling you, this is a heavy pie...TONS of cheese, great "toppings" and a nice crispy crust that is just thick enough to hold this work of art together.  So don't go ordering one and then bitching that you have cheese gut :) It's worth it!!  I'm supposed to be dairy and grain free and I did not care one bit what the repercussions would be. 

It was good as what we had in Chicago.  Will go here every trip back to Vegas...guaranteed. Won't be upset if there's a location off the Strip that is more convenient though :)  

Enjoy guys!!
