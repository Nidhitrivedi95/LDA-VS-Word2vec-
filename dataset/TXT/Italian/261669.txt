wsmVIHJEi9J_38dXx2qLKA Very cute restaurant, a lot spacious than I expected. We were greeted warmly when we walked in, and all throughout our meal, the host and the waitress made sure we were comfortable and happy. My boyfriend ordered the kafta brochette, and I had the ravioli of the day (chicken & spinach, and buffalo mozzarella). The lamb kafta was very flavorful, and the hummus is absolutely amazing. His order came with a small plate of pita, which was also very good. My ravioli was tasty, although the portion is a little too small for me. The marinara sauce that came with the ravioli was a bit watery, but flavorful so I was happy with it. 

The very nice hostess asked us if we wanted dessert, and the dessert list sounded so good we just had to try it! We had the caramel cheesecake, and the chocolate cannoli (in a smaller size). I liked the cannoli a lot because it wasn't too sweet.

Overall, highly recommend for the atmosphere, the friendly service and good food!
