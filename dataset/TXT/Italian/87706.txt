dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg They still consistently give great food and service and they deserve an upgrade after all this time. Their Zucchini di Pomodoro is my personal favorite. It's hard finding good vegetarian pastas in this town. The EVOO, tomatoes, and zucchini shine in this dish. I don't feel like a glutinous heffer afterwards. Their bread is perfection. The caprese salad is beautiful with fresh slices of buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes. 

They promote their specials via text if you sign-up. One time my friend got a text for a complimentary cannoli and the waitress brought one for each of us. A generous and sweet surprise. Excellent food and personable service goes a long way and Parma deserves all the praise and love it gets.
