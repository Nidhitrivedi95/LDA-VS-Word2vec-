8xyRFdmF_9boBaPx0jBhHQ Ordered pizza and wings tonight to give them another shot after they messed up a order weeks ago. Now that was  a mistake. The pizza was so tough and tasted terrible. The wings were super dry. This place use to be great what happened. The night manager Kathy when I called was rude and said didn't care if I was lost as a customer when I been one for over a decade. She gave me a partial credit for my order which is now in the trash as its not edible.
