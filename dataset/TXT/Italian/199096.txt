pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw It is located in a very small, but charming building.  It has a reputation of having very long wait times.  Luckily, I was able to get there with a very short wait.  The food was ok.  Nothing super special about the pizzas.  I kinda thought the pizza choices were weird.  Even though the atmosphere was great, I probably won't be going back anytime soon.  You should go to this restaurant at least once to experience it for yourself though.
