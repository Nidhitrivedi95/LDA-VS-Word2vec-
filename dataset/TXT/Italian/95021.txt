eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg Looking for something a little more upscale while staying or visiting the Fremont Experience/Street? Well this is the place for you. The Grotto is located inside of the Golden Nugget and is a little hidden. You have to actually go through the whole casino and walk towards the pool with the sharks in the large tank.

Service is wonderful, the food was alright and prices are a little higher then you would get a say Olive Garden and such. I was with a largish group, but that was no problem for them as they were able to get some tables together quickly. Joan, our waiter, was very attentive and could answer any question you could have about the menu including her awesome suggestion of the waffle fries for the kids in our group.

I ordered the homemade roasted chicken ravioli which came with soft polenta, mascarpone, roasted red pepper cream & herbed velouté. What half of that means? I have no clue, but it was not too shabby. Before my meal was brought out we were served some warm bread with oil. It was bread, it was good, no complaints there. As far as the raviolis... I was expecting multiple small ravioli's, but it is really just one big ravioli. The flavors went well together and created a nice warm meal on a cold Vegas day.

Overall it was not too bad, would I go back? Maybe if I was in the mood for non-fast food and or I wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Fremont Experience.
