pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Went here a yr ago but I'm new to YELP so I'm catching up :) 
Waited 4 hrs, yes I heard the wait was long, but Reeeaaally? Finally sat @ 10pm after having some apps next door. By the time we sat we weren't terribly hungry but the server forced our foursome into getting 4 pizzas. We ate 2 (told you we weren't hungry) and took 2 home. Pizza was good, but Cibo is better! Was the wait worth it, ahhhh No.
