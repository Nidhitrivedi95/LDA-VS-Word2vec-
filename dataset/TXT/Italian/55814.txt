aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw Without a doubt, Bartolotta was an experience but you MUST be a seafood lover! I came here with a client and opted for the Top Chef tasting menu, which we enjoyed tremendously. Our table had a nice water view that added nicely to the ambiance. 

Unlike some expensive restaurants which give you tiny portions, the multiple courses were extremely filling and the fresh seafood did not disappoint. The presentation was flawless, service was impressive, and the overall meal was memorable. 

We got to try the famous langoustine, which apparently only 12 restaurants in the world have flown in live (and Bartolotta is obviously one of them). They were sweet and well cooked. 

The Top Chef tasting menu had a variety of pasta, seafood, risotto, and ended with the biggest pesce al sale profumato (fish course) I've ever seen! It was truly an impressive speciman of fish, coated in salt and lemon seasonings. They de-boned it table side and serve just the moist filet. We were all so full, but still managed to eat a fair amount. 

It was a pricey meal ($750 for 3 of us) but we did choose the most expensive tasting menu and overall, I would say it was worth it for the elegant presentation and wonderful meal!
