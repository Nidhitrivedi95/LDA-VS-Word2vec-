nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A I had the linguini with clams, my husband had the parm and my son had the spaghetti with meatballs.  It was all delicious!! The service was great and very family friendly not like some restaurants in Las Vegas that could be intimidating.  We also
had the hazel nut dessert with the salted Carmel ice cream and it was just the best!  Love this place.
