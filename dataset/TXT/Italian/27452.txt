4sfof0u2L7_ryXQusDM-aA Something has changed!  The place is empty when it used to be wait list only.  I think the manager that has been there is gone and obviously there was a new chef with a new menu.  Service was terribly slow.  My husband went inside to find out where our dinners were.  When they finally got there about 10 minutes later, we all started talking about things are not the same.  The Eggplant Torte has been my favorite dish, nicely plated....not tonite.  The chef just kind of put some eggplant slices on the plate and covered it with sauce.  I ordered Pasta with Clams.  Some clams were open, some were closed.  Taste was non existent.  The people who ordered the petrale sole said it was loaded with salt an inedible.  We were a group of 6.  Four of us had been there many times and all 6 agreed this was not typical of this restaurant.  Another couple at another table came over to talk to us; they said they were having the same experience.  When the manager finally came out to talk to us, we asked him where the regular manager was and he said he's been here since the opening.  NOT TRUE. When we queried him about this, he admitted that he goes from other locations and comes here also, sometimes.  So no manager, no regular chef, no business, lousy food...we no return!  What a shame.
