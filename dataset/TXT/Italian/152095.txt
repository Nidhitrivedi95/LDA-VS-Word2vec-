kR4NBNFf5SLpeAtZ-uPoPg So I've been in Scottsdale for over five years and I seriously can't believe that last night was the first I heard of That's Amore! We had just finished dinner next door at Thai Pan and as we were saying Arrivederci to our friends who were headed out of town, I looked up and saw the sign. I said, "what's that?" My husband said "That's Amore!" "What is it . . . let's check it out! Ooh, gelato!" I said. He said, "you go, I'll wait." I said, "let's just get a taste." Twenty dollars later we took home four flavors of the most creamy and delectable gelato we've ever tasted. 

The owner is the real Italian deal! He has a robust personality and was willing to let us try any (almost all) the flavors. He enthusiastically explained some of the flavors that were unfamiliar, offering up suggestions of what to pair with our chosen flavor, pushing little mini spoonfuls across the counter for our tasting pleasure. 

My husband and I are typically on opposite ends of the flavor spectrum. He goes for the fruity and cookie type flavors; I go for the bold chocolates and coffees. Honestly, we couldn't have gone wrong with any of them. What we took home: Black Cherry, Coffee, Malaga (similar to but better than what we know as rum raisin), and Biscotto. If my husband allowed me to choose a few more, I would have gone for the Toblerone (incredible dark chocolate), Amaretto, and Dolci di Latti. 

When I got home, I couldn't wait to put a little of each in one dish and devour it, and so I did. The Biscotto was the perfect selection to accompany any of the other three, so it will be a staple in our freezer. 

Simply put . . . "That's Amore" . . . "mi piace moltissimo!" (Now go Google that!)
