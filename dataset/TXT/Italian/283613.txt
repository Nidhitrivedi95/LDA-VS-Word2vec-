z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ Located on the 2nd floor of the D - on Fremont street.  Andiamos - an Italian Steak house - over priced.  I can make a better steak at home as well as the pasta they served with the steak.  Now the Caesar Salad - AMAZING - best I ever had - they make it at your table, the dressing OUTSTANDING.   Definitely order the Caesar Salad.  Our waiter was excellent.  Had reservations for 7:30 - restaurant was running late for whatever reason - and we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. Hostess staff - not the friendless...
