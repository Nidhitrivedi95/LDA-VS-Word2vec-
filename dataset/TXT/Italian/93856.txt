eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ Grape Street Cafe is a nice little restaurant with wonderful ambience and a very friendly wait staff.  I went there with my husband early on a Saturday night.  We each ordered a wine flight, an appetizer, and I ordered a pasta dish.  I thought the wine selection for the flight was wonderful and the price was fair.  The appetizer was okay.  We ordered a cheese and fruit plate.  I thought the cheese selection was only fair.  My pasta was good but a bit bland.  Overall, I had a very pleasant experience.  It is a bit over priced but otherwise a fun option if you're looking to get away from a chain restaurant.

I wish I could rate this as 3.5 stars.
