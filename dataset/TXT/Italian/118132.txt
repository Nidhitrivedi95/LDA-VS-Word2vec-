gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw While visiting Vegas for just one night, this was my choice of where to dine; partially because I was staying at the Venetian and partially because I have always been a Mario Batali fan. The menu was amazing, the wine list was superb. I tasted the best pasta I have ever had here. I would highly recommend this!!!
