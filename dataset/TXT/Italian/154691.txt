L_thK7r3K_h5M4tV7amEKQ Looking at the menu, everything is insanely cheap here! Meals range from $5 - $12, and the servings are large.

The biggest regret I have, however, is ordering this Honey Dijon Chicken Burger. LOOK AT THAT PICTURE. IT WAS LITERALLY JUST A BUN WITH CHICKEN AND HONEY!!!!!! Honestly, this is not what I was thinking when I read "chicken burger".... it was just very, VERY bland and dry.

As for the breakfast meals, the portions are large but not fresh. I was looking forward to the potatoes, but they weren't crispy at all ;; I will say the omelettes taste the best out of everything included.

Overall, this restaurant is a pretty great deal. The price is extremely ideal and the service is great too! However, the food just doesn't taste amazing.... so it's give and take. I may come back in the future if I'm looking for a quick cheap eat (especially late at night because this place opens until 3 AM). I will never order the chicken burgers here ever again tho!!
