bOGpm_4Emm4btMbJNA1L7A I was at the pool earlier and we got hungry, and my 3 year old is impatient this is only reason why we ate here. 

I ordered two pizzas. The girl told me it would be done in five minutes.  I pondered how is this possible, is it pre made?  

I waited 15 minutes, what a waste of my time.  The pizza wasn't anything impressive either.  I had better food truck pizza made in SF.  I can't believe this is a part of Wolf Gang Puck's restaurant chain.
