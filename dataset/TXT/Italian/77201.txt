cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA This place ain't got a ounce of chicago in it talk about bad service I been ordering giordanos my whole life starting in Chicago and was waiting forever for them to open in az I've always ordered Italian beef and gardenera peppers on my pizza always never had a issue in Chicago and manage to get it in az until now I just called to order and the lady refused to give me what I want what I ordered from the same location five days ago so I asked to speak to a manager who can help me I wait and they put me on the phone with a supposedly manager at a call center really ???? And what did that manager say to me even after I offered to pay extra sorry it was a one time deal for you we don't do that we don't order enough beef lmao are you serious giordanos shame on you for having hands down the worst customer service you lost a customer for life I would have payed extra for a damn Italian beef sandwich you could have put it on my pizza if anybody wants that good combo go to Lou malnatis in az they will do it for you I guess they ordered enough beef for there customers
