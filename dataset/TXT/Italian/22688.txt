Upon return to Dominick's for a second try, it did a complete 180. The restaurant was full yet spacious and waiters were exceptionally accommodating. The waiter Brad was extremely knowledgeable and was able to answer all questions regarding menu. He explained, suggested and gave us a little background on several items on then menu. 

The Sauté shrimp appetizer was the perfect size for two people. A little kick to it, large and full of flavor. My guest simply said "this is the best I've ever had"

I ordered the sea scallops again which were delicious. The portion was perfect and seared to perfection. 

My guest ordered the Chillian Sea bass and wow! I'm not a fish eater. I like shell fish and that's it. I do not like any fish but he assured me this would be different and Wow! This was just phenomenal. We added bread crumbs which gave it a bit of texture but it wasn't breaded. Very unique and definitely made a difference. 

Three words ...Creme brûlée corn. Amazing! 

We really enjoyed our dinner compared to our last visit. I will chalk that up to the PGA in town and it being extremely busy. I would definitely recommend Dominicks and will return.
