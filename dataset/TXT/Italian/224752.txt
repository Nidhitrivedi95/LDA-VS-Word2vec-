sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg I'm not even sure where to start with Sienna Mercato. They have great beers on draft (Pumpkin FTW), amazing appetizers ( seriously the cheesy bread and pepperoni fritters are ridiculous) and then the best meatballs I've ever had. 

I wholeheartedly reccomend you can the "saucy balls" entree. This means you get four GIANT meatballs (choice of beef, chicken, and vegetarian) in any sauce you can possibly think of (recommend Creamy Parm) OVER traditional pairings like pasta or mashed potatoes but also more creative and delicious alternatives like Tomato Risotto or mac & cheese. 

Service was top notch (quick and friendly) which made up for the wait to get in. 

Seriously ..go here.
