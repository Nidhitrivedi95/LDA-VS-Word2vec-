B5hl4fV8ZmwN2bLDgdr0Fw We recently hosted an event at Bado's for our family. 

I was able to easily speak with the event coordinator and set up the details of our event when I called. I customized the menu a bit due to some food allergies and called in two weeks ahead of time to confirm our count for our "adult pizza party" off of the banquet menu.

When we arrived, we were able to set up early and get ready for the event. Everyone was able to fit comfortably in the space and since the private room is upstairs, you also have access to the outdoor deck area. The room was clean and well laid out. There were also 2 TVs, a private bar, and the outdoor deck.

For food we had a mix of veggies and various dips, sandwich ring, and pizza. The pizza was probably the biggest party pizza I'd ever seen and was a big hit with guests. Included in the pizza party per person pricing were also three beers that were on tap.

The one weird thing was that at the end of the party there was some leftover food (i.e. about a quarter of a pizza); so as I was paying the bill I of course asked for it to be boxed up. Before this there was no indication that it was "catering" style and that any leftover food was to be left in the restaurant. I was told that the food could not be boxed due to house rules. I didn't understand since I had literally just paid for all of the food, but wasn't able to take it with me. It also wasn't explained well when I asked about it. In general it made me feel like they were being super sticklers and honestly ruined my excitement about telling others about the good parts of our experience.

For what the party was, it was a great room to host an event, but there are definitely some oddities that need worked out.
