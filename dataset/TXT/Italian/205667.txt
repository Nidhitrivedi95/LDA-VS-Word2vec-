The restaurant itself is super small and you might end up seated outside the restaurant in the aisle.  So if you are looking for an intimate romantic dinner, this place is not for you for sure.  But if you are just looking for a good Italian food reasonably priced, then this place is for you.  

My husband loved his lobster ravioli and I liked my dish too.  The dessert was too sweet for my taste but I bet a lot of people like it.  Two pasta dishes and a dessert = $55 plus tip.  The service is good... the owner (I am guessing he was the owner) stands outside of the restaurant, greeting people and keeping eyes on the tables.  

This place is a bit hard to find so ask a security guard for a direction when you enter the Venetian.
