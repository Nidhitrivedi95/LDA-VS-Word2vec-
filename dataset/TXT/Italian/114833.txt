GnODIDJz09LecpudDoynCg After striking out at two other Pizza's places while in Madison, a co-worker recommended Greenbush and all it did was fill me regret. Why? Because I regretted spending money at other Pizza places while in town while I could have had more of their AWESOME thin crust while in town!

One of the best pepperoni thin crust pizza's I have had in recent memory. 

Don't let the small location, bad parking and other small negativities scare you a way!
