H3cMcV9KK3g2pi68lDNsng Brunch at Luxe was very disappointing. Even though the waitstaff was very friendly, the waitress forgot the only drink order of the table. The portions are tiny (5-6 bites for the croquettes) compared to the prices and compared to brunch sized portions at many restaurants across Cleveland. The wild mushroom omelette tasted fine - nothing exceptional, and the portobella croquettes sounded good, but really had no flavor beyond deep fried batter.
I've been to Luxe for dinner before and really enjoyed that experience, so I'm surprised that brunch would be so different.
