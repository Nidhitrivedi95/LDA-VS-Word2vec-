zINKP9rtvo2IUKTZoYJUvQ My wife and I love this place and wish we could get here more often. Luckily for us, it's open on Mondays, a day that works well with our schedule.
The seating is cozy but the space is adequate. The food is simple but delicious. The gnudi and other pasta dishes are thoughtfully prepared with local and seasonal ingredients. The salads are tasty and the soups have never disappointed either. Reasonable prices, great service and delicious cuisine are the reasons we keep coming back!
