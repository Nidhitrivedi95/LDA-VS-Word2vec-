4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ I have lived in Southern Highlands for the past 5 years. This place was a gem before, fresh family run business. I'm afraid my red line has finally been crossed with the new owners. Called $80 take out order at 3:00. Told me 15 minutes. I show up at 3:20. 1 other customer at bar. 3 people in the kitchen. They haven't started my order yet!!!  "Don't worry it will only take 5 minutes"

Are the new owners serious? I've spent so much money at this place over the years remaining patient. Never again. Not one more penny from me.
