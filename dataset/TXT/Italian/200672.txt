pVntIctjRuspaO_ULf5zOA Used to go to Spacco on a regular frequency. Salad with grilled steak was excellent. Bought a dealfind coupon to bring us back for a special night with my wife. Wishing we never went. Our old memories were better than it has become. Shrimp appetizer excellent. Mussels cracked shells and broken shells meant that the mussels were dead, one or two could slip by, I stopped counting at six and sent it back. No apology, no offering a replacement, or something else. I had to ask for drink refills, but they didn't bother to ask my wife, rude. Didn't ask for it but the waiter said he would bring bread for the mussels, it never showed up. Good pizza, but the rissotto was swimming in butter, quarter inch deep at the bottom of the bowl. Get the bill, don't worry sir, we've taken care of the mussels.  However, they still thought it approprate to add a 15% tip. First time that I have left a restaurant without paying the full bill. Extremelly disappointing considering that it used to be so good.

I guess the sign that it was only half full on a Friday night is the tell all. Been in business since 1993, won't see their twenty year anniversary unless serious change happens. Toronto is a big city wiith lots of great restaurants. Don't waste your time with this one.
