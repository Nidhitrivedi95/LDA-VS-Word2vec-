wp5FAtCGMyU2RnQ-7kxKHQ We've tried Roman Bistro several times over a few years and in roughly a third of our visits have been disappointed.  The waitstaff is professional and caring, but the management is not willing to take responsibility or try to satisfy in the face of problems.  Tonight, two of us were served while the third member of our party waited for about 10 minutes before being served.  The manager made no apologies and insisted that we had only waited 4 minutes and gave us a card for a free desert next time we bought a dinner there.  Never again.
