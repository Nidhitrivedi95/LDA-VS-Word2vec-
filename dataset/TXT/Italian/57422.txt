They suggested a couple of appetizers, grilled shrimps. Calamari and butter squash raviolis. All absolutely delicious. Of course the main event is always there steaks, but because of my high cholesterol I ordered linguine and clams. My husband ordered their ribeye steak and as always perfect and delicious. Some of my guests had never been to Piero's and all concluded it was the best steaks ever.
