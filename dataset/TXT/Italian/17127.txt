Randomly and I mean randomly stopped in and asked for a slice of pizza. Maria said no, but persuaded my mom and I to have a seat and that it wouldn't take long. 

I asked for a "white pizza" not even sure I knew what I wanted. Maria said they'd do a margarita with a white sauce. HOLY CRAP it was AWESOME. The pizza was gone before we pulled out of the driveway. 

Maria working the take out was super cool and someone I'd hang out with. Thanks girl for making my day!
