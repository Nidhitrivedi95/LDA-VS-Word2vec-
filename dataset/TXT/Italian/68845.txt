bUGtQAzsJ8Z-Y8vBtY6aPQ What an extraordinary find!

This is far more than simply a pizza place.  Though the cheese pizza I had was the best I've had in F.H.

The crust was chewy without being soggy.  There was enough cheese to make even a Wisconsin cheese head happy.  Just the right amount without being too rich.

The service was excellent.  It's obvious the owners want to provide personal as well as personable service.  Count me satisfied in that regard.

The menu, beyond pizza looks terrific.  While I was enjoying my pizza, several people came in for take out orders.  

It's important to note here that delivery is now an option.  

Their menu includes pasta, sub sandwiches, salads and several tempting dessert options.  Something for the pickiest of family members.

The best part is that I got two huge slices of pizza and a drink for less than $6.

I took a menu so I can try other items to be delivered.

This is not some chain restaurant.  It's  locally owned and operated. 

Like Arnold says...I'll be back.
