mOFCSkPUPKjISMDhvz02HQ The tea was just brownish water...my husband ordered 2 dozen bone in wings in hot. They were DISGUSTING. We have eaten here for years and he always went there for the wings and said they were THE BEST. Not sure where they get their wings from now but to be honest,  theu tasted lile the frozen tyson ones that we sampled at Costco.  Just more hot wing sauce. There was no meat on them. Just this weird jelly like fat substance. They were greasy and gooey. Disgusting.  We will kever be back. We frequented this place for the wings and baked minestrone soup (which used to also be good). Now it is just brown gravy and stale bread. I saw a half a noodle. Thats it. We tipped our waiter because it is not his fault that the food has gone down hill...SEVERELY.  45 Dollars and an hour of our life we will never get back. You have lost very loyal customers with the shortcuts you guys are taking. Never never EVER AGAIN. If you want fatty weird jelly on a chicken bone though, this is the place for you to go
