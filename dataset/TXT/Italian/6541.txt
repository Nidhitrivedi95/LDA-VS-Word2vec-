0aw3HbxkZ4G7pkPYt10fhA My mother & I waited 10 minutes for a server, he checked on us once and waiting a long time for our check. Where other tables were being served fairly quickly, noted only one other table in the section we were sitting at. Nobody needs to wait 10 minutes for a server. I come here all the time and service is always great till now. He could be a new server I don't know, not the best service today.
