u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg You know what I LOVE about Postino's?  THE PATIO IS DOG FRIENDLY!!!  We love to go there on a Sunday afternoon and share a bottle of wine or champagne, snack and enjoy the cool weather!  It's a great place to meet the girls for lunch too!  Great snacks, salads and wine selection!  Great neighborhood hang out!
