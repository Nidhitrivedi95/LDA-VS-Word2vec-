I was entertaining VIP clients while attending a trade show in Las Vegas and chose Sinatra based upon other Yelpers and the menu. It was a great choice.

We started out with a couple of cocktails and then we were told about the specials and given plenty of time to order. I went with the tuna carpaccio which was tuna sliced paper thin with capers and a perfect dressing. My co-diners went with a salad that was made with watermelon. I don't recall what it was called but they loved it.

I decided to go with the Chicken which was covered in wild mushrooms in a marsala wine sauce over gnocchi. It was DELICIOUS - the gnocchi was the best I ever ate - light tiny little clouds that I couldnt stop eating. The sauce was perfect and the chicken as well. 

My co diners had the salmon which was served over vegetables and the pork saltimbocca which was served with a creamy, cheesy spinach. Both said they were delicious.

We passed on dessert as we were too full. Service was excellent and the atmosphere dimly lit and quiet. Perfect for client entertaining or a romantic evening.
