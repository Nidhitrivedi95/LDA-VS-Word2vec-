DRIyvsa8LUaPNhAMmKdjOQ My husband and I were at the restaurant last night and I found 2 hairs in my salad and 1 in my pasta! I have never experienced this at a restaurant in my entire life! (Yes, maybe once in a blue moon a hair will be found, but not 3!!!) I hardly touched my food so you would think that the waitress would notice, but not so much! It also took 45 minutes to get our meals and there were only 2-3 other tables in there! Needless to say, we will not be returning! EVER!
