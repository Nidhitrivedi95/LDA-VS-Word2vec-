KNpcPGqDORDdvtekXd348w Just this moment got back from dinner at the Carriage Inn in Elizabeth, Pa. I stopped long enough to make myself a sandwich of one slice yellow cheese on two slices plain white bread and that alone was miles ahead of what I was served at Carriage Inn for a meal, before I wrote this review. Completely inedible.  Ordered fish on a dish with onion rings and cole slaw.  The fish was cold, greasy, and limp. Same for the rings. The slaw was dry and sour. My nephew's fish was the same.  My friends medium well steak arrived rare, was sent back and returned well done.  Exceedingly frustrating, and as the 'manager wasn't on duty' there was nothing anyone could do about adjusting the bill for all the uneaten, and I mean uneaten, food.  I won't be back.  They won't miss me. There's a sucker born every minute !
