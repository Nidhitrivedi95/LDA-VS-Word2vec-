CbI4IFtWCNm4rLvWr0veEw Visited Villa Dolce for a friend's birthday.  We had a group of approximately 20 people, and they were very accommodating and had a back room set aside for us.  The place is very intimate, with a variety of smaller dining areas, so it never feels over crowded.  Pizza and pasta were both excellent.  The pizza is a semi-thin chewy crust and the amount of cheese and toppings they use is just-right, not overkill as it is with some other pizza places.  Service was excellent, and our server allowed us to split the checks since some were leaving earlier than others.  Great place, and I would recommend it to others without hesitation.
