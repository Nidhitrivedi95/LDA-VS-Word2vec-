YXvXE2p6xeg6a11SMIjQ3w Came here to quickly grab a slice for myself and my daughter. Sat at the outside bar for a bit, noticed the poor bartender was running his ass off so I went inside to find a host/ess. Nope. This poor kid was working the ENTIRE place by himself. Meaning taking guests on patio, bar and interior tables. THIS KID ROCKS. Give this kid a raise ! (I know managers read yelp) The interior is rustic and typical downtown chandler. The pizza for this Jersey girl was just "eh". A little on the doughy side, could have been cooked more. Sauce had flavor and cheese was fresh. I wish that I had more time to really look over the menu. Pizza was good enough to make me want to discover more items on their menu.  Let's hope when I return there are more people working
