UFvLouGNq5q3w-0Ud_HP7w As a first timer, I ordered a thin crust Loop and a deep dish Lake Shore Drive.  Overall, the cheese and ingredients were very tasty, although we felt the sliced tomatoes on the Loop could have been of slightly better quality.  The thin crust itself was delicious.  The crust on the deep dish was a little too crispy to earn five stars, but the buttery taste of the crust was appreciated.
