5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Decent meal after a show. The half BBQ chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The sides of spinach, corn, and butter beans were all pitch perfect.  Washed down with a decent IPA beer and it was overall a great meal.   

Considering the quality of ingredients, the location, ambiance, and service, the price seemed in line with other restaurants at this quality level. 

If you're seeing a show at the Belk Theater, this is a decent option that is close, has a varied menu, and isn't too pretentious.
