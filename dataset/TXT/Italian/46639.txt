8qNOI6Q1-rJrvWWD5Btz6w Food is good, overpriced in my opinion, but was good for an occasional treat. Pasta Luciano is yummy which is their red sauce and alfredo sauce mixed together. Chicken Parm is another favorite. The Wedding Soup is spot on. 

The servers are usually very pleasant but the hostesses and managers are TERRIBLE. They have the attitude that you are bothering them by being there and if something is wrong, they try to turn it around on you. If that only happened once, I'd just brush it off, but it has happened several times. Sorry, but when you order a pizza for delivery and they bring you something completely different, I'm not taking partial blame for that. 

I'd suggest you just go to Tillie's Restaurant down the road.
