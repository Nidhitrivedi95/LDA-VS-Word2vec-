JK_DiDwbl7HX5OhCAh3h4g Got pulled from the street by a friendly host - he convinced my girlfriend and I to come inside. I had the diplomatico sandwich and a side of fries; both were fine but hardly impressive. Americano was good and the service was attentive. You get what you pay for I guess - it met my expectations.
