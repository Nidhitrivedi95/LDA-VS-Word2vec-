pCWg4B0R5gauQR4SJ9VDmw Dang, This pizza place is a sleeper. I have lived in the neighborhood 20 yrs.
    Their pizza is the BEST around for the money.
 I try to always eat Stumps about every Sunday night as a treat.
    Get it to go and I love the pizza even after I have to freeze some I don't eat.
  Get a pizza stone and you are all set.. BillyRay
