Other wise this place is very elegant (not stuffy though). Romantic, excellent professional full-plate service; not the kind of place that tells you to keep your fork. Yes, it is expensive but they do all the things that a place at this price point should have: a gracious and welcoming hostess, professional wait staff, beautiful linens, a full course formal plate setting, over the top lush and romantic atmosphere and beautiful bathrooms. When we left bar downstairs had the piano playing and it was so laid-back and moody. It would also be a great place for drinks and some light eating.
