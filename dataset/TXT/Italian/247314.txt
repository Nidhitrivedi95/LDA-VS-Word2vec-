VA95qAV2PRH9gtTi2Vfv4Q The kale salad and grilled calamari was simply amazing and extremely filling. I had ordered the calamari as an add on to the salad and was pleasantly surprised with the quantity. The only disappointment was that I didn't receive some bread to snack on while I waited for the main course. I find this to consistently on/off- sometimes I get it sometimes I dont- and it's so delicious that I would be happily munching on it all the time!
