Thought I would give them a second try and had the bbq chicken pizza which was completely burnt on all the edges but the rest was really good. Hot dogs were the best food I have had there. The buns are amazing and the fries are really good. I will be back to try more items on the menu but only for lunch, no more breakfast!
