-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw Ate here with esposa and our two daughters.  It was a beautiful Scottsdale afternoon, so we sat outside.  Our server was top-notch from start to finish: witty, personable, and knowledgeable.  Ambiance is nice and comfortable.  Menu offers a nice array of Italian offerings.  Everything was very nicely presented, fresh, hot, and flavorful.  Wine list is a bit limited, but has excellent choices.  OVERALL: VERY GOOD.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
