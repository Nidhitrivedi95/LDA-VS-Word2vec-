GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA The food here is ok.

I don't remember what everyone at the table ordered but I know I got the Beef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver for $26 and my mother ordered the Linguine with Clams, Pancetta and Hot Chiles for $29.  How you can make a seafood linguine for $29 dollars is beyond me.  I'm guessing their clams are clammier than your normal clam.  Or found in some distant, unknown cove in the Sea of Tranquility.  If so, I couldn't tell.  Seemed like a normal seafood linguine to me.  As for my beef cheek ravioli, I'm sure Mr. Batali's idea for creating this dish was "Let's stuff everything that's tasty into a small pouch.  Texturally, it felt like I was eating baby food.  And it was too rich.  Every bite felt like eating a pillowcase of butter.

But!  Though the food is lacking, the service is impeccable.

You stay classy Las Vegas!
