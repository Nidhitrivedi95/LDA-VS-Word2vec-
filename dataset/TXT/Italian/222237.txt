SgSVJWgMwFteYyz4OlHu9Q Finally putting my official review!  These guys are family owned, so you know they will make you feel welcomed.  I don't eat other "pizza" places anymore.  My father is originally from Brooklyn as well as these guys are.  Whenever I come in they always welcome me and my brother.  I give out love to these guys and what they do on a daily basis making sure everything down to the "T".  I love my pizza and this is the one place I will go.  I will always refer people that I know as well as anyone who wants good wood fire pizza.  Don't just check out the pizza they have other beautifully tasting goodies as well.
