ta0rxEq9cL6aKxO68OkKkQ It was the first time that for me and my friend to go to this pasta restaurant, and tell you what, I'm glad we went there! The waiters at this place are very friendly and the food was tasty although it was a bit blend. Also they give a good portion for the price and they are not stingy with the ingredients.

Therefore I would go again to eat there and also I recommend this place if you like pasta.
