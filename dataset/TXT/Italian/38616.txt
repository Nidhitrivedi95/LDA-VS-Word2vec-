7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ great little spot... i think the pizza is very good... the people i went with fell in love with the chicken wings... and i can see why... they are grilled, which you dont always find at food places... i like the atmosphere... it is super casual and has some good drinks... check it out if you are in the area and not in the mood for postinos
