Y-hmtitiRfg7vmc3N-lTww The service was below average. I received a glass of water that clearly had a large black item floating on top. The waitress never apologized and claimed it was simply parsley. 

The food was not that great either. The calamari was over cooked and rubbery. The pizza was under cooked, and me and my date both became ill from the food. It is unlikely that we will return.
