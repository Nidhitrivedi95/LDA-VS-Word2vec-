0URIvKxCNT-AVgtdYFAX8w I live walking distance from Harley's and I do not make it there nearly enough.  Where do I start?  The Staff AMAZING. The food, what's better than amazing? The prices, out of this world affordable.  My partner and I dine there when we have time together.  He is not a pizza guy but I convinced him to get the Prosciutto and Arugula Pizza with Balsamic reduction.  3 months later he is still talking about it.  dinner for 2 with wine for under 30+tip best value in the city  (NOT in  an over crowded chain restaurant with screaming kids) PRICELESS. 

I am not an employee nor am I related to anyone that works there (I hear some restaurants do that) Stacy and Charlotte you have done a great job.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place
