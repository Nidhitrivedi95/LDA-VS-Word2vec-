A7f8lp2v3PK2sH2JHzX9YA Best pizza I've had in Montreal, it's amazing! I got the cheese pizza and tried one of their tomato-less pizzas, I much preferred the cheese one although the latter wasn't so bad either. Prices are very fair, staff is really fast, and there's beautiful decor. My only complaint is that they don't have almond or lactose free milk for their coffee but it won't kill me
