GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA My mom and I had Christmas dinner here and the food was amazing!! There were a lit of small complimentary treats.  Also, the lamb was brought,sliced and served at our table.  The space was a little tight and our table was tiny but nothing worth complaining about.  Yes, it is on the pricey side but it's a steakhouse so it's to be expected.  Would def dine here again.
