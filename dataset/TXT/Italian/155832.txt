L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw A nice central location to meet up with friends, go for a drink with coworkers or take a date. It's decorated nicely so great for those girls night photos. The service was good as well. The only issue was that the food and drinks came out to be a bit overpriced for being very average. We shared the calamari and mushrooms as apps which were decent. The porcini fetuccini was alright but not that memorable. I did like that they had a bevy of non-alcoholic drinks that were actually fun and pretty tasty but I'm unlikely to return just for the drinks.
