caq9CTtWB-8K0tdFUhTfAQ Pretty decent Italian food. I ordered their seafood pasta special and it was enormous. It's not jump up and down good, but can definitely satisfy a pasta craving. I also consider myself somewhat of a tiramisu expert I give their tiramisu two thumbs up. I copied them and started serving my tiramisu in little balls. Very creamy and yummy! Service is not the fastest but I am generally in no hurry so it's fine by me.
