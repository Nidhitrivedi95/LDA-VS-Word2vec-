0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw I can't believe that I lived less than ten minutes from Joe's for almost five years and ate here once...WTH?  I guess the location off Higley and Ray wasn't along my normal route, otherwise I would have been a regular for sure.  I'm spending the day with my Golden Retriever, Chloe Rose, so after a walk around the park and a stop off at the doggie juice bar for Mutt Muffins and Yappy Yogurt, I needed a decent spot for lunch that would allow the princess pooch to hang out with me.  

The atmosphere at Joe's is really cool and very unique...it was portrayed well on the Food Network's "Triple D"  It's modern, kindof rustic and not Arizona at all.  Gotta love the TV playing cartoons and the Barbie Dolls/GI Joe figurines in the unisex restroom.  

We ordered the signature BBQ chicken pizza (the bomb) and the Grilled Chicken Sandwich (one of the best I've ever had) which is HUGE....I ordered it on a multi-grain bun with blue cheese and "upgraded" to garlic fries which were to die for...seriously dripping with garlic and parmesean cheese.  I must also mention the pickles which were awesome...so fresh tasting since the cucumbers are locally grown.   I like that the condiments are self-serve along with the beverages.  I cannot wait to get back here for breakfast next weekend :)
