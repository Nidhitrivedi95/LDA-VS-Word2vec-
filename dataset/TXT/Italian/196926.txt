POJL-N7Smw1UZMP_xldFwg Had this mad craving for spaghetti the other day, so I hit up this place on Yelp. They had an amazing online catalogue in which everything looked delicious, and I ended up ordering 1 pasta, 1 pizza, 1 salad, plus 1 desert. Yes, all for me;)
Of the 4 items, my favorite was by far the salad. Which was a surprise since salad isn't even real food in my books!! THAT's how good it was. It had strawberries and veggies in it, and came with the most delicious dressing EVER. A perfect balance of sweetness and sourness, and the texture was just incredible. The first bite reminded me of home, and I'm not even Italian!! Strawberry salad, you may just have converted me, I am officially a salad-lover now.
The other three items were sadly forgettable. The pasta was way too creamy, and they didn't even have vinegar in the kitchen?? Pizza was okay, only had potatoes on it so it was kinda boring. For dessert I chose panna cotta, and again, it was very rich. Fortunately the blueberrries on the side had enough sourness to balance it out, as I managed to finish this one.
Overall it was a solid meal, nothing was particularly bad, and that salad REALLY stood out. The interior was nice, lots of natural light and food that actually look appetizing! And you just gotta love the price. Will definitely return again to try out other items on the menu:)
