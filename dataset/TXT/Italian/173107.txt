N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg Been wanting to go here since it opened and bit the bullet on the one hour wait time, figuring that wasn't going to change anytime soon. 

Went on a Friday at about 6:30 and waited just over an hour. You can't make reservations or call ahead, but when you arrive, they'll take your pizza order so that can get started and text you when your table is ready. You'll still have to wait a while at the table, but it's a while less. 

Pizza was tasty, but none of us thought it was worth an hour wait. The garlic bread was very good also. 

The bathrooms were odd. We saw several people waiting outside them, because they are single bathrooms, two for women and two for men. But that wasn't obvious in the hallway, because unless you walked all the way down, you wouldn't see it went "W", "M", "W" and then "M" - felt like you were going somewhere you shouldn't (like the office).
