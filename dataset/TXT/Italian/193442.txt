pHpOuNf02eMyhdCnvMQGhg Very unfriendly hostess.  Tables are placed too close together.  They really cram people in like sardines before shows.  Food isn't memorable, in fact downright horrible at times.  I've had to endure this place on several occasions for work lunches and friends who've wanted to try it before seeing a show.  From the outside it looks like a great, bustling place, but once you're in and seated you quickly regret it.
