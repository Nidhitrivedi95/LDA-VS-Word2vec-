4qQVf2lt-47VcQ4v54PEXQ This place is small and it was not a great experience.  We had six people and was told   that the wait was 15 mins for dinner.  It was actually 25 mins.  The place seemed to have plenty of help, but had a help wanted sign in the window.  Since it probably only holds 40 people max, I'm not sure how any people were needed.  It took us 5 mins to get drinks.  And another 5 to order.  After waiting another 45 for our food, we told the waitress we were in a hurry and had to get our son to the Ice Den for hockey.  My son ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  How long does it take for spaghetti and meatballs???
So, his order comes out fast and everyone's else's except mine comes out 10 mins later.  Since we are in a hurry, I start eating my son's spaghetti while he has to leave.  I asked the waitress where's my food (a calzone) and the kitchen and waitress start a commotion and panic blaming that it went to table 6 (we were table 7).  However, I didn't see a calzone on any table.  Well, the kitchen never made my food.  I have never, ever been to a restaurant where my food was never ordered or the waitress never saw that my food was there.  Or even checking up.  We never got drink refills either.  Even after removing the drinks from the bill, it wasn't enough.
