7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ I came here at 7pm on a Saturday to get a glass of wine from the wine bar. It wasn't that busy but it look over 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge our presence and even longer for someone to bring us a menu. There's lots of other bars in the palazzo, I don't recommend this one.
