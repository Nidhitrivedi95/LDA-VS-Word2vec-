te-QMdSMQdjws6NnRexjJQ I have to confess, I'm still on a hunt for that perfect local Italian restaurant that everyone has - the one you go to when you can't be bothered to cook but can't justify going out for a swanky meal, or just where you go because you know it's always so good.

Although I haven't found it yet in Edinburgh, Ciao Roma is definitely leading the pack after 4 years of living here. I ate here for a friend's birthday recently and I'd absolutely recommend it.

For one thing, the service was excellent. You got the impression from the efficiency of it that they are used to handling big groups of girls with copious amounts of wine, and yet they were also very patient with us and didn't rush us at all. 

The menu isn't just the usual tired pizza/pasta list that you so often see; obviously they do offer all of these things but what struck me was how many risotto dishes on offer, as well and chicken/steak-based dishes. I went for a risotto with scallops, brandy, a good helping of garlic and roast peppers (£9.95), and it really was lovely.

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the price of the house wine, although it wasn't by any means extortionate it was more than you'd expect in a cheap-and-cheerful italian. That said, if you're looking for an Italian place in this neck of the woods, then you could do an awful lot worse than go here.
