Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A 8 of us went to the Sunday Brunch to celebrate my father's  82nd birthday. They charged us a 18% gratuity--which is crazy for a buffet. The food was not very hot--unless you got a made to order omelet. The ham was dried up. Desert selection was poor and they only had a small tray of sweet rolls. We should have known to go elsewhere as they place was not crowded at 10:30am.  3 of us are locals and go to the Palms regularly to gamble but we will never go back to the buffet.
