XqSN1PtZkJ6QorOUa9AAdA What a great experience for my Wife's birthday.  At first, we couldnt find the specific restaurant, but asked a staff member who showed where it was in the back.  What a beautiful resort;ive been living in Tempe for five years and had no idea it existed.

After we were seated, an assistant server took our order.  Our main server did not come for quite a few minutes, which has me worried.  However, when he arrived, Michael apologized for the delay.  

My wife and I ordered a cheese board, white anchovies, grilled Ahi Tuna, the homemade pasta with mushroom marsala sauce, and roasted tomatoes with parmeseasn.  In all, it cost 69$ after tax before tip--very reasonable.

The cheese board was great, with homemade jams.  The meal also came with a complimentary bread basket (we had two lol).  The anchovies were just OK, would not order again would rather get more cheese.  The Grilled Ahi was very good, tasted fresh and the chef let the flavors of the tuna stand out serving it only with a caponata, or what I call an Italian salsa.  The pasta was delicious even though i generally do not like cream sauce.  It did not taste like cream sauce i have ever eaten before -- it literally had a ton of fresh whole fancy mushrooms in the sauce.  It was also served with wilted argula which tasted great when mixed in with the sauce.

Michael our server was great.  He offered us a dessert on the house because of my Wife's birthday.  We chose the chocoloate hazelnut cake.  When they brought out the creme brulee, we sent it back and apologized for the misunderstandiing.  To make it even better, Michael came back with both the creme brulee and the chocolate cake--both on the house.

The meal also came with two complimentary gondola ride tickets.  No, its not Venice, but this was a great experience as well.  A great way to end the evening when the weather is perfect.  All in all, this was a great experience at a reasonable cost.
