PJVjfGtVc71M0XlUr83teQ My daughter and I decided to go back and give this place a second taste.  Hmmm seems like the Cook had a magic touch, because our early dinner was fantastic.  The prices are reasonable for such generous portions and once again, we had to request a doggy bag to take home. I hope I'll be able to upload our meal pictures.

We missed meeting the Owner.  Ha Ha, a reason to return and munch some more while hearing My Pie's history.
