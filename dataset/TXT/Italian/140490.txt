JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw Service was great,  Food was small in portion size, no salad included with dinner.  2 small slices of bread served cold, not warm and very expensive.  House wine was $14.00 per glass. The house wine sells for $12.99 per bottle at your local wine store.  The bacon with the pasta dish was fatty and chewy.  My daughter was not able to finish her 1/2 size order, it was that bad. I would not recommend this restaurant nor will I return.
