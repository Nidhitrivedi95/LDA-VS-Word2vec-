8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA One of the best deep dish pizza's in Vegas.  The crust isn't doughy, the bottom of the pie is crusted lightly, and the thickness of it smothered with the a sweet sauce, melted cheese and assorted meats is just like eating, well, a pie.

My husband knows it takes a while for one of these big pizza's to cook, so he manages to pre order and when we walk in, they are expecting us and we are seated right away and a juicy hot pizza is delivered to our table.   No waiting!

The staff are friendly, eager to please and always prompt.  The pizza's great here!
