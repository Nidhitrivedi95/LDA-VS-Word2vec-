kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg Was a little disappointed since I heard a lot of great reviews from their first location. The food here is just average, for the prices to be what they are. The restaurant is nice on the inside but the high ceilings make it too loud. Not my favorite type of dining atmosphere. Should have posted this a long time ago...
