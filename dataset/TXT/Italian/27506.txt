Stopped in tonight after the Steelers game and although the restaurant had many women and children in it , they allowed a butch of rowdy fans to use F & MF bombs continuously without regard for the others in the restaurant . Couldn't tell you how the food and service was because after my drink 's came I got disgusted and left . Who allows this behavior in a restaurant? I guess Cafe Milano does . Stay away . Better places in Pittsburgh.
