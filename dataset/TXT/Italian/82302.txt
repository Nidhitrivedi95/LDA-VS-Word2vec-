DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw I haven't been to this place in several years so I was excited when my friend Gina randomly brought me for dinner one night. Staff is super friendly. Everyone goes above and beyond to make you feel extremely welcome. 

We started off with the House Ferraro salad. The best description for the salad is extremely fresh. The pine nuts complement the fennel and Arugula perfectly. 

For my entree, at the waiters recommendation I took a chance and ordered a special. It Was So Good! 

It is made with Homemade 30 yolks Taglierini pasta  with sea urchin and a ginger carrot sauce. It was perfect! Highly recommend. I was super nervous as I've only had sea urchin in sushi, but I wanted to be a little adventurous... It was totally worth it! So good. 

The waiter also chose a selection of deserts for us. The Amaretto Pistachio cookie was my favorite. This is definitely a great place for a nice meal but also perfect if you want to impress someone. They also have a very extensive and impressive wine list. Don't be intimidated!

I love when a dinner is amazing from top to bottom. The review writes itself.
