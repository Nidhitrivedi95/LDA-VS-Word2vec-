b3zsV44_SBz5JLwyfiHsRA First, please understand, I avoid chains.  Some are ok, but I like to show the love to those shining stars who are out doing this on their own.  That said - every meal I've had at Carrabba's has been very good, with great service, and nice friendly people to make the experience just right.  Love the chicken Bryan - some times it's a little "too" rich - but tonight was just right.  The calamari was wonderful as usual.  Fantastic service.  We were there for a friends birthday (about 10 of us!) - and we kind of messed the server up by playing musical chairs a bit so we could visit with each other.  She wasn't flustered, took it in stride, and did a wonderful job of accommodating us.  Couldn't have been a better time!  I'm a fan!  (And the take home Pasta dish as a 'bonus' was perfect the next day!)
