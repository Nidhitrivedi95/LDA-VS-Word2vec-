vNQkym5qZ-E-4AJ4IQ5JEg If you want one of the best, most authentic Italian dining experiences in the country then look no further than here. But bring your wallet. My girlfriend and I came here last weekend. To start off we got the meatball appetizer. (Which is more than enough to feed 4 people, we had to take it home and it is to die for) then they brought out a pasta dish with vodka sauce .(which is also to die for) and for the main course I had the cowboy steak Gorgonzola. Which absolutely changed my life. And my girl had the linguini del mare. Which she said was very good. This establishment is not only one of the best in the region, it's one of the best eating establishments in the country. And I would recommend to anyone that is visiting the area or those who live here and haven't tried it yet. Also, don't let the neighborhood that it's in scare you, they have a safe valet parking service. I hope this review helped... Enjoy!
