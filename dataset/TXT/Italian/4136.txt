_j-JBXnTuXclA1lEzzezmQ Had the pleasure of revisiting this resto last night and felt It warranted a review - charming as it might seem I realize it's truly a spot that's a function of convenience from where it's located with the ambiance and noise buzz akin to that of a university cafeteria- though it's not without its heralds (personally I do enjoy the comfortable seating in the bar area) I do realize I was there during primetime 

I always enjoy an open concept kitchen - but sadly there is no artistry taking place here  - it's a factory assembly line where drones perform  and you can watch what a pre-franchise product run by aspiring post secondary students would look like seeking a ISO-9000 certification.

They boast a standard curated wine menu by the glass and bottle - standard fare here - though no sommelier available for consult 

The Carpaccio is one of my favs on the menu and truly is one of the better ones I've had in the city - simple and true where less is more and is a great classic piece. 

The Crab cakes were actually the high point ; having had crabby patties  across the continent - for what they've presented is quite an enjoyable feat - though I did have them split it into two individual cakes as opposed to the single huge patty as it was more manageable that way as a tapas piece - and I owe kudos to them recognizing that input and making the request of the kitchen - the additional chunked avocado and mayo complimented it very nicely - it's not Maryland but they'll pass :)

The cheese board was "meh"'such that It offered no real value beyond the delightful jams I truly could take it or leave it but I'd rather revisit the charcuterie board I'd had on previous visits...

The smoked Salmon salad was actually drier than Preferred but the addition of figs and pine nuts to the soft cheese to the greens was a notable difference that added a sweetness I found delightful

I was actually disappointed with the Lobster pasta ravioli - as a seasonal item I found the rose sauce uninspiring and without merit  and the stuffing was bland, light and had me searching for traces of crustaceans -  all I could taste was fresh pasta cooked to perfection  - I'd personally seek this dish elsewhere 

Though I will say they make a wicked Americano coffee - and it is fantastic and when paired with a shot of baileys was worthy of a repeat (and - it's served with a generic almond biscotti )

Notably a very nice light tiramisu and flavourful coconut cream pie that both were bang-on terrific as a post meal delight - I'd suggest exploring the dessert menu :)
