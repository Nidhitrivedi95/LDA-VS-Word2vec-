Zt4ljpwfmBufatNM1zPNcQ First time there a couple weeks ago to the Tempe location. The food was indeed absolutely amazing, and the environment is super-nice! As celiacs, my daughter and I have gone to so many places and had their GF dishes. Some good, some not so much. This one is REALLY awesome. We both had the Creamy Tomato Bolognese. The noodles tasted "real" -- but actually way better than any wheat noodle I've ever had. 

The price was a little expensive, $17.50 a meal (not sure I agree with yelp's $$ rating). The only down side was that our portions were very small. Perhaps that's why I say that it was expensive. I see that other people think opposite. (?) Perhaps we came on a bad day? We are both around 120 lbs., and this was the first time we both said to each other that we were actually still hungry after dining. lol

Otherwise, I would give this place 6 stars.
