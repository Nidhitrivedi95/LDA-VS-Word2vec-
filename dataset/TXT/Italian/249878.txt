vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw First of all,  I've been coming to Oregano's since 1997.   I love this place and this was my first experience at the new location at 67th ave and Bell.  This location was overdue!  Too bad it's so small and the bar seating is only for four people.  Way Too small! Angela the bartender was very nice.  

Now to my food.  I ordered the Numero One -0 without onions and green peppers WITH Hatch green chili and extra cheese.  I received a pizza with onion and very little green chili.  The chili was right out of a can with no taste.  Very disappointing.
