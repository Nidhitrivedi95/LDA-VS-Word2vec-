NFTOaufaF6oHsshUROAp8g Excellence!!! I'm based in Seattle where excellent/inexpensive Italian food is as rare a sunny day in February, therefore, this Cleveland gem was a true treat! From the family atmosphere to the homemade marinara, Dino's was IT!!! I got the Chicken Parm sub, which is as hard to find in Seattle as a good Mayoral decision! 

The sub came with delicately thin breaded slices of tender chicken carved with the alacrity of a chisel wielded by Michaelangelo himself.  The sauce complemented without overpowering, but included a side of peppers to slake your spicier taste!

This is a must!!!
