Finally WONDERFUL Italian food ... Yumm & double yumm!!!

That was last year.  And it was true. Wonderful warm welcoming feeling, wonderful food, wonderful service. And very understanding and cooperative toward my wife, who is blind. Even to the point of standing on a chair to direct and adjust the available light to best serve my wife. 
All in all quite impressive and worth the 5 * I gave it. 

But that was last year.  I don't know what happened, maybe they were sold, but this year was entirely different. No warm vibe, no welcoming feeling, totally empty, music and tv blaring, some staff person sitting at the bar texting, waiter says: this is the best lit table (it was pretty dark), I request the table were the guy adjusted the lights, he say I can't do that and it never happened, no one would do such a thing. And the woman at the bar chirps in that I don't know what I'm talking about.
Nasty nasty nasty - especially to a blind person. 
I wouldn't put anything in my mouth made in that hostile place. Stay away!
