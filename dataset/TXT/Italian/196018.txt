pM4mWLjeaZJlcdUxut2lMg My last name is Italian, so with years of grandma trying to fatten me up with lasagne and antipastos, I have been tried and tested on the pizza and Italian food in this city. 

Vittoria makes me happy. My favorite professor is Italian... like from Italy. My parents (Italian last name too) came to visit, my friend who just arrived home from Italy, my Spanish friend whose wife is Italian... etc. etc. 

All of them loved this place. 

I don't care if it's generic Italian food. It's exactly what you want when you want Italian food. CHEESE, TOMATOES, BALSAMIC, OLIVE OIL, OLIVES, FRESH PARMESAN, HOMEMADE PASTA, THIN CRUST, SALMON, ALFREDO, PESTO, GARLIC, FRESH BREAD... 

No, it's not weird fusion shit. It's not over-the-top local ingredients which some of the fancy Italian places have (NO OLIVES IN SCOTLAND...). 

It's about 20 actual off the boat/plane Italian people running the show, and you can see that, on their lunch and dinner breaks they EAT THE FOOD... What else do you need to know?
