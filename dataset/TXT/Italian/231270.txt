TFftsYkRIUtdo6ZhRwJ2lQ The ambiance is lovely, great for catching up with friends.

We ate:
- Caprese salad (5/5) Fresh, delicious. The tomatoes are tossed in a basil/olive oil marination.
- White pizza with real smoked salmon (5/5) Yes, Yelp was right. Best pizza Ive had in Toronto so far. The crust was crispy and light. SO fresh.
- A suggested bottle of wine (5/5) I dont remember the name, makes me sad.

I will be back to try more food so that I can give this resto a 5 star rating!
