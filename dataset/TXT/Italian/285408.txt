zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g Review for Restaurant Week!  Stick to the regular menu.

I applaud Dom DeMarco for participating but nothing really knocked our socks off.  We were in for some protein and carb-loading since we had a full night of drinking ahead of us and at least we weren't disappointed.  Would I recommend friends to stop by for restaurant week dinner?  No.  Would I recommend they stop by for pizza?  Hell yea, especially after 10 when I guess you can call it happy hour til closing.

First course, fried calamari.  Served with marinara.  Enough for two people.

Second course, another appetizer I guess, half Mediterranean salad.  Salad with chickepeas, tomato, olives, peppers, and cheese.  Also enough for two people.

Third course, I had the Brooklyn chicken.  Breaded chicken served with spaghetti.  Enough for two people.

Fourth course was the vanilla panna cotta, this was good.  Most panna cottas are hit and miss.

So while portion control was excellent and my friends enjoyed their meal, they considered it a discount since all but the panna cotta is served on the regular menu.  Again, for restaurant week I would not recommend.  But their pizzas are good.  Dom, the man, not the Jr, stopped by our table to say hi and try to chat up New York stories so that was cool and the highlight of our night.
