vL17CsjB1PsGgo3F-kppkw The BEST take-out pizza I've ever had. Large pizza with 3 toppings was 9.99 + tax. Was ready in 10 min. The pizza crust tasted similar to a baguette and loved it. Crunchy and soft at the same time. I did not need a dipping sauce for the crust edge. It is chewy and tasty all the way to the end. Toppings were generous. The owner was friendly and nice. Definitely will go back again.
