eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ I came here a long time ago and tried their Filet Oscar and love it.  This is the best filet I have ever tasted.  Go here and order it.  You won't be disappointed.  Also, as I'm typing this I'm pretty sure you need to order the Chocolate Soufflé Cake when you are here, because it is so good.  The Head Chef and the owner (same) is always in the kitchen looking over everything like Chef Ramsey.
