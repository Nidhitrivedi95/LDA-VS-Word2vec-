LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA First time at the one here in vegas. 

 The wait for 2 people was like an hour but it wasn't a big deal. 

 Italian food is always suppose to be very large portions and super filling which is where they kinda screwed up on this particular occasion. 

 I got the lobster ravioli full order (23.50) and ended up getting a plate with 8 raviolis on it. 8. I finished my dinner in about 5 minutes. (could have been 2 but I was eating slow) I asked the waitress about my order and she said that was a 1/2 order and about 10 minutes later they brought me some more ravioli. Well not much more. 5 more to be exact. 

 So my advice to you is to only order family style here with a group of people and avoid coming with any less than 4 folks. You just won't get the same bang for your buck. 

 Nice wine list and there were a few banquet rooms / wine cellar rooms that the dining seemed to be really nice in. 

 There's a much bigger restaurant right above this one that I am gonna have to try out because it really looked nice.
