zYb4kj2R54R2YPeNm829BA So after my last review I decided to order out a few times since then. A PERFECT SCORE STILL STANDS PEOPLE. My delivery time each and every order so far has been well within reasonable timing and the food has been warm and yummy every time! I even ordered a huge order my last time for a big get together and everything arrived just as ordered. I'll be a repeat customer no doubts about it! 
ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Yikes, previous reviews really ripped this place a new one, but I've gotta say... We have a great experience. Contrary to previous issues, our server/bartender was tentative, polite and friendly. The food came out in fair time and was WOW surprisingly delicious. Bar food with a bit of culinary spritz. I dig it. We will be back again for sure. And it's so close to the mall... Perfect lunch time meet up spot.
