F73T-N5lRNL2Gcpg0Q4KKw Fair meal at pretty high price. Pork and scallop entrees really were just not great. Pork dish quite cold, undercooked and lacked flavor. Four scallops for about $8.50/scallop was just over priced. Appetizers were good and pretty reasonably priced.  Pasta was ok but not nearly as good as many other restaurants in the Valley and very small portion- although warned about that by our waiter. On the plus side was the excellent service.
