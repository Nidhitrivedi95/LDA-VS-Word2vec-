The staff is friendly and helpful with guiding you through the menu. The shrimp cooked on the hot stone is decent but definitely has it downfalls. 1. The shrimp are small so cook quickly and can burn if you are not quick enough. 2. I can't tell of there are the frozen precooked shrimp 3. The sauces that come with them are a "different " despite its downfalls it is still good just not something I must order every time. The calamari is outstanding in my top 3 best calamari in Vegas, fresh, tender, and tasteful. As far as the entree my favorites must have are the las ha and shrimp and garlic pasta. The ambience is nice to with beautiful views in the outdoor seating area. They also ha e a bar area where you can smoke if you're in to that
