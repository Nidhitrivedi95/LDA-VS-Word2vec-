ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw 3.5 stars really.  Server was nice and attentive, didn't mention the fact that I had two kids with us, no menu or drinks offered to them.  BAG SALAD...ick.  Pizza pretty good, crust was soft and chewy.  Good sauce.  Prob won't go back.  House wine was not bad, but unless I'm in Italy, I
prefer to know what wine I'm drinking.
