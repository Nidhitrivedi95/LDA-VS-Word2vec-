UWupVhvb1qWZh8rNowJliQ Had a great time for our anniversary dinner; the staff were courteous, attentive, and offered great advice on the dishes. The food was terrific - we had the steak frites, tuna carpaccio, and a charcuterie spread along with drinks and everything was fresh and amazing. The setting was perfect for a date and the fact that the surrounding neighbourhood was surprisingly very quiet for a downtown location just made it that much better. Would definitely recommend it for a special occasion.
