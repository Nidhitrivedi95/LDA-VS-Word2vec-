Reason 1 -- The owner doesn't allow smoking

If you want to go to a sports bar in Las Vegas, you pretty much have to surrender to the fact that you will be breathing in "lowlife trash gas" a.k.a. cigarette smoke.  

Johnny Macs is the only sports bar in the Vegas area (that I know of) that does not allow smoking.  

For that reason, it is a sports bar where people bring their kids.  It is nice to go watch a game with the whole family, and not feel like you're giving your kids cancer or feel like you need a shower after you are done.  

Reason 2 -- the food

I am not from Buffalo, but my wife is.  So is the owner.  They bring in Beef on Weck, YUM.  The wings impress even the most hard core Buffalonians.  The ribs are outstanding too.  Everything I have eaten there was either off-the-charts delicious, or at least good enough (the antipasto salad, for example, is something that you really can't improve on -- it is what it is).  

Reason 3 -- The Service

Every time I have been there, the staff has been attentive without being annoying.  Every time, the owner comes by at least once to make sure that you're happy with your food and your service.  This has happened to me whether it was a slow Monday night or a super-busy Sunday afternoon when the Bills are playing.

Reason 4 -- GREAT place to watch a game.

First off, if you hate the Buffalo Bills, stay out of this place.  This is a shrine to the Bills, and you better be ready to tolerate it.  I am a die hard New England Patriots fan, and I've never felt unwelcome in the place -- even when wearing my Steve Grogan jersey.  Even watching the Bills play the Patriots, people were cool.  But, if I were a Bills fan, I'd be here every sunday.  Even a non-Bills fan will enjoy it though.  

All in all, this is a great sports bar, where you can bring your family or just come on your own.  I could not recommend it more highly.
