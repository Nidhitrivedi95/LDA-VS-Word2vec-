ZVtjS8Hvq2a6SxHxlehPGg We have been to the Phoenix area several times, and this is, by far, the best restaurant we have had the pleasure to dine.  Amazing food!  Some of the best Italian food we have had, and that includes the number of places we ate in Italy.  Growing up in San Francisco, and a regular in the North Beach area where great Italian food is the norm, this came as a complete surprise. My husband had the short ribs and cannelloni, and I had linguini with clams.  The short ribs were melt in your mouth, and the cannelloni was light and delicious.  My linguini had more clams than I have ever experienced with this dish elsewhere, and the linguini itself was exquisite.  The owner seated us and made a wine recommendation, which we took, and were glad that we did.  Live music!  A good bar!  Good wines!  What more could you want!
