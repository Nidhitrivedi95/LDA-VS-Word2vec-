qBXfNxSpo2_8cP_WHQRvOg I love Olive Garden! We have been here quite a few times and the food is always delicious and consistent with other olive gardens. Cute decor and tables and restrooms are usually very clean. Hostess is always friendly and if there is a wait they manage it well. Service is spotty, we've had some really good ones and we've had some pretty bad ones. Something that makes them unique is one of the servers is a professional opera singer! Very cool if you go on your birthday :-)
