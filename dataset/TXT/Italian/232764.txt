TLbx_MR2dyFztoyR5d9H2A Growing up on Salerno's Pizza this is one of my  regular stops. The Pizza is fantastic and it is also good as leftovers the next day. The dining room is no frills, so if you want a fancy dining experience, this won't be the place for you. I've tried practically everything on the menu over the years and I can't ever recall anything bad. They also have a really good lunch special.
Five Stars!
