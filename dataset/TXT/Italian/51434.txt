We only ordered from there because of their aggressive coupon doorhanging campaign, and being recent transplants from Chicago, knew no better.  We sorely regretted the decision.   Anything would have been better than the pizza we received.  It's hard to screw up pizza, so the one star is awarded for accomplishing just that.   The pizza was laden with unevenly melted blobs of the worst mozzarella I've ever tasted, the sauce was bland, the crust lackluster, the toppings depressing.  No one should have to suffer this pizza.  I would advise them to shut down and stop desecrating the pizza world with this slop.
