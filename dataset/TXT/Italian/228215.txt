SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog My second time here, and again I am so impressed!
Suggestion: Make a reservation! We only waited 10 minutes for our table. But we heard others who just showed up, being told 45+ minutes.
My girlfriend and I split the "Tour of RigaTony's" and it was delicious!!!!
However, there is a $3 charge for splitting a plate. Meh...
Atmosphere is nice, but service is almost a lil too quick.
Still, I'd take this place any day over Olive Garden!
