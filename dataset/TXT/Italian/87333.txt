duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ Caught a bite, or rather, a full meal pre-flight and it was a fabulous way to round out our week of Vegas folly.

Love the secluded Four Seasons location, right around the corner of Mandalay registration, take the marble steps down & you're transported to understated elegance.

Two choices for dining: inside or alfresco, looking out into the private pool area.

Good:
*Iced tea w/iced tea cubes
*Lobster Salad, no lettuce, but so many ingredients, delicious & fresh
*Greens Salad, lovely light dressing & loved the mixed chartucerie
*Beef tartare, w/whole grain mustard, balsamico & micro greens
*Salmon w/lentils & a wine reduction, rustic, seared perfectly

Alright:
*Amuse, prosciutto & melon shooter, an interesting take on the traditional appetizer, the melon was in liquid form, too sweet for my palate.
*Halibut w/sundried tomatoes & olives, fish was nice, but bland, tomatoes and olives were not a nice marraige w/the halibut.

I thought it was funny that their take home utensils are SILVER plastic.

Solid food, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here, it's not an experience.
