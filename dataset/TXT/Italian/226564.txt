Add hot coppa (meat) to it- so good. And you must put the hot chili oil on your pizza! End your meal with their awesome gelato- banana latte dolce, espresso, and lemon crunch were our favorites. They tasted amazing and were so creamy. 

I cannot describe how good Vero is! It was a little noisy but it didn't bother us.
