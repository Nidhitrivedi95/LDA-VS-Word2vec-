MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg Very small place, but excellent food. Took my partner for his birthday dinner. But of us had veal dishes, little on the expensive side for the amount of veal but not overly so. Service was a little weird. Four tables including ours got seated at about the same time. Same server for all of us. We got listen to the server talk about the specials at every table but ours. Seemed very friendly at the other tables but sort of distant to us. It wouldnt have been noticeable if the tables werent so close together and we could hear how he was at other tables. Not sure what the deal was. Granted we werent dressed up as much as the other patrons, I didnt get the idea that it was a dressy restuarant, so we were both wearing nice jeans and I had a button down shirt on, so I am not sure if he just figured we werent worth sucking up to compared to the other guests or what.  Thats the main reason for 4 stars. Food very good, service weird, tight fit in a tiny place.
