H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g I have watched Mario on TV and have never been that impressed but my opinion just changed after a meal here. Located in the Venetian, open air next to the ongoings in the main "square" food was a great surprise. We ordered the ricotta and pancetta fritters, one was cheesy other was salty, mix those and it was delicious! Paired them with 2 glasses of Italian wines (recc by the staff) and the sausage-pepper pizza. Yum the crust was just right with burnt edges, fresh ingredients esp the meats, he has a rotating meat stand in the center of the restaurant. Loved it! Decor is lovely reminding one of a outdoor place in Italy. Definitely worth a stop here!
