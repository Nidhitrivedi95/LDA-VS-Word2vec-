cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA Took the family to the latest pizza establishment to come to town.  I have to rate Giordano's three stars largely due to the quality of the pizza.  Everything else about the experience was only 1 - 2 stars.  

We stopped by on a Wednesday afternoon at 1:30pm to avoid the rush and largely that was a good decision.  As mentioned in other comments the service and wait has room for improvement.  

In order to have the ultimate experience we ordered the Meat and More Meat stuffed pizza.  The menu said expect a 35 - 45 minute wait so no surprises.  After 60 minutes our pizza arrived and it was delicious.   I enjoyed a cold slice the next day and it didn't disappoint.   

Our server was slow to arrive, kept falling behind on refreshing our drinks and was slow to bring our bill.  The table next to us wasn't doing much better - who knows maybe they are still there?  1:45 from beginning to end.  I expect 2 hours if you arrive at around noon.  I feel sorry for folks who have to wait in line before being seated.  

Go for the pizza but don't expect much else.  

I'm not from Chicago and don't have friends from Chicago so more than likely won't be going back anytime soon but I might be tempted to try one of their sandwiches.
