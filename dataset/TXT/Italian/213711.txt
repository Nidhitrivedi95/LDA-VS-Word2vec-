r7IvPMyza853adkAvi1RNQ I know this place is a neighborhood comfy-food kind of place, as evidenced by the seniors who frequent this place.  But for a Saturday evening, not a lot of diners.  The employees were really nice, which is why I'm giving 3 stars, but if you're a bonafide "foodie", you know there's much better Italian food to be had elsewhere.
