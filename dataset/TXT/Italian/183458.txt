oejQ4bWsJaKszf98xjNrrg The best pizza ever. We were starved so to avoid the long line up for a table we opt to sit at the bar. We ordered two beers and two individual pizzas with our own  toppings. The pizzas arrived we were so hungry I was down to my last two slices when i realized I hadn't taken a picture to share on YELP. Hence my 2 slice picture if my delicious pizza. The only negative i had was when ordering my pizza our server miscommunicated all toppings were part of the price of the pizza on the menu. I was upset when my bill arrived and i was charged $1.75 per topping. My individual pizza ended up being more expensive than i had wanted to spend. I will go back snd be more mindful on the toppings I order. 
They also have a full  Italian menu. 
They have takeout and delivery.   Lots of parking. Staff were very nice.
