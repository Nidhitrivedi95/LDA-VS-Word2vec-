VjaHHmV-rSkFaOAnU3faxg Wonderful food!  Creative menu.  Love the use of fresh and local ingredients!  We have never ordered anything here we do not like.  Very excited for them to move into a bigger location downtown.  Being Italian, I've longed to have a nice Italian restaurant in Sun Prairie!  Can't wait to see what else they ad to the menu!
