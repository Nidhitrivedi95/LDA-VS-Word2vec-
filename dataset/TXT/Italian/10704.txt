The meal started with their freshly baked bread and spreads which were divine. We started with the beef tartare and the polenta. Tartare, very fresh. The polenta, honestly, some of the best I've had. So cheesy!! I would come back for this dish alone! For my entree, I got the pasta with lobster. The dish, when brought out I thought was on the small side, but once I took a bite, I understood why. Extremely rich. A little too rich for my tastebuds. I actually couldn't finish it, which doesn't happen often. Delicious, but just too rich. Dessert, we ordered the bombolini that were filled with either vanilla or chocolate filling. Highly recommend these. Also ordered the chocolate cake, good, but I'm not the biggest chocolate cake fan. My brother-in-law who loves chocolate loved the cake. 

Good service and food with gorgeous views.
