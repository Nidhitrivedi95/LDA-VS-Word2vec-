DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw As a local we had heard great things about this well know Italian restaurant. We made reservations to arrive at 6 PM on a Wednesday night to avoid weekend crowd. Arrived 5:55 no parking spots tried to valet waited 15 minutes still no valet looked around found a parking spot my the CVS drug store. Fought are way through the homeless people to get to the restaurant and we were told due to our being late our reserved table with the waiter who recommended this place was gone. When I explained we were late because your valet service was non existent it didn't matter and the gentlemen never did investigate what was going on with his valet as it was chaos when we left an hours later.

The food was incredibly disappointing my fiancé had Lasagna which was small portion and flavorless honestly a frozen grocery store bought lasagna has more flavor. I had veal scaloppine which was again a small portion and again had no flavor from the sauce. The veggie that came with it was awful. Service was outstanding as was the atmosphere. 

This place is an enigma as to why it has such a large following with average store bought Italian food level quality??? As hilarious as it sounds Olive Garden has better food? We were hoping for a great meal from a well known local family owned restaurant and instead we got a meal you might find in an average casino or amusement park. Wouldn't try it again as there weren't any mistakes made with the food that was how it comes on a daily basis.
