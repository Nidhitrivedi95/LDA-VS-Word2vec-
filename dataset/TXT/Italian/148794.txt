kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg My brother and SIL got my husband and I a gift certificate and when we finally got a chance to use it we were ecstatic. This restaurant is a great place to sit and talk while eating delicious food. 

It was a little too hot to sit outside so I am anxious to go when it is cooler.great location for people watching.

My husband loved his chicken parm and they had one of his favorite beers on the menu. I enjoyed the market special, cod. We will definitely be coming back for the great ambience, food, and service.
