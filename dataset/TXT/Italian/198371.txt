pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Been dying to come here for quite some time and finally got a chance during a business trip. So, I've tried many of the so called "best pizza in US" places such as this. Is it the best pizza I've ever tried, no, those honors go to either Motorino in NYC or A16 in San Francisco. Is is an awesome pizza nonetheless, absolutely. Very cool space and awesome service. Would totally go back next time I'm in town.
