_JwfmRh0T8mEEx-A4FqMOw First time here. The tomato onion salad is fantastic! Their homemade balsamic dressing is amazing. 

Our busboy, Ian, was super friendly and on his game. He deserves a 5 star rating! Our server, Cherrie, was pleasant and nice as well. 

I gave 4 stars based on our seating arrangement and lack of cocktail menu, just a pet peeve of mine. I prefer to not have to ask the server exactly what type of liquors, etc. Just seems modern day to provide some specialty handcrafted libations. 
They seated us in a booth that the top of our knees were jammed in. Yes, we are tall, but the booths are definitely short. This place is certainly ready for a renovation.
