TLbx_MR2dyFztoyR5d9H2A Since we are from Chicago and used to go to this pizza place in Berwyn, IL we could not wait to get there for the pizza.  We went there and ordered an XL pizza and when we got it, the dough was soggy and it was overbearing with cheese.  We were both way too tired to complain but will never go back.  Service was great, but pizza a huge disappointment.
