The entertainment created an ambience that just made you want to dine here regardless of everything else.  But on our last visit when we were told they were out of the first two things we ordered, early on a Frid. evening, and they had discontinued another dish we requested, we were concerned.  That was followed by really bad service and an awful meal that we picked at and left.  And I feel bad for this place because they will need to really step it up to make up for becoming a "Goodwill" strip center and I don't think they can cut it.
