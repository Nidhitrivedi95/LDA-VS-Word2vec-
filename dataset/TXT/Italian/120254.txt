h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ Mezzo Bistro and Wine is one place you should try before you leave the land of the same old favorite place to go.  This place was hoping, and Joe our waiter never lost a beat.  He was very friendly, new the menu well, and evening though it was super busy, he never once forgot about us.  

My husband, and I tried the risotto balls, they were everything you could want in an app.  For our main I had the prositto wrapped halibut, and my husband had the fire grilled pizza, with goat cheese, and sausage, both were incredible.  They have a T.V. by the bar, and one on the other size of the room, so that everyone can see what is going on in T.V. land.  Great place, and will be back for more.
