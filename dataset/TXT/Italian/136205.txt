IXUwuNjy707wJNW2U4sRVg Alessia's Ristorante Italiano has been open since 2004. We used to go a few times a month and then stopped when somehow my husband and I thought they closed. Thanks to a fellow Yelper when I was looking for a great restaurant near our home I found this little gem again.

We were greeted by a friendly gentleman that we later learned was one of the owners - the other being his wife who is the chef. They have an interesting back story if you care to check out their website but I'll mention that they do know Italian food!

We opted to forgo the salads and were glad we did because the main dishes were hearty. There were four of us in our party and two had the Gorgonzola Linguini both agreeing it was delicious. Our friend had the Pesto Pasta and he raved about the flavor so good there too. I had the Cappelini Bolognese and was delighted with the flavors. Slow cooked sauce to perfection ~ just like it's supposed to be done. It's the only sauce made ahead due to the cooking time. Everything else is made fresh to order. My only complaint (and I really won't call it that) was that I like my pasta a little more el dente and I didn't ask. However I feel that an Italian restaurant should cook it that way so I don't always think to mention it.

The table shared a tiramisu and it was DELICIOUS!! I was sorry my friends ate as much as they did! I'm somewhat of a tiramisu snob so trust me if I say it's good - it is.

Really reasonable prices and outstanding service too. Best kept secret in Mesa. Love this little family restaurant and I will be returning to become a regular again.
