Tgc2dTcE1xOey2OUt_PvXA Oregano's in Goodyear would have received a 5 star rating had an incident not happened. While attending a birthday party for our granddaughter,we mentioned to the server that it was H.......'s..birthday. They brought out a birthday desert. She shared her treat with her sister and her sister with a shocked look on her face pulled out a STICK PIN from her inside cheek. We were shocked too. Her grandmother went to the manager and showed him what was in the ice creme portion." We're sorry", is all the manager would say. He never came back to check on her or apologize . Nobody at the restaurant was concerned if she needed treatment, etc.... We found out later that they prepared the desert below a bulletin board with stick pins in it. My daughter who has worked at the Phoenician and other upscale restaurants was really bothered that nobody came back to check on her. Accidents happen, but poor managerial skills are not and should not be accepted as the norm in Oregano's.
