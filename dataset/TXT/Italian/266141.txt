x0J4FqlcmpZAxwfyTszKAg I've probably passed by this place a thousand times without ever stopping in before today. As others have pointed out, it's small and intimate, but I liked the charming atmosphere.

I ordered the Seasoned Grilled Chicken on Cibatta and a Desert Blossom Iced Tea (lavender, hibiscus, apricot and rosehips). The sandwich was well balanced and moist. It was served with iceberg, roma tomatoes and a side of their house fries, "Kilo Fries." The fries were seasoned with a cheese blend, which seemed a little dry to me. However, a quick swirl in olive oil improved them quite a bit. The tea was delicate and refreshing - a nice complement to my lunch selection.

The service is what stood out for me here. My server was friendly and attentive throughout the meal, even though I was dining solo. I certainly felt that my business was valued here. She even offered me a to-go cup for my tea, which was a nice touch.

I will definitely be back to explore more of their menu. Prices are reasonable too, which doesn't hurt!
