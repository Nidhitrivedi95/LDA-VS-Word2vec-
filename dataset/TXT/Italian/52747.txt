9XLH_grfIYKR7d5ZT9ZX_A First visit to Melanie's Bistro. I was very impressed with the food and friendly staff. I had the traditional breakfast, added a third egg, and chose bacon. It was done perfectly.  Over easy eggs were perfect, and their bacon was thin and crispy without being burnt or crusty. The potatoes reminded me of the way my grandmother used to make them, so that was a fun memory recall for me. And the salad had slivers of apple which added an extra freshness to an already tasty side. Coffee was good too. The only complaint I have was that their service on the Sunday Brunch time was a bit slow. Overall very happy with this experience. I'll definitely be returning.
