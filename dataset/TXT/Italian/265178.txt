wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw Tried this wine bar for the first time last night...here's the scoop:

Liked
- great design...very hip
- good selection of wines
- excellent, friendly service

Not so much
- food was good but not as interesting as other wine bars we frequent
- too many kids...I know it's Gilbert and clientele is beyond the bar's control, but I don't want to hang out with kids and babies during my happy hour at a bar...can't imagine why people would think its ok to take kids to a bar.
