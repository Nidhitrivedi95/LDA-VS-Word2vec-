lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ Got my bill and was charged $14.00 for a Margarita...strike one.
No bartender,so had to wait for the server had to make the drink....strike 2.
Sorry,only one chef in today...Insane wait in an empty restaurant....strike 3
My eggplant supposed to serve 3,only 2 pieces for $25.00....your out.

Not enough staff to even run the place.

This place is a joke,edible food but the prices and the service is total garbage.2 small dishes and one cocktail was $70+...no appetizer or anything else with it.
