I9I3wIHFDz1rxVqbltk7NQ Today, I ordered a sheet pizza from North Coast, which is right around the corner from my house.  It was short notice, but they were still able to deliver a full sheet pizza with 32 slices in an hour!  I ordered half cheese and half veggie.  The pizzas were delivered at the time I requested and were nice and hot.  A sheet pizza from North Coast is actually four rectangular pizzas served in two boxes.  You could potentially get four different toppings on four different pizzas, but still call it a sheet pizza.  Options are good to have.  The sheet pizza was $33.50, which I thought was fair.  We had a few people at the house, so the pizza all but disappeared.

The veggies were nice and large, fresh, and tasted great.  The cheese pizza was yummy too.  We would order again.
