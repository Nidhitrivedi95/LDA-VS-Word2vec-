pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Went in for lunch this past Monday y
to celebrate a friends birthday. The food was pretty bad. The pasta in linguini with clams was way under cooked and I just about broke a tooth with a clam shell. My friend sent back her veal, it was so sugary sweet. The replaced her dish with a tasteless eggplant. My friends husband asked her to bring him octopus do she orders it to go. When she got home all she saw in her to go box with 4 little pieces of octopus with an old looking wilted salad. She paid $20.00 for that to go dish. I called the restaurant to speak to the manger he was unavailable so I left a message. He hasn't returned my call. We were very disappointed.
