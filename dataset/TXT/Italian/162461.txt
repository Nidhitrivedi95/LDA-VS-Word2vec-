lq71ZTkANfb40sR0DAs6Rw Well, I was fine with this Pizza Hut location until I got delivery tonight. F***ing incompetent delivery driver destroyed my pizza in transit! What I got was a big ol' blob that sort of resembled a pizza. Seriously, how the f***ing stupid is management at not only this Pizza Hut, but Pizza Hut in general, that they hire inept drivers who aren't even functionally retarded to not be able to get get one damn pizza delivered without destroying the f***ing thing! If you're going to order from this location, ORDER FOR TAKEOUT ONLY! Seems they can't even hire delivery drivers who have an ounce of common sense! Though, takeout is hit or miss too since each time I've done that with this location, I've encountered stupid, inept staff members who can't do simple things like correctly use the POS system to take my payment. Seems the management of this location will hire any retarded dumbass off the street and give them a job. Actually, here's my advice, AVOID THIS LOCATION ALL TOGETHER AND GO TO MARCO'S PIZZA NEXT DOOR!
