CUGswyxGdkcd4IE1oHc80A I had heard amazing things about this place, and happened to be in the area, so I stopped in for lunch.
I had a pizza and grilled calamari.  The calamari tasted very fishy. I probably should have sent it back, but I didn't want to make a fuss.
Silly me, I ended up with an upset stomach a few hours later. :(
I won't be returning.....
