IvkBPG8qtSx56P0Z9xmijg I'm only commenting on the food since I don't know much about wine. I came for a friend's birthday.

When I sat down to read the menu, I was pleasantly surprised by the affordable prices, but in order to keep their prices decent, they skimped on portion size. The pasta dishes are Italian-sized portions (read: small). They were enough for my dinner (I'm a small Asian girl), but I had to supplement with bread and ice cream cake. So in the end, the small portion size allowed me to save room for cake. My male friends unfortunately were still hungry at the end of the meal.

I had the veal ravioli, which was recommended by our waiter. The dish was good for the most part, but the pancetta was waaaay too salty. I had to dampen the excess salt with more bread. 

I tried some lobster gnocchi from a friend's dish, and that was much better. Still a little on the salty side, but edible and tasty.

Overall, be prepared for the small portions or don't come for dinner.
