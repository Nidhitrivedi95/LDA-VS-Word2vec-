q6BzQz426uH6rB7bmZvexQ This was my first visit to la capella and I have to say I will not be back.  After being seated and having our order taken and drinks brought to the table right away, we waited.  When our salads and soup came to the table the salad was days old.  The lettuce was brown and wilted.  The soup (wedding) was tasteless - no flavor at all.
Then we waited and waited and waited.  The waitress never came to the table to tell us what the delay was or refill our drinks or bring my 3 year old, who had already waited too long for her pizza, a cracker or anything to hold her over because of the delay.  Almost an hour later our food was brought out.  I got the bourbon glazed salmon.  When ordering I asked what the vegetable of the day was and was told sugar snap peas (which I happen to love), when my dinner came to the table I had been given broccoli.  The salmon was just ok and barely warm.  I honestly could have made it better at home.  My husband ordered linguini with red clam sauce.  The linguini was over cooked and barely warm.  My daughter's pizza was the only thing that came out hot but it was swimming in grease.  I literally had to pat it off with a napkin to soak up the pools of grease that were on the top.  Again, the waitress never came back to ask if we needed anything, wanted drink refills etc.  The only time we saw her again was to bring the bill to the table.  Needless to say we were very disappointed and agreed that we will not return.
