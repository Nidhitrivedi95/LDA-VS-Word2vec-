7o4SWZDKYHYfv6X0U21ErQ Six of us had lunch at this restaurant and all of us really enjoyed the food.  I was the only one to have an alcoholic beverage, a peach bellini. I enjoyed it but would have prefer it without the crushed ice.  I had a soup and salad combo.  The Italian wedding soup was well prepared as was the insalata della casa.  The mac and cheese ordered by my grand daughter was really good as was the roasted vegetable pasta ordered by the other grand daughter.   I didn't sample the other dishes ordered but everyone was happy with the meal. The service as quite good.

We would all recommend this restaurant.
