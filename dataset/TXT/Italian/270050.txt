XlvpNPAZnzm-DJmKYmK2nQ I actually felt compelled to create a yelp account after my experience here. I had no expectations one way or the other before I entered the restaurant. 

We ordered our food when we first walked in -as this place is a semi-serve yourself kind of place. Personally not a fan of this set up. When go out for a meal I would prefer full service. 

The food came in a respectable time frame. However, for a place that prides itself on making pizza, it fell quite flat. The pizza sauce was just plain marinara, my pizza had almost no toppings, the crust was puffy and bland. This was the McDonalds of pizza. I could have gone to the metro next door and quick fired up a better frozen pizza. 

If you have tastebuds and consider yourself a foodie, skip this place. If you want a place to bring your kids, it's moderately priced and seems quite family friendly. Yet another lack lustre restaurant in Leaside.
