uR31VDHTAY37HtCDYr1q9g Freshslice pizza definitely isn't the freshest of pizzas nor do they even have a proper oven, but I love the different varieties of pizza they do have. The pesto and garlic options are delicious and I really like the tomato sauce they use. The meat lover and garlic lover pizzas are my favorite. The balance of toppings to sauce to cheese to crust is pretty good so you really get all the flavors packed in one bite. 

They have 1$ slices on tuesday (pretty big slices too!) and they give out FREE slices of pizza and coupons on random days. I've probably had at least a pizza's worth of free pizza. hehe

Not the best pizza in Toronto but not the worst. Good for cravings or just a simple meal. :D
