pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Certainly didn't live up to all the hype.  The crust had no flavor just like eating flour and water, the center was mushy with burnt crust.  Guess that's why they couldn't put a few more toppings and cheese on it the crust would not support it.  Had just a dab of sauce on it which they are known for and couldn't taste it.  Yes it was fresh but for the price certainly not worth it, probably had 50 Cents worth of topping on a $18.00 pizza.    Wonder if James Beard got the same pizza's we were served.  I agree with another viewer that they need more help, if your going to wait a hour and a half at their "outdoor bar" the least you could have better service and not just left there waiting. He's one smart cookie making a lot of money on a really cheap pizza with a few fresh ingredients on it.  People wake up you can buy a really nice meal for $18.00!
