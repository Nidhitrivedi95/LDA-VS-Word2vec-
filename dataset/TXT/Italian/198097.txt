Also thought is was small for the money. Grimaldi's in scottsdale is much better in my opinion and cheaper too. We were not sure of the parking so we parked in the parking garage down the street.  parking garage cost 15 dollars to park. They do have a very small lot to park in and i think it was a few dollars to park. Also very small inside so if you are going to go get there early.. We went around 2 and got a seat but not many seats were open.
