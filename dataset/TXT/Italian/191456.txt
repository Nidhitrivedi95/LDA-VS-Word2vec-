PF8Ou0oDho7-6PrFv5lacQ I came here out of the blue and it was pretty good.  The panini is pretty big but it gets pricey. Service can be quick.  overall I'd say this is a good place for a quick bite.  

They also have some pre cooked frozen Italian pasta which is excellent for a house party,  but I don't think they advertise it well.
