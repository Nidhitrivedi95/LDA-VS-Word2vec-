DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q A quickie version of one of my favorite restaurants. Smoked salmon salad is still the way to go if you have the discipline of avoiding their carb-loaded goodies: pizza, pastries, gelato, etc. etc.  I hung around for some beers before a delayed flight. I'd avoid the red wine though; it was corky and pretty terrible. Small disappointment in an otherwise great airport option.
