5SEwzlWlrxSVyZx3IgXwLg I lik Marcella's, I really do.  Marcella's reminds me of my shameful visits to Starbucks.  I'm not opposed to either, don't get me wrong, but chains that get it right are a very scary thing to me.  It's easy to hate a chain when their food sucks and their prices aren't that great, but that is not the case with Marcella's.  From their bruscetta, pizza, cheese plate to their reasonable drink prices, Marcellas is getting it right.  Although the cheese plate didn't come with a knife.  I had to "cut the cheese" with a butter knife.  After asking for a sharper tool, I was given a serrated steak knife...  Lame.
One thing that must be experienced is their bathroom soap, it may be the best soap in the world.  Reminds me of the pumice soap at my buddies Dad's auto-shop as a kid.  Uberclean!
