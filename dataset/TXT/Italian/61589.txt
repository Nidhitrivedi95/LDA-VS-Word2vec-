AYLxEeVq8NKG2UhcBiggrA I would say 3.5 stars.
I was there with a larger group for lunch.  The service was nice and we each had a pizza, which were very tasty! 

My only criticism is the desserts.  My friend and I ordered the apple and pear crumble and it was really disappointing.  It was essentially warm pieces of apple and pear tossed in cinnamon with cream on top in a small ramakin with no sign of a crumble - not worth $5 IMO.
Not the way we wanted to finish of lunch.
