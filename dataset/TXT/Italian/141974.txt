JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A One of my go-to 24 hour diners. 7 West is a great spot for coffee, comforting bites, and late-night/early morning conversations.

I've been here multiple times for brunch and was here on my birthday. The food is decent with fair portions. They always play throwback pop songs. I just love the casual intimate vibe.
