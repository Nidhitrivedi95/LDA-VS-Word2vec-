L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw This was a very disappointing experience. I actually went here on a date with a girl and it didn't go so hot, so part of my resentment is due to that. But I digress. I had the Margherita pizza paired with...idk, some red wine. The pizza was fine but nothing too special. For dessert we had a dark chocolate ice cream I think? (you can really tell the impact this place had on me haha) Ambience was fine but nothing too special. The service was decent I guess. And overall it was too expensive. Bah. You know what? Jamie Oliver is a hack. He thinks he's like this cool, hip version of Gordon Ramsay but he's...bollocks. Bam! Haha. Take that Jamie. Wait...hold on, that might be someone else's phrase.
