FqJ1SWEBhgVl66FrcsovOQ I am very disappointed in this place. I visited this location on June 20th 2017 around 4:30pm. The staff was friendly but the food was below average compared to all the chains outside of the city and state. The pizzas were low in selection, there was only really 3 options; cheese, pepperoni, and vegetarian. The quality of the pizzas were dry, like over heat lamp dry. Pasta and salads were good, but the desserts were also slim as well. The only dessert out on the buffet was the cinnamon rolls and they were made with a little to much sodium. This is the first Cisis I have seen were they don't bus the tables either.
