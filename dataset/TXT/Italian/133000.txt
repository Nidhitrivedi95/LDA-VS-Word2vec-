iL3Jpm1h1lkQMHXZe6T1CQ I voted 5 stars not just because I proposed to my sweet wife here :) but the food and ambience is terrific. I suggest the grilled calamari to share between two plus a main. I tend to get the seafood pasta or the daily special. Weekends make certain to reserve. Sundays is private functions.
