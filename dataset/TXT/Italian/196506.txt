pOEL97ld-FJMKO8Ki8JmYg Had a reservation for Mother's Day brunch. It was before the rush and not busy when we arrived. One of the people Iin our party uses a walker and they tried to seat us at a booth where she could not sit. They made us wait 15 minutes for another table that could accommodate her, despite more than half of the restaurant being empty. The general manager also refused to accommodate a simple modification to the grilled cheese to make it child friendly (just omitting the ingredients other than the bread and cheese) because apparently everything is preprepared. When the food arrived the toast was burned. Very unimpressed, particularly by the lack of accommodation by the general manager.
