9CYZaEbU3KjdLFMkKbUXVw I live close to this place and honestly this is my favourite bar since the drinks are so good. They taste great but are secretly very strong. It has a small patio out front if you want to drink outside. There is plenty of seating inside. It's also generally not super busy thus a good place to hang out with friends and talk without having to yell over loud music. I would recommend the Friday zombie.
