yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Nice and dark, old school, with the smell of garlic bread, 
and a mishmash kitschy decor of a Chotchkie's apron with flair, 
the place is oddly perfect for a romantic date night, 
a family dinner that pleases everyone, 
or a raucous party (the endless wine helps). 

The portions are huge and yummy.  
My lasagna was so cheesy it was like queso fundino with sauce.  
My wife's cannelloni was a bucket of fresh ricotta wrapped in a pasta blanket. 
 My sister's sausage (wasn't that a CBS show?) was yum.  
We ate for a long time and it looked like we never started.  
Make sure your room has a fridge.  
And we ended up with uneaten garlic bread.  
Who doesn't finish off a basket of garlic bread?  
I mean, besides the Lost Boys. 

Oh, and personally I'm glad the endless wine isn't super awesome wine. 
I don't like wine, but this stuff was slightly watery and slightly flat 
so I was able to throw it down.

Hey, here comes Gordy, the accordion player!  
He's like a mariachi band only it's one guy, I understand the words, 
and I don't shrink in my seat when he comes by.  
Keep a fiver in your pocket to give him - 
the guy will need a second hip soon.

The service is great, too.  I didn't like much my minestrone soup. 
 It had, like, every vegetable in it.  
I could point out so many it was like a Richard Scarry book.  
So I asked if I could get the salad (mmm with a slice of salami) instead.  
"No problem!"   
Can we get more garlic bread?  
"Sure, please make room for a shoebox size basket of garlic bread".  
Hey, since this wine is endless, can I leave my car here?  
"Please do.  Would you like us to fill it with garlic bread?"

Oooh, and that hot chocolatey cappuccino at the end w/ whipped cream!
Nothing's better on a stomach full of 2 pounds of cheese 
and a gallon of wine than some hot liquid chocolate coffee.
Keep your leftovers so you have something to eat while you're in the bathroom :)
