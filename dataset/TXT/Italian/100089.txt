F9IJ3EddoyW89O0DFikPTQ Pittsburgh Bound!  Part X

(For Part IX, go to: http://www.yelp.com/biz/stamoolis-brothers-company-pittsburgh?hrid=8hA8rRHss2PRlroWujzT_Q)

The Sunseri name is famous in Pittsburgh, and although their small alcove of Italian meats and bread is one of the smaller storefronts in the Strip, their pepperoni bread is melt in your mouth, filled with great mozzarella cheese.  I grabbed a loaf and we picked at it while we walked around.  My mom and I inhaled half of it without blinking an eye.

If you are going to get a loaf of Sunseri's pepperoni bread, I would suggest not doing it on an empty stomach.
