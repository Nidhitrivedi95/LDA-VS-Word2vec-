3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg Fantastic, swanky, fun restaurant. Go for a nice meal or happy hour (I was surprised to see how great their happy hour specials are). My parents dine here regularly and we were lucky enough to join them last night. We had a little bit of everything. Every dish was delicious and our server, Liz, made the dining experience extra special. We had a small hiccup on the preparation of a steak, but the manager, Brian, went above and beyond to make it right. Fantastic customer service all around. If you have been contemplating going...GO! You won't regret it.
