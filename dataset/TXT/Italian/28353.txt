527O5H26A0lFtCHO6zEh8w I live in the area walked by this place a number of times bit of a hole in the wall no Lansdowne not on the main St Clair strip of restaurants.  It is smaller but quaint restaurant.  Saw they usually took part in Winterlious and Summerlious which was enticing .  Finally made reservations and had dinner there on Saturday night.  

My husband and I were stunned by how amazing the food was.  Started with the calamari which was not your usual breaded and deep fried but grilled.  Probably scary for some people but beyond delicious.  I have the crab ravioli, it came out fast and delicious.  Then both had tiramisus for dessert.  The meal was fast, fresh and hot.  Service was great the watress was friendly and quick.  Just to note though we were there early 6pm dinner resturant not full just two other table at the time so I can't comment on service when they are busy.  The chef (not the gentleman in photos below)  came out to see how our meals were he was very personable and that was a nice touch.  This meal was on par with those we had in Italy on our honeymoon.    

We will be coming back again and again after this experience.  They have reasonable prices in general and as I mentioned take part in Winterlious and Summerlious.  They also have wine available by glass, bottle and half liter.  The 1/2 litter is something that few restaurants seem to have and for I and my husband a bottle is too much and 1 glass each insufficient.
