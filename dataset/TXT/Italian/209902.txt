Quayv4ZFz7z9xKQHnXbQQg What a great place! My wife and I decided to stop in for a late dinner and were pleasantly surprised. We were greeted by what appeared to be the owner and he was very nice and hospitable. We pulled up right at the oyster bar, what a cool thing, the seats were Vespa scooters! The oyster selection was next to amazing and the mignonette was delicious. My wife and I split the salmon and it was cooked to perfection and deliciously seasoned. We will be back for sure. I can't complain about anything! Strong 5 stars
