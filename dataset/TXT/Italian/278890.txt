YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ My daughter and I had dinner there yesterday  always went to the one in spring valley and it was good.  My dinner was okay but you could tell it had set on counter for awhile.  My daughter had the Mac n cheese truffle one.  It was so awful.  Tasted like they used smoked cheese as it had that after taste   We had ordered before and it was good  not sure what happened. Bothered me that employees were sitting in customer area eating food from other restaurants .  Not sure if I will go back.
