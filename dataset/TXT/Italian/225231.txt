So132GP_uy3XbGs0KNyzyw My dance group and I traveled to Las Vegas in December. In total there was about 30 of us. We were looking for a place to have one last team dinner before returning home. I called asking if we they would have room for us in about 30 minutes. They said they would try their best but can't guarantee all the tables will open up. We arrived in 20 minutes and they were all ready for us! Our dinner here was one we will never forget! The staff was so friendly, the waiters and waitresses were extremely accommodating to our large group, the food was amazing. THE SINGERS! They sang some Chicago songs specifically for us as we are from Chicago and even let one of us get up there and sing a song too! Definitely some of the best service we have received. Would recommend to anyone!
