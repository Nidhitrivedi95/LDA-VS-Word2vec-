nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg So yes...it was "A-OK."  It wasn't great...I don't think it came even close to the hype.  It wasn't bad...it just wasn't great.

The table shared a couple of Caprese Salad's...there was one single leaf of basil in the center of the plate.  The tomato's were dark pink (if we can get bright red tomato's in Minneapolis in the winter, why can't they get ripe tomato's in Chandler?).  Again...it was ok, but I expected more.

I had a "primevera" salad that was comprised of mixed greens, apples, orange, and grapefruit with a creamy raspberry dressing, but it was saturated in blue cheese crumbles that completely overtook the salad.  

My entree was a broiled halibut and came with a generous portion of mixed vegetables that were overcooked.  The halibut was simple and tasty, but it was also tiny - probably the smallest portion of halibut I've ever been served.

I had a nice glass of Pinot Noir; the only one they served by the glass on the menu.

So, all in all...it was ok.  I wouldn't even think of driving out of my way to go there again though.
