pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Pizzeria Bianco is overrated. The quality of Bianco's pizza did not justify our investment of time. If I wait 3 hours for food, it should be amazing. Bianco's pizza wasn't. Bianco makes a competent, if not extraordinary, Neapolitan pizza. 

Bianco's pizza was fine but hardly the best pizza in the US. I have eaten pizza all over the US and throughout Italy, so I have a basis for comparison. Honestly, I don't even see how Bianco gets into the conversation. As an example, it was no better than the pizza at Ciao Napoli in Chicago or Tutta Bella in Seattle (and I didn't wait anywhere close to 3 hours at either of those places).

I would only return if there was no line (i.e., I won't be back).
