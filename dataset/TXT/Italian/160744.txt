lJbxQFXqbgKBdHPKKxROMQ We got two extra large pizzas to go and we're very pleased with the pies and the size!! When they say Extra large they mean it!!  The five cheese was delicious and the veggie exactly what we hoped for! We preordered and everything was ready and hot when we picked it up. Would go back again. The menu looked inviting.
