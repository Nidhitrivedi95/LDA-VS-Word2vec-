nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ Very good Italian food and service. I had spaghetti and meatballs and others had ziti. Two kids (3 and 19 months - and the mess associated with them but the staff was great about that) shared ravioli off the kids menu. We dined outside in pleasant weather. Pricing is spot on for what you get. Highly recommended!
