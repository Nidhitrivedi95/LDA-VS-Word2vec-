XD0LjNuPPwJPsTAHecUh7A I am used to coming here and being greeted with incredible service time and time again. However lately the service has been terrible and the food quality has declined significantly as well. What used to be a high quality toronto gem has become just another mediocre Italian spot. Today after we complained about the service, we were given a whole bunch of excuses about how there was not enough wait staff and kitchen staff to meet the quantity of guests. On top of it all, the cutlery was quite dirty and the cups smelled horribly of eggs. In the future if there is not enough staff the restaurant should remain shut for that day, just a note from a previous frequent fan. Truly disappointed.
