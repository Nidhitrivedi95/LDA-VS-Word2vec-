7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg Sometimes when you hear all sorts of good things; you expect a little less, a little more average, something to keep you grounded in the inevitable disappointment.  Well, let's say I wasn't disappointed at all.

Arriving, the staff was friendly and the space small and intimate.  We had a coupon from the website (hint!!) for a free appetizer so ordered the calamari.  It was delicious!  Served with a side of fresh, delicious, and homemade marinara sauce, I couldn't stop eating those little buggers!  

Since the lasagna is highlighted as being "The best in town", obviously two people from my table ordered that.  My mom claimed it to be not only the best in town, but possibly the best lasagna she's ever had at a restaurant.  Not that we're Italian or anything, but we do like to eat out a lot!!  

I ordered the gnocci in a blush sauce.  It was delicious with fluffy little gnocci bites.  Oh, and should I mention there was a WHOLE POUND of it!  Every time the waiter came by the table he joked about if I'd even started yet.  

All the sides were delicious, the entrees come with salad or soup (Wedding soup) and even the bread was great!  Everything was reasonably priced and I was pleased with the wine menu.  The only negative that I have is that I forgot my leftovers in my fridge instead of bringing them into work.  I want to eat them right now!
