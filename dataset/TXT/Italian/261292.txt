It's a beautiful building, just not sure why in AZ especially they wouldn't have built room inside to wait for a table. Our waiter was outstanding. I wish all restaurants had service like his. The food really wasn't anything great. I was looking forward to this amazing meal with all the customers I see daily flooding the place, but no, not great.  My salad was pretty much a head of iceberg lettuce with a few "homemade" croutons that were just dried out garlic bread, a little chicken, and a pinch of cheese. I ate about half then gave up on it.  Pizza was a thin crust that didn't have much flavor.  My husband's lasagne was very good he said, not the greatest, but good. Was a pretty small portion he pointed out. My girls liked their fettuccine but just left the leftovers behind. I don't see us eating there again.
