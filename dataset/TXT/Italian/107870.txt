FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A I'm more than displeased about this place, this is the first time I have had to update a review.

Every time I used my free garlic bread coupon when a short thin gentleman was working he would charge me anyway. 
This happened on 5 separate occasions. I find it hard to believe he is this incompetent. 
A little too shady for my taste. 

In addition the quality of food has declined. 

The staff play music of there choosing which I don't think is appropriate especially with kids around. 

I won't be returning, the blatant charging for sticks made of bread, stick bread and stick bread garlic sticks was the final straw, the last straw, the straw that broke the camels bank.
