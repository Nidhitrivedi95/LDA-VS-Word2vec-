vrpW_ZIjHvsAX3ByyeHjCA I enjoy the food and the atmosphere here but the service is on and off. Some visits, we are served with a friendly face and efficient attitude, but I've also been for lunch and felt completely forgotten about, even though we were one of two tables in the restaurant. However, I am going to take it as an off-day and won't hold it against them! I really enjoy their salads and pastas. Everything is hearty and homey. It's a welcoming environment for the suburbia-ville area!
