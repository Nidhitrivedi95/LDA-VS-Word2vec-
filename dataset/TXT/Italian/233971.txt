The upstairs lounge area is even nicer with red velvet walls, white banquettes, dark flooring, a good sound system, and great mood lighting it is very rare to find a place to get both good food and good music in a good environment. 

As much as I wanted to stay inside the weather was so perfect I had to take advantage of it and turned out to be great. Although the patio is small and may be a little crammed the service outside is just as speedy and charming as it is on the inside. The waitress was very nice, accommodating, funny, and really knew her stuff when it came to specials, drinks, and pairings.

Food is good. I don't recommend the vegetable crustini as it is not very flavorful and the crustini as more stale chewy bread than a thin cracker like bread. I had the seafood pasta for dinner and it was good. I wouldn't say it is the best pasta I've ever had, but its pretty good and the portion is large. You get shrimp, muscles, bay scallops, and calamari all in a wonderfully light tomato and herb sauce. I was full half way through but it was just so good I ate it all. My one complaint was that a lot of my pasta stuck together and being an Italian place, you just gotta make the pasta right, flavors were good though. The bread served up is also very good.

Overall, it's a great place to have food and a few drinks. Service is awesome and the lounge upstairs has a good vibe. Makes life easier for those indecisive people out there that wanna do dinner and do something else afterward, this place has both dinner and nightlife. Prices are decent and pasta portions are good. Rapini sides are great but $5 for rapini is almost crazy.
