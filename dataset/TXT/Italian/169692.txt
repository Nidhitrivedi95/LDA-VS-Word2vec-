mRrgBIT8vsYdI3YSfzCQhg I've been here a few times and honestly this place never disappoints. 

Tonight was another amazing dinner. I had the Calamari salad to start. Sooooo juicy and yet had the wonderful char marks that one would associate with grilled calamari. 
Following that I enjoyed a seared to perfection blue rare 10oz New York striploin (I like it rare) and it was like cutting through butter. My hubby (it's his bday ;)) had the veal chop. OMG. Both dishes had the beefy flavor without the stink. Although the rub is slightly on the salty side ( personal tastes) I have to say the quality has always been amazing. 
Again what is dinner without amazing service? Well the staff here are stellar. Absolutely amazing. Friendly, personal and smiling. (Even with a few screaming kids) common you have to be an saint. 
No wonder they've been here for 15yrs and counting. 
Here's to another 15
