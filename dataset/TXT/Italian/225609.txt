Although I went with a group I would also say it's a great place to take your significant other! I loved how they had a live jazz band playing frank Sinatra and others of that genera. The service was also fantastic! They also offer a limo that will pick you up and drop you off at your hotel! My GF and I shared a 1lb pasta bowl that was perfect for 2. And the pasta (penne & greens) just melted in my mouth. Next time I'm in Vegas I will be back!!
