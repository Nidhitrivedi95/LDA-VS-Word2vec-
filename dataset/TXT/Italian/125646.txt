Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A Last Saturday was a super-crowded spring afternoon in downtown Tempe. We interrupted the hostess staff as they huddled together in conversation. The young lady who greeted us was a bit put out - sorry about that, but we did have reservations. Once we stepped onto the patio at Caffe Boa and to our table however, the clamor and noise of the outside world disappeared. Our server was very good, filling our glasses of water, taking our order promptly, refilling our wine and chilling it too. The menu is lovely and the food was fabulous. The crispy chicken was the hit at our table with a delicate rosemary crisped skin. Inside - tender and juicy and delicious. The lasagna was also ordered - a giant portion of food, almost too much for the lady who ordered it. Smothered in a slightly creamy, very flavorful tomato sauce and oozing with cheese. The arugula salad was also large and nothing but arugula and goat cheese. A few other veggies would have been nice - all that arugula can be boring. I ordered the veal ragu but a veal chop appeared at my place. I was into the chop - it was alarmingly delicious and didn't have the heart to send it back. It was a slight error on our waitress
 part and I enjoyed every moment of it. Desserts were the tiramisu (wonderful) and the adult s'mores tart (good, not great.) The espresso and chamomile tea were lovely to finish off the meal. This is my second time here and after the first time we swore not to return. Happily... I would come back again and again.
