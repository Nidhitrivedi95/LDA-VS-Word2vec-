The pizza was "ok" - I feel like more options as to combination pizzas are needed for this place to shine - don't get me wrong - the mushroom pizza was good - not very "mushroom-y" though...

The cavatelli tasted like frozen Chieffos cavatelli that we make at home...only colder & swimming in watery red sauce. 

Would I go back - for the take out red bread dipping sauce and maybe a craft beer (they have a good draft selection) - pizza would be only "to go".
