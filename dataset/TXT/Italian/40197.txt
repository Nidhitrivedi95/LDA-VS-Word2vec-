7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ I love the dining room here. It's grand, it's massive and it's a steakhouse on steroids. I know people have ranted about the decor, but I love it. I love the big chandeliers and the high ceilings.

The veal chop for $72 is no easy task to order. You take a little breath before you do but once you give over to the price, the beautiful piece of meat that comes out is fantastic. I ordered it med rare and got exactly that. 

Yeah.
It's just meat on a white plate.
The better to see the red and pink and white fatty bits.
Yum.

If you want sides, order 'em. 
I don't need it.
Just give me meat.

Meat and wine.
Simple.

Even the menus are over-the-top.
I loved reading the food on the front and then opening the menu to two giant pages of wine.

Service was attentive though my partner thought it lacked a rhythm. It felt like we waited a long time for our appetizers. But in the end we had to rush our meal because our youngest diner was ready to leave.

If you're on a budget, this ain't the place to go. You've got to come here and live large, eat large and pay the large bill.
