cdLjMoQPRtdWN4g6LW650w Service was terrible and the food was inedible. The server was slow and unfriendly. I can't believe the positive reviews on this place. The "fresh" pasta was a sticky glob, all of the sauces were bland. The prices were high for the food we received. Will never come here again.
