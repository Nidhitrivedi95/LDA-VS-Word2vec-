bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg Loving pizza I would not say this would be my choice.  Tge restaurant had a nice feel. Nice music.  We order there house favorite.  We were not our favorites the oven is very hot that makes the bottom of the pizza get chard but the dough itself is a little chewy and it got soggy very quickly the sausage could have been cooked a little bit longer. We order the sea bass. It was ok nice crispy skin.  But under a cold salad. 
No thank you.
