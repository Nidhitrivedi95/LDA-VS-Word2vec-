8dSIAoz_UphMGpZr_uMing Under new management?!?

This was the go to lunch spot for a few of my coworkers, probably ate here 2-3 times a month. Never had problems until today. 

We waited for 15 minutes after server took drink order for drinks (water plus a couple sodas) to arrive. Server took our food order after delivering drinks, and we waited 45 minutes for food to come out. Our group ordered standard lunch fare - a couple salads and sandwiches. Salads came out 10 minutes before other foods, and the folks who ordered sandwiches had to get them packed to go as we had to leave. 

Truly bad experience today, and this place will fall to the bottom of the list for quick work lunch spots.
