B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw Great food, good service.  Book ahead and avoid peak times if you can, this place gets BUSY.... but the food is great and the service is professional.

Top features are the wonderful rooftop patio, house wine sold by the ounce, and their awesome private basement room for family-style meals.
