MWYJl-bIxhtQ-4Kg3ENUxA This pizza place has a lot of good things going for it! My work recently catered in lunch and I was able to sample some of their thin crust pizza offerings. 

My initial thought was "this is not thin crust" - but when I think thin, I think cracker thin. That being said a cracker crust would never hold-up to the glorious amount of stretchy cheese and toppings that are present in every bite - so gooey! 

The establishment remains true to its claim of authentic "Chicago" style with hand-crafted Italian sausage present on many items. I tried the Godfather and I really like the addition of giardiniera and this was far and away my favorite specialty pizza. The sauce was good - not too sweet - and portioned out mildly enough not to over power the bite.

Overall it's good pizza and worth the extra couple of dollars for something far more substantial then your average chain!
