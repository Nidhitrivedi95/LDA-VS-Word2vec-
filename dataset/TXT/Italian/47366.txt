Decided to give them another try since I was in the neighborhood.   The lunch menu hasn't changed and it still has the same dishes - most of which are pretty heavy for a quick lunch.  You can get a small cheese pizza on the lunch menu but no substitutions so no pepperoni pizza.

The dining room is pretty dingy but the bar isn't half bad - which is clearly why everyone sits in the bar.

This time service was much better but the food was so so.  

This place was one of the first I can recall to serve a white pizza and it was decent.
