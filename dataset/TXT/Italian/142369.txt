The pasta was chewy and flavorless, the sauce was mostly garlic, and the sides were so forgettable... I've forgotten about them. The best part of the meal was the waiter, who gave us all the good gossip about his friend, a ticket scalper, who the waiter insisted could get us good concert tickets for a fair price.

Unfortunately, an engaging waiter does not a memorable meal make. We won't be going back.
