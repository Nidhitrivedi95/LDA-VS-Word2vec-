7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ i just made an account on yelp so i could write a review for this place. 

i was visiting from California and my friend was like.. "i have to take you to this place! you will love it!" 

he was so right. 

we got there about 5 minutes before closing time on a saturday night.
they were super cool about it though. 
didn't rush us at all.

i had a pizza called "the gladiator." 
AMAZING. 
we also ordered a kids meal for an appetizer. 
it was peanut butter and jelly "sushi." 
really cute! 
came with french fries, carrots and celery. 

the waitress was really nice and helpful. 
good about refilling our drinks. 

when we were done another waiter came over and chatted with us and got us a to-go box and then continued to tell us the best way to reheat the pizza the next day. he also got us new drinks in to-go cups.. .which is awesome :-) 

i highly recommend this place. 
everything we ate was REALLY great. 

also bought a chocolate cupcake from the bakery. 
outstanding. 

i will definitely go there again when I'm back in phoenix!
