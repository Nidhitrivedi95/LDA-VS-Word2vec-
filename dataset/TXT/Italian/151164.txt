KLivsKKkFU3XxHM3eukVLA I have ordered from Super Pizza and visited and many occasions and every time I have never been disappointed by the quality or portion sizes of the food. By far one of my favorite items on their menu is the Robert's Chicken Fingers especially when it's coated in their kicking garlic parmesan sauce. The sauce has just the right amount of flavor that leaves your mouth salivating with a little hint of butteryness added to it that makes you feel like you ate something deliciously bad for you.

One of the other great things about this place is that they do not charge at all for delivery. In this day and age that's a rare thing to find and with food that is better than the national chains or other local places like Napoli's then you have a win win. Add in two very approachable and friendly owners (a husband and wife team) and Super Pizza is simply a win.
