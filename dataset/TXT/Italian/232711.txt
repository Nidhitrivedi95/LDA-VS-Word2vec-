TLbx_MR2dyFztoyR5d9H2A It's actually the closest restaurant to our house. When we first moved to Gilbert, five years ago we gave it a try, twice, and were unimpressed. We decided to give it another try last night and after waiting for our food an hour we took it to go. The servers were all really nice, but the "pizza oven was backed up". We ordered the thin crust so how long could it take??? Next time, Grimaldi's.
