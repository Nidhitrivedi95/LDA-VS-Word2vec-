qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg Was passing by with my 5 y.o. kid when both of us had a craving for something sweet: the kid got his cup of a 50/50 gelato (mango/passion fruit) and a got a large cannoli. Gelato was excellent.. Cannoli was crap: the shell was old, dry, hard and it crumbled immediately upon the first bite, leaving all that filling on my fingers. The filling was not quite right either. However, the atmosphere, ambiance, and the choice of baked goods was good.
