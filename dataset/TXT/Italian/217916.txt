RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q Like most of the other reviewers the pizza sauce here to me is on the sweeter side, but I liked it. I noticed a lot of people order their pizza extra crispy; we didn't and the crust was crisp but it didn't crunch, if you like that - ask for it.
The hubby and I shared a small pizza and a pitcher of beer plus a side salad. Our Bill was $30 plus tip and we were plenty full. 
Wed night is half off bottles of wine too; not that big of a selection but getting a $30 bottle for $15 is a great deal.
The staff was nice and very attentive to our party of 10. Nothing to complain about at all from our visit. Great job.
