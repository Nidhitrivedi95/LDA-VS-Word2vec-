DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw Second time here. Service was poor. It's the night of the Mayweather fight and we're 1 of 3 tables in the place. Couldn't get a refill on water unless I specifically asked. I ordered a medium well sirloin and it came out black. As in charred and burnt. I had to ask to send it back because the server tried to pretend not to see it. When I sent it back the sirloin that replaced it was medium rare (blood was coming out of it). At that point I was too hungry to care and ate it. Overall the food has been good and this was the first time something hadn't been well (no pun intended), but the way the server handled us really didn't sit well.
