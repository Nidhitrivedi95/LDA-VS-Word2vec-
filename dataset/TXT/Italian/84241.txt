DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw This is re the deli.   I'm disappointed because I needed thick ricotta and dry ricotta...I called ahead and was told they had both.  I drove across town.. the dry ricotta was too salty and they wouldn't cut in chunks only slices so I couldn't shred it.  I bought the wet ricotta though it looked too wet only because the girl told me that's what they use.  It was way too wet...in fact wetter than the store bought type...but it waa fresh...hiwever it had zero flavor..it was like eating nothing.  I wanted it to make fresh from scratch raviolis but instead used v I t bin a ricotta cake where I could add flavor and the wetness didn't matter.  I don't appreciate that they wasted my time and the questions I posed to both girls...well they were both clueless about italian supplies and cooking.   It's a shame
Wasted time and money.
