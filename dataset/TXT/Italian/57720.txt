aNYunG3j5zNJ4F0dQcZMyQ Amazing food.  Three of us went there for a celebration.  They did not have the mouth watering filet mignon on the menu but they were willing to give us anything we wanted.  So I ordered a medley to different things so I could try out different menu items.  The salad was very good with the pistachos.  The bread and butter was even a wow factor.  The place was very nicely lit and amazing wait staff.  Geno waited on us amazing they way he spoke to us, he treated us like royalty.  The tables had white linen cloths on them, very upscale establishment and not at all noisy you were able to have a conversation without yelling.  We ordered the wild caught pistachio salmon which was very good, the seafood pasta with sea bass amazing and the trio of fist size raviolli's  The butternut squash homemade raviolli was amazing.  Very nice atmosphere, great wait staff, nice ambience everything you would want in a upscale restaurant.  Plus the melt in your mouth Filet is always an added advantage!!! Yum Yum Good!!!!
