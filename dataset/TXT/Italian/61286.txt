aYjZc-3aVbPIPaJgGiUK_A The fact that Nostrano doesn't have a solid 5 stars is a disappointment. It is my favorite restaurant in Madison. I completely disagree that it is overpriced. There are certainly more expensive place in Madison, and at Nostrano, I truly feel like I am getting what I pay for. 

The chef here is from a James Beard award winning restaurant in Chicago. (granted it didn't win a James Beard awards when he was there, but I think it reflects the standard it holds) I mention this because the food is not only delicious, it is thoughtful. It is artistic in every sense of the word, from the presentation, conscious of both color and texture, to the curve of the plate it is presented on.  

The food changes with the seasons and is always fresh. The drinks are incredible and creative, ever changing. My favorite part is, you can tell the bartender what you are feeling like and he will make a drink to those specifications, just for you. If you don't like it, he will make you a new one, for free!  The drink making here is also masterful. They cut ice cubes to specifically fit the kind of glass you are drinking from. 

The staff is attentive without being obnoxious. They are well-versed on what they are serving you and can tell you where your food came from and why they are pairing it with whatever is on the plate. They aren't just there to serve you - they are there to educate you, if you so choose. 

Over, all the attention to detail, the comforting and inviting atmosphere, and the excellent staff make Nostrano the definition of a 5-star restaurant.
