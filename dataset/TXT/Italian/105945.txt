fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg Really good! They definitely KNOW THEIR NOODLES! I only say 4-star based on the ambiance. The restaurant was kind of bright and unromantic for date night (looks like it used to be a Marie calendar's or a Cracker Barrel with the wooden booths and all the farmhouse-homey decor), but the food was great and well-priced and our server was really knowledgeable on the menu and the exact right amount of attentive.
