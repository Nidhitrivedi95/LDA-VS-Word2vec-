-b-waFIsc6BJdXWOJMRKEQ Fantastic restaurant! This is my all time favourite restaurant for Italian food. I have brought so many friends and family members here and have recommended it to numerous people. My coworker who grew up in the area and still resides in Little Italy planned a night out years ago and ever since I have been hooked. I believe it is a family run business. The mom makes all of the pasta noodles from scratch. They even cure their own meats. I always ordered the lobster risotto which is phenomenal. They cook it in their house special sauce. The prices are reasonable for the quality you receive. I highly recommend Marinella's for quality Italian food.
