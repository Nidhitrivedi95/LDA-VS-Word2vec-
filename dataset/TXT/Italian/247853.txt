vE4WR05o_c0pL_l4Aq2BlQ If you're in or around north Glendale and want fresh and authentic Italian food, great service at a reasonable price, come to Pomo. The menu is diverse and well conceived. From the antipasto to the dolce and everything in between, everything is fresh and well prepared. Pizzas are the traditional thin crust style. Pastas are so good I can only presume they are freshly hand made in the kitchen. 
I really love their lunch menu too. The serve a couple of pasta dishes and 5 different panini sandwiches. I had the Amalfi today. Grilled zucchini, eggplant, mushrooms and tomato on delicious homemade bread. 
Love this place.
