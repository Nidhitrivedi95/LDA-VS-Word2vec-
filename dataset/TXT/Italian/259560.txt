WLixYfXWO1Q0b_L4PsQ-5w We ate here after my dad was released from West Penn Hospital for heart issues. So we celebrated with heart healthy olive oil based food haha.

Lombardozzi's is not only fun to say but a good place to eat. Friendly good service. Little antipasto appetizers set out while you decide from the menu. Top notch place.
