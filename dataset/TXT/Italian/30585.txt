5keoVVM81g-nJw0Zdpl1nA Came here with my wife on vacation, this place stands out as one of the better meals we had. My wife is picky as hell about pizza and she loved the food.  The sauce on these slices was really good and I ended up going back for two more slices! I stuffed my face, I had killed one of those big as drinks on Fremont so we had a pig out. We'll definitely hit this place up next time because it's hard to find quality food in that area.
