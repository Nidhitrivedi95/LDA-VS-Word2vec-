Sm2k1ijcnK17Ro5paN2_qQ If I could give them zero I would... I couldn't tell you what the food was like because the driver was too incompetent to figure out an apartment complex. When I tried to tell him he was on the wrong side he wouldn't listen and got rude with me. Then I got a call from a nice lady at eat 24 since I ordered through them and she told me the drive said he doesn't have time to drive through the complex and that I need to come pick it up because he didn't have time to find me. It would have taken 2 mins to drive through the complex or around the building. What a jerk. This place will never see my money. Eat 24 was very friendly though.
