unDs06rQ8V-d8-EujSVe8A I came to Little Italy in 2012 by mistake, when I was looking for any pasta places to carbo-load before the Cleveland Marathon and was pleased with a restaurant on the street near "Random Street."  I couldn't remember the restaurant so I Yelped it and believed I was at this place...but when I went there, I was mistaken.  In any case, it was a job well done.

I ordered the Spaghettini with meatballs and bread to-go, since I was on a tight schedule and parking can be notoriously difficult to find in this area.  I asked for extra bread and was glad to get it.  Overall, not a bad experience.  Service was nice and the people were courteous to my needs.
