grf5Gmn_GAh8ImHTi3HLPg ONE star given for the young man that took over the Phn call after 10 mins of the gaL not knowing how to add toppings and charge ---other wise a big fat ZERO. 

UPPER management needs to step in. 
It was Wednesday evening and not a single event was taking place in town... This place was a wreck from the initial Phn order placement. 

Your workers don't know the physical address of your place. I wanted to verify or double chk (as an out of town guest) which store I had called and needed to pick up at ... due to delivery times being quoted at 1 HR 45 mins. 

Your business is 8 mins from my hotel (per Google GPS) and it took @45 mins of standing at your counter to receive my InCORRECT order. Thank goodness Starbucks was Nxt door the kids had dessert before dinner. 
The gaL at the counter is quick to collect the money but should check the boxes immediately and NOT after I waited an addiction 25 mins for an add on of MiLD Wings only to find out that my original order to include a personal pan pizza was made incorrectly.

I don't have any good things or kind comments to say about this business and my first experience with them ... and could write more negative ---but I think you get the point. 
***did I mention that folks before me (3 orders but who's counting) were given free wings for their "wait" 

They offered to remake my pizza (there was a 25 min turnaround time) 
My reply was; um... No thanks. 

I was told my card would be credited for the personal pan pizza mishap. The misMADE pizza wasn't given to me ... And the Exact dollar Amount to be credited was NOT stated.
