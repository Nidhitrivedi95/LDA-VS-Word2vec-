MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg Chicago Joes brings it home, no questions asked. With authentic Italian cooking. Starting off with one of their specialities, stuffed artichoke; made with homemade Italian breadcrumbs soaked in white wine, butter sauce and steamed in the oven for two and a half hours. Their bread it brought in fresh everyday from Great Buns Bakery, and you'd be a fool not to lap up that white wine butter sauce with the warmed up bread. Our server sent out some of their homemade cannoli's and it was lights out. You must visit this classic Vegas restaurant.
