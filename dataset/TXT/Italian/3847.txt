_e3rChyednoh47n2cjGv2w The pollo al limon is AMAZING!!! So delicious. Its always made fresh and perfect. The desserts here are also very delicious and made from scratch. Id recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a family owned restaurant that serves FRESHLY made food. Everyone is so lovely and nice. They always make sure you are taken care of.
