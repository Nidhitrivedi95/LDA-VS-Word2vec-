qvQ-i1HgSloSJLkGnXsfhw I remember my first red devil experience vividly. It was almost 5 years ago. I was having one of those typical really crappy IT industry days. The NOC was slammed with calls and of course all from the worst of the worst customer wise. My manager at the time says he has something to make the day better. Takes off for about 45 minutes. I didn't know what to expect... hookers? blow?... no.. its a huge pizza and a giant pile of wings.

Holy crap these wings are AMAZING even with the steam effect you get when you take out wings. They are super crispy and sauce is the baseline hot/vinegary/buttery awesomeness by which  I measure other wings. Their ranch is absolutely amazing and they are not stingy with it. Enough left over to dip pizza in afterward for the ultimate in glutton. I always go for the hot but their other flavors are good. If  you want a real treat just ask them not to sauce the wings and get a few sides of dipping sauce. The teriyaki they coat their chicken in for their oriental salad makes a GREAT wing dip.

The pizza crust is super crunchy and has an amazing flavor, cheese is nice and greasy, and the toppings are good quality. The sauce is a little flat but I can look past it considering all the other pros.

If you are lucky enough to dine in the wings are even better and they will serve you these delicious pizza bread rolls. They tear like string cheese and are always fresh. Sometimes they come right out of the oven mmmmm.

I have never once encountered a rude server. Service has always been at least 3.5 stars.. mostly 4.5 or 5. This is just a fun place to go and a great family restaurant.

This is a valley icon/staple and has been around long before I was even a thought. Apparently we have some family history. This used to be my uncles college stomping groups and Tee Pee used to be my dads. Guess love of the local grease pits is hereditary.
