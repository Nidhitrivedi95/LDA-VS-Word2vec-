n_UkzLCAMCIqhUnu-iLQyw Bricco had delicious food, but terrible service.  On Tues Oct 12 around 7pm we dined at Bricco right before our 8pm show at Playhouse square.  The hostess was courteous and friendly, the bar staff was speedy and accommodating, and the food was absolutely delicious.  However, our female server was so incredibly rude, I was quite surprised that she was employed by Bricco.  She arrived to our table asking if we would like more cocktails - we had drinks from the bar while waiting for our table.  I said we were OK on our drinks for now, and asked if we could order dinner, she rolled her eyes and in an unprofessional curt manner her exact reply was: "I guess so."  Puzzled by her response, I then asked: "Is it OK if we order dinner now?", and she shrugged her shoulders.  My friend asked if our bar tab could be transfered to our table, and the rude server shot back: "No, you have to close out at the bar."  I understand that some restaurants have this policy, but never in my life have I been borderline yelled at by a server when inquiring about the bar tab.  My party was so surprised with the server's angry response, my friend went back to the bar to order another round of cocktails instead of ordering more drinks from our tactless server.  Our dinners arrived, and when we asked for the check, our server didn't respond at all.  Moments later she did drop off our bill.  After a long time, fearful that our server would not return, I got up and looked for our server to see if she would bring us our change.  She was no where to be found.  Finally she appeared, we paid our bill, and she did bring us change.  I would like to dine at Bricco again and hope the other servers are more professional.
