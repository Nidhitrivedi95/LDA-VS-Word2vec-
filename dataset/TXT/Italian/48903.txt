9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw I came to this place with a friend, who raves about this place so I was excited to finally try it after all the hype that is was given on behalf of my friend. Sadly to say, I have had better pizza at a similar type restaurant to Cibo. The pizza that I had was soggy and had no flavor. I was very disappointed and do not believe that pizza should be eaten with a knife and fork. The only thing I liked was the dessert, which was the nutella crepe. I will never come pack here and stick to my favorite urban pizzaria, which is La Bocca in Tempe.
