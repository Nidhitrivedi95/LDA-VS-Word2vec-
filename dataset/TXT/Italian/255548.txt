VzekjBEdqFdJsXEOWInA1A I ordered a delivery. They let me order the Chicken Fetticine Alfredo but after I ordered it and paid for it already they cancelled it on me saying they np longer have sauce. Also the chicken wings I ordered were plain when I ordered them with medium sauce and also tasted old and spoiled like it was bad meat. It was disgusting. I ate 2 and threw the rest away. They wouldn't refund me for them either. Just an overall terrible experience which is sad because they have been good in the past.
