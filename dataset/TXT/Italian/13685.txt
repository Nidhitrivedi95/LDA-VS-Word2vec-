1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ I realized i haven't yelped this place even though i have been here at least once a year since moving here.

Okay so maggiano's in my opinion is only worth it if you are going to do family style eating...heck yes all you can...

I only come here on special occasions with my family, when everyone is in town. We ordered i think almost all the combinations of food you can think of for the family style. I really love their stuffed mushrooms and calamari appetizers. Those are always a good pre-game snack, but it turns into a pre-game meal because of it being bottomless.

There are too many main courses for me to remember, but i enjoy them all especially with it being...yes all you can eat.

The dessert, get the cream puffs those are amazing monsters of joy...and i think sometimes i save half my stomach just to throw down 2-3 of those. 

I really enjoy this place for family outings because its about eating up. But really who would turn down high quality all you can eat food?? it's not a buffet so you will have to shovel out a pretty penny for the family style eating.
