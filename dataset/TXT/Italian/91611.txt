EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw I spent a lovely, intimate anniversary dinner here last month. I specifically chose Crudo for the bizarre menu. I wasn't disappointed but at several points during the meal I felt a little oogie, not because the food was bad. I endeavored to try only things I had never eaten in my life, and Crudo delivered. We did the Tasting Menu which was unbelievably priced for the variety and quality offered. The butterfish was delicate, flavorful. I could have had seconds. I'm not a big risotto fan and the squid ink risotto was darkly colored, but I liked it. It was creamy and salty. Nice and different. I chose the burricotta because I had no idea what it was and because it was topped with trout caviar. It was delicious. As the main course, the lamb belly was super. I had pangs of guilt thinking about poor, poor Lamb Chop. Shari Lewis is going to haunt me. While the crispy pig ears were interesting, I've fed too many to my dog to truly enjoy them.

This was a great evening. We had a slow, lingering meal in a dimly lit, quiet dinging area. Our waitress was superb. She was the highlight of the evening, attentive, patient and effortlessly explaining the menu course by course.
