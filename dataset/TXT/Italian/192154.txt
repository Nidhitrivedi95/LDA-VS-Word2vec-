pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Have been recommended this place by friends and not far from my place. Went w my kid. The table where we were seated was very small and cramped. in the bar area. Was around 5.30pm. The lemon clams were over steamed. had the lasagne and eggplant parm which were average and a bit on the oily side. Wine however compensated. Not the most friendly or responsive staff. Apparently smiling not allowed.

I may try again.
