RXyM7VrCiEFthJxQ4bGmBg Came in here on a Thursday evening to sample there Winterlicious offerings.

A long narrow restaurant with exposed brick walls and dark wood tables with hardwood floors.

Our waitress was very bubbly and friendly and came over to take our drink orders. We wanted something fruity and tropical. She joked and said we'd have to go the caribbean for that but she'd do her best to whip up something along those lines.
She later returned with a tall ruby red refreshing blend of grenadine, gingerale, pineapple and cranberry juice. It totally took us back to the caribbean!

From the Winterlicious menu I ordered

Crustini -Three piece crustini topped with smoked salmon and avocado mango relish 
The salmon was fresh and ample and I loved the refreshing taste of avocado and mango which totally blended well with my caribbean drink.

Filet Mignon -Pan roasted bacon wrapped filet mignon with morel mushroom red wine sauce, served with herb roasted vegetables and buttered baby bok choy
Boy oh boy did this knock my socks off! I was expecting a wee little piece of meat but out came this hunk of juicy delicious well seasoned generous cut of meat! Everything on the plate looked amazing and tasted equally delicious!

Walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream
Two Fudgey warm brownies packed with toasted walnuts with a side of vanilla ice cream and hot fudge, simple but lovely end to a fab meal!

Tea - English Breakfast by Bigalow

Overall superberb meal which totally exceeded my expectations as this was one of the cheaper winterlicious offerings however it was surprisiningly  a high quality and outstanding meal + top notch friendly service!
