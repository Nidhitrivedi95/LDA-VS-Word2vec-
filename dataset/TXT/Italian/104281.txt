FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA My partner and I took a stroll to try Postino Central for the first time.  By walking there we didn't have to worry about parking.  Postino's does have valet in case you were wondering.  There is a neighborhood directly behind the restaurant and the home owners put out pylons and road barricades to keep customers from parking in front of there driveways.  Parking is tight at Postino's so if you have to end up parking in the neighborhood have some consideration for the home owners.  I am sure they are annoyed with all the traffic.  Enough said about that.

Postino Central has had huge crowds since it opened.  My partner and I put off going until the novelty of the place wore off.  Guess what.  It hasn't worn off.  It is a great restaurant/bar and hangout.  We went later in the evening and there was a big crowd.

I tried the bruschetta.  I ordered a half order.  There are 11 choices of bruschetta.  Take your pick.  To drink I ordered a Cucumber Honey Lemonade.  Yum.  No alcohol for me that night.  My partner ordered the NYC Grilled Cheese.  So simple but delicious.

We went back to Postino's that same week.  Another large crowd.  They are doing something right there.

Both times I have been there I ordered and Iced Cafe Mocha to go for the stroll home.  By walking there and back it felt like I was in NYC walking to my favorite hang out.  We will definitely frequent Postino Central.  This place is a Hot Spot for many reasons.  Check it out.
