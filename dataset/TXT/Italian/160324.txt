LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw Get the Link Sausage!!!  The flavor was brilliant.  It is house made and This was my first time to this location.  I've been to other Oregano's in the past, but obviously I did not know what I was missing.  A friend and I went and there was a line of people waiting.  We were able to sit at the bar and eat dinner.  Be aware that they have Pepsi products.  I love Diet Coke and so I had to have soda water.  That is my only complaint.  We had a starter of Sausage and Meatballs, wonderful taste, a Ceasar salad and the Clark Street Pizza.  The pizza was better than my expectation and has been added to my list of the best pizza so far.  I was not expecting that from a chain.  The service was excellent and the bartender Josh was amazing.
