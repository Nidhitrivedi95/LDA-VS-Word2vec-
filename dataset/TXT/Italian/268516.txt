XiN6fI8I3Mzg2nPRJ9ukRQ Been in vegas for 12-13 years, living in Europe for 20 years before that, and let me tell you - have not had better Italian food! Prosecco is the top one restaurant in Vegas and Henderson combine. Tried their pizza and their pasta and i dont know what to say WOW! Just try it! thank you guys for the great hospitality! Top Restaurant!
