esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA My husband and I visited Oyster Bar on our last trip to Vegas in late August/early September.  OMG - it was great!  There was a good variety of items to choose from on the menu besides the oysters, and I would recommend those as well.  We did not make reservations since we were having an early dinner and we manged to get in without any problems.
