5OV1bavavdsYyfeBRNiOeA Warning out-of-towners...do not try to get to this place in the dark!  It is literally on train tracks!  Our car got stuck on the unmarked tracks - a bunch of well meaning but unhelpful folks came out to tell us "it happens every week" and then shout conflicting advice.  After it was all over, we had popped a brand new tire, kids were traumatized and my husband ate his cold scampi in the hotel.  A moment to forget - we will never return to this part of Pittsburgh!
