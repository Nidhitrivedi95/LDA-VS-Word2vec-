Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA If I were cruel, I would say that the pizza crust is orgasmic and just end the review here.  

But, I'm feeling generous so...  go here.  Today.  They had a great beer list as well as homemade wine coolers.  I had the blueberry hibiscus and it a perfect concoction.  The margherita pizza was delicious.  They were not stingy with the cheese or the basil.  My husband had the sweet potato and ricotta pizza.  He quite enjoyed it and considering he's not the biggest pizza fan, that's kind of a big deal.  We shared the 'Lil Triple for dessert and it was wonderful as well.  Oreo crust, chocolate creme and toasted marshmallow...  

Service was a teensy bit slow but to be fair, they were quite busy.  It was a beautiful day outside but we opted to sit inside as the patio was quite loud since it's on the street.  

I realized shortly after being seated that this must be the brainchild of the same folks who run Windsor and I was correct.  (I think the gum wrappers in the sugar containers may have given it away.)  

Can't wait to go back!
