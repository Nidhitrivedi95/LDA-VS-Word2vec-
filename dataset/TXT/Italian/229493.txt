t5Ip9ggWaam6qAUH0WPKVg Decent pizza but a bit overpriced.  I thought it  was better under the original owners.  There are a lot of different pizza places to choose from in Scottsdale and I'm not sure this place separates itself above the others to warrant more than 3 stars.   Worth a try but don't go out of your way.
