7S5iOI5Xb9cTUQLmBwCeXw If you want mediocre food in a very slow -- actually dead -- atmosphere where you could sit at your  table and watch the staff as they watched soccer - do I have a recommendation for you.

Ok, it was not like I was the only person there.  In fairness, there were exactly two other people, one of which had come with me.  I had to do a double take as we walked to the front door  to make sure it was even open.  But I'm ok with undiscovered gems.  This one is definitely a diamond in the rough.  Just a tad bit more like cubic zirconium in the rough.

The menu is.. meh.  Adequate would be an overstatement.  We tried the bruschetta which wasn't half bad.  If you are wondering where the phrase skinny Italian comes from, though, you'll know it by the portion sizes.  Three bruschetta (bruschettae?) exactly.  What I did get to sample was pretty good.

On to the main course, I ordered the jalapeno pizza based on someone's review here earlier.  Can't say that I will ever be that brave again.  The dough was severely under cooked to the point of the crust to be deemed officially MIA.

The waiter, single employee in the joint, was pleasant enough so no qualms there.  I just really do not know how he can make any sort of living given the amount of traffic he was getting.  Poor guy, if you go tip him generously.  Or don't, because I half suspect he is the owner and couldn't get anyone else to cover such a dead shift.

If you are interested in Skinny Italian Kitchen, go there now.  I don't know how much longer it can last.
