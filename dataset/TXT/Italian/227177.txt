SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ 4 friends / family and I dined here on March 25th. The food and ambiance were excellent. Our waitstaff Rufus is top-notch. He was friendly, very entertaining, and accommodating. We loved Rufus! I sampled the following dishes: 

Calamari Fritti - Perfect and without being oily.

Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare - The best version of this dish I have ever had. Thank you very much.
