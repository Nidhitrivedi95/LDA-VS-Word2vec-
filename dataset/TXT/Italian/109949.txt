G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q After following her show and buying her cookbooks we finally were able to try Giada's restaurant. The restaurant is beautiful and the ambiance is very nice, fancy but comfortable. But the food especially the pasta was really disappointing. It seemed overcooked! The dishes were also small and expensive, which is ok since you are going to a nice place. But having mushy pasta was really disappointing at an Italian restaurant. I don't think we'll go back. :(
