JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A The best part of this restaurant is that it's open 365 days a year! Wow, what restaurant do you know does that!? Not many. We came here after our trip to NYC and we were tired and it was a holiday so many other restaurants were closed. We always order the chicken penne or chicken carbonara. They are amazing savoury pasta dishes that fill you up to the brim. It's a bit pricy at $16 but you'll never leave hungry. The sauce is delicious and you get hearty chunks of chicken. Pro-tip: ask for the sauce to be thick.
