epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ The Italian food here was very good and authentic. For example, the sauce I had on my spaghetti was exceptional and had actual chunks of tomato in it (unlike that canned stuff other restaurants serve). But despite the authentic food, the service wasn't all that great.

Service was kinda slow considering that the restaurant was somewhat empty. In addition to that, there was a mix-up in the servers and the staff were unsure as to who was suppose to be helping us.
