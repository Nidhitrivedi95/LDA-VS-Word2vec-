It's the perfect description. From the moment you walk in, you're transported out of the Forum Shops and into Carmine's. I loved the ambience, great music and a family feel. I really did feel like I was dining in an old school New York Italian restaurant amongst good company.

We arrived Friday night with a large group and we came ready to eat.

Carmine's had us covered; their portions are HUGE!

My favorites were the cold antipasto, fried zucchini, and porterhouses contadina. Everything is cooked to perfection and the servers really do treat you like family. I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant for those in search of great Italian food.

I'll definitely be back to try their calamari and spaghetti with meatballs.
