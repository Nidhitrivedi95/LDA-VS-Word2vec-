yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg Amazing, traditional Italian food for a great price! I was very pleased to find this eatery and I take all my out-of-town guests here. Also, like myself, the owner is a huge San Francisco Giants fan so the walls are covered with World Series memorabilia. Makes me feel like I am back home in the Bay Area! Overall, a great experience!
