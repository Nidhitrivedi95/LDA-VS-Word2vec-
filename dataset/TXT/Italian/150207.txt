KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ We called and were told the ONLY reservations available were at 5:00 - fine, we were on East Coast time, felt like 8:00 to us.  When myself and a co-worker arrived at at 4:59 (told over the phone if we were late or no showed, they would charge our card $50) there was no one at the hostess stand to greet us.  Had to wander to the bar to announce our arrival ---- only to find that the 2 young ladies sitting with the 2 older men RIGHT NEXT TO THE HOSTESS STAND were actually the hostesses who should have greeted and seated us.  Owners, if you are reading this, NOT THE WAY TO START A MEAL FOR 2 FOR OVER $150 - work it out.  Stay off TV and fix this.  I can't overlook this, hire better.  Unless you can back it up at the end, start strong.

Once seated our waiter was knowledgeable and reasonably accommodating but we felt so rushed.  Everything we ordered arrived within 5 minutes...just as quickly we were asked if they could take FULL plates.  NO - go away.  The waiter also sat on chairs that were weirdly blocking access to our booth - I expect Hooters waitresses to sit at my table, not Rao's waiters.

Started with the antipasta appetizer for 2 - amazing,  Also ordered the Meatball side dish, they were fine, I truly make better, I also serve mine hot.  The Pasta with Vodka sauce was simply amazing.  Also had an order of the Fussilli with spicy sausage and cabbage - the pasta was perfect, the cabbage was a good addition - the sausage was over cooked, just short of burned, the sauce was acceptable, bordering on too acidic.

When leaving, I was put off that the only res was at 5:00, we felt rushed and left at 7:00 to an almost empty restaurant.  Should I ever have the option to try the Harlem version, I would be hard pressed to say yes, sorry.  Work is needed.
