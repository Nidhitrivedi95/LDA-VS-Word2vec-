FXt37UPKGGSUINae6NFWiw The food is delicious! Been there a few times and try something different every time and am never disappointed. Had the mushroom chicken, stuffed pepper (a special), blue cheese calamari (also a special), and boccancini balls. All great! And my friends have tried other things and loved them. Reasonable prices for a nice dinner out and we love the patio!
