_VHU9KZUHRLp2Hc2JOKlYg Dropped in at Cioppino for a late bite and a bottle of wine...and stayed to listen to the great music ( Terrance Vaughn Trio). Snagged a table in the bar and ordered a "baby" CdP (Plan Pegau) after a nice chat with the roving wine manager. Ordered up the lamb sliders and the Mac & cheese fritters... The Elysian Field lamb was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection...juicy and delicious. The Mac and Cheese fritters where about as one would expect...lightly breaded balls of cheesy goodness, fried and served with a warm cheese sauce. The place was hopping with a fairly young crowd enjoying the music. Will have to venture back to try dining in the main room...menu looked good.
