Y-hmtitiRfg7vmc3N-lTww 1st time there tonight after 5 years of being in town. It was recommended by a friend at work.  Can't beat their summer specials. Today was the pizza and a bottle of wine for $20!!! The pizza like my 7 year old son said " was out of this world"! He's quite the foodie!  Service was excellent! Overall, very satisfied.  We will make this our weekly stop from now on!
