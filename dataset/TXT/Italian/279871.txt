It is a slice of Las Vegas history for sure. Definitely I did not love it as much as others who have told me to go but...I get it. It is fun, funky and cheap (by strip standards)

Pros 
- Funky, mafia style interior, complete with 4 prong phone jacks by the booth! You never know when you may get a landline call while dining out.
- Garlic Bread! OMG!! If I could have taken my shirt off and rubbed my nipples with it I could have! But I was dressed up, and did not want to be greasy at the theater.
-Service, fast, friendly and efficient
-The end of the meal, sweet and spicy, coffee whipped creamy thing they serve. HELL YES!

Cons
-The food is bland and SOULESS. That is all I need to say about that, without sounding like a whiney bitch. 

That is my take on Battista's Hole....in da'wall.
