8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA This place is a piece of home!! Originally from Chicago, my fiancé and I have been trying to find a good pizza place out in Las Vegas.  We have had no luck until we decided to try this place.  Their large cheese pizza, extra well done with extra sauce tastes just like the pizza we love from back home.  It is just the right amount of thin (not too thin like NY Style) but not too think like regular pizza.  Also they cut the pizza into squares like the neighborhood joints do.  The best.  The pizza is slightly more expensive than it should be.  For example, we could get a 18" pizza with 3 toppings for $16.00 from the north side of Chicago.  Not sure why this is a little more expensive.  But overall, best Chicago style pizza I've had in Las Vegas.  If it weren't so far from my home, I'd go again.
