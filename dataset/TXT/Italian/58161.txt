ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg We started off with the meat and cheese board for an appetizer. A great value for $13. For our entrees we ordered the caprese salad in a whole wheat bread bowl, the chicken Caesar salad in an Italian bread bowl and the kids split the Penne alla Vodka. Everything was delicious, although the portions seemed a bit smaller from our previous visit. The place was empty. We were the only table of patrons along with a few people sitting at the bar, but our service was exceptional. Would like to try their pizza next time. 

We were talking to the manager about the new location coming to downtown Chandler next spring. It will be a two story restaurant with a "speak easy" lower level. Sounds pretty sweet!
