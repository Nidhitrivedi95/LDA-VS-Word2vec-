k9AaulyfonmUlkmI3uMiQQ This is my favorite restaurant in Little Italy.  The patio is warm and inviting and the inside decor is very nice.  I LOVE the mussels!!!  I usually will have a pasta, but I will try whatever seems to appeal to my taste buds.  This is a "must visit" whenever I am in town and I can't wait to eat here again in the near future.
