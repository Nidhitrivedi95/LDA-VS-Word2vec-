OZqAZkjhV_nyHsbnKaD1WQ I will be the first one to admit that this place would have gotten 5 stars when I first went there 7 years ago.

I went there with a bunch of other Yelpers Thursday...so there were about 20 of us...so this is going to be more about the food then anything else.  I am not going to rate the service, though our waiter, Guy, did a good job considering the large group.  Really couldn't complain about that.

I wasn't a big fan of the wine...but that definitely could have been my fault.  (I have been told in the past that my taste in wine can be better)   Sarah G and I shared the Calamari...which I thought was very full of flavor and cook just right.  The Potato soup was ok...a little too watery for my taste.  I loved the salad especially the house dressing.  I think that was the best part of the meal.  Of course by the time I got my main course, I was full.  But I did eat all of my veggies and half of my chicken (which said it came with lemon butter sauce...but that sauce was not lemony and it had mushrooms on it...which this chicken dish was not supposed to have...oh well.)  I did try Gabi's Sea Bass...now that was yummy!

5 stars though for the awesome company!!!!
