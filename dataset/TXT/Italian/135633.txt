iwzVhM5CirzkNS5wTxwZeA Yesterday was my birthday and I was looking forward to trying The Strand. My girlfriend heard from many of her friends that this place has the best Italian food around. We arrived at 8:42 pm in which the hostess told us they were closing in 15 minutes. I was ok with that and told her to seat us still in which they don't close till 9. The hostess then proceed to tell us they were on a limited menu until they close. I asked her why in which we are paying customers. My girlfriend and I decided we didn't feel welcomed at The Strand so we left.

This is when the manager or hostess went crazy. When we were outside talking about how rude she was, she came out and started being very defensive. We explained to her if the sign says 9 then stay open till 9 serving guests. She kept making excuses that the staff wanted to go home. I told her to close at 8:30 then. She then said "Come on in then, you get what you wanted." She was screaming this in a very defensive manner in which we felt threatened.

My girlfriend and I both work in the customer service industry. I have stayed open later just to make that customer happy. That's part of the job. For the lady that treated us with so much disrespect, she shouldn't work anywhere around people with those customer service skills.
