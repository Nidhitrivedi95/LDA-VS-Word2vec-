If you're in the mood for something light, go with the chicken caesar salad. If you want something that's going to fill you up, order the sausage, green pepper, and onion sandwich, or their chicken parmigiana sandwich with garlic fries. They're both spectacular, and even better when paired with a garlic knot (or a full order of three). 

Hands down this is the best family-owned and operated restaurant in walking distance from UNLV.
