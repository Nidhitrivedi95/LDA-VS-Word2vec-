aal0SiXVRmUoM20A1m7xDw I didn't know what to expect when coming to A n' A for a drink.  I was actually impressed, it was smaller inside than I anticipated, but felt like an intimate place to grab a drink or bite to eat.  I liked the decor - it just made me feel comfy.  

I had the Circus Boy Magic Hat bottle.  It was really good - I like hops and wheat beer and this was a great combo of both.  

The waitress was very friendly and it wasn't overly crowded for a Friday night.  While we didn't order food here, the waitress mentioned that their Shepherd's pie is a big hit.  

I would come here again and this time try out the food.
