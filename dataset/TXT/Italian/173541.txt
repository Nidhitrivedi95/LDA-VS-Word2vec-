N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg I've been to this restaurant twice now and have been very satisfied with the food.  Three drawbacks:  1.  The wait time no matter what you order.  They try to alleviate this issue by having you order before sitting down at your table.  The food is excellent.  2.  The prices are a little high for pizza, especially if you get the thin crust.  3.  The last thing is the noise.  Very difficult to hold a conversation at your table.
