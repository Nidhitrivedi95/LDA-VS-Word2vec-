OZqAZkjhV_nyHsbnKaD1WQ Truly impressed! We got fried calamari that was crispy and fresh, stuffed mushrooms were buttery and not too crabby. Between 4 of us, we all shared each other's food. I loved the tortellini the most. Veal was a delicious and a nice cut too. Calamari at dinner was just as yummy, not chewy, and fresh! Shrimp scampi was a hit too! 
Every meal is served with soup and salad. I believe the dressing and soup changes often. I liked them, didn't love them, but everything is homemade and tastes that way. 
We ended the night with a nutmegy strawberry cheesecake and the limoncello cake.  I prefer the cake :)
I left extremely happy and stuffed. 
This is where you go for good homemade Italian food with love, and waiters that are good at their jobs. It seems other reviewers didn't enjoy themselves, and I would blame their expectations. It IS mom and pop, and it's amazing!
