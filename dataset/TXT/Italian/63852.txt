bchksAMD4CtI98_s_kJNpg Had the Sunday brunch..think it is new....really great food, everything but the kind of uncooked potatoes...but french toast was the bomb, lemon pancakes superb, the meats are top-notch, so if we hadn't ordered the potatoes I believe I'd have given a 5 star rating. Try this place!! Support a French restaurant in Cleveland Heights!
