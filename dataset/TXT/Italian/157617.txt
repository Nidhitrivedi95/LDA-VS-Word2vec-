Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA I was at the cafe side of this restaurant. The "breakfast sandwiches" were pre-made and disgusting. It was a stuffed croissant filled with mostly cheese and scrambled eggs (not very much) and chunks of ham. I don't like ham, but there was no other choice if I wanted eggs, which is usually what people get with their breakfast. I could only eat half of it and had to toss it.
