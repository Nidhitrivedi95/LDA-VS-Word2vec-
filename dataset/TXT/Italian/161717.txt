LMdUoR00jPxQDWLYRq93FA This is a charming place, off the beaten path, on what appears to be a large grassy yard/farm. DONT wear high heels, you might break a leg.  The food was overall good, but I wasnt THAT impressed. Our waiter was knowledgable but a little thrown off as he was training some young gal that appeared to have never waitressed before-  He seemed irritated. We started with the charcuterie plate...it was ok, but headcheese on toast points and pickled onions wasnt my cup pf tea. My friend ordered a salad but it never came and our waiter suggested it would have been too much food anyway, lol!
 I had roasted squab with carrot puree and my friend had beet ravioli. Both were good,nothing special. 
The goatcheese & pear tart was delicious, the chocolate cake/beet mousse was not. The front sunroom part of this restaurant, although has a nice window view, was very loud. 
Love the idea of a fresh daily menu and perhaps we arrived on an "off" day...but for $250 (2), I expected more.
