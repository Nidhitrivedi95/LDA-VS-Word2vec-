Last week I made the mistake of suggesting this place to a co-worker.  She paid $9.95 to receive 5 under seasoned & over-fried chicken fingers.  She paid an additional cost for greasy fries and a soda with.  When she asked for ranch dressing, the staff huddled together to decide whether or not they were going to provide it.  She's still upset with me.
