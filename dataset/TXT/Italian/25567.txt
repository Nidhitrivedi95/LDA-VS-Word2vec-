I met the owner who kept on bringing micro brews since I told him about my love affair with hand made craft beers. Waitress was sweet and had vast knowledge of beer as well. The food was amazing. My wife and I both had seafood lasagna my kid had the margarita pizza. Both were great! To end the night we got desert the cream brûlée and Tara misuse and again both recommended. Dive bar atmosphere but great food and service! Check it out l
