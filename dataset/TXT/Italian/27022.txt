4qQVf2lt-47VcQ4v54PEXQ I checked this place out based on reviews online. Did not disappoint...tremendous flavor from the first bite; the calzone with sausage, peppers and onions was magnificent. The pizza gets rave reviews. Crust just right - not too doughy, not too thin. Also the special of the day; sausage, tomato, white wine, lavender, peas and marinara over pasta. The bread was a little disappointing after reading rave reviews.  But the crusts on the pie and calzones were home runs.  Claudio, the owner, (Born in Palermo, raised in Bensonhurst) was hands on (literally, coming out to serve pizza at one point). This is a place that should not be missed.  That coming from a New Yorker who takes food seriously (especially pizza!). Bravo, Claudio! BYOB for a small charge.
