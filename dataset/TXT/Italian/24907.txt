4gXdyihRiytmXEAfqLNMBw Lovely little local joint in Surprise, with a quaint atmosphere, excellent service (thanks Alex!), and superb food!  Wholly recommend this fabulous eatery! 

Spicy Alfredo Italian Sausage Pasta w/ an added Meatball: the pasta was perfectly al dente, the meatball was a bit "tight" (it should have fallen apart, but was a bit too firm), and the sauce was just enough spicy for a good zing... the only downer was the sauce-to-pasta ratio was off: too much sauce, not enough pasta. Still superb! 

Creamy Garlic Chicken Pasta: the pasta (again) was perfectly al dente, the chicken was moist and delicious, and the sauce was rich and creamy, with just enough garlic to make it pop.  Again the only downer was the sauce-to-pasta ratio was off: too much sauce, not enough pasta. Still delightful!

Bread: so many yelp reviews show the bread being the best thing on the menu, and while my fella thought the bread was out of this world, I just felt that it was mediocre at best.  

The Big Baked Babbo Pizza Cookie (chocolate chip): the flavor was divine; however, it wasn't cooked all the way through. Now, some folk enjoy that gooey cookie flavor, and while I do enjoy gooeyness, this was a bit much. There was just a bit too much cookie that was only half-cooked.
