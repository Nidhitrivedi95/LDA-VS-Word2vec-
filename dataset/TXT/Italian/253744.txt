VtiHtLI2t0OjFjbrnR70lw great location, great look. Servers could be better trained (had to ask for a second round of drinks...how often does that happen?). Food was interesting but a little bland. Tried several appetizers, vegetable plank, crispy squid, olives on ice...good not great. Also tried the fungi misto pizza and the spicy meatball pizza. Pizza was excellent, meatballs were not really spicy, but the sauce was terrific. Biggest disappointment was the "crispy music bread". Great story but v v v v bland taste.
