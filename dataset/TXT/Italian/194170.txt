PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ Off the hook should be the name...the service is so cool, the family style dinner concept with no menu is great, the passion the owner had for the business is apparent. 7 course meal, dessert hmmm great cheesecake!!!  Good wine selection, best place I've had the pleasure to eat at in Vegas, and I've hit a few great spots,
