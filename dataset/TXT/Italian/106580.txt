FTVDICd-uxoEGYh4pU0pcw Great pizza!!! I love the taste! The quality is great from the sauce to the crust!! Their pepperoni pizza is very delicious!!! I grew up in NJ and I'm very picky when it comes to good pizza. I approve this spot, and I'm thankful they're close by. The service is also always great and everyone has been really friendly! This is first on my list for places to tell my friends where to go for great pizza!! 5 stars!!!!!
