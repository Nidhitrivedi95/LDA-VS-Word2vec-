VsHhy9ixEze-AxNYt6UxLA Wow about sums it up! Found this restaurant off Yelp and it was not a disappointment! The food was absolutely amazing. There were 8 of us and there was not a bad meal. Every time something came out it got an ooo and aww from all of us in unison. From the Meat and Cheese platter to the calamari to the cheese knots, ravioli with lobster cream sauce to the manicotti, to the eggplant rolltini to the cheese cake to the cannoli....well you get the picture. It was all amazing!! And the service was 5 star! They were attentive and couldn't have been nicer. And finally Ian our waiter was wonderful! Made us feel welcome and like part of the family even though we were from California. All I have to say in closing is Ian and the restaurant has made #loyalcrustomer out of us!!!!! We will be back.
