Plus when we order multiple orders from work, they have no problems with it and are still fast. Not to mention when I asked if you could put cheese on the fries they were able to do it, it's so good. The burgers got bigger and they now have an option to choose how you want it cooked! Highly recommend. Great munchies food.
