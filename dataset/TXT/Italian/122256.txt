hgQOESYp7CF4LnNI90XEiw Staff was friendly and helpful.  As for the pizza itself, meh. Saw a review stating they were too thin in the middle and my husband and I both agree about that opinion. We both chose the margherita base, minus the basil for my hubby, he needn't have bothered as mine had all of 2 leaves. Where the dough was thicker it was really good, however the middle is so soggy I gave up after 3 slices. My hubby ate a couple of mine but the crust was so burnt that's really all I tasted. It's too bad, I really wanted to love this place. At $36 for our whole  meal, 2 pies, a soda, tap water and a glass of tap wine it's not a bad deal. Just really wanted my lunch to taste better. Our pies were cooked together and my husbands crust wasn't  burnt.
