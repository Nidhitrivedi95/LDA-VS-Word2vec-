6okGKL2PA7kkc-GjZzNHnA Went here for restaurant week. What can I say? It's a steakhouse. I got a New York Strip and ordered it medium-rare, and got it back very, very rare. This is a going theme with steakhouses it seems, so whatever. I could have sent it back but we didn't have a lot of time.

Music was turned up a tad loud, so it wasn't as relaxing as I would have hoped, and while our server was very nice, she seemed a bit rushed.

Everything else was nice. The Banana cheesecake I got was superb. Get it.
