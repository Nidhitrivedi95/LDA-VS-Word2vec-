q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ One of my boys told me about this spot when he visited Vegas and said to check it out but would not give me details.  I was like okayyyyyyyyy pretty strange. This place is cool and very different! It's definitely not just your typical restaurant based on theme and originality.  It super quiet on the outside of the building on a near creepy level lol .
Soooo before you enter you see a sign that says "Ring the door bell for entrance". which we  did because we were hungry lol. Then a few seconds later, a small peek window behind a photo frame opened and this dudes face pokes out asking pass word questions in order to enter the business. LOL  At first i was like WTF !!! lol but It was a pretty cool way to be unique and give you that Mobster feel. (I thought I was John Gotti for a second) LOL After that he opened a hidden door and it is pretty dark in there and looks pretty old school yet comfy with nicely set tables and booths.

Customer Service was great and they made you feel at home. The food is amazing and flavorful with authentic and perfect seasoning.  I am chicken parm addict and my sandwich was made to perfection and french fries were amazing !!!!! They had some of the most unique Mob names for dishes that were really creative and funny to me. I loved it !!! I will definitely be back when visiting Vegas to try more on the menu for sure. 

My only negative was that the dim setting after while was kind of rough on the eyes when sitting in it for a long period of time but other than that great experience !!!
