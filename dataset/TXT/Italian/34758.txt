6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA Absolutely loved this place. Tried the Linguine Shrimp & Scallop with some type of spicy cod roll with it. It was very good. Also had the balsamic soft shell crab but I think they forgot the balsamic as it seemed the crab was in a buttery garlic sauce. Also had the fried oysters. They were good as well but the tartar sauce they serve with them was so bland it needed a bit of seasoning. Also ordered the Seafood Pescator which was excellent as well. Looking forward to going back & trying other dishes. Waitstaff was very helpful with menu as it had been our first time there. 4 stars since the tartar sauce & soft shell crab was a bit off.
