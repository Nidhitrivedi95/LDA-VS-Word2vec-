iqntlaqSCB4hkzTzlPlEmQ I've been here twice and the food is just amazing. While their salt encrusted NY Strip might've been the best one I've ever had, and I've been to tons of high end restaurants. I'd consider their steak legendary, because it could just as well be a subject of legends. Bravo is very reasonably priced and everything I've had so far was top notch. Very glad I found this place, just not sure if the 5-star reviews aren't going to make me wait longer next time.
