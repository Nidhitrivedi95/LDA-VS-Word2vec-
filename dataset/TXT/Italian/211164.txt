qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ Great service and awesome food! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was for the wait time and I can't speak to this being a regular thing so I can't say this is typical.  It is definitely worth a try to experience it yourself.  I will say this was one of my best customer experiences restaurant wise in the last six months.
