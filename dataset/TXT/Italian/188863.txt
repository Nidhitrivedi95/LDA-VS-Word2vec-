OXrFWgoz533T8tMRemkiww We live close by and wanted to check this place out. Nothing was overly amazing but the food was decent. Decor is your typical Tuscan style and the wood fire oven is interesting to watch. 

I had one of the veal dishes which reminded me a lot of Chicken Marsala and cost $28. There were no sides, salad and even bread to go with the meal but the size of my portion was ok. The only issue I had, besides the high cost, was that my meal had no surprises.  It was a very simple dish and for $28 I would expect something more complex. The sauce was everywhere, overpowering the cheese, prosciutto and mushrooms and there was nothing to counter it. A vegetable or anything would have improved the meal and helped me get through the overwhelming taste of the sauce.  

My husband had the lasagna which was very good but cost $19 and I know it did not fill him up. Again it was simple in design and we were expecting something more coming from an Italian background.  Maybe my family is full of over-achievers, so my opinion may be harsh but for the type of food they are creating the price is outrageous. 

If prices were lower my review would be higher and I say this with years of dining experience in Mt. Lebanon. For the same amount you would be better of going next door to Bistro 19, one of the upscale restaurants in the area. In my opinion, they have a far better menu, it is creative, hearty and the atmosphere is trendy. We went there this summer and I loved everything about the place. Even though it's on the expensive side, Bistro 19 is definitely worth it.
