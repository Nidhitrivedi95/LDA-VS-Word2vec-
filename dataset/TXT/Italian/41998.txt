7PRse3yCQbEprAj1DWrEQQ Visted last night with close friends for our annual holiday night out. All agreed it was the best experience we have had in Pittsburgh! Every aspect from the service to the food was spot on. Best way to judge a meal is by the empty plates / bowls following each of our appetizers, main course and desserts. We plan to visit again!
