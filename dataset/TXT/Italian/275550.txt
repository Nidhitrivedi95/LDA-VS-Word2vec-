yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg HORRIBLE service. I ordered gluten free spaghetti because I have a sensitivity to gluten and repeated multiple times that I wanted spaghetti and not ziti. They said of course. Then, then brought me ziti. I asked them if they could please take it back and give me spaghetti. They said no there was nothing they could do and were extremely rude. They would not take it off our bill even though I would not eat it. would never eat here again or recommend to anyone!!! Don't eat here.
