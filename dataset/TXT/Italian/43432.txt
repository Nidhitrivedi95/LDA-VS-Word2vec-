Customer service was amazing, the bartenders were super friendly and helpful in deciding what to order. We were so entertained by the way their wines are setup and the different temperatures they were stored at. We ended up getting a bottle of wine so not sure how the cocktails are. 
Food: we got a salad and pizza and everything was absolutely delicious and fresh. 
I would definitely come back here for happy hour to check out the menu, and for dinner.
