FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Just go here, sit at the bar while you wait, and enjoy the wine and the ambiance. 

Last night we had a group of four friends and we were sat in about 15 minutes, which if you've been here on a Saturday night, is a true stroke of good luck. We ordered bruschetta (do the Brie, Pruscuttio, and Fig) and 2 bottles of the Perfket Riesling, and of course everything was outstanding. 


As far as a wine bar with an intimate patio setting, you can not find anything better than this spot.
