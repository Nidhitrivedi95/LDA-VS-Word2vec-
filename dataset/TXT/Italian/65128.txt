BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA Just an incredible dinner - my hubby and I had the roasted calamari - yum - then had the mussels with fresh tomatoes and crazy good broth with warm toast for dipping - Yes!  Our server, Heather, was incredible!  Great sense of humor - super making recommendations.  My husband's dinner was a pasta with chicken where he substituted red sauce for a creamy sauce.  Drinks fabulous. Definitely be back!
