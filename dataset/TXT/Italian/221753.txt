SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg Perfect date spot - just be sure to make reservations and ask for a table with a view of the Fountains at Bellagio!

My husband and I ate here during the week on a recent trip to Vegas, making reservations about one day in advance for a late dinner.  The view of the Fountains during our meal was spectacular - I would recommend asking for a table up front towards the windows or on the patio for the best of the best.

The service was nice, but not as personalized or as steady as we expected.  Our server forgot to put in our appetizer and salad orders, and was slow to bring drinks from the bar, but overall he was polite and knew his way around the menu.

We had the Bruschetta as an appetizer, and it had a nice little kick to it from the garlic oil, then had the minestrone soup and the Ceasar salad as our next course.  The minestrone was extremely light but flavorful, and the Ceasar salad was crisp and nicely dressed - having those two dishes for lunch would definitely be a great idea!

We stuck to traditional favorites for our entrees, and the lasagna (not sure they have it every night), and the pappardelle did not disappoint.  Both were filling and you could really taste how fresh the pasta was.  I would recommend either one if you are going to have a multi-course meal, because even with all of that food, we still had room to try their gelato and maybe an extra martini or two. 

Overall, the beautiful atmosphere and view of the Fountains is probably enough to make us go back to Lago again (it truly is one of the most romantic restaurants we have been to in awhile in Vegas!), but it's the fact that the food is so fresh and so delicious that makes us want to recommend this restaurant to others as one of our new favorites in Vegas.

Cheers!
