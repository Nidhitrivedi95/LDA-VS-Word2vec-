r_KDxVcTZVEigYepnoJ6Lw Visually, the restaurant is pretty unassuming. Inside it has the classic decor of a local Italian dive with checkered tablecloths.

From the start the waiter was talkative and friendly, offering us dishes not on the menu. When he mistakenly described the special as also coming with king prawns he promised that he could have it made that way especially for us. The chef also stopped by the table a couple of times to joke with us and ask how the meal was going.

I was tempted by the pasta + wine special for £7.90, but I couldn't resist the Seafood Stew based on Blythe's recommendation. The stew was overflowing with fresh mussels and fish for £15. I'm not a big fan of salmon, so I was pleased that the stew had a rich variety of flavors, including a nicely smoked whitefish. The broth was tasty, but when I went to sop it up with the accompanying bread I was disappointed. The bread fell apart in my hands and had a wholegrain taste that didn't match the rest of the food.

For dessert I tried the Tiramisu and Banoffee pie. Both were fine, but nothing exciting.
