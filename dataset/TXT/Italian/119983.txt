H3cMcV9KK3g2pi68lDNsng If you are looking for delicious food and great service, this is the place to go.  Even though they were very busy with happy hour, we got seated quickly in the dining room this past Tuesday evening (which I preferred because I was having dinner with friends I had not seen in many months, and we needed a quiet area so we could hear each other talk).   The grilled acorn squash small plate was to DIE FOR!!!  My main entree, the butternut squash ravioli, was also incredibly delicious.    Our waitress was wonderful and checked in on us frequently but not so much that it was intrusive.  We had a wonderful evening with fantastic food and warm ambiance.  I highly recommend dining here--well worth your time and money.
