nOkSC1GtMUJ_I70sb0SaeQ Uh....no. Yelped pizza near me and this place came up. Had a $20 for $40 deal in the Yelp app along with pretty good reviews. googled the place an ordered online. Guy behind the counter REFUSED to honor the Yelp deal because I ordered thru 3rd party website. WTH?!?  then says he doesn't have a website. Then what's pizzanatali.net?  and why when you go to that website does it have a see the menu and order online button?  Beyond that silliness the pizza was average, too much sauce. Wings were good though. Place was dirty inside. Dust everywhere, even on front counter. Won't go again.
