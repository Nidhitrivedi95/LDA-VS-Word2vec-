FfF8XGFf8_BSlWSjIgqeQg Visited twice during opening week with a friend. Unfortunately, the vegan menu options were scarce (to be expected when dining at an Italian restaurant) but there were a few options for vegetarians.

We were huge fans of the avacado & goat cheese bruschetta and the focaccia crostini served with the spinach & artichoke dip was absolutely delicious.

Also, huge thumbs up for being the only restaurant I've come across to charge me $2 less for my entree after removing the chicken. Why don't more restaurants do this? 

My only complaint (and this is a big one) was the overwhelming amount of hovering and interrupting from the staff. My friend and I were interrupted several times by both staff and management, each time mid-sentence, to see how we were doing. Normally I would appreciate an attentive server, but this was simply irritating as we barely had a chance to lift our forks to our mouths for our first bite before being asked what we thought of the food.
