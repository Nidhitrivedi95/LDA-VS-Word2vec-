8J55FMsOXei4Xh1jHSpElw I love this place, I come to this location about once a month and I love it! It's priced great and has a great atmosphere to just hang out at. I went there yesterday and my bread roll was very hard which is REALLY unusual, so I asked to get another one. I wasn't trying to make a big deal out of it or anything but the kitchen manager baked all new rolls and brought them to my friend and I and was EXTREMELY apologetic which wasn't necessary but greatly appreciated. He also mentioned that he threw away the entire previous batch, they really go out of their way to make you happy there. I'll be coming back for years to come.
