cMrCi3nAcBi3aUKDRAySiw After the Yelp event at Laide, I wandered up this way to get some dinner to go with those delicious martinis - and Big Mamma's Boy was it!  We had the pulled pork sandwiches and a pizza with artichoke hearts, grilled chicken, sundried tomatos and goat cheese.

The good:
- it was a very entertaining experience
- pitchers of beer are called 'jugs'
- they are open late

The bad:
- everything else... the Food was pretty bad...
- the Pizza crust was flavourless, the toppings were dry and didn't seem fresh, the pulled pork was actually okay.

The weird-and-scary:
The woman who was running the show here... I swear to God that she asked me for money on Church one night, and I gave her $5 because it was raining.  Then she offered to walk me to the streetcar stop, which she did, while talking to me/herself about some conspiracy, and then suddenly... she was GONE, having disappeared into a dark parking lot/alley of some sorts.  I swear that it was her working here and I think she recognized me. 

Will I go here again?
No.  Just... No.  Well... maybe for psychic brunch.
