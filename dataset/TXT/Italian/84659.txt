DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA A little pricy but I was very content with the quality of the food I ordered (the pear salad). The food was actually tasty: the pear added a smooth alternate to the usual apple I have with a salad. The dressing was excellent and I believe there was a drizzle of chocolate. Unusual, but tasty. 

The portion size seemed approximate to what you'd expect for lunch. The delivery time was appropriately speedy. It was a salad with no cooked parts, but they did well with respect to that. The presentation was appetizing. 

Sammy did bring by a pizza which Gordon famously criticized. Sammy announced that it looked great, which is a little unusual, but the fact he said it make the experience a little more surreal (omg that's where Gordon sat! There's the register! Etc). He acted as host and delivered the check (a waitress took our order and delivered the food). 

I tipped 10$, hoping that it found the appropriate home (I am usually generous with my tipping anyway). 

Overall, the "experience" of what happened on the show still kind of exists, but the food we ordered was pretty tasty and passed the tests of my layman taste buds. 

I'd return again.
