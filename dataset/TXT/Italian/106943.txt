So I decided to go on a whim and trust the reviews for this place on Yelp and I was excited to try it out. I made the mistake of not making reservations for many of the better (Keyword) and newer restaurants in Toronto. We wanted to stay downtown and this is was one of the only places that we could get a reservation a few hours notice. A+ for that.

When we arrived at Kit Kat, we were slightly confused on where to stand to ask someone about our reservation. What seemed to be the owner, came up and asked us if we had a reservation, I replied with yes and was then told to go to the bar, which I had thought that we were already standing at. 10-15 minutes later, we had a seat in the back where it was slightly close quarters as most places can be in Toronto. 

We ordered some house red and white wine which was nice and refreshing on a warmer day. The anti-pasto for two and was a huge disappointment. in how little meat/cheese we received and how much veggies came with it. It almost felt like something you would buy at Metro or Sobey's. Next came our main. We both ordered the special which was a seafood pasta which was nice, a lot of fish (clam, shrimp). 

Our waitress was pretty funny/expressionless which added some comedic value to the meal. For the price, it reminds me of an upscale east side mario's and I can't say I would go back.
