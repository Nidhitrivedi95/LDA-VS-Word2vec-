CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA First experience, I wasn't particularly impressed. It's okay, plain and simple. It can be a bit greasy at times. I always get the pizza when I go there, I have no problem with it. It's not the best nor the worst I've ever had. 

The customer service is usually pretty quick, never had to wait more than a few minutes if there's a line.
