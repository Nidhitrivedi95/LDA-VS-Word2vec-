h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ The service was so slow - ridiculous!  The food was just 'meh'...it tasted like reheated frozen items.  Greasy, soggy calamari, chewy chicken.  I had looked on their website prior to coming for dinner and they offer a dessert if you leave them a review...not worth waiting another 45 minutes to get a dessert, escpecially since no one cared about the poor service and food when I was dining there!  They are just trying to 'pay' for reviews!
