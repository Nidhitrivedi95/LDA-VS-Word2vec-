Oi2k3en1Ip-D0n_jfGbvIQ Nice ambience and decor. Food was good. We tried a couple of their pasta dishes (Fusilli Artigiani and Rigatoni with sausage) and both were good as was the Pizza Quattro Formaggi. It had a nice thin crust. The portions were perfect.
The pear and cheese salad was good except for the 
walnuts that tasted rather old. The only other 'negative' was that the bread was brought out just before the food, it was cold and the spicy oil was brought out well after the bread had been eaten..poor timing on the server's part.  The restaurant was rather busy and perhaps it was just an 'off' night.  I will recommend this restaurant to friends that will be in town soon.
