k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ To the Parlor...you wow me. Just love you! Folks, if you haven't gone here, first of all, holy crap--why not? Second of all, the ambiance is one of those cool, organic  places that makes you feel both hip and sophisticated. It's pretty small, and even though it's right off of Camelback, you'd drive right past it if you didn't know what to look for. Apparently it actually was a beauty parlor at one time (thus the name), and the original architecture reflects that. The food is phenomenal. Salads to pizzas to burgers. Soo tasty. Happy hour prices are decent. Be forewarned that this is a popular spot, so if you go at lunch, make it earlier or later than usual. Both indoor and outdoor seating available. A cozy bar. And a small vegetable garden borders the entrance as you walk in. I've been here many times and never been disappointed. Go! Go now!
