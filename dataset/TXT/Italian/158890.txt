LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA I have been here many times, and each time I have been impressed with the restaurant and all it has to offer. The food here is fantastic - I highly recommend the flat breads or caesar salad for an appetizer. Also, you are missing out if you do not order the four cheese ravioli. If you come to the restaurant with a large group, they have a great family style option. However, this option is ONLY AVAILABLE for groups of four or over. Do not waste your calories/money if your group is smaller than this - it is not worth it, and you will have to take food home.
