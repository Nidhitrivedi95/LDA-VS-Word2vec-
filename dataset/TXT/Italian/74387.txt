cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q Family favorite. I love their salad and chicken Gnocchi Soup.  I am also reviewing this restaurant because they have recently added some low price options so you can get a full meal of their favorites like their Lasagna with unlimited soup or salad for 10.99.    This particular location is always clean, friendly, with great service!  Also, their Kids menu allows the kids to pick what they want on their pasta which usually ends with my daughter getting shrimp with angel hair.  Much better than the other kids menus at other places that don't offer anything creative for the kids and just give plain pasta or pasta with meatballs.
