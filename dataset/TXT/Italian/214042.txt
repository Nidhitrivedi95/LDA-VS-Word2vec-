rBTlmcEEQka-7cdU6ByrYg Fabulous find for pizza delivery!!!! We ordered the Maya Special, Veggie Explosion, and a pepperoni-black olive-mushroom pizza, as well as french fries and onion rings.  Everything was fantastic!  I have to admit, it wasn't the big greasy pizza we normally associate with "ny" pizza--which turned out to be a good thing!  The crust is thin and crisp and the pizzas weren't greasy at all.  We actually feel good after eating it, rather than heavy and weighed down.  This is pizza as it should be!!!!  The pizzas bursted with flavor from the fresh ingredients!!!  I wasn't expecting the Maya Special to be so flavorful, since there's no sauce, but I was pleasantly surprised!!!!  The onion rings are superb and even the french fries had wonderful flavor.  We will definitely be ordering again!!!!  This is our new favorite place!!!!
