KPKQLzVKqLgEPKOWrSCRtg I haven't dined in in years so I can't speak to the service or ambience at the restaurant. I have got their delivery through UberEats, and anywhere that will deliver both hot wedding soup and a frozen, old fashioned pecan ball in less than 30 min gets some stars in my book..We were not overly impressed with the Italian entrees for the price. Since they do have a varied menu, next time I would like to try sandwiches or entree salads.
