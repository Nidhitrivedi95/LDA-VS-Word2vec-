We walked past a young man shoveling the remains of the front window of the old Evermore Nevermore building into a wastebasket. We asked the caretaker if they were expanding into the adjacent building and if they were going to keep the mural that adorned the wall, he said yes they were expanding and didn't know about the mural as he shoveled the last of the earthly remains of the venerable Evermore Nevermore away to their final grave. 

We walked in through the door and soaked in the brightly colored decor, the smell of fresh dough being baked to a thin perfection that middle aged soccer mom's can only dream of. 

The staff greeted us exactly like the regulars that we are not. This ensures our continued visits to the brick walled abode of pizza goodness. 

The pizza was cheap, but tasted like a million bucks.
