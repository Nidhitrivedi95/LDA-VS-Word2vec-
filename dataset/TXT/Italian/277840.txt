YJS7cXGLAvWw9DUDXpw84Q Came here one evening for dinner to try out their spaghetti & meatballs special. I liked the look of the restaurant - pretty modern for an Italian restaurant. We started off with toasted ravioli which I really liked. The foccaccia that they bring out is also really good. I mulled over the menu for a bit and considered getting something else but I thought - when in Rome. So I got the spaghetti & meatballs and it was nothing better than what I could have made at home. Now, if they used the same marinara they used with the toasted ravioli for the spaghetti, they would have been on point. I'm not sure if that one dish is reflective of their entire menu, but I don't know how soon I'll be coming back to try them out.
