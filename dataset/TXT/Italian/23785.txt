3yMmo1sERpks50quoaA8PQ This restaurant is ok. The house salad was a handful of romaine lettuce with some shredded cheese in the middle. No tomatoes, no onions nothing. Weird. The bread is not bad  It's thick slices of  french bread lightly toasted with garlic and butter.  I ordered chicken Marsala as I do nearly everywhere we eat Italian food. This one was nothing to write home about. I would say it's above average but not worth it for the price. My kids ordered Fettuccine Alfredo and it was phenomenal, but then, how hard is it to make that dish? My husband ordered the special they were having that night and was disappointed when it came out. The server had obviously not fully understood what went into the dish and therefor was not able to convey that to the customer (us).
 I think this place is way way too expensive especially for being in a rundown strip mall. Some of the reviews spoke about a long wait etc... call ahead and make reservations. You will get right in.
