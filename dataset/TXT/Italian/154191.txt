kz7O0_o6WrDQk1Kl8dKeHQ I'll be honest, I originally learned about this place because I saw a cute Instagram post of their "What else is possible..." mural outside. However, after checking out their menu, I knew I wanted to stop-in for their food too. We went on a Saturday around 3:30pm and sat on the patio since the weather was beautiful. At that time, they were offering their dinner menu. 

Chicken wings: Absolutely fantastic! The chicken was fried to perfection but not greasy. While the menu says it's a BBQ sauce, I would consider it more of a hot sauce base since it's spicy and vinegary. You get 3 large wings... the 3 largest wings I've ever seen.

Beef pot roast: Melt in your mouth deliciousness. The mashed potatoes were also really good. The portion is very generous, I could only eat half before I was about to go into a foodcoma. 

Fried chicken sandwich: I had a bite and it was just as good as the chicken wings. Again, the chicken was fried perfectly so that it was crispy but not greasy. My BF said it was the best chicken sandwich he's ever had! The fries were also really good, I definitely stole my fair share.

This is definitely a place I would love to come back to, especially for brunch since their brunch menu looks really good. Definitely check this place out, especially if you like craft cocktails... you won't be disappointed!
