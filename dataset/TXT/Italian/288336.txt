zpIybGTZ0RqArG8BOX0ALQ Pretty standard Italian-American joint. You know the drill.

I had the linguine pescatore with marinara sauce. The seafood was plenty and fresh. The marinara sauce was not bad, and the pasta was cooked properly al dente. I also had a salad with bleu cheese dressing (GREAT dressing) and a french onion soup, which was also yummy.

The food was good, but I felt Franco's was extremely overpriced. I spent about the same amount here as I normally do at Dish in the Southside, which has some of the best, most authentic Italian food I've had in the States. Bottom line is I don't think it's worth paying $40+ for a meal I could easily make myself.
