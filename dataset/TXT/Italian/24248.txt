Greeted immediately by the bartender, who layed out placements, roll-ups, water, and menus.  

Glanced over the wine lists.  Yikes! pricier than I anticipated off strip.  Glasses ranged from $9 - $23 with the avergae in the $16 range.  Me and hubs were able to find a lovely red blend for $9.

We were served a heaping antipasti plate.  The portion was generous for 2 people!  It included artichoke hearts, crispy salted zucchini chips, roasted red peppers, olives and chunks of parmigian cheese.  Tasty treats.  Definitely a creative departure from the average bread and balsamic.

We decided to share the burrata salad and the tortiglioni pasta.  Moments later, literally, our salad arrived neatly stacked in two small bowls.  What a thoughtful gesture to actually split our items charge free!  The salad had far too many tomatoes...otherwise, it was excellent.  Spicy arugula and micro basil dressed in vinaigretee merely danced around the generous portion of light, creamy, perfectly salty, buffalo mozzarella.  The fresh cheese had an incredible texture as if melted in the cold salad, but clearly not.  Admittedly, I scooped obout 10 tomatoes; the 6 that remained were sufficient!

Before we finished our salad, our pasta arrived...neatly split as well.  The service was too speedy but we were sitting at the bar.  The pasta was a little too al dente; borderline crunchy.  Other than that critique, it was excellent.  A hot, spicy, creamy, well seasoned tomato sauce perfectly coated each noodle along with ground sausage and peas.  They grated fresh parmagian on barside.  

$54 for 2 glasses of wine, a salad, and a pasta.  Not bad at all!  Note: Ordering entrees or other wine could have easily allowed this check to get large! Entrees range from $24 - $48.  Pricey for off strip but fitting for the lovely decor.
