bVTWcZWhtJc4IjWy_74CYQ My husband, daughter and I just came from the Goodyear location.  Was asked if we wanted more bread, which we didn't get. Also, no refills were offered on tea. I noticed our server was stretched thin so I thought "no biggie".  However, my main complaint is based on what I witnessed. We were in a booth within a couple of feet of the wine station. I know a little bit about wine...tend to try and enjoy a wide variety so I am well informed.  A server for another table poured 2 half glasses of the standard merlot Robert Mondovi. then took 2 more glasses and poured just a quarter in each of Cavit merlot.  Im studying her trying to figure out what she was doing.  Then, taking me by surprise, the Cavit wine was poured into the Robert Mondovi glasses, making them full servable portions and then they went to the awaiting patrons.  Im beside myself.  I now question every and any establishment I have ever dined. I am for sure not choosing this particular location again.
