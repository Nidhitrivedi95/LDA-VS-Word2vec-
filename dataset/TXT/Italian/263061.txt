Other friends that I have gone here with have gotten some of their specials and they always look good. They give you big portions.  You won't leave hungry! 

It always amazes me that this place is just a 5-10 minute drive outside of the Charlotte city limit and how "country" it is in comparison. The wait staff never seems to be in any kind of hurry. It may take a while to be greeted after being seated. For me the place always seems a little dirty. The diet coke is flat.  I'd go back for the good diner style food and cheap prices.
