exz9aZqMqjpqzUOFBAl9Gg Yeaaaaaaah... So I've always wondered about this place.  

I'm pretty sure this is a chain.  I know there's one in the West Island and I've driven by it every single time getting on the highway going in a certain direction.  

The pastas are not made in house.  I know because I asked my server.  The pasta isn't even fresh.  It's dry.  Like dry from a package.  I'm not into that.  No one should be into that unless you're at home and desperate.  

We tried the osso buco, pork chop, and veal scallopini (sp?).  Everything was okay... Nothing special.  

It's not a place I would go back to or recommend but if you're basically a suburbanite wanting a nice dining environment, family friendly, and lots of parking, I can see why people come here.
