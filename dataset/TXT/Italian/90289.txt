Ea4ODC2cfqAbDbb_sYdPZQ If you're reading these reviews and thinking surely a restaurant can't be this bad.   Well let me tell you it's every bit as bad as people say.   The worst service I have ever experienced in my whole life and the food is well below average.   My experience was much the same as everyone else's here.   It's a shame as it's within walking distance of my house and I really wanted to like it.  If I could give less than 1 star I would.   If anything you should go for the comedy factor because this place is a joke.
