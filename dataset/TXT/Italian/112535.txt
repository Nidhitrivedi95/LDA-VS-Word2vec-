GCr0eTVnVzFE72c-VJezoQ First time taking the family to Little Italy and among all of the terrific restaurants my son picks this place. He could not have picked s better place to dine. The server was excellent and the other support staff made the whole service experience awesome. We had a hot anti pesto plate as a appetizer: calamari, mushrooms, rice balls, roasted peppers.  Feeds a family of four easy and it was good. We had ceased and house salads, I liked the ceased-a little heavy on the dressing but tasted great. Veal Parmesan with pasta was delicious and big enough my wife a I should have split it. Spaghetti and meatballs, sausage was very large and the girl took home leftovers. We all took home leftovers. The boy had fettuccine with calamari which was very tasty. Definitely would recommend. Family of 4 $100 plus tip. FYI
