W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg Had a GREAT meal here last night.
It's a fun place to sit and linger.  We sat outside (it was a perfect summer night) and never once felt rushed or hurried.
We tried some sort of eggplant appetizer that was delicious- very thinly sliced eggplant that was lightly fried, covered with marinara sauce and a dollop of cheese.  
With a friend, I split a salad and a pasta.  We got the caprese salad, which was delicious.  The cheese was creamy and fresh.  The tomatoes, oh, the tomatoes, were at peak perfection of ripeness.
We tried the FETTUCCINE FELLINI.  It was incredible.  Pancetta and gorgonzola in a creamy parmesean sauce?  Yes please.  I practically licked the plate.
Good cappuccino, good wine selection.
Friendly service.  They even split the pasta for us without us having to ask.  I appreciate that kind of thing.
