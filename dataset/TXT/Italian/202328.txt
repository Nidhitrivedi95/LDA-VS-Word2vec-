I live out of town and found out about this place from a Bellagio employee.  I told him I was tired of overpaying for ok food on the strip and wanted to go to someplace off the strip that wasn't expensive but nice.  
Capos is my new favorite restaurant to go to.  I have been back 3 times since my first trip and taken clients and friends there and they all walk out talking about what a cool experience it was.  If you want great food with a cool / different experience then go to CAPOS!
