qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA Was on my way to get a burger from another restaurant when I saw a picture of the creamy pesto ravioli.  I couldn't pass it up.  Stopped in and got the ricotta filled ravioli with creamy pesto sauce.  It was amazing!  The Caesar salad was decent.

Ambiance of the restaurant is low key and relaxing.  The restaurant seating is in the upstairs section after passing the bar so you are away from the passing crowds of people and all of the noise.  Great service, great food, and a pleasant atmosphere.
