Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA This place is a joke. It should be called Joe's tourist trap pizza because it's not even close to New York pizza. It's very expensive and subpar at best. I ordered a slice of just cheese.  It was very thin in the middle, large crusted at the end, very little sauce and very little cheese. For five dollars a slice claiming to be award winning New York pizza, I expected a lot better. I'm from New York and have been to the REAL Joe's pizza in the Village many times. When I asked what part of New York the owners from, I was told he's from Bulgaria. Really... Apparently just another guy jumping on the  New York pizza bandwagon. Being a pizza lover that's actually from New York I find this place in insult
