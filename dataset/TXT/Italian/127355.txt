HUWLnKD5LSZY134amUO2Rg I'm eating their regular cheese pizza right now.  A coworker wanted me to compare it to Broadway Pizzeria, and here's the difference I taste.  The dough and crust on this pizza is phenomenal.  Lightly crunchy on the very outside, fluffy on the inside, chewy but not doughy.  The pizza is wholly delicious.  I can't say it's better than Broadway's.  They're both amazing.  I might like the cheese and sauce combination of Broadway's pizza more, but the overall pizza slice of this restaurant I think I may like better.  This pizza seems to have more dimensions without losing any of the east coast..
