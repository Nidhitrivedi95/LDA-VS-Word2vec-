qVQGfHphxolps16v6g5X-g As you all know Cave Creek Rd can get sketchy at times and you have to be careful where you dine. In my experience it is necessary to bring a seat liner to most of the restaurants on Cave Creek!

Belfiore's is different, thank goodness! When you walk in you are greeted with pastries, gelato, and the smell of fresh pizza. If you decide to sit in the dinning area you get a nice stack of fresh crusty rolls and butter. The portions are huge, so count on sharing unless you are just a pig. 

Service is very pleasant and helpful and the clientele is middle class or higher, so no worries about the guy pushing the shopping cart on the side of the road. LOL!

Not only can you get great pasta and meat dishes but you can also get your weekly supply of cold cuts. They have the best deal in town for Boars Head meats. WAY lower than Fry's. 

SO go check it out!
