GnODIDJz09LecpudDoynCg Let's just say the two times I have delivered babies in the hospitals across the street, I have ordered Greenbush pizza and food from my suite.  Hospital food may be getting better, but you can't beat Greenbush food no matter what. 
It is a secret gem.  You may have walked by a dozen times and not even realized it.
I love that it has a real history to its own building and neighborhood.  
Walk down into the basement, watch your head and be greeted by a wonderful smell that would've made Uncle Louie proud. 
Appetizers, salads, antipasto, pizzas, oh pizzas, smoked trout on pasta, are just some of our favorites.  It's intimate, it's cozy, the drinks from the bar and fabulous and so are the amazing desserts if you have any room left. 
So bring a friend who has never been, visitors from out of town or your honey on a romantic trip down memory lane right here in Madison.
