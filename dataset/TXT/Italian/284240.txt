z8H4Mdzl4jS9pYswj6Jf9w Amazing food - as soon as I took my first bite, I just about swooned. We had the
- Nodini. Bread knots with that amazing "ping" of garlic buttery goodness. 
- Bigoli. Duck offal ragu with duck egg pasta - comfort food at its tastiest best.
- Black cod pasta that had this seafood unami taste that I just about fainted - it was that good.

Overall, wonderful food. The only drawback was that I thought the service was weak - compared to the original Buca on King West where the servers were incredibly knowledgeable about the food, the service here was lackluster and they did not appear to know the menu or ingredients well. Overall, would return - a wonderful meal all in all!
