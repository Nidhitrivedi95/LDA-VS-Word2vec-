fRqO2UFdERD4In_9_zO-dg Great place, great pizza! First time we were there, we ordered a  large pizza, dine in. We waited...and waited...customers came...customers went...no pizza for us yet, so my husband went up to the counter and asked if ours was ready.  The guy apologized without hesitation and told us  they apparently  overlooked our order and he would make us one immediately.  He reimbursed us for the mistake (we were not angry or demanding  a refund--he just handed over our money--with more apologies!)  THE PIZZA WAS WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!!  DELICIOUS!!! Perfectly baked and seasoned, with just the right amount of  "grease" to make it yummy and, most importantly,  AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! What a nice bunch of people!!!  A place like this DESERVES your business--they are awesome!!! Keep up the great work! Can't wait to come back for another pizza...and a hoagie, or two!  PS--this place is IMMACULATE--used the restrooms and they were also spotless.  Such a nice place!
