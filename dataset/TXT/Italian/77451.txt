cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA I had Giordano's in Chicago when I was there for Valentines Day of this year, I was so in LOVE I ordered one to bring home.. on the plane.. frozen.. stuck it in my freezer and had it 1.5 months later.. it was just as good as being there... In between the Original Chicago brought pizza I ordered one to go from here in Peoria.. called it in, it was total chaos when got there, the to go counter was in the middle of a nightmare... but I got my pizza and left.. only to get home and be disappointed that it was missing what I brought home from Chicago, the flavor was off, and the crust was burnt.. but I am not a quitter... I will give it another try, hoping for the same experience as in Chicago...
