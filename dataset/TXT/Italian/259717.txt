WNnkyVvBfY1vTqiqSufZQA Uptown Italian eatery. The appetizer were good not great. Had the calamari (grilled) and the mushrooms. Mushrooms were tasty and warm and the portion size was good. Can't understand why we were not served the fresh warm bread? Everyone looked like they enjoyed it. The ahi tuna was extremely "fishy" tasting; I wasn't a big fan of it. I would probably go back but am not killing myself to get there.
