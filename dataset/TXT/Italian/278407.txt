YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg Well here is another disappointment. I've heard good things and good reviews, but sadly makes me believe that people here never ate good food (I hope I am wrong) ... Sorry!!
The order that I am describing here is not importance, but the sequence of arriving thru leaving.
First, the place is nice, good view, location of the table was amazing, but (Vegas) there is a huge billboard with the name of the restaurant that just in the middle of the view. Who do they want to advertise, to people inside the airplane?? 
Second, the service (Michael) ... Nice guy. Ok service.
Third, wine list. Simple, nothing extra ordinary. With a wine cellar so big they could make a more variety. The waiter did not bring the wine for the taste. Just brought the glass full and that was it.
Fourth, the food. Most important, but ... I order ossobuco with pasta. My wife order risotto with shrimp and scallops. 
The ossobuco had a sauce, it was cold, the meat was warm, the pasta was horrible. Did not have any flavor and you could see the lack of care that was in the plate.
Her risotto was warm, not hot, the scallops were ok and shrimp was tough to chew. The seasoning was way to hot for a risotto. Almost a risoto mexicano.
No chef, nor the su chef were there. Just cooks.
After they noticed that I did not eat they tryed to serve me something else, but the meat was going to be cold or colder and I would eat by myself. Ended up eat just the meat. The manager (I think) came to see what was happening, but I told me I did not wanted anything that I would eat the meat and finished.
The check ... In full almost 100 dollars. Paid. There is one place that really need all the money they can get. First and last time they saw mine. O well one more experience to tell you!!
