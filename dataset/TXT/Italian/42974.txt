7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw It was my first time at this delightful place as we were immediately welcomed by Blake. He explained the menu and wine choices, then introduced us to our server. We ordered a bottle of wine to share. It was really tasty! We ordered a salad and pizza. Delicious!! Blake was ever near as it was very busy and our server was swamped. I saw Blake serving food, cleaning tables, and answering questions. I found out he was the manager. I have rarely seen a manager so visible within a restaurant. Usually they come to your table to ask if everything is all right. This manager was working with his staff to make sure everything WOULD BE all right. Well done!!
