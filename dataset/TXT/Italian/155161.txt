l0WauZ92kRg9bu2oxHj4TQ I've only been here once, but I really like this place. There's a good vibe about it. It's clean and airy, with friendly people...oh, and the food is really good too!

I tried the Chicken Parmesan sandwich. It was big and delicious and came with a scrumptious salad on the side too. I tasted the Salumeria sandwich too, and it was also very tasty. That one had a nice spicy bite to it; very good!

I wish I lived closer to this Aiello's. If you live in the northern part of Phoenix though, this place is certainly worth checking out. I'm looking forward to returning anyway.
