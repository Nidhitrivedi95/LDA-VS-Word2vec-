Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA I really just love this place...for take out.  We've dined in a few times, but the wait is usually very long (duh...because word is out that it is fantastic) so now we take out 90% of the time.  Our favorite collectively, is the Big Star pizza, my husbands favorite is the Pepperoni and mine is the At Last.  The flavor combination on At Last as a meatless pizza (and I'm a meat eater!) is so well thought out.  I feel like I'm a judge sampling a pizza on a cooking show or something.  Seriously.....try it.  And tonight, we got (our first here) dessert, the Lil Triple.  It was really good. The chocolate cream is more like just chocolate pudding.  But it was cute anyway. And the staff who takes and hands off our take out order are just the nicest and most attentive. We had Josh take care of our take out order tonight, and he was great. Just go...it's worth a bit of a wait.  Bring friends, have some drinks at the bar, the beer selection is great too! Brava!
