ZS3l1Q7InA5h4R8nMcFRwg The food is notably overpriced. The beef carpaccio was fabulous as well as the mushroom stuffed ravioli in a truffled butter. The sea bass wasn't very impressive at all and the potato and spinach along side it was even more bland. The ambiance is nice, quiet and romantic but I couldn't help but notice an arrogance in the air. I quickly found the arrogance comical as I realized it was their price list and not their food that was being showcased. Not coming back
