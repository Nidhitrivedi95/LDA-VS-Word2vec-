Orgm9nmcClxnAUva4nOKyA Went here on Wednesday night. When we got there it was packed, we had no idea that Wednesdays were all you can eat dinner buffet. We made reservations so we didn't have to wait too long, maybe 10 mins. My husband and I never tired the buffet here and the waiter kept raving about how good it was and the various selections they had to offer so we decided to give it a try which was a big mistake. The selection wasn't that great. Only things we actually enjoyed eating were the BBQ chicken and the cheese filled pasta. The roast beef was as raw as raw could get. The cup of water I got from the server was dirty beyond belief. Not saying I won't be coming back to the hot house but definitely won't ever be coming back for the dinner buffet. Seems like the servers are focused on way too many guests to actually serve you properly.
