hHgSUnDB9yIrxUEMSmsdoQ My friends and I met here a little before 7 PM on a weeknight and it was perfect timing! While there were others in the restaurant, we didn't have to wait in line very long and the service was fast! I got the Summer Lunch Bundle (even though it was dinner!). I got a side of the roasted corn salad, turkey pesto tasca and the blackberry hibiscus lemonade. It was all so refreshing and delicious! My friend and I also split a pepperoni stick, which was just as good! I look forward to going back and trying something else off the menu!
