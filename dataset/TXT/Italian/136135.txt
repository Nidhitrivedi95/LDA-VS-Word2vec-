IXUwuNjy707wJNW2U4sRVg Yes the food was good, if not a bit over priced for ( as most of the folks here write)being in a strip mall in Mesa catering to snowbirds who like Olive Garden. However, the owner didn't know what cannelloni was and smirked when I wondered why it wasn't  on the menu.The chef/ cook is not Italian, so there's the answer. I'm from SF and grew up eating at north beach and 4 star Italian places.  The waiter/ owner insisted on calling me M'lady and telling me to try some wine, which I told him I do not drink.. Annoying. The shopping center is actually very charming and attractive. I live close to it, and No- I'm not a senior in a mobile home park.  I was hoping I would love this place, but maybe I will try one more visit. The patio looked really nice.  As with everyone else, the husband was the key annoying factor in this review.
