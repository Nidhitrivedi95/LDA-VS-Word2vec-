eEKfOX6KtQmLgb8z-1VfUA Had a taste of them from Taste of italy when we got cannolis and we were hooked.
They were so delicious! 

So good that we came back for our anniversary dessert round 1 ! and shared a sicilian cannoli and it was still amazing as we remembered.
Would like to try other things eventually but cannolis were the best we've ever had.
