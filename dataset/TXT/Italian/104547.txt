fOKeVUHC7nb6c8G5sILdHQ Great pizza at a reasonable price. Picked up take out pepperoni and cheese. Only down side to picking up the pizza was that there was not a separate line for pick up and people ordering slices/pies in the restaurant. However, once through the line they were very friendly and my pizza was fresh out of the oven into the box before my eyes! Delicious and cheap! Will be back.
