OEFDnarfWI8sFGTFgax7pA Bills Pit was a place we had visited many years ago when he was at Jane and Wilson and moved to Woodbridge. We frequently went there for many birthdays and anniversaries. The ambiance has always been  minimal but clean and friendly. This was  our first time at this new location.  This is a smaller restaurant but also clean and the staff were courteous. The wait was 20 minutes before we were given menus and water , and another 15 before the garlic bread and relish tray arrived. The food arrived shortly after. It was hot and delicious. We ordered  a full rack of ribs with accompanying potatoes ( or fries) and steamed vegetables. The ribs have always been delicious in spices with a barbque sauce.  They are done perfectly (not the fall off the bone kind, ) BETTER!! If you have 2 hours to relax and eat then coming here is a must!!
