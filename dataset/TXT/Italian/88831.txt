e_yxY8iYwK6WDnUSz3v8ng We went to Flour at 9:00 on a Saturday and it was bustling, as usual.  It was also restaurant week and their menu was one of the most appetizing on the list of restaurants, so I am sure that had something to do with the energetic crowd.

The pork chop and brussels sprouts was AMAZING and a huge portion - we had an entire piece to bring home (and even though it was my boyfriend's meal, I have DIBS on that.  YUM).

My pasta was amazing, as usual.

Hoping to make it out for happy or lunch sometime soon !
