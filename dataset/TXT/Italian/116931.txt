Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A Very delicious Naples-style pizza .This pizza is serious stuff.
Vera Pizza Napolitana.
.  Crust, cheese, ingredients--everything was tasty.
We had the margharitta first and then we went crazy with Bufalo pizza.The dough is like eating a cloud and it has the most perfect leopard spotting, they cook it in less than two minutes and you can taste the complexity of the wood-fired oven style.
These people are PROS.The food was OUTSTANDING, as was the wine selection. I felt like my bill was very fair and will definitely be back when I'm in town again.
