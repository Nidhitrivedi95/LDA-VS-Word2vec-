mUUTJY9_BqmAYxypHiqWrw My husband and I frequent here after reading all the reviews (we have passed it many times but never went in). We try to go biweekly. The napoleon square is like no other! One of our favorites! Another reviewer said that their cream brûlée was not sugared top but liquid- it was sugared top but if you leave it out too long it liquified.  Their rice ball was good. Their pizza was amazing! Going to try their sandwiches next they look so good!  Will add more if we find things that are of note.
