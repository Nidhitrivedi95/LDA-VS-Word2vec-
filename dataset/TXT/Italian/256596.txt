w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q Had a very disappointing dinner at the Palm last night. Our party of four stopped in early, around 5:30 PM , and got seated right away.  After browsing the menu, two of us opted to split the surf and turf and a salad, I chose the grilled salmon with a mango salsa and my daughter chose the filet mignon.  When our meal was served, my salmon was so dry that I had to send it back. I commented to our server that I prefer it medium rare.  When she returned with the new dish, it still was very overcooked. Because the other members in our party we're already halfway through their meals, I did not send it back to the kitchen again. For $38 though, The chef should be able to cook a piece of simple fish correctly.  The two people in our party who split the surf and turf asked to have their steak cooked medium and it came out well done instead. Again, for the high prices that they charge, you would expect your meat to come out as ordered, especially when the restaurant was practically empty because we dined so early. The only positives to our meal were the cocktails and our friendly and personable server.  The food was extremely overpriced and very mediocre quality-wise.  $300 later, we were very disappointed...
