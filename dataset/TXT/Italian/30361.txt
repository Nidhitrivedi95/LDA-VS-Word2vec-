5jYYHTRka2SMS7zBOuN9RA The salad was perfect, but the pizza was under-cooked.  I had the Cucina Cucina pizza, this should be great as the signature dish.  A swing and a miss.  The service was fine. Our waiter spend a little too much time talking to other employees.  So they lost two stars because of things that are easily fixed... I will try them again.
