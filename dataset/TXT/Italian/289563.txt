ZtJ6sTq7-5rL9ORUtQJHAQ Delicious beyond words. The fetticine  and braised short ribs melted in my mouth. The owners and family that work here came by the table to say hello. Good old fashioned courtesy that goes far in this impersonal world. I just love the Italians. They turned a mostly vegetarian into a carnivore tonight.   Yummmmmy!!
