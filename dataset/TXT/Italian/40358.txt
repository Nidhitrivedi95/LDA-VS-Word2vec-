Simple, basic comfort food, or daring, bold, imaginative and sophisticated, what I bring up to my nose and put in my mouth must be orgasmic, the stuff of dreams and fantasies, haunting me till my next visit, causing unexpected and sometimes embarrassing unplanned drooling and mindless reverie;

Service needs to be caring and professional, a combination of doing the job, and making me feel welcome, not an imposition. Around when you need them, but not hovering or intrusive. Being easy on the eyes and a ready smile don't hurt, though the first one is not as important as the second...

The setting, small and intimate, or grand and imposing, needs to be well done, appropriate, complementary to the food and mood. 

Ultimately it's the combination of all of the above, a whole greater than the sum of the parts. 

Carnevino is, to me, one of the greatest steakhouses in the country, a restaurant whose lamb and beef dishes I fantasize about and will find any excuse to go back to. ..
