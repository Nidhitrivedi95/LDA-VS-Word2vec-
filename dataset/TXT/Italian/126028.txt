HrR_2-HUE6cqnoz1zMN9AQ My husband and I were hungry because we had not eaten all day. We were attending a convention and did not want to eat hotel food. Saw the excellent reviews and gave it a try. Had margarita pizza and vegetarian pizza. Also had arugula salad. All was very good. Will come here again the next time we are in Charlotte.
