Tf13Wexrt6WmNw-CDW5Gyg Dined here the other night because Yard House was packed as usual and totally regretted it.... I was told the meatballs were completely gluten free and well lets just say that was impossible since i am still suffering from it. Ive been in severe pain ever since dining here and when i called to speak to a manager, the hostess "lost connection" with me twice. And can we say OVER PRICED? i will NEVER return, and i hope they realize why all the other places in town square were packed and they had a total of 3 people sitting at their bar.
