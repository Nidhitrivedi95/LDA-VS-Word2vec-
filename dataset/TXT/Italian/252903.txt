VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w We arrived a little early for our reservation for Sunday Brunch. Our reservation was for a patio table, however since the only tables available were in full sun, it was decided to go for indoor seating in the dining room. 
The dining room has a beautiful decor and soft lighting The room is very conversation friendly.
Immediately after being seated we ordered water and cocktails. This was followed a complementary dish of garlic/butter bread with a bowl of red sauce.

Next our server Josue explained the menu and was helpful to determine our selection.. Many items are large portions that can easily be shared. We finally decided on sharing two items. The  meatball with sausage ragu is made from fresh ground Wagyu, Italian Sausage and Veal. Handcrafted with fresh herbs, imported cheeses and topped with whipped Ricotta. The meatball is 16 oz (yes 1 pound). The second item was a side order of Pene Pasta with tomato sauce.
The meatball was cut into four pieces table side We managed to eat half of the meatball and half of the pasta. This left enough for a take home meal. The kitchen accommodated our request for extra pasta sauce. 

Las Vegas has no shortage of great Italian restaurants and  Lavo certainly serves one of the best meatballs in town. Juicy and tender Waygu accompanied by a rich sauce.
