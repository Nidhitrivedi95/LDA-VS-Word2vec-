7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Just ate there last night and left extremely disappointed.  While the steaks were good, I found the appetizers and side dishes way off base and very salty.  The Brussel sprouts with prosciutto side dish was so salty they did not charge me for the dish.  The same can be said for the potato & parmigiano zeppole. So for me, any steak house can cook prime steaks - it's all about the accompany dishes that allows one restaurant to outshine others. Unfortunately, Carnevino falls short from my experience.
