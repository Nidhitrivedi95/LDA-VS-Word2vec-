AuIiqDeL65kczmiFSkAWrA Went for a buisness dinner so they had a set family style menu with tons of food  and free drinks! The calamari they served was fantastic some of the best i have had in a lone time. The chicken marsala was also very good but so was all the main courses. Great dinner and I have always been a fan of this place. But i did have to buy one beer and 5.00 in Charlotte come on!
