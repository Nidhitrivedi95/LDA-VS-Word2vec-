Tf13Wexrt6WmNw-CDW5Gyg I sure do love me some meatballs...we decided to try this place out since we were hungry and it wasn't as busy as the other restaurants. The hostess was friendly and talked about the menu before we made our final decision to eat here. New spot so minus well try it out.

I didn't know what to get and I asked our server what he recommended, he said the classic meatballs with the tomato sauce. I didn't go with what he said since I'm trying not to eat red meat so I went with the turkey meatballs with the mushroom sauce. It was delicious! I would get it again. The garlic fries was delicious...but you really can't mess up fries.

I only gave this place 3 stars since the service was excellent, he forgot our waters.
