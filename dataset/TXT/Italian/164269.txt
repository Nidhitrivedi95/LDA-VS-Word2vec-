LXheNwqZPoXuXNNeP1sNew When this place first opened, I loved it. Perhaps because it was new, or maybe because the pizza tasted better than most of what you can find in the Arrowhead area. Whatever that was is kinda gone now. 

Service is almost always exceptional. Generally happy  and helpful staff, usually quick service. The outdoor seating is great when it's not 110 out. The food is pretty good, and there's some unique options on the menu. 

What gets me, ultimately, is price. Lunch specials are great, but I feel like $15 for a personal pizza is a bit much given what usually comes on them. Our $13 caprese appetizer came with 5 slices of bread (for a table of 4), couple tablespoons of mozzarella,  and some pesto. Again, felt cheated for the price. Their $10 lunch specials are probably a loss leader, but that's the price point I feel makes the most sense for these guys -- at least that's what would keep me coming back regularly.

Maybe I came on an off night, but it was dead for a Saturday night at 6. Maybe I'm not alone in this thinking? Overall, decent food, good service, but just a tad too high on price to make it a regular dinner spot for me.
