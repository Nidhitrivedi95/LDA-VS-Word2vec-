oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ Went to dinner tonight and found it to be a unique and very rustic feel.

Beautifully decorated with all the hints of what a winme bar should look like, alas the service was just plain amateur.

Maybe it was an off evening but she didn't talk much about the menu or the great wines on the list.
No mention about the menu, she was just plain horrible!  
Never checked on us, to see how our dinner was or offer anything we needed, the one staff just threw my dinner in front of me.  Just plain rude!
She didn't ask for coffee or a look at the deserts or digestiv drinks.

The food was terrific, I just wished the owners realize that your restaurant and food are only as good as your hosts and servers, i can't even give them an outstanding grade for the food that service was just terrible, none of the basics of hospitality were followed.  Expect to be puzzled when you come for dinner.
