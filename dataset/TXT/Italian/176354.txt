NhNO2lN-p1RvA4MfR1wk1A It is a blessing and a curse that this place has opened up just a couple minutes from my house. I absolutely adore the food! My new life goal is to sample every item on their menu and everything I have tried so far is absolutely amazing. The secret as far as I can tell is simple - fresh pasta and light sauces and don't drown it all in cheese like an unfortunate amount of Italian places do. 

The restaurant is located at the end of a shared building and has an unassuming air. The most expensive item on the menu rings in at $15 for the delicious lobster ravioli. This restaurant has introduced me to a new favorite food, arancino, which is a scrumptious fried ball with a rice and mozzarella base. The side of meatballs is probably the best item we have found on the menu so far. We all greedily forked them and dipped the fresh free bread that comes with the meals in the leftover sauce.

The restaurant delivers amazing food with friendly service at a reasonable price. My carb consumption is going to skyrocket with such a great place so close to my house.
