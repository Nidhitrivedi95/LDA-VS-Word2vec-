jspgVJaiyobeUq6EMhmO-w Wow! Completely impressed. Walked in a little skeptical - parking lot was empty on a football Sunday and the first thing that crosses your mind for a sports bar is "hmmmm...what's wrong that there's no one here on a Sunday?" But, the service was good, and the food was pretty darn awesome. Had the stuffed mushrooms (super cheesy and delicious), bruschetta (balsamic tomato goodness that I kept the sauce to dip my pizza crust in for later), smoked Cajun dry rub wings (smoky, flavorful, and not greasy or messy), and their veggie pizza. Pizza crust is crispy, thin, yet doughy - super delicious. Pizza is never my go-to...never - but I found this crave-able. Oh yeah and if you dip the crust ends in the bruschetta sauce...it's amazing!
