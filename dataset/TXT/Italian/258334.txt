w67o_AhcSU_fjVOTlbquXg I USED to love Little Chicago's.  When I first moved here, it was the only pizza I knew, and the only I cared to know.  The pizza is deliciously cheesy and greasy; which is perfect for a late night slice of pizza.

But now that I've tried the likes of Pizza Sola and Blue Grotto; Little Chicago's doesn't seem quite as tasty. 

Nevertheless, I wanted a pizza delivered tonight, so I called Little Chicago's.  At 11:30, on a Thursday night.  That doesn't seem like a tall order for a pizza joint that delivers.  But the phone call I just experienced would suggest otherwise.  The girl that answered the phone seemed...perplexed.  Why...what...where....do you want a pizza delivered???  It seemed a foreign concept.  Really?   

I know that every time I've been in there, the employees have been in an alternate state of being...but seriously.  So much so that you forget you're working in a delivery pizza joint!?  

It was really disconcerting to call a pizza place at 11:30 on a Thursday night (a Monday night, maybe?) and catch them off guard and confused about an order as simple as "large pepperoni, delivered".
