k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ I guess I am lucky with the places I'm being invited to because The Parlor was a nice place.   

My party received great service from our server.  Food was hot. Drinks were cold. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and could make recommendations. I was satisfied. 

However, you are gluten free...you get to eat salad while you friends eat pizza that smells and looks WONDERFUL.  So brace yourself.
