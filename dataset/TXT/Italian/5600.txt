_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw Tried this place out for a friends birthday party. Tried two different kinds with my wife. A few pieces were more done then I would like, but pretty good still. My wife doesn't really care for pizza and loved it. She was willing to come back and that is a huge thing. It is a little pricey, but very good.
