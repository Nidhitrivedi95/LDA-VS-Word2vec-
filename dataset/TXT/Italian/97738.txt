EUQoB_ph7_xIyj7JZGI3bg Have eaten here numerous times over the last couple of years.  Tonight food was good but not great.  But what bothered us the most was the lack of bread.  No I will not pay for bread especially when I am paying over thirty dollars for two pasta dishes!  Other Italian restaurants offer bread as part of the meal and in some cases either a choice of salad or soup.  But not providing bread as part of the meal has made this our last visit.  I'll pay $30 for pasta but not $4 for something that should be part of the meal.
