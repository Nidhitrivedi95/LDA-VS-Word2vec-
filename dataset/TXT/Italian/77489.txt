cy3Or8iSsDOmHBBu2MwnOg Second time to this restaurant-again, one of the first places I went to when moving to the area.  The place is small and intimate, but the noise level is high, so can be difficult to have a conversation.  Our first experience was very good, and this was our second visit in about two years.  Made a reservation, and based on the time available, I was really expecting a full restaurant, but when we arrived, there were certainly plenty of tables.  The first person who came to our table was great, but when it came time to order  drinks/wine and food we had a different server, not so great--seemed pompous.
My meal was very good--Caesar Salad  and then had the Spaghetti Carbonara.  My dining companion went with the Rock Shrimp Risotto.  The Risotto was good and the arborio rice was cooked well, but they did a poor job of preparing the shrimp.  My taste, very first bite, I had shells on the shrimp, and my dining companion had several bites that contained shells--not good.  At first we brought it up to our server, who was somewhat unresponsive, not sure if he just didn't know how to handle the situation. Eventually asked for a manger, who at first wasn't helpful--I told him we will pay for meal but tell their chef about the shells.  He did apologize, not charge us and gave us a piece of tiramisu with two forks -- wow, but that was never the point.  For the price, they need to make sure every dish they serve is prepared correctly.  Three stars for the experience and price.  If you look at my profile, and I'm in customer service, service is Wauwatosa important as the food.  Not sure if I would rush back to Toscana too fast.
