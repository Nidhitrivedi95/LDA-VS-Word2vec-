Lrn9Yk5dmLrYJMVvQT_CHw I had heard so many things about Strada from other people and I was excited to try it.
You can create a salad or a pizza. They also have pre-made lists/types that you can choose from. I went ahead and ordered a Build Your Own Pizza with up to 6 toppings. 

I got the Red Pesto sauce, Mozarella Blend, Chicken, Sausage, Pepperoni, Garlic, Mushrooms, and Mozarella Slices. They told me, "it will only be 5 minutes."

5 minutes. 
I could not believe it. 

It came out and it was piping hot. You can eat at one of the tables there or get it in a box to-go. Next time i'll have to try the salad line.

The Pizza was AMAZING. I added crushed red pepper and Parmesan to it too. It's thin crust which makes it cook faster and the stone oven can cook so many pizzas. They also offer gluten free crusts and put it in the oven with it's own foil liner and let everyone know that a GF pizza is going in so people can keep non GF pizzas away from it. AMAZING. 

What a great place to take friends and families (kid friendly) when you are visiting the Memorial Union. Enjoy!
