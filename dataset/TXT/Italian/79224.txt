D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg Came in to town for Vegas for one night on business, found this place @ the Palms and man, was the food amazing! But besides the food, our service  was 5 star as well. Our server, Ernesto was incredible. This guy really went out of his way to give us great service,  & answer all our questions, also made sure we always had drinks. By far, one of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant in a long time! Make sure to try Nove Seafood pasta! It was excellent. The pudding for dessert, hit the spot! Make sure to request Ernest as a server! This guy has an awesome personality!  Will definitely return!
