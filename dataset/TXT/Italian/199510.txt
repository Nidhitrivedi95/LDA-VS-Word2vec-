pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Awesome pizza. Great place to go for parties. You have to get in line outside about 3 hours before it opens. But it is totally worth it, after all, best pizza in the country! They only take one reservationa day. You should definitly get there 3 or more hours before it opens at 5, because it is a small place and there will be long lines. Its very nice insidand you can watch Chris, the owner , and all the other chefs preparing pizzas. Dont listen to those bad reviews, this is a great place!
