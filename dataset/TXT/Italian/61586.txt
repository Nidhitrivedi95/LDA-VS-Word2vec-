AYLxEeVq8NKG2UhcBiggrA I tried this place out for the first time last week, I got the Canuck I believe which had pepperoni and bacon.... Sooooo GOOD! Pizza crust was amazing, nice wood oven taste, and the sauce was just great. I also ordered a side of meatballs, and they were probably the best I've ever had. Following week, I had preferred myself the beef ravioli, and those were really good also! Just a little overpriced in my opinion, but because of the taste, and the fact you just get that super fresh feeling when eating it, I might just be able to let it slide. The place is nice inside, very vibrant, and you just can't feel depressed sitting in there. 

Highly recommend
