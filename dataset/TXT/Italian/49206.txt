9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Had a few hours to kill before hopping on a flight and found this place on yelp. all the glowing reviews really drew me in and we weren't disappointed! 

we arrived and found that this charming restaurant is located in the midst of a residential area. we were greeted by the evenings musician, who was playing soft electric guitar behind his back. incredible talent! 

first of all the charcuterie plate (il tagliere) is amazing. so much goodness on the board, I could have just eaten that for dinner. we also ordered a margarita pizza and the pasta bolognese. both were outstanding, packed with flavor! 

if I ever find myself in Phoenix again this will be the first place I go!
