The live piano music sets a great mood and is like getting a show with dinner. The drinks are a little on the strong side, so pace yourself. The pricing may seem steep, but you are getting quality service and food so enjoy yourself! They have the best bellinis in town. Cody is an amazing server so if you get a chance to be seated in his section, he will take care of you. The also offer a variety of proteins, and for someone with a finicky husband who only eats fish that is fresh and well prepared, The Bootlegger Bistro has never let him down. Try this place and you'll keep coming back.
