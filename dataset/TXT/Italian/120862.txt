H9QvGwjFPnUULD0y8i7FkQ Been here three times. First time was many years ago, and the pizza was really good! That was actually a takeout experience. The last two times I visited was because my kid's sports teams were having end-of-year celebrations there. The place definitely needs an upgrade, but it's still good for kids because they have arcade games and TVs. Another positive is the wait staff. They were very friendly on both occasions. On the negative side, the pizza isn't as good as it used to be. It's not bad, but it's not great. And the review about the owner cursing at a diner really makes me have no interest in returning. Generous rating.
