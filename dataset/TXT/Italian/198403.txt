pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw This place has some of the best tasting and freshest food I have ever had. Not only was the pizza was phenomenal, the salad tasted like it had just been picked off the plant. Everything was so fresh and I'm house made feta cheese is amazing! The bread at the table tasted like it was baked right before it was brought out

Don't forget the chocolate cake dessert! You won't be disappointed! 

Well done Pizzeria Bianco, well done
