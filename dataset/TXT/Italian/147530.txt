kcCncG6-pomVVc7r27HYWA This update is not for the restaurant, this is for the catering business, Sausalito Catering. I went to a wedding at the Galleria. The food was awesome. The servers were awesome. Huge portions. Great food. Salmon with wasabi/teriaki sauce. The servers were the most attentive I've had at a wedding lately. Super professional. I would recommend this catering company to anyone.
