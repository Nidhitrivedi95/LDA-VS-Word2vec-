y1AM7MeCN3HaS7SHnxcBfQ I had a very lovely meal at Il Mulino, a hidden gem tucked in Eglinton and Bathurst. The interior was warm and intimate, a perfect setting for a romantic dinner with your loved one. We were greeted very warmly by an Italian gentleman, who thoughtfully asked us for our seating preference.

We were served some flat bread dressed with rosemary and drizzles of olive oil. This bread was amazingly addictive, particularly that lovely, crunchy crust. we finished two servings of it on top of our meal. 

The meat lasagna was utterly delectable! The flavours were very robust and the texture of the pasta sheets was wonderful- not too mushy but adequately soft. I wanted to lick the whole plate clean.

In comparison, the other pasta fell a little short. I wanted something simple, so I opted for an appetizer portion of gnocchi quattro formaggio: grana padano and ricotta in a four cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was rather bland, perhaps because I had tasted the lasagna first. I also thought it could use a little more salt. I was really looking forward to a more pungent cheesy taste (after all, it had four cheeses!), but that didn't really come through. However, the lasagna was so good that I could easily forgive this dish.

For dessert, the tiramisu was very tasty. It had perhaps a little too much cream for me, but the flavours were excellent and not overly sweet. 

The service was just wonderful. When our server missed us leaving the restaurant, he even ran out the door to bid us farewell. Next time I come, I would definitely call ahead to find out whether meat lasagna is on their menu that day.
