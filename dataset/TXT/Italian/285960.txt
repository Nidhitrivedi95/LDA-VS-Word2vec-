ZfPcpbZssIMrYBSg9jXNdw We went there with a Groupon, which the waitress took when she greeted us.  We ordered, and told the waitress we'd have two half price drinks that were the special of the day.  When the bill came, we had been charged full price for the drinks.  The explanation we were given was that we couldn't use the Groupon along with any other discount. The Groupon states it's for food only, therefore the discount on the drinks should have been okay. The manager was not accommodating, and demonstrated poor customer service. 
The food was overshadowed by this situation. 
There are many other Italian restaurants in the area that want our return business.
