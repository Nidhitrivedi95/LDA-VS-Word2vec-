Kykw3ho8wHtLV6gr9qbWTg My boyfriend and I go to this establishment at least twice a month and its our favorite restaurant. We ask to sit in Taylor's section every time. Not only is she the best server I've come across but the entire staff is great And makes our experience all the better. I wish they would bring back their salon pea pasta but all their food is amazing. Favorite restaurant and have never had a bad experience.
