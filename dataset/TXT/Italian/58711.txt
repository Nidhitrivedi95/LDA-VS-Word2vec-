aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA Kayla is awesome!! A vendor brought us lunch on a very busy day but the salad dressing was missing. Not sure who the manager is but they gave the OK for Kayla to bring us some dressing and a little something extra!! This was a great solution and our office appreciated the thoughtfulness and attention to customer needs. Keep up the good work!!
