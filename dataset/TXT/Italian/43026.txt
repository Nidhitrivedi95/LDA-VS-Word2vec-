7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw I came across this place at Kierland Commons since it's close to where I live and I often visit the commons for shopping. North has a great menu with lots of healthy options and a fantastic selection of wines (the half priced bottle deal on Sundays is awesome).
The staff is very friendly and attentive. It's nice to see something other than the typical Americanized Italian food that is buried in boring heavy sauces and cheese. The food is well paired with their wines. Oh and as far as deserts go - the salted caramel budino served in the little mason jars is to die for!
If you don't mind spending a little more for quality items, this place is for you. Overall, a great place to go with company or a date because it's intimate yet still in a nice casual environment. I will be back again for sure.
