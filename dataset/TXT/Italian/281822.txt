yXiDD18UV49-7UhA6dWjAw Came to Charlotte for my cousin's graduation from UNC and Giacomo's is one of her favorite places to eat so we decided to go there. Food and service were excellent! My Mom and I split a cheesesteak and fries, Gram had a bowl of minestrone and a slice of pizza, my cousin had chicken tortellini alfredo and her boyfriend had a spinach roll. Of course we all tasted and shared, everything was delish! Would definitely go again if I'm in the area!!
