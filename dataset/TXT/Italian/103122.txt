fliaU7_M0PkJuXFYtBhnNw I had dinner here the other night.  New place, located across the street from the ever present Cafe Diplomatic.  I asked my server how long they have been opened, a mere 3 months.  

The decor is very chic, black and white with a damask theme.  Quite different than the average restaurant you find in little Italy.  

Everything I ordered was amazing.  My main course was gnocchi with a creamy Gorgonzola sauce, so rich and delicious (I'm sure high on the calorie count too but it was worth it). 

I looked at the dessert menu but didn't dare order one as I was too full from my appetizer and main.  Though I was informed there tiramisu and creme brulee is made in house.  I would have tried one of those if I had had room for dessert.

I found the prices to be quite reasonable, my gnocchi was only $14.00.  Desserts I noticed were all priced at $7, which is an okay price for a creme brulee but a steep price for a sorbet or ice creme.

This place is a hidden gem at the moment  as it was quite empty for a Thursday night.  It a place that should definitely be checked out. It is a place I will be visiting again and recommend visiting.
