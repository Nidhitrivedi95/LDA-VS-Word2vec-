xCcg7KsIxRpYp0-Hxo0prw La Cucina Flegrea is one of the best authentic Italian restaurants you could ask for.  Their menu has a lot of amazing options, but definitely try any of the selections with fish, as it seems to be a specialty.   As it should be, their red sauce has a bit of a spicy kick to it and both meats and fish are cooked to perfection.  We always start the meal with one of the anti pastas and have never been disappointed with the quality or quantity.

The restaurant is small, very intimate and quite casual. We love the fact that you can get one of the best meals in Pittsburgh at a reasonable price in such a pleasant and casual atmosphere.  The do not take reservations and it is BYOB.
