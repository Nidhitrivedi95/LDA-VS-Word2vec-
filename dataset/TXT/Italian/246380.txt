uzpdcxvlKx5BuoWU3NRHbA Second time here and probably the last. Bad service and bad food. Took a couple of reminders that we needed an extra place setting and then only brought 2 of our 3 entres and had to wait 5 minutes for the 3rd one. Chicken Parmigiana was very tough, salmon was dry and loaded with garlic. To top it all the piano player was too loud so you couldn't have a conversation
