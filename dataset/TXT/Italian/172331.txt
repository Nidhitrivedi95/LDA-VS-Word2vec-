N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ Been here before, had a great experience than, and this time was just as good.  We started  with an Italian sub for an appetizer, it's loaded with meat, red peppers, good bread.  

We also got a meatball, sausage, mushroom and ricotta cheese pizza, it was soooo... good!  We wanted to eat more, but didn't want to look like pigs, so we asked for a box to take home, but it didn't last long!  

Still a hidden diamond in my neighborhood, definitely recommend it.
