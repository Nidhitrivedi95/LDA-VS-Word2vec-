aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ We never got our cotton candy!! Waitress promised it 3 times but it never came :(. Other than that I thought the place was slightly above average. I don't know, maybe I'm one of those people that has too high expectations, maybe my palete is a little too discerning because I haven't been blown away by too many things in this town. The service was excellent (except for the cotton candy debacle). We were immediately greeted with some sourdough bread and olive oil  to dip in. There is no S&P on the table so we couldn't Dr it up. Eh. The amuse bouche was a play on bacon and eggs.
 I didn't eat it but my husband thought it was uninteresting. The gazpacho amuse was tasty. 
My husbands halibut was beautifully presented and artfully prepared, the mushrooms were the best thing on his plate. I got the fettucine with english peas and carrots in a pecorino sauce. The pasta was nice, peas still had some crunch but all together it was bland and boring. Again, where's that S&P?
We decided against dessert but I was looking foward to that cotton candy.
