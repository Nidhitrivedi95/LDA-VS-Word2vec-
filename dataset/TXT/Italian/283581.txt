z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ I'm very late writing this review.  I ate dinner here 4 nights over March Madness for 2013 and I was in town for a total of 7 nights.  It was so good and the service so fantastic that I kept going back.

First, this is an amazing restaurant for Las Vegas, Strip or Downtown. I am very glad it is downtown at The D since I usually stay there during March Madness.  

Oysters were fantastic.  I did have one that I thought was off (and I eat oysters by the dozen weekly, usually if possible very many dozen) and no questions asked, everything replaced.  Perhaps someone might have caught it, but I don't blame anyone for this.

One great note, I ordered the Lobster Risotto from the bar on a Tuesday.  It arrived and was fabulous...but missing the truffles.  I immediately noticed and let the bartender know.  She went to the kitchen, the chef walked out, looked at the dish, apologized and took it away.  It returned with the perfect amount of truffles and added lobster.  Fantastic.  No discussion, just an apology and the dish made right, probably far better than on the list.

I think this place is amazing.  I was there at the beginning when they'd only been open for I think less than a month. But top to bottom after 4 dinners, this place is five stars with no questions asked.  Sure, I had some hiccups in a couple of items, but there is no way that it detracts from the experience because they did EVERYTHING right.

Bartender was very knowledgable about the wines and I like that.

Great place.  I'm going back as soon as I can.  I would travel across country to eat here.
