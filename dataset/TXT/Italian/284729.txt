zCqpHq-eDSRqXn9VBtoVcQ It is very hard to distinguish between all of the Italian/pizza places in Yonge and Eglinton so when a new addition opened for business, it didn't seem like anything new. Quattro e Quattr8 replaced Falasca (the pizza by weight place) and has maintained the pizza take-out but no longer by weight ($4.50 per slice). They have also made a tapas and pizza restaurant on the other side which has specials such as half price pizza on Tuesdays and 50% off wines on Wednesdays. The tapas range from $8 - 15 dollars and are exactly what you'd expect of a tapa - small plates. Overall, I really liked their eggplant tapa and also the pizza with 3 types of mushrooms. 

TL;DR Went in with low expectations, it met my expectation. Get pizza on Tuesdays.
