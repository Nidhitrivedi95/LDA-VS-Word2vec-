8dolrPYCAgqzPzZCv23lvQ I grew up in Chicago and grew up on Chicago dogs. I was excited to learn that a new place for dogs was right in my neighborhood.  Scotti's has been open about a week. My husband and I stopped in today for lunch. Fast friendly service. But most of all - great Chicago dogs!  Vienna hot dogs. Vienna buns and all the standard trimmings including the celery salt.  They even have ketchup available for those of us that violate the Chicago dog rules and add ketchup!  A couple next to us had the Italian Beef and said it was the best they had in years.  The place also has a small deli.  Grilled cheese is also on the menu - I may just have to try that some day.  We recommend!
