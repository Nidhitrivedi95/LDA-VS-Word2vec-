B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw Just rather mediocre Italian food overall.  Had the highly yelp recommended mushroom pasta with truffle oil, and found it rather bland.  The tomato ravioli was also lacklustre and the worse dish was probably the spinach pizza as the mounds of spinach was flavourless and the middle of the pizza was a soppy mess.  Only dish we liked was the beef tartare, but the crusty bread that came with it was overly oily. The fries were poor too, overly oily and underseasoned.  Service was friendly.  Overall a disappointing Italian meal.
