e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw Second time eating at this beautiful spot inside of the Wynn-Encore resort. Even though it had been at least five years since our last visit, nothing has changed! It's still fabulous. Servers and host staff are very accommodating to your every wish. The decor is absolutely beautiful with a lush garden venue available for those who would like to dine alfresco complete with fireplaces and heaters for cooler weather. Menu is somewhat limited but complete in meat, fish and pasta categories. We decided to share a filet ( as ten ounce is the smallest available ) with pasta and a mixed green salad which we also shared. Our server placed everything in center of the table even going as far a slicing the filet for us. It was a true dining experience while listening to Frank croon in the back ground. To top it off we shared an over the top pana cotta and a flight of vintage ports from ten to forty years of age. There are many great  choices for Italian food in Las Vegas but as Steve Wynn says in the menu forward; I think Frank would really like this place- and so will you!
