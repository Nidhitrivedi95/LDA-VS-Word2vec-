nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ I really wish they would get some servers who had a sense of urgency. The last time we went i swore it off, but its right next to the movies. The food is really good. Ill either get a pizza or the veal chop parm on the bone. All the food is good but they have zero attention to detail and they are so slooooooooooooow. Last time was the worst. This time things started off well, appetizer came out quickly, food came fast too. Then it's just crickets. Sit sit sit sit.. I decided to walk around to find our waiter. No where to be found. I ask the hostess if she can locate him. She came back and said the guy is in the bathroom. I get it, guy has to go, but use ur head and ask someone to look after your tables if u r gonna be 20 mins. Finally, we got the check, i left 10 bux on 70 and a note telling them how slow they are. Im not going back anymore. It good food but not worth guarantees awful service.
