Orgm9nmcClxnAUva4nOKyA Came here for a Sunday brunch. The food quality was ok and the selection is not huge. 
The service was pretty poor. The hostess gave us attitude when we requested to change seat (it was pretty hot under the sun and we were literally melting) We asked for our bill and the hosted said she would let our server know and she never did. The service was very slow and our server was nowhere to be found for a good fifteen minutes. We had to walk to the counter to pay for our bill because we were not going to spend another fifteen minutes waiting for the credit card machine. I am not sure if I would come back again.
