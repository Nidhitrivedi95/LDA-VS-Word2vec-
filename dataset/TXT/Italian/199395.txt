pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I was disappointed.  The place is fun, cramped but cozy, and the open oven is awesome.  That being said, the pizza choices and ingredients were too yuppified for my taste.  No pepperoni!  Come on!  I was raised on the east coast where a pizza was a pizza, made often times by recent Italian immigrants who's English mainly consisted of "What do you want?" and "20 minutes."  My pizza had fresh ingredients and the oven flavor was strong, but I found myself yearning for a New York style pizza.
