eGTAC8EzcHiYnnZ52tijiQ I was looking for a new breakfast joint and saw all the great reviews for this place.  Checked it out today.  We had the tuna sandwich, greek salad, and their version of eggs benedict.  The tuna with dill and olive were awesome, the feta on the greek salad was very flavourful.  the eggs benedict came on foccaccia and was very filling.  Service was friendly.  Can't wait to go back and try some of the other items on the menu.
