G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q The service, food, ambiance and elegant decoration are worthy representation of the star chef Giada. Our favorite main entrée was the crab and scallops risotto, our favorite dessert was Giada's lemon cookies. We brought our own bottle and of wine, the corkage fee is $35 (very good price) we enjoy the signature cocktails at the bar before dinner. Andrew, our server was nice, patience and knowledge of the menu. This restaurant is perfect for a romantic dinner. The photo booth by the main entrance is a nice touch. We will definitely be back
