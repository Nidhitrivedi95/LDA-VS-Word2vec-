I heard all the hype about Cibo and how great their pizzas are, we I'm not sure what everyone's talking about because both pizzas lacked quality and taste.
 First off the crust is very hard and chewy, your jaw becomes sore after half a slice. Not sure what they put in their dough but this is way too tough (maybe need a little more yeast?)  It's almost like eating a cold hard sourdough with tomato sauce on it. 
The toppings were non existent, a few little sprinkles of sausage, and pepperoni that's it!  The sauce bland, and the cheese just okay, We ordered the meat combo, I don't mind paying for good quality, but for this small little pizza, and for the little amount of topping this was unacceptable.
 I have been to good quality "wood fired" pizzerias and they were loaded with toppings and full of flavor and wonderful sauce and cheeses. Cibo pizza lacked in all areas, I will not come here again - the ambiance was quaint and nice however the pizza and salads and the rest of the fare is unacceptable.  

1 Star for the ambiance 
1 Star for the pizza

I will not be back...unless I am going for drinks..
