lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ went for lunch and with 2 people it is the perfect time.  the lunch portions are good for just 1 vs the dinner portion which feeds a city.  had the soup and salad and it was a good size.  the minestroni was hearty and a touch of kick to it.  the salad was the size of a side salad and i liked to olives.  it was just $6!  would go back.
