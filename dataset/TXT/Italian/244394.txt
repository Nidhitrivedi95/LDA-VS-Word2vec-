uTBm1BXwhdUcLJy2-IIQTA First time eating here. It was highly recommended by a friend. Some of the best lasagna I have eaten. Obvious homemade sauce, with such a beautiful color! Very visually appealing. The ricotta and mozzarella were both delicious. The meat in the lasagna was tender and flavorful, with no gross squiggly things in the meat. You can taste the high quality of the ingredients. The service was excellent and the prices were very reasonable. I will definitely be back!
