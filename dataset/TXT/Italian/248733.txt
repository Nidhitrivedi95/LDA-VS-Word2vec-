VfxlkvZQkLr9tu_w1SU_iw Napoli Pizza location...(765 North Nellis Blvd. North Las Vegas, NV)...is the nastiest place to order food from. The food is under cooked and raw. When you speak to them about your order they tell you that the food was just fine and that your complaint will fall deaf ears and they will not do anything about. The manager...(Holl)...I think that is what they called him will tell you that he spoke to the owner and they will not do anything about it you either like or your out of luck.... this place is -10 stars. I wouldn't feed there food to animals. Notify the HEALTH DEPARTMENT FOR RAW FOOD WHEN ORDERED WELL DONE AND BBB ABOUT BUSINESS PRACTICES.
