pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw One of the best pizzas I have ever had. Highly recommend the Margherita pizza and Farmers Market salad. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant's history. The food is delicious and the prices are very affordable. If interested, ask your server about the background of this authentic Italian pizzeria and where the brick pizza oven originated.
