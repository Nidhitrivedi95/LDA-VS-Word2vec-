POzMNUmUWFNDinWrspiBEA Stopped in here tonight to pick up dinner on the way home - calzone with meatballs and sausage, which was very tasty and perfectly done. Attentive waitstaff and mellow atmosphere, although the juke switching between hip-hop and country was a bit disturbing. Can't say as I'll make a habit of coming in, but won't be actively avoiding it either.
