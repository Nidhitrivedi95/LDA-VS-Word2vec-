SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg I came here while visiting LV because my friend is a local and I was not disappointed. The menu is not overly complicated with a zillion options. I had the pork chops and my friends had the steak and salmon, the food literally looked like it came of the Food network, beautifully prepared and tasted great. Staff was very funny too!
