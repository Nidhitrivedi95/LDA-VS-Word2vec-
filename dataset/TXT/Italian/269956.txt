XL9aGjYi8dxieaL-L1TmHg One word, Wow! Caught me by surprise. My wife has been bugging me to be more adventurous with some of our local restaurants and I'm glad I finally took her advice. This place is awesome all the way around. Atmosphere, food, prices and service. We both ordered chicken dishes and they were so dang flavorful. Made me want to share on yelp. Don't hesitate to visit this joint, it's good folks!
