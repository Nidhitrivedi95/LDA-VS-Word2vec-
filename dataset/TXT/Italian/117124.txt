GW2_gqOhKQ7sI4oem6yP9w The food is good, better than most places, the pizza is really heavy on sauce and cheese, if you like that... I prefer mine a little lighter.  The food isn't the issue here, the service is.  They have messed up my order twice, once sending a totally different pizza, the other forgetting items.  For the price, which is higher than most, you would expect better... That being said the pasta dishes I have ordered have been good and large enough to eat all week!  They delivered my food but couldn't figure out my apartment gate code so I had to go down in pj's and get it... Kinda defeats the purpose to the point a bit... But overall if you want more than just pizza, order here.  Negatives:  they close very early, the white pizza they sent me instead of the one I ordered was disgusting... Clumps of ricotta cheese...? Positives: the capellini pomodoro is great!!! Cannoli was great, the flour-less chocolate cake not so much... Lots of vegetarian options.  They really should stay open later for delivery!!!
