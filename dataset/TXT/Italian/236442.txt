But seriously, I've been here multiple times, and each time the food and service has been excellent. I'm not a huge fan of pineapple pizza in general, but I tried their "Pineapple Express" for the first time yesterday, and now I've officially found one that I've liked and would even order again. 

I've also done takeout and taken advantage of their drive-through (!), which is super convenient and also allows you to avoid the cramped parking lot / valet.
