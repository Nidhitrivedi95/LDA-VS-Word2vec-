O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ I recently went to Sassi and was very impressed.  I think it's the surrroundings and restaurant that really got to me, but the food is great too. 

The restaurant looks and feels like an Italian villa...it would be a perfect, but pricey first date choice.

If you're looking for a noisy, family-friendly Italian restaurant, this isn't it. But if you want to have an intimate dinner with your significant other in an elegant setting, I recommend Sassi. And if you don't mind a third wheel, take me with you.
