dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw Came here at the request of a friend and it in no way disappointed.  I tend to think I'm a little too critical of a restaurants food, beverage, staff & ambiance and I was pleasantly surprised that Fiamma was great in all of these regards.  The host staff was very friendly and more than accommodating in our request for a different table.  Tim our server was professional yet charismatic and suggestive in dishes and beverages he liked.  The restaurant is clean and was very well maintained  throughout our two and a half hour dinner.  We ordered the Calamari for an appetizer.  This Calamari is different than most because it's served with crispy Pepperoncini that gave a great tart-vinegar balance to the fried Calamari.  It's served with a Basil Tocco sauce that was a little heavy for me but still very enjoyable - in moderation.  Both cocktails were terrific.  She loved the Blood Orange Margarita (made with puree) and the Dark Stormy cocktail I ordered was just what I was looking for.  Rarely do I ever order the same entree as my date but this deal was too good to miss.  Bone-in Ribeye Steak and Lobster for $75 each.  The steak was cooked to a perfect temperature but the meat itself was a little tough.  I still devoured it and it wasn't so bad that I once thought about sending it back.   Overall a great experience and I will definitely be back
