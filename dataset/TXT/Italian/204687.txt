qd2aT4pPmJkHb2cBO74UkQ This time we had a meal at Divino Enoteca. In addition to my previous review I have to add that they did very well to accomodate five of us on a busy Saturday evening during the Edinburgh Fringe. 
They were very busy as we expected. But we were all made to feel right at home and at easy. We knew we had to vacate the table by 8pm, but we were not hurried. 
The dishes were to the standard you'd expect from a place like this. 

The waiter recommened a very good wine for consuming with our duck - very enjoyable. 

If you have a chance to do so - visit them
