z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ "The D" is a very interesting place. Use the valet service and go up the escalator to the restaurant..hard to find. Authentic Italian / steak place. Biggest martini I have ever had! Waiters in tux and had great service. Sit in a booth. The grilled portobello mushroom with char grilled beef tenderloin and zip sauce for a starter was over the top and huge ...so share. We had Italian dishes that were so homemade. If the steak in the starter is any indication of how good their aged meat is..wow! They are famous for their desserts. You would swear the the old Italian grandma was in the back making them. We had the tiramisu ....heaven. We will be back for just steak next time.
