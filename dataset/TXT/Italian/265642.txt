wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw Nice chill but upscale atmosphere to drink a glass (or bottle) of wine. Love the outdoor seating! The bruschetta is amazing (every single kind I've tried I've absolutely loved) More often than not the servers are accommodating & educated with wine pairings (a couple of times I've felt rushed -when they weren't busy- & the server didn't know or maybe just didn't care to impart their knowledge about the wine I was inquiring about) Still a great place!
