IwMhD-JhfhEY_nk963h7Vw When I am in need of a simple, quick and fresh lunch, I always stop by Caffe Bacio for the bresaola panini or the trio salad combo (bresaola, prosciutto melon, and caprese). I'm craving a panini just thinking about Bacio! The pizzas are also freshly made and delicious, and you can't go wrong with the generous drizzles of truffle oil on most of the tasty brunch and lunch dishes on the menu! 

Rahier treats and a full bar are a plus, as well as the lovely baristas and waitstaff.

My only complaint? Feeling kind of rushed and uneasy when I haven't ordered food and am enjoying my coffee at a table technically reserved for lunch patrons between the hours of 12 and 3. I generally move to the window to make room for paying customers and hurry on my way.
