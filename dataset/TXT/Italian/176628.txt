nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ We went to the restaurant at the Venetian this time and it was sooooo good! The service provided by Santina was attentive and well provided. They have a great wine list, a bit pricey by the glass but good. We had the calamari for the appetizer and it was breaded lightly and tasty. We had the eggplant and chicken parmigiana both had pasta and were prepared flawlessly. I highly recommend this restaurant
