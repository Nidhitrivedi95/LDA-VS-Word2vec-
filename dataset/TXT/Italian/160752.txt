lJbxQFXqbgKBdHPKKxROMQ I came to Cenci's with my son's soccer team to watch a World Cup game.  We ate lunch and I was very pleased with the Calzone I ordered. It was huge and very good.  The price was right.  The service was not the best that day, but to the servers credit, it was a crazy environment with lots of separate checks requested.  I will certainly be back with the entire family and check this place out further.
