dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw Came to eat here this past Monday around 6, after a rough 3 days at Edc. We were sick, hungry and heat exhausted. We sat down and there were two bar tenders on duty. The bartender suggested what to order and it was probably the best food I've ever tasted! He told us we needed lots of carbs and they made sure our waters were full the entire meal, they insisted we take water to go and go sleep it off. After dinner we went to the room and slept 12 hours, waking up feeling much better! Thanks guys, you were more informative than the medic at the festival! Amazing service
