dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw My husband and I came in at 2pm on Friday. When we walked in the hosts were very friendly. They sat us within 5 minutes  of when we came in. But, they called me Liz. My name is Sara, so I don't know how they heard Liz. They did apologize a lot for it.

We ordered the Lobster Bisque, the steak bruschetta, and the chopped salad. The bisque was delicious! However, my husband's was tomato, wrong soup, and both bowls literally had soup all over the outside and on the plates, and was sloppily wiped off. It looked like someone had started eating our soup before it was brought out. With their hands.

The salad was split in two for us which was very thoughtful. But the salad maker forgot to put dressing.

We were waiting for a while and the waitress came and told us that they were remaking the steak bruschetta, because they had burned the first one.
Then it came out, and we noticed it had no gorgonzola, so we asked for it. The waitress offered to have them apply it, so it went back to the kitchen.
She came out a moment later and said the cooks told it was on there, we just didn't see it. Or taste it. So we asked for more. When it came back out, it was delicious. The meat was flavorful and tender. The waitress told us the manager was comping that dish.:)
Overall, the staff was friendly, and the food was good. Seemed like the kitchen needed to be a little finetuned though.
