k3fn9JFiNLNy2q5p0cE1kg I was taken here for my belated birthday dinner..read some nice reviews on Yelp so decided to give this place a try. I personally think I was more impressed with the service than the food. The service was excellent, we were looked after to the T...checked up upon within reasonable time frames, poured our wine as soon as we were almost done to the last sip...so the service I would give 5/5...the complimentary bread was amazingly delicious...with rosemary, olive oil and salt...we kept on asking for more bread..omgoodness, we don't usually do this...

The food was nicely plated and presented but the flavours were more like a 3.5/5 at least for most items we all tried. We ended up opening 2 bottles of wine that night, we ordered the scallop, tuna tartar (this was the best dish) with the taro chips, grilled calamari..

When I checked the menu online, I was a bit surprised they had Osso Bucco becuz that is not a dish you see at most Italian places so we decided to give that a try, the veal was tender but the taste didn't hit the notes for me...

We ended up ordering 2 pasta(s), we overhead the truffle pasta was suppose to be delish so we tried a small portion of it. Yes it was good but it was also pricey when we legitimately had one strand of spaghetti each...LOL...

All in all, I think this place has impeccable service with a slight bit above average for the food. Hence, I gave this a 4/5...mostly was for the service..they deserve to be credited..

I'm not in a huge rush to come back due to the pricing for Italian food. I still have other places to try...
