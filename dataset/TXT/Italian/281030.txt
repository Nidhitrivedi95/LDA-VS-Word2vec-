yRTwPIAjJ5u7Nqg8TeeE7A My friend and I had been to the Renzie's Rose Garden in the morning, and since she used to live in the area and has eaten at Cenacolo/Fede Pasta several times for dinner, she took me there for lunch.  Oh, my goodness!  Such a delicious meal, from the wonderful, light, crispy bread with honey butter plus olives as a complimentary starter to the perfect arugula salad with sweet dressing and salty shavings of parm plus red and yellow cherry tomatoes to our pasta entrees: mine tarigolini with crabmeat, lemon and chives and hers gnocci with goat cheese sauce.

Slightly expensive for lunch since the "lunch" and dinner menus are identical, but the meal was worth every penny. My friend ordered tiramasu for dessert, even though we both had to take half our pasta entrees home. At the end there was a tiny amoretti cookie for each of us and a tiny portion of lemoncello as a "palate cleanser."

I also bought some fresh pasta and some asiago fresca at the Fede store.  My husband is Italian and makes his own pasta, but even he will be delighted by the fresh pasta I brought home. What choices.

You must try it!
