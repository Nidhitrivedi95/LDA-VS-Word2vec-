2QBD8wYCrwgOGRfHKvS23w VERY BAD EXPERIENCE!!! First let me put out there that that I've had many different pizzas in many different regions in the U.S. Including New York, Chicago, and Phoenix. The restaurant atmosphere was very nice, and from the time I walked in I was instantly reminded of a Brooklyn Pizzeria. Well this quickly changed! The pizza came to the table, I let it cool off for awhile before picking up a slice which instantly fell apart in my hands, so now I have to use a fork and knife to eat 95% of the slice, GREAT! So I eat that slice with a fork and knife, which was very greasy by the way. In my 19 years of eating pizza I don't think I've had worse. So at the end of the meal when the owner was making his rounds to talk to the customers, I simply told him I wasn't too impressed, but it wasn't a big deal. He immediately snapped with a rather rude attitude, as I explained my issues with the pizza saying that I don't know anything about pizza as he walks off into the back. His daughter then thought it was appropriate to make a rude comment to me and my friend. At this point we walked out noting we would never be going back! SIMPLY JUST A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!
