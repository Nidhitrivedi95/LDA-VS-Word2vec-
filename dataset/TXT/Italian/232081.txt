TIYnquDIPdYmVJK4GNeXSQ Stopped in for lunch. Meals were delivered timely to our table. Food was good, service was good.  The table top tablet screens have games to play while waiting on food. The trivia game allows you to play against other patrons. While trivia games are free at restaurants all over town. Olive Garden chooses to charge $1.99 without ever showing the charge in a well marked manner. Hostess should tell guests when seating that there is a charge. We were vey surprised when waitress asked which person would be paying for the game.  We would never have even kept the tablet on the table had we known.  We complained and waitress said GM will look at putting a tape with price for notifing customer of price in future. Disappinted Olive Garden would choose to tick off table after table over $1.99 hidden fees.
