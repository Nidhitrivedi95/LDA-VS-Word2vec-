7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ CarneVino was a tremendous disappointment.  Dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine came to just over $500.  It was by far, my worst meal of 2012.
For starters, we ordered ZACH'S CHOPPED SALAD and CANNELLONI.  The salad was decent but the cannelloni was bland, cold, and a complete waste of calories.  For the main course, we ordered the rib eye for 2 which tasted like it had been deep fried in old oil and was certainly not worth the $150.  In addition, we had the potatoes and broccoli.  Both were cold but the potatoes were likely prepared in the morning and warmed in the microwave a few times prior to our service.  The broccoli consisted of only the inedible broccoli leaves.  We had a few stems and a hint of a floret.  
We refused to give up so persisted through dessert.  We ordered the Lemon Curd Semifreddo.  Obviously, nobody at the restaurant has any idea what Semifreddo is as we received a ball of lemon curd ice cream which was completely inedible.
You would minimally expect an Italian restaurant to serve a decent espresso.  It tasted like coffee grounds and couldn't even be gagged down.
To add insult to injury, the ambience consisted of extremely loud, expletive filled gangster hip hop music!  We could barely hear each other speak and heard several others complain while we were waiting for our table (which was only available 20 minutes after our reservation).  The staff just laughed it off and behaved as if everyone was just being overly sensitive
The wine list was impressive but ridiculously expensive and the patrons are not trusted to test the wines themselves.  The restaurant sommelier tested our wine before it was brought to our table!  I have never seen anything like it and hope to never again.
I wouldn't even recommend this restaurant to someone lacking taste buds and with money to burn.  Just eat the money as it will be far more satisfying.
