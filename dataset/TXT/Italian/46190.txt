8pmGz3Lg4f_r7HdDZPa4dQ Just had a great experience here! Could not decide between getting a sandwich and trying the pizza so my colleague and I split the pizza and each ordered a sandwich. I can safely say I just had the best meatball sub I've ever had and loved the pizza! The owner Vinny is a great guy and very helpful. Strongly recommend this place and will definitely be back!
