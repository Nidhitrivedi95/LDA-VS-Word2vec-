QFTIBvLlcOPqBe5byK4ZIg MUFFULETTA SUB! These guys make em fresh every day, & they are terrific! As a matter of fact, all their stuff is great. You can eat it there or carry out and have it later! The place does lasagna, eggplant roulettes (which are out of this world), stuffed shells, pizza by the slice & a variety of other subs and pastries. It is a neat little bistro / market, and it is clean as a whistle and the staff is just as nice as they can be.. highly recommend Verdi's. It's a gem.
