viji5rHhNlsy9w-JmUhyaw Started with a bit of a snafu.  We were quoted a 30 minute wait.  Our buzzer went off about 35 minutes later.  When we went to the hostess stand, they said they seated another group who said they were us.  I asked if they had one of the OG's pagers like we did and the girl said no.  I was a little peturbed because we  woke a sleeping toddler and then had to wait another 15 minutes before they found us a booth.  They clearly knew they made an error and apologized and offered us a free appetizer for the blunder.  After we were seated it was smooth sailing.  

We ordered the fonduta for the app.  I would not recommend it if you're paying for it.  The gouda sliced cheese the put on top is not melted, so it's a bit odd.  The poppyseed bread it's served with was tasty however.
