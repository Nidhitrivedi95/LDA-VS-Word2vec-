D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA I would highly recommend this place! Came here last Friday and while somehow they didnt have our reservation, they were luckily able to find us a table within about 15 min. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating and apologized for the mix up. The atmosphere is very cool inside and the way it is decorated is awesome! Warning - the place is loud so dont expect a quiet dinner. It was totally fine for our group but just an FYI.

The food here is truly amazing. Everyone in our group of 8 was impressed with their food. Some of the highlights of our meal were the bolgenese, the beef heart, the pesto bread, the EVO salad, and the Oreccchiette.
