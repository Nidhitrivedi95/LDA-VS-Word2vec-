xly3K2HgsjvZs5Mu9kSFxg We have been here before and the food was so much better. This time the food was so awful that we won't be coming back again. their landmark dishes, were horrible. They tasted like they had been sitting around in the kitchen for a while as they were lukewarm and a bit soggy (and not very tasty). I also had a salad and the lettuce was tired, the dressing and chicken had no taste -and the waiter never came by so that we could have possibly tried something different. The meal was expensive and a huge disappointment.
