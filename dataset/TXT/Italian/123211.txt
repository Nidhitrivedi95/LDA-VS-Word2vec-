HKsDnEbwZ6DYKqEWtVdWJQ This place will make you say, Vale!  Packed for dinner, this place still manages to make you feel extra special!  Gino, our server, was very energetic and attentive...and knew his Italian!  We ordered the salmon, halibut, rigatoni, and steak ravioli.  All was delicious and HOT!  The star of the night was definitely the Cacio e Pepe, which we shared with our salads and soup.  You MUST order this dish when I'm Rome :). The only drawback was the volume...definitely a little loud, but that's what you get when a restaurant is so popular. We didn't sit at the bar,  but it was full and lively.  The crowd is much smaller at lunch, so check it out midday for a quieter experience.
