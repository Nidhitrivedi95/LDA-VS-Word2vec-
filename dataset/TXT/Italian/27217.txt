4RL5ydKIIFpU8bevsOKRdA Slowly, this place is carving out a special place in my heart.  It all started with a Yelp event at the Ballantyne location, then late bites at the Woodlawn location after catching a flick at the theatre across the way, and now, infinite delivery orders from the Uptown location.  

Everything here is pretty good, but not blow-my-mind good.  The pizzas are pretty plain if you get something basic, I'd recommend going with one of their specialties like BBQ Chicken or the Harvest pizza.  I used to be a fan of their linguini in clam sauce (adding shrimp), but after ordering it like 3-4 times, it doesn't quite have the "it" factor.  Their subs and heroes (what's the diff?) are tasty and fresh.  Two things really stand out though:  Boylan soda and garlic knots.  If you've never had Boylan soda, yer missin' out, bub.  The root beer is what root beer should taste like.  Truth:  I've ordered delivery just to get root beer.  I love that they have it here.  Garlic knots?  You haven't lived unless you've had their garlic knots.  So good they have slayed many a vampire.

Food aside, their service truly stands out.  I shot them an email about a 50% discount that they had said they would apply to my last order.  You see, they were slammed and my order was late.  The chick on the phone was really nice and I didn't really care for the discount, but it was nice to offer to take care of it for me.  Well, she didn't - and that's when I sent an email.  Just doing my part to better all Charlotte businesses and make sure they follow through!  Anyways, within 24 hours, Mike emailed me back and handled the discount quickly and with no effort on my side.  Being responsive is the key attribute in good service IMO.  Hell, they could screw things up all they want, but if they are answering my questions and putting forth effort, you can't really ask for more.  Handled perfectly.  

Libretto's #1 fan here.

dmo out.
