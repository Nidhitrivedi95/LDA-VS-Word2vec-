yEgnxd3aUUgUoG7qJiuDlQ This gem of a restaurant has to be one of Toronto's best kept secrets. It has been there forever and you would think that things would take a turn for the worse as time goes on. Not the case, this place serves the most delicious steak tartare. The service is friendly and efficient and the food is cooked to perfection.Highly recommend the steak and asparagus.
