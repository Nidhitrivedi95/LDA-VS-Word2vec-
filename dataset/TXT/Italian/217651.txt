RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q This place has become one of my new Chicago style Pizza places in this area. Been driving past this restaurant for way too long and finally decided to stop in and give them a visit.

They have a pretty good selection of many of the Windy City's mouth watering favorites. Inside is cozy and decorated with a traditional pizza parlor theme. There is also a nice patio outside for when the weather is enjoyable. Perfect during the nicer times of the year.

Their menu here consist of Appetizers, Salads, Baked Sandwiches, Pastas and plenty of Pizzas and Calzones. If you leave here hungry you are in big trouble. We always have a good portion of leftover pizza to bring home. Great for a midnight snack or when you have those late night munchies.

Extremely friendly service. They will let you order your pizza and split it right down the middle. You can go crazy with two totally different kinds. They put a small line of sauce that shows you where it changes. Nice!

So far we have tried a 14" Chicago on one side and the Combo version on the other. Came back a few weeks later and did a 14" half Canadian with Nicole's Favorite on the other side. Great flavors with some really tasty ingredients. The pizza sauce here is a Chicago recipe and sweeter than what you would get at a NY pizza joint. So get ready and don't be surprised.

Can't wait to try out their Italian Beef Sandwich and maybe a Chicago Steak Calzone. They even have Dessert. Saw the Cannolis last time but had no more room and was ready to explode.

Bring the family and friends. They will make you feel right at home. Get the thin crust so you can eat more without getting filled up. They also have thick crust for you dough lovers out there. PIZZA TIME!
