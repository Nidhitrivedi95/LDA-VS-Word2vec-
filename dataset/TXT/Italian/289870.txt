zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA I needed to get out last night, I work from home so some days I get a little Cabin Fever and need out. Last night I wanted to some good ole Italian Comfort Food, and it was not going to be Olive Garden. So I decided to give VinciTorio's a try.
The Restaurant was easy to find and park at. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server promptly. 
One issue I had was we were seated off in some corner in which we had no view of the dining area and were right in the path of where the service staff comes in and out. I know we had our 2 young children with us, but this corner should not be where you seat paying customers.

I ordered the veal tortellini w/ fresh mushrooms and peas in a tomato cream sauce. Delicious, maybe a bit overpriced at $14, but it came with a small salad.

My husband ordered a Stromboli; it was great and no complaints about the price. The sauce was also delicious.

My 4 1/2 year old had the Rigatoni with Cheese ($3.95) and a salad ($2.95). The cheese was a yellow sauce, weird, and then why so much for a salad for a kid?  The Rigatoni was overdone. I now have the feeling that they really don't want kids there. Put us in a corner, never asked if my son needed a refill, and put no thought into cooking his meal. He is a good kid and did not deserve a bad meal. I will say, he did enjoy his salad.

Here's what was truly lacking:
No offer of Fresh Pepper for the Salads
No offer of freshly grating Parmesan for the Pasta
No offer of Dessert
No refills of Water

Will I go back? I don't know, I think I'll be giving Cafe Boa a visit soon, as I felt I could spend the same money but get a lot more.
