XqSN1PtZkJ6QorOUa9AAdA I had the truffle filet and it was easily the best steak I've ever had. My husband had a pasta dish and even though the pasta is handmade it wasn't anything to write home about. I also had wasn't crazy about the ambiance and the service wasn't what I would expect for a restaurant in his price range. Definitely worth visiting for the filet alone!
