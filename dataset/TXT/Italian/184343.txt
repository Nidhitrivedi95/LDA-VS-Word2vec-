They have a daily special (outside the listed menu items) that has an interesting mix of ingredients as well. Saturdays are also "tax free Saturdays". Garlic bread is also a must try and they have a massive helping of ice cream on top of a brownie if you still have any room left after the meal. 

My favourites are the italian sausage, tettrazini, jerk chicken and the classic spaghetti and meatballs.  Their seafood options are good as well, non-pasta options are homemade lasagna (meat and vegetarian).
