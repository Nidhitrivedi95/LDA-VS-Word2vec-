xmWs-su5eB5_57CIw4sqfw We had dinner at Gina's bistro on a Wednesday evening.  The atmosphere was very charming -- a small restaurant with a romantic setting that makes it a great evening out.  The food was fresh and delicious, the service was top-notch, and the prices were very reasonable.  We loved it.
