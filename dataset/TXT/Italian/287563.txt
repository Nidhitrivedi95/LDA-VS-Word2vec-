zluk4cL7Ch-uRlRply42ZQ I enjoyed dinner, Italian or not. Client dinner large group, drinks, appetizers, desserts,  one of more expensive entrees. All good in my hood because I don't pay for a thing, client dinner, front table. Has to be the only decent restaurant in the unfortunate city that is Mentor. 

Waiter was good and shared specials for the evening with an entertaining amount of pomp. He was younger and gave me somewhat of a difficult experience because I was the youngest person at a table of nine. Timely service and preparation with each course, you will see, if not, go back again.  I would actually give this place five stars had the waiter not tried to challenge my elegance. Water under the bridge now and he filled my glass diligently.
