6okGKL2PA7kkc-GjZzNHnA - Wine selection: 3 stars
- Wine sampling: 5 stars (more than just the regular 1sip-to-tease-you, you actually get a two mouthful sips tastes if you want to sample any wine by the glass)
- Wine temperature: 2 stars (pinot noir was on the warm side)
- on the table unfiltered olive oil in-house blended with herbs and garlic + plus top of the shelf Parmesan cheese (in Wisconsin, I knoooooow!!!!!!): 5 stars (tip: ask for more bread, it's sinful!)
- stuffed pork chops - 4 stars
- salad -2 stars (ask for 'dressing on the side) and still, it may give you heartburn
- music level: bare minimum, great to cary on private conversation (or listen to the next table neighbor cell-phone conversation).
