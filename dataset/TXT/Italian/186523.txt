Orgm9nmcClxnAUva4nOKyA Excellent stop for a Saturday night. The calamari was amazing. Bonus they serve wine from the local region. Service was excellent and top level checked in more than once. We ate on the patio but the inside also was excellent. Family- toddler friendly for a nice night out on the town.
