a-Mo7Ipu_c5y21mmg0-F7g Excellent food (fresh & authentic & delicious), cozy atmosphere and a great chef and a happy polite waiter.  We had grill sea bass & grilled vegetables & gnocchi and chicken linguni alfredo. The dinner was amazing & grilled zucchini mashed pumpkin amuse Bouche on the house. Super reasonable prices too. Thank you chef Marino, we will be back!
