SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg I went here with my wife and sat at the bar.  Great romantic atmosphere.  This place has all of the prohibition Era drinks and the bartender was fabulous. A lot of local people here and ...not the strip.  The happy hour prices are a great value.  I had the meatball appetizer with a Boulevardier and that was a perfect combination of food and drink. The  ribeye with garlic mash and the Brussel sprouts for dinner.    Great food/service/people/ambiance.
