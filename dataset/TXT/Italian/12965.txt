0xzmIBsJQc5eUNLucFrZ0Q Okay, I'm gonna try to go short, but if you've clicked through my reviews, you know that's nearly impossible for me.

Bad: our server kinda grated on my nerves, like he was irked with us. wtf, man.  But this other guy in a suit came over to serve + chat with us a couple times, even tag-teaming our server in reviewing our dessert choices, and that was pretty nice.  Maybe it was b/c I asked a bazillion questions (like whether arugula was a highlight green or main green in the salad where it was listed, and he got confused, and my friend "translated" for me -- I know I say things strangely, but -- really? boo.)

Good: food.  Duh.  I wasn't feeling my best, I'm not sure what was wrong -- but (starting at the beginning): the cranberry bread served with the cheeses was delicious.  I avoided the strong cheeses but loved whatever mild one was plated.  Sampled my friend's ravioli -- she had leftovers, but if I were feeling normal, I bet I could have polished off all 6 of those delicious pasta pockets.  My other friend ordered the Bosco pizza -- Wow.  That's all I can say.  More than enough for 1 person, especially when you add in an appetizer or salad.  Since I wasn't feeling tip-top, I ordered the cucumber salad -- perfect for me: light, refreshing.  Any other day,  there's no way it would have been enough, since it was so light, and a good-sized but still "side" portion.

Each of us had our fave dessert in the sampler too: mine was the tiramisu, was has to be one of the best I've had; another friend swooned over the cannoli; I super enjoyed the bambolini/cream puff; and the cheesecake was pretty good (nothing uber-special to me, but I'm not a huge cheesecake fan).

Definitely a surprise-treat, overall, since I didn't think we were planning on eating at so many nice places -- but it was fab :)
