k4PFaATcPO0tvTetNbdm8Q Very disappointed with this restaurant.  Went this past Saturday night for a light dinner and a glass of wine.  Patio was packed, but lots of space inside the restaurant.  Unfortunately, didn't read any reviews prior to eating there, and made the mistake of ordering the ravioli.  It was undercooked, drowning in butter and had the consistency of cat food.  The waiter was not at all concerned with the fact that the dish wasn't being eaten.  When we suggested he may want to mention to the chef that there were negative reviews on Yelp, the waiter stated, "I think we're doing just fine."  Totally dismissive and rude.  Couldn't have cared less that we were unhappy and not eating our food.  If you like crappy food and negative attitudes, you'll love this place.
