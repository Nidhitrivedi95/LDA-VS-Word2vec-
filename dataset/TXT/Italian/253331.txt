VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w FANTASTIC experience at LAVO! It was a wonderful birthday dinner choice and they went the extra mile to make sure each guest was happy. We were a little late (it's VEGAS) after all and they made us wait an extra 20-25 mins, which was a bit excessive but we got drinks and got over it! If you are looking for a nice restaurant in vegas that can accommodate few to a lot of people, check out LAVO!
