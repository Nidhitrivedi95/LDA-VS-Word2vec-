I ventured here with a friend, and we were both pleased with our experience. The staff was nice and quick to serve us. I had penne con pesto, and I enjoyed the tomato basil sauce a lot. With a sprinkle of parmesan on top, I scarfed it down. The chicken was cooked well and the sundried tomatoes were great in the mix.

It also has a separate room for large groups having a special occasion. I loved the large windows, letting natural sunlight illuminate the large space. 

The gelato is delicious. I had pistacchio, and I will probably order the same flavor the next time I come in.
