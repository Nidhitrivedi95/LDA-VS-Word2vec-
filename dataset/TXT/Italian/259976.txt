wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg I've been meaning to try this place for awhile now!

i went on a Tuesday around 5ish pm, thank goodness i did! Because when i was done my meal the restaurant was starting to get packed

Decor is very nice, this is one of the only places that had a nice basement washroom.

Server was amazing! He recommended the good stuff and surprised us, the bartender mixed up a drink for me. Delish

The server would go outside and refill customer's dog water.

NOW ONTO THE FOOD!

I ordered the Basta, that was alright. It was good but i have yet to find a cream sauce that has blown my mind.

My boyfriend got the "Paesana-Fettucini with Italian sausage & fresh peppers"

It was amazing, next time i go i will probably get a tomato sauce or rose sauce based pasta!

Their brushetta was somewhat a disappointment and it came after we were done our pasta (it was the appetizer) The bread was rock hard.

The bread at the table isn't fresh, just regular bread.

Overall food 4.5/5
Service 4/5
Price 4/5

I will definitely come again and try the Vaughan location as well! Apparently this location is the original.
