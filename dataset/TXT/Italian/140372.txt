jkK0tP2Emh0nvKN5lHwtSw I recently ate there and was disappointed, both with the food and the service. First of all I ordered their "angus striploin", which incidentally, looked and tasted more like a $2.99 Longos special. I know my cuts of meat, and it definitely was not an angus striploin. There was also absolutely no seasoning. I sent it back and decided to order a pasta dish - linguini and clams. Well, to my dismay, as soon as it was placed in front of me, the foul smell coming from the dish told me that the clams were not fresh, that being an understatement. Also, the pasta was overcooked and dry and basically completely stuck together. I decided to taste a clam, which was a bad idea. Not only did it taste horrible, but it was also full of sand. I felt bad calling the server over again and making a scene so I decided to wait for her to come to me to ask me how it was, which I believe is something standard for a server to do. Well, I was disappointed again because, even though I did not touch the rest of the pasta, and even though she came around at least four times to see how everyone else was ( we were a group of 12), she never once approached me to ask me how it was. I know she saw the uneaten dish, and then had the gall to bring me the bill, charging me for the pasta. I will definitely never go there again, and I would not recommend it to anyone.
