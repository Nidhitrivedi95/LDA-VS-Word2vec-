kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Overpriced salmon added - We went to this place because it was my birthday and we had not tried it in the past
I ordered the superfood salad and on the recommendation of the waitress had salmon added to it - she did not tell me how much the salmon was going to be and I made the mistake of not asking for a center cut piece of the salmon 
So salmon was not good - was not grilled enough to have good taste and it was the end cut and they charged me $12 for this piece of salmon which was just outrageous 
I did enjoy the salad and should've just had the salad 
I complained about the quality of the piece of salmon and thought that maybe she would respond - she just looked at me and cleared my plate and walked away - my husband did have the pizza and said it was OK - then we got the bill
Yikes Our bill was $43 for pizza - salad with a piece of salmon which was outrageous - we live in Scottsdale - we go out to eat a lot and we have never paid $12 to add a piece of salmon to a salad anywhere anytime anyplace 
So after another complaint they did give us credit but the woman that waited on us was very short and brisk
And the manager never came over to even talk to us - we will not be going back to this place - we felt they were rude to us despite the fact that they gave us credit for a piece of fish that certainly didn't cost them much
