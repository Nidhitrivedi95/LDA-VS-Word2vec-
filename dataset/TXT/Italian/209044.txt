qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg Looking for a nice and reasonable resto, so we ended up here and to think so close to where we live. Nice place and good staff.. The owner was there too assisting and or helping them. She's so nice too. 
I had lamb roast gyro and my boyfriend had the traditional gyro. We had the traditional platter as our appetizer . Food was delish,and salad was fresh , loved it. 
Would recommend this place and I'll go back their again..plus the owner gave us a 15% discount card on the next visit. And oh if you have a LVAC member card you have a discount ( show it upon paying).
