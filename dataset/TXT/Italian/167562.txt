Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw I'm not Italian. I'm definitely not from the east coast. I have never seen The Godfather or The Sopranos. But I believe this place offers great Italian food. And by reading other reviews, I am not alone in this assessment. 

I love this place. I love that several of the customers and the owners act like they're family. I love the deli and the various Italian products. I love that when I was feeling under the weather and craving soup, they had pasta fagioli (and other soups, too) Do you know how hard it is to find a big  bowl of hearty soup around UNLV? Their caprese salad was a bit pricey at first glance ($8.99) but they give you a lot of fresh sliced mozzarella with basil and garlic. Again, where else am I going to get caprese salad within reasonable walking distance from campus? I am sad I didn't come sooner.
