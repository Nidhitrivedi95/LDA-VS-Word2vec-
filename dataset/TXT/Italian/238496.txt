u_s0zWoTlX7PoYDjtKAK2w I'm not sure if the fellow at the corner was the owner or just staff but he was rude. I ordered a Margherita pizza and it was disgusting. It looked and taste like can crushed tomates with onions as the sauce. The crust was hard and dry tasted like cardboard. Im not sure what herb it was but it surely wasn't fresh basil. This pizza had absolutely no taste to it. My boyfriend ordered a chicken calzone and said it had no taste. The wings were mediocre. Save your money and go somewhere else. I will not be returning!
