UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ We stopped for lunch on our way home from the airport and a little shopping. What a pleasant surprise. This restaurant is plenty large for ample seating and is a very nice ambiance with classy atmosphere, Delicious meal choices and a great selection of wine. 
We usually share to avoid over eating and had the shrimp Mediterranean "specialty", shared the chopped salad $4.95 entree addition and a 9oz glass of rose.  It was perfect for two! I would certainly return here again if I was in the neighborhood.
