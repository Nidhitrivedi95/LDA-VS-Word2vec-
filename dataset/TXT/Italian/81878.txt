We started our dining experience with the grilled octopus and calamari! The grilled octopus had a very ceviche-feel to it, rich in citrus and lime flavors. Be warned though, there are very few pieces of octopus. It's an appetizer, so you can't expect that much more I guess. The calamari was also really delicious, perfectly crispy! The dipping sauce was a mixture of sweet and savory! Both are great appetizers!! I chose the duck breast as my main course. I was surprised by how little food came on my plate. There was a small piece of duck along with a spoonful of mashed potatoes and 4 pieces of brussel sprouts. I got my duck medium, which is what the chef prefers. The duck was rich in tangy flavor, very tender and juicy! It had a nice crispy skin as well. The brussel sprouts were nicely seasoned, not too salty or overpowering. Wish there were more pieces though! The mash potatoes were so-so. It could use a little more salt or other seasoning  because it tasted rather bland. Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience at Felice! 

Apparently there are three stories, but I only explored the first floor and was already impressed! The servers are all super chill and friendly, dressed in casual clothing, so don't be scared to be comfortable!
