7iZYl52Gtica73shRYsuMQ We went here because we received a gift certificate and wanted to check the place out-- the pasta was delicious! I ordered the italian sausage/goat cheese rigatoni, she ordered the vegetable penne. I totally thought the veggie penne was going to be the generic, safe, boring dish, but the staff recommended  it and it was great! Light while still remaining flavorful.

And the portions are definitely large, at least in the pasta department-- like "Carrabas giant bowl of pasta" large. We ate the leftovers for dinner the next night.

Wine was delicious as well-- lots of nontraditional Italian stuff. Only issue is the ambiance-- the spot was definitely bought from somewhere else before that had a different vibe. Tile floors, huge high ceilings, giant windows-- sort of the opposite of "cozy italian" that you'd expect from Mother Francesca. 

But overall a great experience, and we'll definitely be back!
