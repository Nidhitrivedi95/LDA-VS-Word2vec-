The old school professional service was also refreshing -- our server actually knew how to properly serve a bottle of wine, which I don't often see in Scottsdale. We had the scallop & shrimp appetizer, veal cannelloni, a chicken dish, and the apricot-almond bread pudding. I say "a chicken dish" because while it was juicy and tender it wasn't a stand-out, but both the app and the cannelloni were simply outstanding -- well-seasoned and not overcooked. The bread pudding was good, but I wouldn't have it again...too many calories for not enough pay-off! Wine list was also nice, with some good values at the top end, but I'd like to see more quality wines at the $45-65 price point. Also, the bread was just OK. For a place with "pane" in the name, I'd expect fantastic bread -- but the prices are up there, so we're not there to fill-up on bread! We'll be back.
