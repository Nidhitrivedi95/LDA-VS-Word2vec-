-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q Maybe this is the traditional way for pizza but we both thought the thin crust made it too soggy. I'd rather not have to cut it with a fork. The antipasta salad was OK. The calzone with the added sausage was a little bland for me. The desserts, however, were great. My wife had the cannelloni and I had the cheesecake with the raspberry topping. We wouldn't come back unless we could take home a dozen of each dessert!
