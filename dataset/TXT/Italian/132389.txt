Ijw0d-2wTcsciDesjCVgsA Pleasantly surprised.  Stopped in for lunch today and got their pizza by the slice.  Now usually when you go to a pizza place and get the pizza by the slice it is dry and has that "been sitting under a heat lamp for 4 hours" taste.  This pizza did not.  It was just the right temp, the pepperoni was perfectly crispy (a huge plus for me) and there was an awesome amount of cheese compared to sauce (not big on sauce in general, so I am always happy to find a place that doesn't drown the pie in sauce).  Grabbed some ranch for the crust.. The ranch was a great consistency and had nice season to it.

I'd go back.
