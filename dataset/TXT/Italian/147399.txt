KAhavksKQwKbMzZHiNOyOQ Went here a while back for dinner with a bunch of co-workers. We're from San Francisco, and yes, we're food snobs*.

Not one of us had a disappointing dish! The only thing that puzzled us, were the huge sized servings, that's not a complaint, however! :)

The bread was good, the pasta was fresh and I think (IMHO) my Eggplant Parmigiana (which is and Should be sauteed and topped with melted cheese, not breaded in Kraft shaky cheese -_-) was one of the best I've ever had. Sorry, mom, grandma..

Eggplant Parmigiana was perfectly cooked, nice slices, creamy on the inside with just a wee bit of crunch on the outside and delicious cheese topping as is most appropriate. 

Our waiter was a really nice and helpful guy, made it a fun night out while away from our homes.

On my next trip back I'll definitely hit Gino's!

*Most of the group were food snobs, the others are just freaking nice people.
