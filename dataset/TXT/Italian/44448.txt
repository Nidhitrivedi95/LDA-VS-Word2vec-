First of all, I'm disappointed that NO ONE ever offers green olives as a topping for pizza anymore...they just don't do it!! Why, possibly because the universe discovered I'm love with them...but on to the food...

I had the pleasure of eating here Christmas Eve.  Now, my crew sneaked in at a quarter til closing time, but they win cool points for several reasons:

1. they were actually still open.  you know everyone else shut down at 6pm and it was almost 10 when we got there.
2. The wait staff was very patient and even though they were probably cussing us out in the back, our food was DELICIOUS, HOT, AND FAST.
3. They have GREEN OLIVES as a topping for pizza!! (really, this should've been number 1).

We all ordered their dinner special, which for 9.99 got us an appetizer, entree, and drink.  Now, certain entrees came with either soup, salad, or bread sticks, but you could add either for a nominal fee.  I got the personal pizza and it rocked!! Super yummo!  My husband got the lasagna and said it was almost better than mine (which i'll take because he LOVES my lasagna).

So, it's not a question of if I'll eat here again, it's when!!  Kannapolis is a bit of a drive...nonetheless, I'll be getting the pizza again...GREEN OLIVES, FTW!!! (WOOT)!
