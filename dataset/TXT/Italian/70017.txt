By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g Came to meet my friends here for a "quick bite". Got here and realized it was more of a wine bar type of atmosphere and none of us wanted to really drink wine. So we just ordered food and beer. Played it safe with some fried calamari, seemed fine to me and nothing extra spectacular. For my entree myself and another friend ordered the fried chicken - tuscan style. Waiter said it was really good and one of the best sellers. When we got it, we actually weren't sure that it was chicken that we were eating. The four pieces were tiny and extremely dry. It was lacking a lot of flavor. Maybe tuscan style fried chicken means dry and unseasoned? 
I would definitely give this place a chance next time if I wanted to drink wine and have some fresh oven baked pizza.
