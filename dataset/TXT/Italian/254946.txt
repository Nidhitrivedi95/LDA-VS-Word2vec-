vxadNrpTY7OHNmWsrEpNnA Growing up in New York, the word "diner" holds a special place in my heart. When I moved south 7 years ago, there have been many places that call themselves diners, but this is the first to remind me of being at a diner in NY. 

From the row of older gentlemen, sitting at the countertop, reading papers, to the quality and variety of the menu, this is a NY/NJ diner. I ordered the Pastrami and Swiss omelette and was blown away by the amount of food, as well as the quality. 

If I was to offer any criticism, and it's subtle, but I like my hash browns to be a bit crispier than the ones I ordered. Otherwise, this will be my new breakfast home anytime I'm in Charlotte!
