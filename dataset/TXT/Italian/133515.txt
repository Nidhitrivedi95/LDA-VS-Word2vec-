im8sxT2V-drSvxP17qdb2A I don't know much about the italian food culture aside from pastas, pizzas, and calzones, but when it comes to ice cream and gelato, I'm all for it. After one of my cousins said that the gelato crepes at Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe were the best ever, I knew I had to try for myself. The place has a nice patio, and I imagine it would be a pretty popular spot in the summer. The prices of the desserts were very reasonable, bordering on the side of cheap for the portions that you get. There were three of us and we ordered a crepe to share and found the portions to be just enough. Mind you though we already had a lot to eat before that.

Tanti Bacci Crepe -Bacci ice cream, Hazlenuts, Nutella chocolate spread, and whipped cream

I think my cousin wasn't too far off from describing it as the best crepe he's had in Toronto. It was in fact very very good. It looks so simple, but it was the little details that made it much better than some other crepes I've had. 

First off, the whipped cream was real whipped cream. None of that artificial stuff that comes from a can. It was so creamy and really smooth. The two generous scoops of ice cream itself was like eating Ferrero Rocher. it had little bits of hazelnut inside the ice cream that somehow were still crunchy despite being refrigerated with the ice cream. The actual hazelnut bits gave it extra crunch, and weren't stale like some nuts you get from other crepe places. What impressed me the most was the crepe. it was made to just the right thickness and had a nice elasticity/chewiness to it. I think I would've enjoyed eating just the crepe by itself. I also wanted to point out that the chocolate sauce and crepe was folded in a way that the ice cream did not make the crepe soggy when it melted. Hard to explain, but as a result of it, even the last bite tasted like eating a fresh new crepe.

I can't vouch for anything else on the menu, but from this one dessert alone, II would definitely come back again.
