anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg Old school business and special occasion fine dining restaurant that makes classic dishes that are well prepared and taste excellent.  The veal Osco bucco was excellent and I could eat that with just my fork.  The pasta with meat sauce was freshly made and has a nice texture.  The side salad was huge and had nice tomatoes and mozzarella cheese balls that worked well with their sweet basalmic dressing.  All our desserts were fabulous.  The house Chianti was excellent and I suggest you try that as it was dark and fruity like a well aged cab that would cost much more than this house wine.
