r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA Their sandwiches are top notched their food is on my top 10 favorite places to eat staff is quiet but im sure they have to do some major multi tasking . they have tables inside and outside patio they get a huge lunch rush which makes it hard to find a table but seriously there's some good food there I give it I give it a AAA+++
