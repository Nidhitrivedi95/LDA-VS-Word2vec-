BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg Absolutely terrible.  The hostess said the wait would be 30 minutes. After 40 minutes I decided to check on how many people were left ahead of us. My group didn't want to wait much longer. The hostess looked up my name and said two tables in front of us. 25 more minutes go by and I see three more groups seated.  Go check to see why we were skipped and then told there are FIVE more in front of you.  I explained what the other hostess told me.  No apology. Just a shoulder shrug. So the originally quoted 30 minute wait, would've been at least an hour and a half if we kept waiting.  I gave up just after an hour. Had I been told the truth of 8(!) more tables in front of us I would've only wasted half the time.  Either the hostesses intentionally lie or they can't count or estimate.
