fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w I have been to this resteraunt before & my last experience was amazing! Good service & good food. I decided to come back so I made a reservation of 9 about a month in advance for a business dinner. It was very disappointing & embarrassing to get to the resteraunt with the rest of your party & the table you reserved isn't ready. The hostesses genuinely apologized & kindly told us we would get sat as soon as they could get us a table but that is still unexceptable for a party with a reservation. I asked to speak to the manager on duty which was Scott. He then Told us the same thing the hostess did. After about half an hour we get sat at high top tables (high tables with stools that have no back to them) apparently our table wasn't ready because the manager on duty Scott gave our table away to a walk-in. What's the point of making a reservation if your not going to hold the table for us? I even got a phone call the night before to reconfirm the reservation. I just don't understand! We also waited for our food for about 45 minutes. I once again asked to speak to the manager Scott which took him about another 45 to come ask me what's wrong. I felt like he was avoiding us because he felt bad for what he did so far. Besides all that the food was amazing once again, Scott comped us half priced drinks (which was the least he could do) our server Joey was great I know we gave him a lot of drama but we all knew it wasn't his fault that this happened. When we left the hostesses apologized once again which made it a little better to know it was sincere. Love this place but they need to work on management!
