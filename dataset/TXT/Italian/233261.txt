tngl2VZ4VGpK3qFpmU0NMw Came here because my boyfriend is absolutely obsessed with this place! 

Celebrated his birthday here - made the reservation a few days beforehand. Got a phone call a day before confirming my reservation. While on the phone, I asked if it was possible to do a tiramisu cake for his birthday.

We had the fresh mozzarella (amazing) and we both had pizza. I've had their carbonara before but it was nothing spectacular so I decided on their pizza. Don't remember exactly what it was called, but there was a raw egg which was great. Wasn't able to finish the pizza so we were able to get it to go. 

Waitress was great! She came by pretty often to make sure our food was good. She explained that the tiramisu typically isn't part of the Birthday desert but they made an exception. I do have to admit though, she disappeared as soon as she gave us our bill.

Overall good service and food. Would come back again!
