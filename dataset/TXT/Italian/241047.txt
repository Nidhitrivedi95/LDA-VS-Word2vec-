UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ Food was amazing and they brought back the lemoncillo pie the day we went in. They gave us a free sample. It was amazing. The guy at the bar was so friendly and bus service was so excellent that I wish I could afford to have tipped him more. Very friendly environent. Glad I moved to Chandler. If you want an amazing slice of pizza, make sure you hit up NYPD. PIZZA THAT SERVES AND PROTECTS....your stomach :)
