6We2O5X62J_gduXU7jvf8w Went here for the first time for my birthday lunch with some co-workers.  We had the trio of meatballs for an appetizer and they were delicious.  I got the spicy Italian pizza and it was good, but I honestly did not care of the pizza sauce.  It was very sweet and I was hoping for more traditional marinara.  I would be back but not to have pizza, maybe try a pasta.
