You walk into a lovely chic atmosphere with chandeliers and candlelight. The staff is truly amazing over the top attentive, at your service, warm and friendly. I'm seated in the corner near the kitchen overlooking the entire restaurant.  I kind of felt like the godfather here or godmother. 
I take a look at the menu and spot many of my favorites burrata and gnocchi so naturally, I have to order these.  Rosemary bread & olive oil, Burrata, Zucchini flower stuffed, Gnocchi paired with some lovely greek wine.  It was all divine the presentation and flavor on point. After all that I didn't think I could take another bite, but my server insisted I order dessert. I did, ordered the creme brulee which was Delicious!  
I would definitely come back to dine here as it was all you would expect and more.
