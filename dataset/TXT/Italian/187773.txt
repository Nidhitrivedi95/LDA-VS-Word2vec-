OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ My man and I had a late breakfast here on Saturday morning. It wasn't packed, thankfully cause I was starving. We ordered a large sandwich  combo that came with fresh made chips and drink. The sandwich was huge, made for four people it seemed, loaded with premium meat and fresh product, on freshly baked bread. The chips were okay, I think they needed more salt.

However, the waitress was a doll and the other people eating there were nice and also engaged in conversation. It was a good meal at the right price, and now I know they deliver!
