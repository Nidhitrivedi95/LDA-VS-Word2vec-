KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg I really like Neapolitan pizza. It is a huge thing back in DC and it is my first choice for sure. I came here with a group and was the martyr in the ordering process. The salad with the egg was probably the highlight. The menu was actually pretty small, but everything we had was really good. If I lived near here I would probably eat here somewhat frequently, though it is still kind of expensive for pizza, but it isn't so great that I would make the trip across town to end up here. A solid offering though.
