Romantic but great for a group of friends/family to share a amazing Italian dinner. The following are a must order as they all melt in your mouth: caprese salad, red snapper. We also had rack of lamb but I was too full from all the appetizers...it was more filling than a buffet. Pair all courses with wine as suggested and you will come out a fan!
