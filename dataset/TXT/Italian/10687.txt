This place is great! We were barely able to squeeze in a reservation during Labor weekend, but it was well worth it. The staff is extremely nice and tentative.

Their starter bread is amazing! They give you a basket with different varieties of bread as well a three toppings: Mascarpone  butter, eggplant, and citrus olive oil. This is probably one of these best bread starters I've had.

The best dish was the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti. Cocktails were delicious as well.
