qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA Tried this place out on a recent trip to Phoenix. Their food menu is pretty limited if you don't want a Panini or Bruschetta. However, they are good at what they do, and the panini that I had was great. It was different from other paninis that I have had, as it didn't have the grill marks and was made on focaccia bread. Big sandwich, so I'd recommend getting 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad unless you're famished.
