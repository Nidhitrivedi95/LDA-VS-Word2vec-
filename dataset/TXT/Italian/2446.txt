Our entrees were a salmon on risotto special and the eggplant parmesan.  Both reminded me of the finest Italian food I've had in much bigger cities at restaurants that charge a lot more.  The proprietors Frank and Deb know their regular customers and treat them like family, something you don't see in the restaurant business much anymore.

Given the paucity of fine dining in downtown Phoenix, the trip out to Chandler is worth it to eat here.  Next time we're in town, we'll be back.
