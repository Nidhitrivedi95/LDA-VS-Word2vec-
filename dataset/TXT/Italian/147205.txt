K99GG6-YZp5JbIe4oPbRsQ Located above Sacks on Indian School, this place is kind of a hidden gem. Or it was.

I came here w/ a group that had a reservation. When our reservation was made, we were not told we'd be experiencing their last night in business.

We got a salad and 2 of their popular pizza. Meh, Ive had better.In fact, Ive had better food from Sacks downstairs which is why I was very surprised when our waiter told us that the same people own this place.

Our waiter seemed flustered and was inattentive. Their patio looked nice, spacious, w/ a large fireplace.

We only stayed here for maybe a half hour.

I dont really need to tell you I wouldnt go back because, well, theyre closed!
