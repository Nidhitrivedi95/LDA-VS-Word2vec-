eGTAC8EzcHiYnnZ52tijiQ You cannot deny it, this place has it down. Amazing food at a great price, huge helping and great service. The Sunday brunch is out of this world good, but would recommend you go early to avoid the insanity.

Probably the best restaurant in Oakville, it's hard to beat this place
