RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q Best pizza I've had IN ARIZONA. PERIOD. HANDS DOWN.

As a girl born & raised in the Midwest, I'm accustomed to good pizza....good Chicago-style pizza that is: Hearty sauce and thick crust. So imagine my dismay upon relocating to AZ & being inundated with piddly thin crust pizza everywhere (like having pizza toppings on a Saltine cracker IMO) with weak sauce.

Luckily that's not the case with Spinatos! The Sicilian style pizza is exquisite. The crust is thick, the sauce is robust & sweet, and the cheese is pure perfection. They add spices on top and it really enhances the flavor!

Anytime I venture out & try a different pizza place I wind up disappointed & compare it (unfavorably) to Spinatos. Well, I'm DONE trying new/different pizza joints. Screw variety, Spinatos is the spice of life!
