WCqcYtJ4rUxA4bIzjOfzqg The concept around this restaurant is very cool and different.  The quality of the food is great and you get to watch the chefs prepare most dishes right in front of your while you wait.  Any of the pasta items are wonderful.

The place is slammed during lunch.. go at 11:30 to avoid the rush if you're in a hurry.

The reason this is 3 stars and not 4 or 5 stars.  It's ridiciulously overpriced.  You're going to pay $13, $14 or even $15 for a pasta lunch.  While the food is amazing, it's not really worth cost.
