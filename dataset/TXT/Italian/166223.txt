mDiFWhywAziq9SKnj6am_Q Initial impression was good. Cute patio and overall atmosphere. It ended there. Even though it wasn't busy when we arrived the service was bad and got worse. Took nearly an hour to get our wine and salad. Actually had to ask the waitress. During this time the place became busier and the service was notably erratic. A tablet that came in after us received the appetizer we had ordered an hour ago.  I had to request our good be served. Then the food came and it was poor. The mussels were the smallest I had ever seen. Main dishes mostly melted cheese. The table next to us had to ask where their wine order was. It final came and a bug was in one of the glasses. Never going back. Save your money.
