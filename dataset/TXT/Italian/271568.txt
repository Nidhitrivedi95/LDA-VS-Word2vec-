xrYcZxAHSfwO1BdtdxdVjw Great place to hang out! We stopped in here during the Glendale Chocolate Festival for a drink and to get away from the crowds. The bartender was super friendly without being overbearing, and he happily brought me a generous sample to try. They had a sweet moscato that I liked and enough unique brews to satisfy my beer-loving hubby. We didn't actually order any food so I can't way if that was good or not, but I love the atmosphere of this place and we'll definitely be back.
