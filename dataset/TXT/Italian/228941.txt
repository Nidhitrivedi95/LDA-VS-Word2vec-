SzHP4_x-ECuBDVK6npb-Ow Lo Cascio's has been around fo-eva.  I used to eat here all the time when I was in college (but only when my parents came to visit me- the rest of the time I was too po') and whenever I'm in the area now I still do. It's owned and operated by the cutest Italian family from Sicily.  I love Italian restaurants that are truly run by Italians, it just makes the food taste better. Could be all in my mind.  Who knows.  

The interior of the restaurant is cute, and it's a very casual place that works well for everyone...Families with little children, couples, friends and the list goes on.  

I love their ravioli, cannelloni and gnocchi.  If you go early though, you'll get their tasty food for much less.  You have to eat between 4 and 6 though to get the discounted prices.  Otherwise your entree will cost you anywhere from $10 and up.
