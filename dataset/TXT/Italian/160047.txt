LH8S1sUwxg2_TotePOFLvg If you like east coast greasy, cheeses, doughy, style pizza, then this is your place. Located in a strip mall at Pinnacle Peak and Scottsdale Road. They offer slices unlike most of the other places in town.
After selecting from one of the five or six slice options, they cook it in the oven and a few minutes later your slice is done. I dab the slice with a napkin or two to get the grease off. 
In addition to pizzas, they offer salads as well as full dinner entrees. And yes, they have the required checkerboard tablecloths.
