*Veal hot
*Chicken hot 

Hot is quite hot but manageable.  Some places, the *hot* is too hot and you can't even taste the rest of the sandwich.  And then in an hour or two you're gonna be paying for it (y'know what I mean?).  For the chicken, the sauce was really nice, tomatoe-y but not too heavy.  The bread sops it up nicely, and you get those really great soft bits.  The piece of chicken was thinly breaded, more meat to breading and the piece of meat was huge.  After I ate the sandwich I didn't need a nap, which I find with these types of sandwiches I always end up in a meat coma.  

The veal sandwich was really tender, like fall apart tender, and hubby says "I didn't feel like crap afterwards."  

If we're in the area we will be back!
