XVDR44P_74FmA0ANanm4CQ House of Pizza. Not to be confused with some of the other Inns and Huts. They can't hold a candle to the House. They've been here forever, and walking inside feels like time travel (in all the good ways). With specialties in pizza and subs, with Greek influences sprinkled in (like any good restaurant in the QC), you need to get to House of Pizza. Be prepared to wait, but it's worth it.

I've not tried the sandwiches yet (next visit), but the pizza is incredible. The sauce has great flavor but doesn't overpower, and they are generous with the toppings. Now, I'm not a fan of the floppy, ends-up-in-your-lap NY style pizza. House of Pizza has those big slices, but the crusty is substantial to support all the goodies on top. Finally, someone who gets what a crust should be!

The people who work here are absolutely great. The whole place feels like sitting in a relative's kitchen. One of the best pizza places in Charlotte, hands down.
