lsfFzCl7SXgoq8N5NjbvZA Wonderful place to be at! The restaurant was small, seemed like a family owned business. I really enjoyed my evening here, as the atmosphere was cozy and service was superb.

Our server was simply fantastic. He had an Italian accent, which was very pleasing to my ears for some reason (lol). He introduced us to the specials of the night, but it was quite overwhelming because there were so many dishes! I passed on the specials and decided to get a pasta. I wanted something simple that night and got a baked Italian sausage marinara pasta. My dish arrived smokin hot and looked so delicious. I think the best part of the night was putting that first bite into my mouth. I was in food heaven for a brief moment because the sauce tasted so good, pasta tender and Italian sausage just perfect. They really made the pasta well, had a very strong home cooked comfort food type of feeling (must have been the environment too)!

The restaurant itself was clean, but I didn't get a chance to visit the washroom. Perhaps I'll sneak in there next time and put it into the review as well. This is a perfect place to take your date or someone special. I will definitely be coming back! :)
