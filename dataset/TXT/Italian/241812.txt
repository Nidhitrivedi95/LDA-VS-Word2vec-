 This place has GOOD tasty food. You can smell the steaks grilling as soon as you open your car door. But that door to your car better be a sleek Benz or Lexus if you're a regular. The prices ain't cheap. The area is more upscale and prim, with tree-lined streets and quaint shops and the nose-in-the-air crowds, so you can expect them inside this trendy uptown spot.

It says "casual" but casual means your Siwy jeans (ladies) and your good shoes (men). You'll have a fun time, the service is timely and the waitresses are very friendly! I expected the aura to be more standoff-ish but the waitresses didn't mind that we took our time to order. 

We came on a Friday night and it was honestly PACKED and it was just great--a lot of the 20s and 30s crowd and drinks going around. I'd definitely come back here for tasty Italian.
