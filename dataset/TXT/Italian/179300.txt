nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A I was pleasantly surprised to how wonderful my dinner was.  I had the Chicken Piccata, which was quite tasteful w/a lot of flavor.  The pasta that came with piccata was the best tasting pasta, yet...it had so much flavor...I can still taste it, yum.  The Eggplant Parmesan and Calamari was just as tasty.  I truly was pleased w/how flavorful each meal was.  I definitely will go back and oh...we did go to Cake Boss's bakery...wow!  I had the strawberry tower, will not disappoint you, I promise.  Loved it!
Bought their carrot cupcakes, sugar cookies and  walnut cookies...will be baaaack!
