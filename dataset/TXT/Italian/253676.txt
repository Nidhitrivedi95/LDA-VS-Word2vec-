VtiHtLI2t0OjFjbrnR70lw We've come here for lunch about five times. Our go to is the arugula salad and one of the pizzas. Last time, we took advantage of their lunch special and had the tagliatelle bolognese with the salad. Everything has been delicious and the service has been first rate every time. We highly recommend and looking forward to going back.
