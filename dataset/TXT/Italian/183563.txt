oejQ4bWsJaKszf98xjNrrg One of my fav pizza places in York Region! The quality of their food is consistent every single time. It's amazing. 

Usually I always order my pizzas with extra sauce as most places don't put enough and I always ask for it to be well done (I just think it's so much better! Try it next time). But at Abruzzo's, their pizzas are sauced and baked just perfect to my liking. 

I just wish they weren't so busy but it's a good thing! I've ordered delivery a couple times and it usually takes 1.5hrs but a lazy pizza craving person can always wait :) oh also, if you have a party coming up and want to advise them of your order ahead of time, they are really great at ensuring you will get your party pizzas on the accurate date & time!
