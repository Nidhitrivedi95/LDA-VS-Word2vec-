j00iBr6uYnwgFs_J5y9f0w Aside from everyone there being exceptionally nice and attentive, the pizza is as close to buying pizza in NY. I'm a New Yorker who brags about how good are pizza is and I've tried many places that advertise NY pizza and I get the urge to box their ears because of the false advertising. You want NY pizza and live in Vegas, go to Rocco's. Oh, and they carry Wise Honey BBQ chips--need I say more.
