mJ_ucQ2_3hfTsmCcKb-hgw We visited for a family celebration on a Saturday evening. Seating was available inside at high bar type tables or outside at bistro tables. We chose outside and it turned out to be great. The menu can be previewed on their website and was not large but we found something for everyone with no problem. Our food choices all were delicious and service was good. There was a small but nice wine list. Afterward we strolled through the Saturday Market enjoying the various artists and vendors. All in all a lovely summer experience.
