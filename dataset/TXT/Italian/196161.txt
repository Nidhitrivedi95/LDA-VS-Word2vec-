PmwKGY3HLpcnC_-g0NCIvQ Thank you, K C N, for the clarification on the city location. So, me and the wife visited the new location and it is fabulous! Same menu, most of the same staff, and as before, great food and service! If you like Greek food this is the best you will find on the west side, IMHO.
