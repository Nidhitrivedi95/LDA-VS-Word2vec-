You can also get pieces of 'Kuchen' to take with you, with E2.50 a piece a slightly expensive treat, though. Worse even, when I opened the box at work, I was somewhat embarrassed about that the pieces were so small, as if I was a cheap-ass not wanting to be generous to my colleagues!
So, if you want a generous treat do not go to Planie!
