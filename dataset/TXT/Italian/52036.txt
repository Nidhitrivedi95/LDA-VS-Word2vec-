9NGXZyn-GHYB-vKC63gOag Food was good but not fantastic. I had the special eggplant Napoleon. Caprese salad was light and very tasty. The eggplant was crispy and not greasy at all, combined with the goat cheese it was great. The pasta was slightly overlooked and the sauce just didn't have that homemade taste. 

My husband had the chicken marsala which was really nothing special. I usually expect it do be lightly dredged in a seasoned flour and served with the Marsala sauce. But the chicken was naked and the sauce lacked flavor. There weren't even any mushrooms, but maybe that's just how I make mine. 

Most likely will go again to try the pizza because we have heard it's one of the better things on the menu.
