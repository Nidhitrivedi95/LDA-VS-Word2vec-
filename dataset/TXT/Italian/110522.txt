G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q The atmosphere and the view are the only reason this place gets two stars! The food was absolutely not worth the money! The scallops smelled terrible and the pasta was dry and cold, we have eaten in many restaurants in Las Vegas, so I can definatley say this is not a good place if you are hungry!!
