YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ I had a craving for pasta one night and thought it was a brilliant idea take a trip down the road from my house to Mac Shack. 

I was wrong. 

This place is seriously overpriced. I paid about $30 including tip for my boyfriend and myself for watery pasta covered in bleh (flavorless) sauce with skimpy portions of toppings. We ordered the alfredo and the rigatoni with some toppings. Certainly not impressed. The portions were not that impressive either. For the same price, I'd rather go to Olive Garden and have something tastier. 

Perhaps I didn't do a good job of building my own pasta there. But I swear I am - I can build a mean tasting pasta at home with some Ragu and store bought pasta with toppings lying around the house for half the price.
