rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg Got one of the turkey leg for $10 and the lady whose cooking the turkey leg seems to be in a hurry  I told the lady I can wait til its done cooking I guess she was in a hurry that she went inside the trailer and fry my turkey leg without even asking me if I wanted fried. I told her I want my turkey leg grilled not fried so she took my turkey leg out of the fryer and now my turkey leg is dripping with lots of oil. I told the lady I dont want that turkey leg since its dripping with oil and she she then proceed to cook the other leg for about 3 mins when I told her no need to hurry and I'm fine waiting but then she proceeds to gave me another turkey leg as I was taking a bite I saw BLOOD!
