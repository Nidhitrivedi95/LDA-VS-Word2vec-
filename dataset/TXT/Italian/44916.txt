8dSIAoz_UphMGpZr_uMing Should have called pizza hut or gotten a frozen pizza. The pizza's the same but without the high price and they've got a pickup system in place that can handle a few orders. After ordering online, going to pick it up after 25 minutes and waiting another 30 minutes because it was only going to take '10 more minutes' each time I checked on the order... Needless to say, we were sent away with the soggy cheese sticks, a 2 liter of coke and 10 bucks. With a promise for the pizza to be delivered in 20 minutes. #wewillsee  #notafan #70dollarorder #eatingleftoverswhilewaiting
