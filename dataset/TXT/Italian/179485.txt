nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Not sure if we were unlucky or what but our service was poor most of the evening. Starting with taking others ahead of us at the beginning. Perhaps it was the fact we had kids and they wanted to segregate us. Everyone else got bread immediately but I had to ask because the kids were hungry. Waitress really seemed preoccupied. Food was OK but nothing special. Very overpriced but I expected that on the Strip. Overall not a great experience.
