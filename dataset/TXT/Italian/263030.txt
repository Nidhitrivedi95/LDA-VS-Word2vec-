wVc3g-YfyDvkOLDecpr4DA I tried out Five Doors North for Winterlicious 2016. I must say, it was one of the most delicious places I have ever eaten. The server was attentive and even gave us extra bread after overhearing me ask if anyone else wanted more bread. The food was perfect and the portions were just the right size. I would highly suggest anyone give this restaurant a try.
