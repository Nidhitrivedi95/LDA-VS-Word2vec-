DZfFFSVFVJVxs3vfFVVf0w I went here today for the first time in months and it was exactly what I expected.  I have been going to this location for almost 10 years now, not very regularly.  Each time I go there I hope they are still in business because it seems most places in that plaza have struggled with the economy.  Sure enough, they're still in business.

I was pleased to know they still had their ALL-DAY 2 slices & drink special for around $4.50. 

2 Cheese New York Style slices and a Mountain Dew.  Great pizza, laid back atmosphere you should expect from an authentic NewYork Style pizza joint.

Just as good as it has always been - great pizza. I have also had their wings in the past and they're great too!
