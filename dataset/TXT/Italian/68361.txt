BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag you must order the Elvis. it is amazing. best French toast I have ever had. the bread is so so fluffy and the warm peanut butter is the best. the portion is huge and you won't leave hungry! I ordered the Elvis and the eggs Benedict and I would say skip the eggs Benedict and get this instead.
