4EfiNcKSsafogIhAjwv0gg Ordered from here twice now and enjoyed the food both times. Onion rings could be cooked a little longer so they're crispy rather than soft. This last time we got the Philly cheese steak pizza which was good, but we thought it would be better w/o red sauce. Maybe use no sauce, or white sauce, or even some cheese wiz (real Philly style). Either way we'll keep going back when the urge hits us.
