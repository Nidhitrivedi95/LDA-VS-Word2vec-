usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA i swear it was just summer! when i realized how long it's been, i understood my need for PIZZA! sweet sophia was our waitress! a bottle of pittsburgh winery cab. the scene was set for a beautiful meal. sophia actually remembers our whole order(we never change it when we go there!). even remembered that we like a bottle of pellegrino! except, we DID change it, slightly. for our antipasti, we ordered the antipasto di mare. SO good! i started to dance in my seat! octopus, fingerling potatoes, celery, artichokes, roasted olives, mustard seeds & paprika oli. we ate it up!  good choice!
we ordered our pizzas-prosciutto e funghi for me, & speck e mascarpone for tom. they came, looking so yummy! mine was perfect, the reason why i come! the crust was nice & crunchy. the prosciutto was plentiful. it was heaven! i became the energizer bunny, dancing away in my seat as i ate! not a word from tom either once the pizzas came! 
dessert was next. sophia remembered them too! chocolate tartuffe for me, & the cappuccino for tom. what a wonderful end to a de-lish meal!     
go! enjoy! note-it's ALWAYS busy. we try to get there early so we don't have to wait, like 4:30-5. i know that's early, but we usually don't eat all day on saturday, so going early is a good thing for us!
