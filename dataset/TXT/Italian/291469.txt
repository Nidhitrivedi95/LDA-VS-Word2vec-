zYb4kj2R54R2YPeNm829BA Best Italian food I've had in Henderson by far! Bartenders are friendly and inviting and the atmosphere is great even to bring the kids too. I've eaten here a few times and am in love with the chicken parm and build your own pasta. I first heard about this place because it's the only restaurant that will deliver to my house. I found out they will deliver anywhere in Las Vegas and not many places do that. I recommend going in and trying it for urself.
