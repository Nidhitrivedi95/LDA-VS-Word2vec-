YvrylyuWgbP90RgMqZQVnQ The inside is pretty and the outdoor patio has a good view all-around, but the food was not the best especially the wings. The most unusual chicken wings I've ever eaten. I really couldn't finish them. Other than taste and feel, I also couldn't finish them for the sake of getting to my bus on time being a walk around 30 minutes. So, it was a so-so pizzeria!
