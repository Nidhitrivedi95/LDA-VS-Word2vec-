HUWLnKD5LSZY134amUO2Rg We've been coming here for years...never a bad meal....servIce is great too.   Beware Friday and Saturdays can get pretty busy...never a wait, just busy.
Pizza is great, a nice thin crisp crust...the calzones are to die for...love the Cavatelli and baked ziti entrees, too.  I've had their special 'rolls' and they are yummy, to say the least!  Can't go wrong for the price and you can easily split them.  
You can't go wrong choosing NY pizza and Pasta...oh and free garlic knots when you dine in?!  It's awesome! 
Tip: Try the Spumoni Cake!  It's crazy good!
