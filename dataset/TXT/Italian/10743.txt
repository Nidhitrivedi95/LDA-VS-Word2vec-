0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg Came for social hour, which was a good way to try the place at a great price. Social hour is $7 for small bites and select drinks from 5:30-7:00pm on weekdays. Service was friendly and great. However, the bar does not get a view of the Bellagio fountains. 

Highly recommend the Il Limone cocktail and the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti. We would go back there just for the agnolotti. 

The Duck and Foie ravioli, while well made, felt like a let down compared to the agnolotti. The foie, rather than adding buttery richness to the ravioli, accentuated the gamey-ness and tasted more like regular liver. 

We also got the Arancini and the Fritto Misto. The arancini was pretty standard. The fritto misto comes out as a pile of thinly sliced fried vegetables on some small bits of assorted fried seafood. There was a tiny subtle pleasant kick to the fritto misto that also added to the uniqueness of the dish.
