VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w This venue is really tiny!  However, this does make it easier to get to the front so you can jam out to the headlining DJs on Tuesdays :)  I have to come here to check out EDM all-star names like BT, Tiesto, Above & Beyond.  

I must mention that their bartender PAUL is the friendliest bartender in ALL of Las Vegas.  We met him when Las Vegas Yelper Yuhi K. & I went to check out BT.  He served us up some super stiff drinks, and was overall had a very personable and nice personality.  Yuhi K. has informed me that she returned for the Above & Beyond event, and he remembered us.  Thumbs up way up for that, Paul!  Thanks Lavo, looking forward to more EDM nights.
