The service is really fantastic, our servers always seem to be able to go on and on about what is good on the menu if you ask them. I love that they throw in a little bowl of snacks with your drink order - a little nibble is really what I want when I'm drinking anyway. If you like whiskey cocktails, I'd recommend the Manhattan siciliano!
