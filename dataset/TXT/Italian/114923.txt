GnODIDJz09LecpudDoynCg The food was EXCELLENT!!  The antipasto platter was great, and then we had a pizza with Italian sausage and artichoke hearts.  All the food was really really good. The wine we ordered was also great.  

I agree with some of the other reviewers, the acoustics did suck, at least with the place packed as it was when we were there.  But the food was good enough to make up for the fact that I could barely hear my date, yet somehow I could hear every word of the inane, ridiculous, idiot conversation at the table next to us.  The table next to us, by the way, was **VERY** close to us, almost uncomfortably close, but then again, I have personal space issues.

Then again, we did go on a Friday night at prime time.  I know for sure that they wouldn't take reservations then, but that may only be because it's their busiest time.

I thought the prices were reasonable!  I don't understand why people are criticizing the prices or saying their meal wasn't good enough for what it cost.  I didn't think the prices were exorbitant or unjustified for the quality of the food/service, and I'm usually really conscious of those things.  ((  Not 'cause I'm cheap... just 'cause I'm po'! ;D  ))

I'll definitely ((try to)) go again!
