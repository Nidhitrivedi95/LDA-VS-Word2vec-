HrR_2-HUE6cqnoz1zMN9AQ I purchased a groupon, $15 for $25 for a sit down dinner service and decided to use it the other day. It was so worth it! I love how you go up to the counter and order, very easy and hassle-free. I ordered the spinach ravioli while the bf ordered the Rustica pizza and with Yelp check in, got the chocolate orange mini cannolis (worth $6). I wasn't surprised to find that there were only one small and one medium sized tables available when we walked in for dinner given all the wonderful reviews. I wish the place was bigger, I doubt there is enough seating during a really busy night. The manager and rest of the staff were welcoming and very friendly. 

Our food didn't take too long to come out and when it did, it was steaming hot and fresh. I LOVED the ravioli, very nicely made. Had the perfect ratio of cheese to spinach. The pasta sauce was DELICIOUS and went very well as a dipping sauce for the bread rolls that come with pasta dishes. Though the bread rolls had great flavor, they were way too oily for consumption if you have any heart complications. My bf loved the pizza, the crust was my favorite part. The fresh mozzarella really comes through here. The cannolis were lovely as well, I enjoyed the orange, definitely put these cannolis apart from the competition. 

We will be back for sure, don't forget to grab a gropuon!
