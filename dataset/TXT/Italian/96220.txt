eqQnIjAAhOUuHqK6gTWRXw We came here after a full day of hospitals to have a quiet dinner. The staff was very attentive with my elder and sick grandfather. Chef Alex Lenk came out and offered to purée the food: It made our evening easier and enjoyable. It's great to see the humane and warm side of people - thank you.
