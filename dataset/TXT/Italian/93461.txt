Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag This place was disappointing. The Service was excellent, but my pasta was extremely salty and I couldn't help thinking that although the others in my group enjoyed their meals,it wasn't good enough for the prices. They did give a complimentary dessert to apologize for the salty dish which i appreciated. Probably wont go back though..
