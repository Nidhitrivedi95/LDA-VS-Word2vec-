qFqueIKCVF5PlXmjl1YY9Q How can you not give this place 5 stars?! 
It is the best Gelato I have ever had, hands down! And there are plenty of places to go try in the Phoenix area... But if you're testing out yogurts & gelato shops, don't waste time anywhere else! 
UHM and Helloooooo HOT CHOCOLATE!!  When it is in season (during cool weather) it is the best I've had... In my life!  Even the hubby who doesn't care for cocoa, drank half of mine! Thick, but smooth, not overbearing on sweetness, but made with gelato delicious!
Oh, they also have Sorbet & this month features Margarita Sorbet... Hello!
It didn't take us long for our little family of 5 to say farewell to Coldstone & their prices!
