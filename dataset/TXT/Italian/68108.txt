Bs8AvNO3xWoURWpqiGd_4w Appetizer - terrific!
Meals were so-so.
Dessert wonderful!

We were lulled into expecting a great meal having just enjoyed Macaroni Grill's freshly baked ciabatta bread.  And, our appetizer of stuffed mushrooms was excellent  - flavorful and a bit spicy, not the usual crabmeat but instead a filling of sausage, goat cheese and spinach - a generous dish.

As for the main dishes, our server assured us that we were making good choices - our mistake in believing her.  In the past we've enjoyed our Macaroni Grill meals.  This visit I had the Pan Seared Branzino - a tasteless grilled whitefish served over arugula.  It lacked any flavor, even the requested extra sauce didn't help.  My lunch buddy's Pesto Spaghetti was bland, nothing special.  

We ended the meal with an absolutely delicious Ghiradelli chocolate cake warm from the oven.  Quality chocolate really does make a difference.  This was a cake to die for!  It was beautifully presented along with a small bowl of hot chocolate and whipped cream.  

This dessert almost made up for our very mediocre and somewhat pricey main dishes.  I think a future visit may be for cake only!
