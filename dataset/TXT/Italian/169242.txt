MqJCtE12yfzQZCg8KGzNTw Wow, this place was delicious!  Just one block from the Light Rail and totally worth it!  We came in at 8:30 on a weeknight and they still had slices available.  We both had pepperoni and it was good, not too greasy and not too doughy.  The best part was their homemade ranch.  WOWZA it is good!  We had never tried ranch on pizza before and at their suggestion we did.  You will not be disappointed.  I can't believe I missed out on this wonderful flavor combination all these years.  This restaurant is a great place for a quick bite after a comedy show at the Tempe Improv, which is in the same building.  The woman working there Rosie is a sweetheart and gave us tips on what to try next.  She recommended the alfredo....they even have shrimp alfredo which my husband will love.  We're coming back Sunday for more yummies.

This is a nice, local, family business and we are glad we have found them.  Show them some love!
