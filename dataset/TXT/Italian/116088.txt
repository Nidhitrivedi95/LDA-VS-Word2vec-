GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA Had the lambs tongue and rabbit with root vegetables.  First time at the restaurant, first time trying those dishes.  Both were awesome.  Well prepared.  No gamey taste at all.  Very mild flavored actually.  Portions were very decent.  Will need to go back and try some of Mario's other dishes and of course some fine Italian wine.
