VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Even with free admission, open bar wristbands, and a handful of free drink tickets, I still wasn't very impressed with Lavo Nightclub. I wasn't feelin' the music at all. It was just a bunch of the same stuff I've been hearing on the radio for the past year, but what do you expect? If they at least threw in an old (or even new) hip hop song with a bangin' beat, I'd be a little more happy, but they didn't. I almost slipped on some drink spills a few times because no one came over to clean it up, but I guess that's hard to notice. The bathrooms were very dark and kind of small. The one thing I thought was pretty cool when I went was that they were giving out free Styrofoam glowstick things and glow necklaces. It was pretty cool until some ghetto guy came up to me and jacked one from my hands. I actually took a picture inside the club and didn't realize how many creepy crunk people were there until I looked at the picture afterward (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_7NLWpbuT1muUTdVQvKzfA/l.jpg). Despite my mediocre experience, I will most likely be back here again to check out Old School Wednesdays.
