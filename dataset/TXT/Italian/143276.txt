JsUprRhyzQyukZmAhcOg0A We enjoy happy hour here. The Tuscan Taster appetizers are very good. The spicy shrimp and eggplant varies from time to time in flavor and preparation ie., crispy vs oily. The burger is always a solid choice.  It would be nice for a healthy appetizer option.
You need to stick with the happy hour drinks or else your tab gets sky high quickly.
At the San Tan location, the blonde bar manager is efficient but super serious and curt.  We always leave satisfied but not thrilled.
