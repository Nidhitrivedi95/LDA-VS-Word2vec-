9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg The food was good, I got the lobster spaghetti. The lobster was a bit undercooked but doable. That was the best thing of this place... Okay, the music and decor was good too.

Service, however, was horrible. I feel liked our server didn't know what he was doing and might still have been new. It felt like he was the disgruntled son of a family friend bringing food out. 

When my food was late, granted I had a big party, but it was so late that he promised a discount. When I asked for my bill the discount was it was long and I had to inquire about it. He looked at me and was like, "oh. Really?" And when the credit card machine came, he took my card then walked off which was highly alarming since he shouldn't be going anywhere with my card. 

Then when he finally came back, he swore out loud when the machine didn't work then walked away again. I don't mind swearing, but I expected more professional behaviour.

Another server came to help us after she noticed it took a long time for us to get our food man she was great.

Overall, I might come back to try the other food but the service was zero stars... Maybe one because the other server recognised that we were in need of service.
