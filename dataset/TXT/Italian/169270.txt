MQJxekA2SN8kmoo-kiq1dw The best Italian dinner we've had since we returned from Tuscany 2 years ago. The pasta is fresh and unbelievable tasty. The appetizer Zucchini blossoms with Ricotta cheese might be the best appetizer we've ever had! Our waitress (I wish I remember her name) was personable, professional and did nothing but add to our dining experience. Atmosphere- excellent. 
We will be back frequently and share with friends both in town and those visiting from out of town.
