L23qeWacyCZFjF9DL6o04w Amazing Pizza Bianco!  I get mine with spinach, well done. I got the small and ate 1/2 for lunch, 1/2 for dinner which proportioned out perfectly. Literally ate pizza all day and still craving for more. And love that you can order take-out/delivery on-line. Frankly, I think this should be a must for all food businesses nowadays, cmon its the 21st century and Venezia's is definitely keeping up with the times and catering to customers.
