FUqvrauxIP8bcI2aVeoXdg Last time I went to Kit Kat was 12 years ago.  I was pregnant at the time and didn't get to enjoy a nice glass of wine with my dinner.  Tonight I went to Kit Kat with that very boy I was pregnant with.  

Upon entering the restaurant we were asked to shut the outside door before we are allowed into the actual restaurant.  Very kindly of course.  But it made sense as there are 4 duo occupancy tables directly inside the front of the restaurant.  We let the kindly Italian gentleman know that we were two.  He asked if we were in a hurry; we said no.  He directed us to the bar to wait on a table, which wouldn't take long.  He took our coats - I was hoping I'd get it back at the end of the night (especially since I left my car keys in there).

We only waited about 10 minutes when I received a tap and a "Bella, your table is ready"... sigh to still be called Bella :-)

We sat down to a nice dinner.  Child of mine gorged on Garlic Bread with Cheese.  He had Fettucini Alberto - 4 cheese with fettucini which he got most of to go.  I had Veal Piccatta - which was delicious!  But missing the capers. And a nice glass of Chianti - how Italian.

I think the best part of the experience was the service, and the food was adequate, but a little pricey.  I guess that's to be expected on King St.  It's actually a great location directly across from Tiff Bell Lightbox.  Perfect in its location.

And at the end of the night, my coat was safe and sound... car keys and all.
