Zja7ykq3icDzkN20XX6j1w Nice greeting by the guy behind the counter.  

One of my favorite pizza places but do not get here often.  Love the Aiello T-shirts on the wall autographed by a few sport celebrities including some Green Bay Packers.  

Nice crust, flat pizza not NY style and not Chicago style.  The crust was nice and crisp and crunched when eaten, very enjoyable.  The sauce was very good and had a little more spice than many places, oregano?  Topped with thins spicy pepperoni which was good.  The cheese was good but a little greasy.
