I9I3wIHFDz1rxVqbltk7NQ Was really looking forward to trying the pizza.  The reason I gave them one star is because I never got the chance to try it. The menu reads that they open at 1pm. on Fridays and Saturdays.  I tried to call at 1pm. just received a answering machine.  I tried up until 1:30pm. still not opened.  Disappointed that they did not change the menu to read a different time if they did indeed change the hours.
