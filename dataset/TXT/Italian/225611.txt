So132GP_uy3XbGs0KNyzyw Wow, I hate to sound grumpy, but I feel like I went to a different restaurant than the reviewers who gave it 5 stars. Over priced and marginal food at best. Sadly, my favorite part of the meal was the half priced bottle of wine. They had a keyboard player and violinist and they were talented, but the volume was so loud we couldn't even hear each other talk. The room is so small, the music just overpowered everything. Won't be back any time soon.
