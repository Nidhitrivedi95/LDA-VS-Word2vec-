Always a busy spot, and very fun environment to be in, to see how busy but organized they (the staff) are and yet still tend to everyone equally. Just be mindful of the wait time, you can indeed be waiting for a while to get in there, but it's all worth the while. Doesn't hurt that there's a bar (Bar Bianco) literally next door!
