0xzmIBsJQc5eUNLucFrZ0Q came here for my birthday dinner and it was so good!  if youre looking for a great restaurant for a birthday dinner or special occasion but dont want to pay the hefty $80++ per person price at a steakhouse, stratta's a great idea! the atmosphere is great, and the service was great.  i was staying at the wynn and it was really nice because the restaurant is RIGHT next to where you get off from the elevator. so it made getting ready and getting there easy.

i got the chicken breast with risotto on the side, with a glass of delicioussss moscato wine. it was soo good!  had some chocolate/toffee cake for dessert too and that was delicious too. and all in all the pricing was pretty good.  would definitely come back! they also have a starlight menu that starts at 11pm and goes til 6am, which is great if your starving after a night of clubbing. yay vegas!
