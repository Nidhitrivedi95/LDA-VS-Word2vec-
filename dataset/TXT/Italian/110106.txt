G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q This place was great and the food was good. But beware of the high prices and everything is a la carte. Also, the food portions are very small so you do have to get appetizers to be happy. Drinks will cost you about $18 and up. The restaurant  was beautiful and we got a window view.  Dinner was romantic and we got to watch the Bellagio fountains from our view.  I had the risotto with scallops and crab which was delicious! My husband had the Veal and was in Heaven. 2 drinks each, dinner and apps came out to $200 with tip. Not too bad for a special occasion but not for a Wednesday evening dinner.
