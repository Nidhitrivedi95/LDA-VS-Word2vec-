This is a great joint to check out if you want good Italian style pizza but don't want to travel all the downtown. Located in the quaint neighbourhood of long branch this joint brings all the "downtown" quality without the travelling headache! 

We were greeted promptly when we entered the restaurant, we chose to sit on the patio because it was a beautiful evening. The patio albeit noisy because it's located next to the street, was still quite comfy. You could tell this patio is only installed when there is good weather.

The service was also really good. There was a switch between servers at the beginning of our meal, but we preferred the girl who switched on so it worked for us! She seemed knowledgable and very friendly and laid back. 

The food... Amazing pizza, the choices were endless, the crust was perfection. The right thickness, the right chewiness and the right crispiness. 

I also loved the Canadian theme for naming of the pizzas. This theme was also found between all the products they carried. 
From the pear cider we had to the whiskey in our coke. 

Overall, a really good local pizza joint. Check it out when you have an opportunity.
