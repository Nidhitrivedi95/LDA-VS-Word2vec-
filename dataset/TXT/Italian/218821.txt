S3w4Pw1wSpYkICvtJAzG8A Hands down my FAV restaurant EVER. Sooo happy it's literally right up the street from my house which leads to take out almost every single weekend

You seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My absolute favorites are the chicken carbanara and veal saltimbolca. The garlic butter spread is amazing for bread, the raspberry cheesecake is to. Die. For. 

Writing this post has got me hungry, might have to make a call for some carry out tonight
