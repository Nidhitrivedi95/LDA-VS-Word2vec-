8dSIAoz_UphMGpZr_uMing I had Rosati's once about 2 years ago when I lived in a different area of town. Honestly, I wasn't overly impressed. I was going to wait to try it a second time before reviewing it, but that just never happened. 

Well, since moving to a different neighborhood, I noticed there was a Rosati's less than a mile from where I type this. It took a minute, but tonight I finally got to give them a second chance.

    ....and I am really glad I did!

Located on the northeast corner of Windmill and Rainbow, you will spot Rosati's Pizza Pub in the Smith's shopping center. It is much easier to find off of Windmill Road just east of the Smith's gas station.

I haven't had a chance to enjoy the actual pub its self since we just grabbed our pie to go tonight. That will just have to wait for an updated review.  

That pie however was tasty as hell! Two things that stood out for me were the crust and the sauce. The crust wasn't too thin (which I can't stand) or too doughy  but nice and crispy! Just right! The sauce was lightly seasoned and had a unique taste in it's own right. 

The employees were all very friendly and engaging and were fun to chat with as well. Definitely no complaints as far as service goes!

The only reasons I can't give it 5 stars is...

- it is a bit on the pricey side. $20 for a pizza isn't the most I've paid for a pie but it certainly isn't the cheapest either! Sometimes you have to pay for quality I guess..

- I am not a big fan of the square slices. Not a huge deal but I definitely prefer the traditional slices..

I live so close to Rosati's and love the taste of their pizza so it is almost a guaranteed certainty I'll be back. After all I still have to try their garlic knots, wings, and have a brew in their Pub! 

4 stars.
