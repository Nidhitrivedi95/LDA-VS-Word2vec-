Jl-NFBNJ0PeIAfO_bDLojQ Went for a late lunch/ dinner at Vivo's and loveddddd it!! Butter lettuce was fresh and crispy with just the perfect tang to the dressing... I had halibut and it was perfection..service was excellent and just nice people, atmosphere was perfect... I will go back for sure. It's my number one restaurant in Sewickley... will be returning soon.
