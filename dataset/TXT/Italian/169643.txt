MrmwDgMlL2GtthlAZsJwNQ TUTTI A TAVOLA  A  MANGIARE!  Any one who knows italian, knows Lidya Bastianic- I feel like she would give this place 5 stars.

I consider myself quite a lazy person when it comes to reviews.  So this should go without saying that I really enjoyed myself at Scadda Bush.  Here we go!

A chain restaurant with the charm and quality of a mom and pop.  

Service: is wonderful.  First step into the place you are greeted by the warm and charming staff.  They treat their patrons as family, with care and respect, I felt like I was back home in Italia.  We were greeted by the owner and and he brought us a plate of fresh house made mozarella and proscuito.  The mozarella was creamy and squeaky (fresh) and the proscuitto was tender, with perfect marbling.  Our server was fantastic, very kind and helpful.  The food is great quality for a great price.  As i said, the food hits home as close as it can to nona's.  I recommend the sangria-delicious. Not this watery tasteless merda that you would get at the keg, but properly mixed and juicy sangria.  Gorgeous atmosphere, perfect for friends, family and dates.
