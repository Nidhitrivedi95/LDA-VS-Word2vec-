SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg Overpriced, overhyped, and when it comes down to it the pizza is just mediocre.  It might have been a little more notable if it was actually hot upon delivery.  Delivery took double the 40 minute wait quoted on the phone.  One of the 2 pizzas was room temp upon delivery.  The chicken was diced so small that could have passed for a diced veggie.  Really shocking, given the quantity of high reviews.  Maybe they were having an off day, but when the cost is over $50 for 2 gourmet pizzas, I expect the restaurant to deliver a high quality product on a consistent basis.
