vg4KopGHV778wmsKErAMQw This experience is based on a take out order. After 2 years of avoiding NYPD, we thought we would give them another chance. Should have waited another 2 years. Arrived early, and they said it would be about 6 more minutes. After waiting for about 12 minutes finally went to check on the order. Both pizza and wings were sitting on top of the oven. Poor communication. Got home anticipating good pizza and wings. Wrong. Wings were chicken particles, and wouldn't consider them boneless wings. Pizza was the Joey's Favorite. It had no flavor and was under cooked. Another disappointing meal at NYPD. Won't be going back.
