DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA We went there and were greeted by the owner who seemed nice. The food was ok but when we were leaving we saw some beautiful glitter covered cakes. The owner said his wife makes them. Since at the time it was our child's baptism we decided to order a cake. That's when we started having problems not only were we told we couldn't have what we wanted our message on the cake to say or have a cross because it was against their religion. So Amy agreed to do a small cross and the message "blessed with our miracle from above" which was a good comprise when we got it it said our miracle and her name nothing else! So I guess that's the way they try to make their customers happy and it wasn't the cake we'd originally ordered it wasn't at all. As if it couldn't get worse but the cake was literally frozen inside and we were charged twice the amount we were quoted by the owner. So the whole experience seemed shady and we never returned. Why agree to making a cake for a catholic baptism if you're not going to try to make your customer happy. The quality was horrible we were stuck serving a frozen cake to our guests. Then charge us more for something we didn't order and the owner acted like he was giving us a good deal. Totally felt like we were taken advantage of:( ps) I'd give them two thumbs down more if if I had more thumbs:(
