EhuKnhTKJTm_EZ_QGe7PvQ I've been a huge fan of Carrabba's since my first visit over 10 years ago. I moved to the Bay Area of California over a year ago and we do not have Carrabba's. So I decided to take a "quick" 8 hour drive to visit Las Vegas and finally eat at Carrabba's again.  I have to say this location is one of the best. Faith, the general manager is incredible. She went above and beyond to make us feel right at home. Danielle, our waitress, was very polite, happy and never once seemed bothered by my special requests. I'm very picky how my food is prepared. :) Vegas has some great places to eat and this is one of them.
