fzxvmA3Ygu3yrQQ6-cEpTw Mora for the win!!! Beautiful decor, Beautiful food, Beautiful service! Given it's a new restaurant they didn't have shades yet... So when my wife and I were about to start our meal the sun was in my eyes. No big deal, why? The manager & a server stood in the distance to block the sun so we and others could enjoy our meal. There was nothing wrong with this place. To top it all off...... Scott Conant and his family had dinner next to us. Well done guys!!!
