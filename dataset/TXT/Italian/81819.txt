ddlnpDxGDDxGGoG_dVXwiw Pulled up to the restaurant which is actually like a 3 story house. It's so rustic cute in here though. I came for a birthday party, the host rented out the very top attic space (good for perhaps 20 people ish). Up there, lots of comfy seating and a few benches to sit and eat, like a lounge. Plenty of room to get up and mingle though. There's a bunch of speakers up there to play music as well. We had one server, God bless her heart, was very attentive in taking orders and serving us promptly. 

The food was scrumptious. In leui of a big sit down dinner we ordered all the appetizers which worked out great (just a little pricey though). My favorite of them all was the grilled octopus (perfectly cooked, wasn't too hard, lightly marinated in orange, lime and chile); the pizza was pretty regular (thin crust, red sauce...wasn't overwhelmed); pork steam buns (each plate has two buns, had pork belly slices in it, was pretty good); kale appetizer plate (loved this! would order it as a side of veggies; marinated in tahini dressings and came with onion, tomato, jalapeño as well). 

No parking lot, find a space on the street or in the neighborhood.
