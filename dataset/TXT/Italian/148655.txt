Went to grape street with a small group of friends for a new try at a dinner spot.

Visited on a Friday night around 8Pm, made a reservation and was seated immediately, place was moderately busy but seating was available either on the outdoor patio or indoor. 

Seated, servers came right over to take drink orders and inform us of specials. The servers were all very professional punctual and friendly. Service was quick.

For dinner I had the grilled cheese and fries. It was great! Grilled cheese in untraditional. It's like a ricotta cheese on a long roll. It was a nice change from a regular grilled cheese and made me feel fancy. Fries were seasoned nicely. Wish they had honey mustard as a dressing option, but again fancy casual. 


For dessert I had the tiramisu, W-O-W... easily the best tiramisu I have EVER had. Was the perfect blend of cake and cream with out being soaked. Loved every bite of it. 

Menu is extensive with seafood, pastas, sandwiches, pizzas, etc. something for everyone.

Prices are on the higher side but well worth what you pay for what you get. Portions were perfect. 


Would definitely return!
