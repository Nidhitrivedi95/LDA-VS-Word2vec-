If you're sitting in defintiely go for the mixed platter for a starter, its such great value! you may not need to order a main though- I'm usually a big eater, but with that to share for a starter, we ended up taking our mains home in boxes for the next nights dinner. Also helps that the food tastes fabulous too!
