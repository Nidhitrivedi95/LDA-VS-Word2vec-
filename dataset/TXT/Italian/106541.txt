fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe is an interesting place.  It's located in a dodgy strip mall east of Rosie McCaffrey's Irish Pub.  A weird location, but once you walk through the door of Cherry Blossom you are transported to a little rustic restaurant setting.  It was a nice surprise.

The place was busy.  We had to wait for a little bit because we didn't have a reservation.  Our table finally opened up and the three of us took our seats.  I was pleasantly surprised with the prices on the menu.  The place wasn't going to break us.  Another thing I noticed was that the menu items were all over the place.  Sushi, Japanese Food, Asian Noodles, Italian Pasta and so on.

Our waitress was an interesting soul.  I will leave it at that.  She showed up to take our order and deliver our food and that was pretty much it.  Our water glasses were empty for most of our dinner.  I ended up pouring our bottle of wine because my date refused to pour it.  He gave up on our waitress.

We had Spring Rolls with a peanut sauce and a Spicy Tuna Roll to start the dinner.  I enjoyed the spring rolls.  The spicy tuna roll was a little bit fishy.  I was scared.  My main dish was the Korean Spicy Beef.  It was one of their signature dishes.  I don't know why.  It was just okay.  The sauce was very rich.  Almost overwhelming.  I forced my self to keep eating.  I don't think I will order that again.

Cherry Blossom creates a nice environment and the prices are right.  No wonder it is crowded.  When I return I will try something else.  After all the menu is huge.  Something has to be good on there.  Three stars.
