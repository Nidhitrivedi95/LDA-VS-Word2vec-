The only reason this was not 5 stars was because we went on a Saturday at 6pm and the place was packed.  We had to wait 25 minutes before getting a table for 6.  Also, the parking was full, which added to the wait time.  There is a valet attendant, who was a bit helpful.

Now, onto the food!  We stared with the baked chicken wings and it tasted hot and fresh.  It came with a fair amount veggies (celery sticks and blueberries) as well.

We ordered the Mushroom Party w/ chicken sausage, Classic Margherita, and Mother Earth.  Mushroom Party was just okay.  I love mushrooms, but the flavors didn't grab my taste buds as the other two did.  Classic Margherita was my favorite.  The tomatoes and their sauce was a great fusion of flavors despite not having any meat.  Hint: use the parmesan to enhance the cheese flavor even more.  The Mother Earth was also tasteful if you are a fan of broccoli and olives.  One of us had a cheese allergy, so we had this one without cheese and it still tasted great.

We shared the the Duvel Golden Ale growler which was much cheaper than each of us ordering an individual pint.  It was enough for about 5 and a half glasses.  So, 16 bucks vs 6 bucks a pint.  Which would you prefer?

Overall, great atmosphere and would recommend you give it a try.  Service was attentive with drinks and boxes despite the large crowd and customers were not to rowdy or out of control.  This place works for both social or family outings.
