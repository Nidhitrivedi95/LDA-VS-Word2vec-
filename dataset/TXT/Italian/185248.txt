Ojw5eTqzbv6k27_Df3q0-A Stumbled across this place when I was staying in Middleton.. The service was great and that free bread they gave was GREAAAAAAAAAAAAT .. i think it had crack in it, it was addicting ... I ordered a pizza, and it was delicious and perfect. I asked for it well done, it wasnt too cheesy which I love... I had a nice glass of white wine ( I can't remember the name of it) YUMM
