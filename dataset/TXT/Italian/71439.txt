C6jKwYmzHztO7OCex9j-YQ I've pretty much been exclusively ordering delivery pizza from this place for the last two and a half years. I like them because their pizza is pretty no-nonsense and it is cheap. Where else can you get an eight slice premium pie for under $18? My favorite is the Mia special pizza as it has plenty of meat and veggies. The dough isn't as crispy as I would like, but overall, the pizza is delicious. As for non-pizza fare, the house rolls with spinach and feta are amazing. I usually get that or wings with my order. The wings are ok--kind of expensive but the quality is standard, if not a little dry. I live right around the block from Mineo's / Aiello's / Napoli's, but I keep coming back to this place because it's affordable and I'm too lazy for pick up. I wouldn't recommend the hoagies, though. I had a couple and they weren't bursting with flavor & had too much bread going on.
