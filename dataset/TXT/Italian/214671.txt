rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg Please for the love of God, wear thick walking shoes.

I wore flats.

It's been three days and i'm still being punished for my decision. The place is all on really rocky, as in covered with sharp rocks, ground.

Also be prepared to walk a good ten minutes to get into the actual fair.

Also be prepared to pay.

Entry- $10.00/Person
Food- Ranges between $7.00-$30.00 per item
Drinks- Ranges Between $6.00-$12.00 per drink
Games- $5.00/Game but usually everyone wins at least a little something
Rides- $30.00 for an all access wrist band.

Not a cheap fair by any means.

It was pretty packed which did not surprise me being the last night of the fair. For the most part the food was decent (No where near worth what they were charging) but decent all the same. The live entertainment was surprisingly good, and the games and rides were what you would expect at any fair/carnival type of event.

Coming from San Diego where the Del Mar Fair is perceived, and for good reason, to be one of the best most extensive and lavish county fairs in the area. I was a tad dissapointed, but I did enjoy myself for the most part.

Probably not something I would rush back to next year.
