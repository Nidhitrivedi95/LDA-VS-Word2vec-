l0aaLW6ZdDXWjUegUECSxg Olive Garden: more like gringo italian food with bagged salad, bottled dressing, and jarred sauce.  But still not too bad!

Our server was Jason and he was accurate to-the-point & quick.  We got iced tea with has a long spoon- nice touch.  The salad and breadsticks aren't bad but far from homemade.  I mention that that they probably have that yoga mat ingredient that subway got in trouble for.

The salad is decent but they probably have the same exact amount of onions and croutons on every single salad.  The lettuce is crisp and I appreciate the few carrot shreds and 2 pepperccinni.

I get the never ending pasta bowl with angel hair and marinara.  My hunny gets the grilled fish & shrimp.  Our food is quite decent but not exactly chef prepared.  Jason reminds me that I can take a portion home which we do.  I ask how many bowls he's seen people eat of the never ending pasta which he says 5!! 

A sweet lady checks on us we are eating & all the tables nearby.  She was nice & charming to everyone which did add personality to the mediocre food- hence my 4 star rating.
