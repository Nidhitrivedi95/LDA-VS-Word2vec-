Yeah, it's greasy, yeah it's foldable and yeah it's yummy. New York pizza is New York pizza.

So searched over and over for a menu on the web for Lorenzo's after I read some other Yelp reviews. Finally found one but just went with our favorites. A Cheese and a Hawaiian. 

Walked in at two on a Sunday, no one around (and I mean no one- no servers, no guests). Sorry to say I had to let them know pretty vocally I was there- after three minutes of hearing them joking in the back. The nice dishwasher came out to tell me he would let them know. Seriously??

Alright, so that being said... the pizza was pretty damn good. I'm a picky girl for gelato and pizza after living in Italy... but I appreciate a hot juicy and cheesy pizza!
Cheese, REAL basil and red sauce, a thin crust but a crunchy crust.

And p.s. They definitely brush some 'love' on the crust!
