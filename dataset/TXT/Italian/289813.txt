Service was prompt and attentive, although we did have to ask twice for a fork as my wife's dinner setting did not have one.  Food is really disappointing.  Calamari fritti is frozen calamari and overcooked, chewy.  The sauce that came with it was okay, not outstanding.  My wife ordered lasagna that came with a bit of bolognese sauce  on the side, not cooked into the layers of the lasagna.  A lot of noodles and not much meat.  Sauce tasted okay, though.  I ordered saltimbocca and while the flavor was nice, the meat was paper thin and overcooked, tough.  It came with broccoli that was just steamed, nothing special.  The penne that came with it, I cannot say as I did not try it.  My wife ordered a tiramisu which came as a generous portion and well presented, but lacked any flavors usually associated with tiramisu.  If it were just a nice bit of sweets it would be okay, but it in no way resembled the better tiramisus we have had.  We are world travelers and this meal is sub-par,  even by Phoenix standards.  We have had much, much better meals at Ruffino's and Bucca di Beppo.  While the initial main courses were reasonably priced, the  really get you on the extras, like the dessert, appetizers, coffee and drinks.  With tip we paid $104 for two of us and our main courses were only about $35 together.
