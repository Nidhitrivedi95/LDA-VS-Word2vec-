cKRxbqDndzZcVOHyVvZLqA I usually order from this place all the time. They're a little bit on the pricey side but the food and customer service makes up for that. I ordered a soup a few weeks ago and the portion was half the size for the same price! I thought, this can't be right, so I went back to the restaurant and they gave me the proper portion. 

Today, I ordered the lobster ravioli which I've had before many times. The second picture is what I was given. The restaurant has cut down on Howe portions and prices remain the same! Not good! I paid $21 dollar for six pieces of ravioli...so not worth it. And I left a tip! I was extremely disappointed with this meal and the restaurant for charging such obscene prices for such a small portion. The food itself is good but it's not worth it. After 5 years of going to this restaurant, it's saddens me because today was my last day going back there. Never eating there again simply because the food given is not worth it. You're better off spending your buck else where to get an actually filling meal
