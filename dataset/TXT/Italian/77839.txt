CZF9Nm8CFY2R9ZhfwYIARQ Used to come here a lot for good food and quiet atmosphere but one that last visit the server spilled wine on me and although he was very apologetic, did nothing to compensate for my being soaked in red wine. Didn't expect a free meal, but could you comp the wine I was wearing?! Won't be back, that was a deal-breaker.
