LMdUoR00jPxQDWLYRq93FA My first Quiessence exposure was as a lucky +1 during a Yelp Elite event. I enjoyed the servers, who demonstrated a knowledge of the menu and its origins. It was tucked away in rural evening simplicity. My second exposure was a quiet dinner for two, and it was extraordinary. Our server, Nicole, was exemplary: timely but not pushy, informative but not excessive. She kept our drinks coming in a nice rhythm and explained the subtle nuances of each dish. Most importantly, she called after we left . . . why, you ask? Because I failed to notice the "gratuity included" note on the bill and added a sizable tip to the total. She wanted to ensure I was aware. I told her to keep it, as she made our night. The cheese selection, especially with the fresh honeycomb, was outstanding. It started us off on the perfect note, and that lovely culinary song continued into fresh, locally-grown salads (mine with seared scallops) and perfectly prepared entrees. Dessert? We had to try it . . . an authentic, hug your southern grandma, bread pudding. My companion for the evening, in his words, "was blown away" by the experience. The walk back to the car, on a crisp evening (btw), makes for a great chance to walk closely. Coy smile.
