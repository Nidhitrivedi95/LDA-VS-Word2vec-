Grr2wJ3nYD_7qUyespDglA Skip the subway and their secret ingredient rubber bread, microwaved meats and crappy attitudes and drop by this spot for a damn heart stopping sandwich!  $7.25 for a veal sandwich and the deep fry that magnificent piece of pounded and floured veal in front of you.  They smother that puppy in sauce and you can add other items for extra.  I added cheese  ($1) because cheese and sauce is never a bad thing!  Did I mention the bread tastes like it was made today?

I have no regrets at the moment but my heart might have skipped a few beats.  Would do again.  This place must be glorious when drunk.

Sub $10 meal, can't go wrong!
