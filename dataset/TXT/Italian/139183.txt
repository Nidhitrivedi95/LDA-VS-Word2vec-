jeTfL2kCyBtmFGSrSQHqVw Winter menu is very expensive and limited that's why I did not list bacaro as 5 stars.   The food was very good but over priced for the market value.  The pork chop came with rib and had good flavor, the seasoning gave the top a nice crisp and crunchy taste and feel.  The pork chop was accompanied by a few small Rosemary potatoes with a mix of arugula and a hint of olive oil.  The lasagna was not a traditional lasagna, this one had a zesty lemon grass sauce which wasn't too bad, but if you're expecting traditional, this one won't be for you.  Over the experience was great lots of wine to choose from and pleasant atmosphere.
