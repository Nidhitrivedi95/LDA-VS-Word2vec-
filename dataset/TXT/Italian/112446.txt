GCen6oV-_6PfMP_uKN-dZw When I first bit into our pizza, there was something oddly familiar about the taste, but I couldn't put my finger (tongue?) on it. My dinner partners were all pleased with the taste of the crust, the bounty of meats on top, as well as the flavor of the sauce. At one point I asked who seemed to be the manager about the pizza. I'd had something very similar before and asked if they had other locations. Only to find out that they had an outlet at the Venetian on the strip. Of course! Theirs was some of my favorite pizza when staying on the strip and made special trips when close since that pizza was very tasty. 
Of course, this location was MUCH less expensive than the single slices at the Venetian "food court" on the main floor. I'd stop in again any time for this pizza, but avoid rush hour as the area is packed with traffic!
The only drawback is their restrooms are located upstairs, although there is a handicapped location on the main level.
