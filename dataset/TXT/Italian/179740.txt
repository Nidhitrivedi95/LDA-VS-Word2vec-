nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Service:  Wonderful.  For the first week of a new operation, the waitstaff was friendly, helpful and efficient.  The servers had issues figuring our who ordered what, but this was probably because we were four sitting at a booth that could seat six.  Extremely accommodating.

Decor: Great views of the strip from the window booth. Nicely laid out with not too many tables and not too close together.  However, the cold air was blowing on us the entire time and I didn't go to Vegas for the cold weather.  Please fix this.

Food: Turkey meatballs were wonderful.  Chicken Parm was chewy and probably overcooked.  We came for the desserts and were disappointed that there isn't a more traditional cake.  I realize you have to spice things up, but if you are going to have funky desserts, you should also have at least one boring chocolate cake.
