tIiiq23utFKTs1At2bVD6w My husband and I have been to Oggi's too many times to count.  We have never had a bad meal, or bad service.  My only complaint is with our most recent visit.  My husband and I went to dinner over the weekend.  It was a Friday night, and not as busy as you'd expect.  Once we were seated, our waiter came over to get our drink orders.  When he came back, we ordered our appetizers.  Our waiter then told us that we need to order everything at one time, because they were sure to get a rush any minute and we would end up waiting for close to an our for our entrees if we didn't order right then and there....and that was kind of the way our whole evening went.  He was a little overbearing and pushy throughout the entire meal.  One of the reasons why we enjoy Oggi's is the fact that the atmosphere is so relaxed.  It normally is just like being in Italy...you're welcome to stay as long as you like.  We felt very rushed throughout the entire meal.  Our waiter was very nice, but seemed to be a little more interested in getting rid of us for a new table.  Also, they never did really get overly busy. This definitely won't deter us from coming back.  As I stated before, we absolutely love this restaurant.  We were just disappointed with the service this time around.
