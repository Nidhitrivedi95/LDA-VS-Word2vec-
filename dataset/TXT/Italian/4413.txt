_lW7i2zGl54a6XtumbtZFQ Ordered from here on Uber Eats after checking a few other menus for pizza and liking a few from here. I was much better off throwing some frozen pizza into the toaster oven. Dr Oetker is more consistent and tasty with more toppings. I used to think it's hard to screw up pizza but Doppio batted 0 for 3.

Funghi:
Described as tomato sauce, mozzarella, an assortment of mushrooms with chilies and garlic oil.  Assortment equates to ONE type of mushrooms, just 2 white mushrooms sliced into the pizza. 

Rucolina:
Described on menu as tomato sauce, Niagara prosciutto and arugula salad. The arugula was grossly wilted from age and not heat. Some pieces were yellow. Not sure why the menu said arugula salad instead of just arugula because there was nothing else on the pizza asides from the described items. 

Picante:
Described as tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy sopressatta, roasted red peppers, black olives and hot peppers. There were roasted yellow peppers instead of red which was an acceptable replacement (I wouldn't have minded being given a replacement for the nasty arugula either), but it was all on one side of the pizza. There was barely any cheese. The olives were crazy salty and I didn't see nor taste any hot peppers.

I will never be ordering from here again.
