fzxvmA3Ygu3yrQQ6-cEpTw 4.5 star food, 5-star service and 4-star prices. I'll round up instead of down. Three of us for dinner. While I was parking the car, Scott Conant came over and introduced himself. So cool. Server was delightful, professional and attentive. We started with the bread cart (focaccia, ciabatta, stromboli and sourdough with 4 spreads) -- very good, a lot of fun, a lot of food (we took home 2/3 of it) and well worth the $8. We ordered the octopus as an app, but they forgot to bring it out, so the comped it for us (classy). Octopus wasn't what I'd hoped; too "fishy" tasting rather than the marinated/charred versions I prefer. Moving on... The pasta with duck ragu was phenomenal, the chicken in potacchio was just as good and the brussels sprouts side was as good as any we've ever had. We shared a (huge) slice of coconut caramel cake as it was so, so good. Scott Conant's daughter (4 years old, maybe) came out with the server to deliver the tab and to bring us the receipt. So charming. A great experience.
