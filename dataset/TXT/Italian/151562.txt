kp9IG_6UDGFn8HxlIDBusQ I do love this restaurant, as I have never had a bad meal and the bread is to die for; however, the service is exceptionally poor and has been for years. Every single waitress and waiter we have had over the past 5 years (approximately 10 dinners) has been negligent, slow, forgetful, and not very friendly. It is unfortunate because the food is so delicious and the chicken parmesan is better than any I have had any place else in the country. My fiancee has been to Italy many times and says that the veal is better than any cut you would find in Italy. I would recommend this if you keep your service expectations low and have a lot of time to sit around and wait for your coffee and water refills, not to mention the check. Typical wait time between finishing your meal completely and receiving the check is about 30-40 minutes and then another 20 to get your change or credit card back. The food is so good and the veal almost makes the negatives not so bad!
