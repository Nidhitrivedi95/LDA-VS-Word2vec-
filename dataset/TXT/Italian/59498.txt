AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw We decided to visit okra for dinner. The drinks menu is extensive and interesting. The appetizers were good. We tried the chicken fried skins and Mac and cheese balls. Skins got good  reaction for creativity of flavor and textures by my friends. The Mac and cheese friend balls were decent. There is a lack of availability of vegetarian menu options. But it is a good addition to Phoenix scene.
