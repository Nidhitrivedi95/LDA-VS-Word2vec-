ZtJ6sTq7-5rL9ORUtQJHAQ This was my first visit to this restaurant. It is a beautiful place. The service was very good Jake was our waiter and he did a good job. However the salads that we had were little bit on the small side as portions go. I had filet mignon with the homemade noodles .The homemade noodles were very good but it didn't taste like filet mignon and the meat was overdone and it looked like ground beef. We ordered artichoke hearts they were the worst artichoke hearts I've had in my life. Artichoke hearts and not supposed to have leaves attached to them and ours did. I told the waiter and he quickly blamed it on the new guy in the back. I told him it's not the new guy in the back it's whoever trained him is the problem.
