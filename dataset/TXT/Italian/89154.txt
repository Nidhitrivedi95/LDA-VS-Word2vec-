e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw What can I say . I'm a big Sinatra fan. My brother played sax with his songs I sang his songs in jazz choir back in college, and his music is so heavenly that a restaurant after him is so appropriate. 
   Good music and what else? Good food and even better to be in the Encore.
   My partner works at the Wynn so we decided on a dinner after Valentines day to ease the congestion of the typical dinner on a Sunday. A Monday is good.
   Appetizer: tuna was good half way though I realize it was missing something and I was staring at it; the spiced olive/pickle that was fanned out added the perfect punch to the relishy chopped mix. 
   Ossobuco: never had it before and Frank(partner)(yes how ironic the name), had it. What I expected; soft and tender.meaty great yummy sauce thicker than what I envisioned. The risotto a nice touch with it. Great dish but would be better with a more onion punch. I'm Asian born in Cali so I like strong flavor. 
   I had the Rombo ; read reviews about it . I had to try it for myself I loved it and savores every bite. A soft white fish with a buttersquash and the nuttyness of what I called truffle oil? I asked the waiter and he said yes it's in the dish. I loved it delicate, but exotic and just could not help, but the flavor kept making me smile. Try it I dare you guys can't help but smile when enjoying this dish.
  We were full but our waiter nicely brought out tiramisu and said "just a taste" well it was good. Yummy a nice flavor not as soggy as other reviews say. Not too rich and not too light very good chocolate and cream was fantastic.
   Yes I would cone back for a different appetizer, I would get my rombo again. And loved tiramisu but I like trying new things. Beautiful restaurant, nice furniture and view by the patio. We were once again the youngest ones there so don't  be fooled by age. We gave our waiter a 28% tip.
