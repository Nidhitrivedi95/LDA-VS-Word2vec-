This restaurant is literally next door to Dante, and in order to eat in the patio you basically walk right through Dante to get there.

The restaurant has some very good options, and some things are just okay.  The pizzas are fairly large, very creative, and pretty tasty.  The crab cake benedict was also very good but somewhat small for its price.  The carbonara frittata is overwhelmingly heavy and should be avoided at all costs.
