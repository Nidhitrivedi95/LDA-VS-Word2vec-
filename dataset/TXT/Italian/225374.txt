However, the Love Shack gets props for being too dark to see the prices and very old school Vegas/Italian. I can't imagine going on a night without the live entertainment which made the experience.  

The night we went it was one older black guy and one older white guy singing mostly 70s easy rock and R&B covers. They should call themselves "Grey".  "Hi, I'm white" "And I'm black", "And together we're Grey".

SERVICE:  Great, but it's the kind of place that gets super busy, so we ordered drinks, appetizers, and entrees all at the same time just in case.  

DRINKS:  Not weak. And the bar has video poker/keno/blackjack. And if you want to eat in the bar, they will give you something that looks like a cutting board with high heel clogs.

LIMO/VAN:  You better reserve that in advance.  We missed the limo, but the manager hooked us up and sent us home in the shuttle as we stumbled out.

FOOD:  We shared the bruschetta.  The bread was kinda crouton-ish, but interesting and yummy.  The meatballs (a side for $4) were perfect.  I made the mistake of ordering the gypsy sauce even though I was told that on a scale from 1 to 10 in spiciness it was a 15.  It was like someone dumped a whole red pepper flake shaker into it.  I sweated throught it, and the server gave me some McDonald's coffee to cool my mouth down.
