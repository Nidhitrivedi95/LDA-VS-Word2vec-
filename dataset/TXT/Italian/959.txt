-b-waFIsc6BJdXWOJMRKEQ We are always on College St. Such a great vibe! We stumbled upon this restaurant that we never noticed in all our years going there. The patio looked pretty neat. So we said lets try it out.
We were greeted by a hostess who mentionned to us that it is a long wait because all their foods are made fresh on the spot. I was like yes of course no worries.

Well this was a great dinner experience. We started with the fried calamari. Unbelievable crispy yet tender. I had the seafood risotto and my husband had pasta carbonera. Every bite was like heaven. The portion sizes were perfect so you dont have that overstuffed and bloated feeling. This place gets 5 stars. The waiter was funny, witty and personable. It was a great night cant wait to go back!
