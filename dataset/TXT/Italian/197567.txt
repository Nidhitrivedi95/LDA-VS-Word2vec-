prPOsr3aS9IStGdBil9l5A Deliver was quite fast, but the driver was really rude, my total was around $25.41 and I got exactly the correct amount, but was told it was $25.68, upon being told this, I told him I was gonna go find a few more cents until he gave me back my change and told me "Don't order pizza, unless you can afford", truly horrible customer service. No patience, and guy was hostile.
