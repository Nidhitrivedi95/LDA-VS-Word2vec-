wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g Canaletto brings a very nice ambiance to dinner time. We arrived here with reservations with my party of 4 which they seated us immediately. We ordered their formaggi misti in which the waiter did not stop to appropriately go through what kind of cheese it had. This was a bit of a disappointment. As the evening progressed we ordered one of their Pinot Grigio from Ca which was delicious. We also ordered their Bruschetta which was not bad as well. Despite it being busy the waiter was kind enough to come check in on us. The Risotto was probably one of their best dishes and I do recommend starting there. 

If you are looking for a pretty restaurant to dine in at the Venetian this is your spot. The location is probably one of the best in St. Marks Square and I honestly can't say it offers much else and their food is average.
