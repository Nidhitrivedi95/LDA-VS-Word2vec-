cpkBJhBujpBFZ0rOItE-4g We have been going to Ruffino's for years! Love the intimate setting and decor.  The  live music from the bar drifts into the dining room making it a wonderful setting. It's not too loud - just the right amount of music to enjoy and a fabulous meal each and every visit!  The food is outstanding!  The meat lasagne and stuffed mushrooms make us come back from more. Thank you Ruffino's for always providing the best Italian food and service!
