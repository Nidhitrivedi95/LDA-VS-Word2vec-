XxXJat55Oep1BMzQ9yJJhQ Best Panini's in the city? Most definitely! 

Negroni's has a nice atmosphere and ambiance to it, but let's not kid ourselves here, the food is the standout. 

We started with the Ricotta dip and were blown away, cheese was creamy and the flat bread was perfection. We then had a panini each and split them, I had the mortadella and my gf had the mushroom, mozza and pesto. Both were cooked to perfection and had lots of flavor. A nice thing was that they were not overly stuffed or too filling, just a nice size meal that is really fulfilling. The size salad was a nice touch as well and quite good.

Please do not forget dessert here! The nutella panini is fantastic! It may sound off putting but it is great, really creamy and quite decadent!

Add $5 wine or $4 draft (in a small pint glass) and you have a five star joint.

Fantastic!
