HfOQdfvijWVWMFgMIhVuBA Order delivery from here about once a month. Typically get the Nicky T. Combo with the chilli as the side. Combo comes with a delicious homemade brownie (and i am a picky brownie fanatic) and it meets my satisfaction. There mac n chees side is just as good as there chilli side i would say. There meats on there sandwiches are very fresh and the seasoning and flavor is unique and A+ and what really makes your purchase worth the money. I guess the only very small gripe is you wind up spending around 20 bucks for a combo if you order delivery after you calculate in the delivery charge and tip. Which might be a little pricey for some folks factoring it is a meal just for one. But all in all i have enjoyed all my meals and will continue to order from this establishment the future
