dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw Didn't like my dish - flavors way too intense in this Raviolini. But no one ever asked why I wasn't eating it. Just took it away and brought me the bill. Good work!!  Also the pear and walnut salad was way below par when compared to many others I've had. My husbands dish was good - he liked it. The service was good if you if you ignore that they ignored what I wasn't eating.
