y769FA7VJOW4QQYdYlR62A AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING Service was so friendly and opening, food was exceptional! The pasta wasn't too saucy, but so incredibly rich. I got the bacon carbonara and arugula salad, while my BF got the pollo Toscano pizza and the Alfredo pasta (secret menu item)  could not recommend this place enough. There was a small mix up with our reservation times and they were so apologetic about it we weren't even upset !!! They made sure we were happy!!
