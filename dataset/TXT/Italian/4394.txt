_lLtkWriA6ksfv4LxIE-pQ Have eaten here a few times. Love the outdoor patio area. Awesome, relaxing and rustic. Charming. The staff is always attentive and spot on. And the food always yummy. Tried a few things here. The flatbread is always delightful, light and crisp crust. Here on Saturday and had the salmon and rice with asparagus. The fish and all ingredients were fresh and cooked perfectly. Always an enjoyable dining experience and you can't go wrong with a glass of wine to accompany your meal. Terrific!
