YJS7cXGLAvWw9DUDXpw84Q Well... I have to say something about this place.

I must admit , I came to this restaurant about 3 days ago for the first time, and my first thought was " this wasn't going to be good" 

There was kids screaming and yelling in the back ect... 
this is going to be a unpleasant experience for me . 

However, the service was great. Fast pace and nice and polite, and I orded the bread sticks with the olive and balsamic vinegar.. amazing fresh taste 


As for my main plate, I ordered the Pasta Martini and it was so surprising to me , absolutely delightful..  and the price is very reasonable.. 

At the beginning I thought "oh boy , this is gonna be bad" then at the end I was so surprised .. very well done . 

Atmosphere needs to be worked on , but the food and service was perfect . 

I'll be returning .
