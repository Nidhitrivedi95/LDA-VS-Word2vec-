FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A Love this place. I've tried a few things off the menu...all pretty awesome. You can add any ingredients into the pasta and they have tons of pasta types to choose from. The lunch special is a great deal. Nice decor and the food is always at the table within just a few minutes of ordering. They make it when you order so it's always really fresh. The penne vodka and sweet corn soup are among my favorites. And it's just never too crowded.
