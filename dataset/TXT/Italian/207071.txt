qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA I know how to cook which  means I have some minimum standards. Best I can say is this place is inconsistent. We were doing lunch and each ordered half a sandwich  with soup or salad. My wife said her's was fine and the salad good. My sandwich was not even close to half and the so called "excellent" chicken soup was pathetic.it should have been called carrot celery in cornstarch thickened broth. The amount of chicken  I found in it meant the poor chicken had parts in many hundreds of bowls.  No way I will return.
