UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w Ordered take out from this place had the four cheese pizza pie which was extremely salty way too much tomato sauce and crust sucked. Had 2 slice and threw out the rest it was not edible. I also had the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken pasta was heavy in cream sauce. It was ok. The grilled chicken was good. The garlic bread was dry. Wife had the meatballs and she said it sucked as well.

I won't be going there again!!!
