Please try this amazing hidden restaurant surrounded by Raku, Kabuto, Monta, and Zen Curry. I have to say this restaurant is as good as Raku or Kabuto in different categories. 
My favorite ?
Spaghetti Manila Clam & "Tarako"
And Hamburg Stake! 
One thing to remember. Spaghetti is not what you think of regular Spaghetti. Not buttery yet it's just right. You will know what I mean when you try it. 
Order a bowl of rice for a Hamburger Stake. And glass of red wine. You will forget what you've been going through at your work. You will feel good.... Just good......
