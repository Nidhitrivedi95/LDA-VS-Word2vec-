PUDtJu2bFTvIl1_WhyUIXQ To me Vesuvio is the only decent Italian restaurant in the junction area. if you're in the Junction area and you feel like having Italian food Vesuvio is your best bet. if you're downtown or at bloor west village no need to come up here just for Vesuvio ... there are better choices to be found in those areas (see my other reviews)
