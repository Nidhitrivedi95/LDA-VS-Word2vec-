mkjIZdBL8IDcBx804P4uZA My girlfriend and I love Pizza Hut; however, I think we're going to be ordering from another business.  
   We've order three different times, and each time we've gotten wrong orders.  It's too "common" to have mistakes every time we order.  This is ridiculous.  The line people need to pay attention to what they're putting on each order; the cutter (who's often a manager) should be double checking that the toppings match the order; and finally (not in all stores) drivers check the orders before loading up for a run.  So, after all that which could have prevented this, all three times we've gotten wrong orders.  WTF!?   I recommend that you go elsewhere.
