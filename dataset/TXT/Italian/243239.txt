UQiUVCtG-rJxoriuEv1RRQ Everything here is just OK. I've definitely had better and I would most likely choose another restaurant in the future, but nothing was extremely bad about this place...just ok. The atmosphere is a little stagnant and while seating inside the restaurant is extensive, it didn't feel very welcoming and it was too beautiful of a day to sit inside anyway. We sat outside and it reminded me of sitting on a friend's apartment patio. The tables were tiny and a little rickety and we ended up moving from one because it was uneven. The food itself was also just ok, but way more expensive then it needed to be. I went with a salad with brie and apples. It cost an additional $4 to add chicken which I did. The salad was decent and tasted like something that could be made at home. Nothing stood out in my book during my visit, but nothing was awful either.
