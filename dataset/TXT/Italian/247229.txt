v9jNkOIBfP4aW2ru50Rn-A I had some kind of ravioli with cheese inside, which was pretty good. I think that the prices are quite inflated though considering it's just pasta, bread, and salad which is primarily lettuce (you get unlimited quantities of the latter two). 

I'm not particularly crazy about anything in this restaurant (food, prices, or decor). The only thing I guess I liked was the service; the waiter I had was very friendly and tried to make conversation with us.
