l09JfMeQ6ynYs5MCJtrcmQ Failure to communicate is an understatement.  My sister and brother-in-law had made dinner reservations for Sat. pm to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary.  I thought it would be nice to surprise them with a dessert on us.  E-mailed them a message (via their website) asking if they provide any of these niceties for such occassions...no reply.  My husband went in person and spoke with the manager who took his contact info..payment info..and the parties name.  Saturday came and went - nothing was done.  I called Sunday, left my name/phone and was told the manager would call me back - still waiting and it's Tuesday pm.  The person I spoke to on the phone even remembers my husband coming in asking about setting this up.  I sent another e-mail asking what may have happened...no reply.  My sister was able to speak to the manager today and apparently the manager 'left a message at the contact number" - no there wasn't....also there was confusion as to the recipient's name on the list so she was hoping her staff would somehow know which couple would be celebrating an anniversary and figure out who is to get the dessert.    Even though I have not eaten here myself, I will not do so in the future.  There is, no doubt. room for improvement at this establishment.
