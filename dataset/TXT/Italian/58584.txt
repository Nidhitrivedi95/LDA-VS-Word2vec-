aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA I've have been to several Oreganos and by far this one is the best I've been to. The food as always was superb. I tried the Big Beefy Sandwich and after a slight mix up that was promptly fixed i enjoyed every overstuffed bite of it. The sweet potatoes fries, let me just say this place now holds the gold standard for them! Wow! My mouth is already watering just thinking about them. 

The food as stated was superb but what sets this place apart is the staff. From the manager down to the hostess we were well greeted and served. Even with the slight mix up food was prompt, hot, and tasty. 

Now the Giant Cookie....just get it and pay for the calories later. It is hot warm and gooey and the ice cream takes care of that burning sensation on your tongue. 

Thanks for a wonderful visit and I will be including this Oreganos on my next journey to Scottsdale.
