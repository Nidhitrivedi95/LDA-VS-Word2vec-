Cherryblossom is very cozy, and the waiter who served us was very nice. He updated us on our orders. Service was a little on the slow side, but given the wait to get a table, I wasn't surprised.

The chicken yakisoba noodles were great, not too much sauce and plenty of chicken; the philly roll was all right--tastes just like any other. My boyfriend was disappointed that the tempura roll was rolled into tempura flakes instead of flash fried. But overall, I enjoyed the food and would like to come back.
