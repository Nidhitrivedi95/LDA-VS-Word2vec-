nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Great for lunch. Hubby had meatball sandwich and diet Pepsi, I had the Hoboken cheesesteak sandwich and a Brooklyn summer ale. Both sandwiches came with fries, which they top with a little bit of shredded cheese. Hubby didn't want cheese on the sandwich or fries.... Orders came out perfect. Sandwiches are large enough to share. Service was a good. Water refilled often, free refills on soda. Cute decor. Would definitely return when visiting Vegas again. Thanks Buddy V for the real homemade Italian food!!!
