He wasn't wrong. We agreed to meet up for lunch and try it out. I arrived before he did, and immediately gravitated toward the bar. It looks elegant, and it definitely is the focal point in the restaurant. I looked over drinks and settled on the Violet Angelo. As soon as my pal arrived, he went with the Italian Racing Green.
Totally worth mentioning: The majority of Talia's drinks tend toward savory, not sweet. Although my violet hued cocktail was fruity, it was not entirely sweet. Very subtle sweet flavor. The Italian Racing Green was all savory... purely herbal.
Now, usually when grabbing food at a new place with a friend, we'll both order something different and let each other try our dish. Here we broke the rule; both of us went for the Ricotta Gnocchi with Short Rib after very little deliberation. I'd seen pictures, and it looked and sounded sooo good.
We were both very pleased. The sauce was flavorful, the short rib was strewn generously over the gnocchi. The only complaint from both of us was the scarce amount of the delicious, fluffy gnocchi.
Lastly, we decided to split a dessert. He chose the Flourless Chocolate Cake with Marscapone. I'm not big on chocolate cake, so it wouldn't have been my choice, but that being said, it was pretty good. The candied berries were plenty, the marscapone was not. I asked about the base, suspecting it was almond flour. I was right. I'd know that crumbly yet dense texture anywhere.

All in all, pretty good! I'd go again, but next time I'll need to try the Italian wines!
