There was actually a mix of locals with us tourists...prob 'cause the cheap drinks & selected food at the bar.  It's a pretty small place, with a nice outdoor patio that has a straight shot of the Pirate show at T.I. across the street.  It seems kinda hidden too.  There's a direct entrance off the sidewalk along the strip and one right off the main entrance to Palazzo.
