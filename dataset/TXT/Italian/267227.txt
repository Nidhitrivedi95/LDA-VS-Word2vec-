Xc3Y8_cWBnMVXvoJmGCh4g What a great family owned restaurant.  The food was delicious, cooked by the owner himself.  While the restaurant itself wasn't very busy (we were the only ones dining in), it appeared they were busy with deliveries. Great pizza and fantastic pasta.  Will definately be returning!
