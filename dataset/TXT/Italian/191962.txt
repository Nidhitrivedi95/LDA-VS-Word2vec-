Pg6t8mG-zWY3pRSdxlFnHg We love this homemade italian food!!  Me & the hubby usually order the Bellas Pasta Trio or something like that.  You choose THREE dishes of your choice.  We usually order two orders of lasagne and spaghetti & meatballs!  Delicious!!!!  The garlic knots are incredibly good.   I love coming here!  Out waitress is usually the tiny little bouncy one and she is always pleasant!  So glad we found this off the wall place since we moved here.  They had great scores (I think) on TripAdvisor and that is how we located them!!!  Thanks for the great food and service every time!!
