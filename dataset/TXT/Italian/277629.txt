YiRhyhrKQNwgV43Sy0LlOQ Italian food done right!  My husband and I discovered this place about 5 years ago while walking around Old Montreal.  We are frequent visitors to Montreal and return to this restaurant every time.  Mike is an amazing chef and the owner Mario is great too!  
You must try the awesome ricotta gnocchi in truffle cream sauce, so light and delicious.  The veal meatballs are tasty as well.  Honestly, everything that we have ever eaten here is wonderful.  Mario brings in fresh burrata from Italy that is served on toasted bread with tomato, a great starter.
It's not in the heart of the touristy area but it's worth the walk towards the end of Notre-Dame near the corner of Bonsecour.
