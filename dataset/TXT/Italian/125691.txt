Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A This Italian eatery has very unique offerings that set it apart from traditional Italian places. People commenting about the price should just eat elsewhere. 

Please note this is a high end restaurant on Mill so, yes, you will have a substantial tab. But the wine list is superb and the food is unique. 

Great place for a date in Tempe. Tempe lacks many romantic places..... But this is a good option.
