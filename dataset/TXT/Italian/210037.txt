Qv0OEziLJwyAqcgtrTsA4w I had the Italian beef sandwich with cheese, peppers, and onions and I really enjoyed it. I also ordered some fries. They serve crinkle cut fries and they were hot and totally crispy. They have all the items you would normally see on any other Chicago hot dog style restaurants menu. Everything I saw come out looked good. Ill come back but i will say for my fries coke and a drink it cost $12. I think its a little pricey for a sandwich fries and a drink but it was good. They have no combo so everything is sold separate. If the prices were a little lower I would have given 4 stars.
