nDKcQkh8vZkY_u1kyww44g this restaurant is inside the Venetian, but i believed they have the casual dining restaurant and fine dining one...they are not one of the same!  this particular one is the Grill at Valentino, which is more on the casual dining one!  Needless to say, the food was good...wished I had ordered one of their pasta dishes though.  I ended up getting their salmon dish and upon inspection the fish was still a little raw in the middle and I did not bother taking it back...it did have a good flavor, but just a little disappointed with how the fish was cooked!  Maybe, next time I'm gonna have to try the fine dining one and compare the two!
