aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw We were a group of 20 with the back room booked.  We did a pre set menu with 3 choices for each course as well as wine and drinks.  The service was absolutey top notch.  The staff was attentive with out being around too much.  They were even able to accommodate a last minute ask for a cakr and champagne celebration at the end of the meal.  The food was very good.  All the salad were fresh and tasty.  The grilled octopus was interesting and the others (caprese and arugula with mushrooms) were okay.  For the mains, the fush was beautiful andvthe steak good though more than 4 ppl said it was overcooked.  The risotto and ravioli were absolutely delicious.  I would recommend this restaurant for any business dinner.  It was very convenient how they had the pre set menu and the staff was great.
