sKrt4CMGyG8YAjxVkk4hPQ Love this spot! Been here 3 times now and consistency is on point. The wine selection is marginal but for 25$ you can't miss. The pasta portion is phenomenal. I highly recommend the Siciliano..the rose sauce is to die for. Me and a buddy ordered the pasta, pizza, caprese salad and a bottle of red and paid 75$. Pure value for money and a better alternative for overpriced King west.
