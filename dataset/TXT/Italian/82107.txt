DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw I have to hand it to Mimmo and Gino for doing it first class.  We had an amazing meal and the soup is amazing.  Mimmo personally came out to tell us how the soup was prepared.  

All around the new location is brilliant and the atmosphere is very pleasing.  I wish them all the success in the world.
