i53HvxUdQEMllZ1XmpjjyA It's not that the pizza was delivered cold and tasted like the cardboard box it came in the problem the driver was short on change so she said I'll go get change and bring you your $15 back will be less than 10 minutes she said we waited for 30 called the store they said she will be back in 10 min waited another 20 called the store again and again they said she will be there in 20 so they deliver crap food and blatantly steal your money.     Beware of this place and drivers absolutely positively do not give them cash if you have a delivery don't do it they are thieves and will rip you off flat out stole our cash !!! Maybe pay your employees more if they resort to stealing peoples money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! .         After 2 hours the lady came back with my cash after the owner called me the crazy thing about it is the lousy ass person still kept the tip I just had to slam the door in her face again beware employees can make or break a business and obviously this place has the worst employees drivers anyway. FYI The karate guy I talk to on the phone he was kind of cool though...... wow another update..... now the restaurant has there piece of crap employees calling us and harassing us I just had to make a threat to them I'll call the police for harassment unreal please please be aware of this place !!!!!!!!!
