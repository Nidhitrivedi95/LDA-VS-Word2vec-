d1_Ko1DQ4QyB9BjnCFjVLw This was my first time there. The food was so-so. Had the mussels appetizer and a third were empty. The waitress was inattentive and picked up the menu before we could order dinner. Didn't even tell us the kitchen was closing when we asked to order. I ordered an antipasto salad that had very little meats and included macaroni. He had the angel hair that was dry. I could never recommend this place.
