ZrtROjmux0QieMkwqlnnTA I was on vacation and I always indulge on vacation. So Tuesday night, after days of indulging in French food and steak houses, I sought some excellent Italian. Ristorante Quattro did not disappoint. I had the gnocchi and my friend had the filet mignon. My gnocchi was very good and my friend so enjoyed the filet that he called over the server to tell him so. I finished it off with the soufflé di cioccolato and I smiled with every spoonful. Bonus points to the entire staff for being very knowledgeable and full of personality. This is a must-visit when I return to Montreal.
