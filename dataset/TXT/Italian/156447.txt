L6ZPG8lO1tMGmHimSjuEMg I had an awesome birthday experience here. The service was great. I had the Yaki Soba which is a very tasteful vegetarian dish. I will definitely be returning. Sadly they got rid of the Shishito peppers... Hence the missing star. Great place though, remodel looks awesome. Ramen is very good, probabky best in downtown but yaki soba is by far my favorite dish.
