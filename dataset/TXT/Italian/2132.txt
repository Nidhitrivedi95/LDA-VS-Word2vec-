-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g Not going to lie, the entrance of Le Serpent was hard to find especially while my friend and I were being ambushed by snow coming in every possible direction, but it was worth the struggle! The interior design is quite industrial, pretty cool. The staff were really friendly and enthusiastic as they explained some of the menu items. Menus had both english and french which makes it easy for those of us who know minimal french. My friend and I ordered the kit of three to start off with, it featured three types of fish that were prepared in 3 diverse flavors. Fish was pretty fresh. For the mains we got the lobster risotto and linguine with speck, cauliflower and truffle brunoise.  The rice was al dente, and was coated nicely by the stock. Decent pieces of lobster. Overall, nicely seasoned. Just hoped there portion size could be a bit bigger. The linguine was amazing. One of the best linguine dishes I've had so far. The pasta was also al dente and coated by stock, very flavorful. Each component was great and complimented the linguine beautifully without overpowering it. Seasoning was perfect. Service was great! They accidentally forgot to put the nuts from the linguine on the side as I've requested. But they were quick to fire another one asap and our server, Ann, came and apologized for forgetting about my nut allergy and even treated us a couple of shooters on the house. The Le Serpent shooter featured apricot, amaretto, gin?, and lemon juice. Quite a refreshing touch (: all in all, tres bien and would totally recommend!
