6rl2DTYflL0t1_oL4KudYw I have been here a few times now, and this last visit was the most memorable for multiple reasons. I went with a friend and it was a holiday, but the place appeared to have only one server and a dining area that was at least half full the entire time we were present. 
When you walk in it says to seat yourself, so my friend and I wandered back to the usual booth. Someone came in right after us, but was greeted and served prior to us. The server was pleasant, but you could tell when she got busy because her responses changed for when she brought the checks. 
My friend and I both ordered the lunch special antipasto salad and an iced tea. The food looked great, but I was not happy about the quality of some of the ingredients. I will be back again, and I know things will be better.
