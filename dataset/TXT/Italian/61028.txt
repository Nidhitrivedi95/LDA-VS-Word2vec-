Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg I've been in both locations and some of my family rave about this one. I was kind of disappointed. I felt the presentation was lacking, the service was slow even though they were not very busy, the quality was ok, but nothing special. Nothing I could not have made at home for far less money.

I don't drink and had my brother with me. We did nor order a lot, he had some juice, I had a lemon water. I ordered a caprici salad, chicken parma which came with a side of ziti. My brother had spaghetti and meatballs. Our rather ordinary food came up to $65.00 before tip!

If the food was amazing I would have been fine with the bill but it was not. I'd put it about the same quality as a Frizolli or one of those Italian chains in a Mall food court. 

If we had gone to a Johnny Carinno's or even Olive Garden it would have been better and cheaper. 

For a place that touts itself as authentic Italian, with a faux Italian market and deli they could have done so much better without a lot of effort. I liked the other location and may try them again but will not be back to this one.
