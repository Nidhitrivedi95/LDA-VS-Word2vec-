7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA I had never heard of this place until a friend of mine recommended we go for brunch today. It was a pretty good sign that people were huddled outside the door waiting for a table and looking inside you could see staff were doing their best to move people in/out as efficiently as possible. Yes, there is a bit of a wait but the food is delicious.

Their menu is fairly extensive with gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options. Our waiter was very familiar with the menu and knew exactly what was in each dish. They are very accommodating to special diets and allergies although they can't guarantee that if you allergic to something that there won't be traces of it in your food.

I had the Huevos Migas and as others have stated, the portion is fairly sizable and delicious. It appears to be one of the popular items on the menu along with any of their benny's. The price point was reasonable for the amount of food received and once seated we did not feel rushed at all.

Would definitely consider returning in the future.
