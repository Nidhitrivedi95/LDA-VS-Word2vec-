8B1Hi9253IICz8-5Aw5qrw Nice atmosphere. I sat at the bar. Multiple staff coming to me, confused with who was my server. I tried a variety of small plates. A few were decent, but the majority of the food was disappointing. The concept seems good, but the execution was off. Kitchen staff seemed uninterested and careless-not what customers want to see when the kitchen is on display in the restaurant.
