Most of us had the special valentines menu which offered 6 tasting plates. I can't remember all of them but I can remember the profiteroles dessert was outstanding. As was the shrimp and oysters. Drinks are also great and strong. It's decently priced for a higher end restaurant. What makes this place is the staff and music. Matthew was our waiter and he really took care of us! I would recommend ordering as much as you can because everything is great. Go eat there now!
