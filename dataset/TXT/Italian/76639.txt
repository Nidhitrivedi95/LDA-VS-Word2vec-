cVlW0omVTRaVJqnT-OBBsQ Piola opened on Queen west about three months ago. I love pizza libretto so wasn't sure if this place would be better but thought I would give it a try. 

I've been to Piola a couple times now and their pizza is pretty good (not quite as good as libretto) but they are comparable and certainly better than other spots around town. And, there re rarely any lineups at Piola right now. their pastas and deserts on the other hand are fantastic. 

The gnocchi Pompei is great, The parppadelle al Ragu Di Carni Bianche is fantastic, 
And the fusili al pesto is ok. Prices are average to slightly higher around the $20 mark for a main course. 

Staff and service are friendly, great atmosphere and ambiance, worth a try.
