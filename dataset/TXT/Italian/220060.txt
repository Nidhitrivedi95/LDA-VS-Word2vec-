SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg How do you review a place where the food was excellent, the service pretty good, but the sit you in what looks to be the dance floor and in the corner of it to boot? A solid three stars is my guess. There's a great selection of cocktails from the older times of these being the "cool drinks" and some great food.  If I had to pay the full price (go during Happy Hour...period) I'm sure there'd be less stars given, but for the price (and company of friends in a trendy place) I'll keep it on the list of places to go.
