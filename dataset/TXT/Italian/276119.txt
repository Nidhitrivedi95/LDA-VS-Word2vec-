YDeN4OHayfKocEo7Tz4jMg This review is for the $5 pizzas at Happy Hour.  You can't beat the value for a pretty good crispy crust pizza with interesting topping choices.  I got the Bismarck which has ham and a fresh egg, and it was quite good with a side of the chili oil to dip into.  Crust is wafer thin and cracker crispy, toppings are light and not a lot of cheese, so not greasy at all, actually tasted kinda healthy which I liked.  It was a slow night, so service was efficient at the bar. No drink specials during happy hour, but a draft is only $4 for a craft brew.. not too bad.  Definitely a good stop before heading into a Checkers game or other event across at the arena.
