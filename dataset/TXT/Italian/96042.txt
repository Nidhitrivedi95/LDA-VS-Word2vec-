eQNApV0-OpYJec3y1OoBvg Yesterday I ventured out of the house on search for a warm and cozy place to eat. Thankfully, I ventured all the way to the Junction and found Magic Oven. I had actually never eaten at a Magic Oven before. Normally I order delivery. 

The great thing about eating at the restaurant is that it is fully licensed and sells everything from beer to mixed cocktails.  If you go on a Sunday, they have a $5 Caesar special. I ordered this and just loved the pickle garnish and classic Caesar spicy flavours. 

I was incredibly hungry so I decided to order the Power Soup and the Rainforest Magic 12 inch pizza (6 slices). 

The Power Soup (price $6) was a hearty mix of chickpeas, kale, celery, onions, and carrot cooked in a light vegetable broth. It was both comforting and full of flavour. 

The Rainforest Magic had a unique ingredient list that blended quite well. The pizza was made with tomato sauce and topped with caramelized onions, fresh spinach leaves, dried figs, and melted mozzarella. It was a savoury blend that delivered on taste and satisfaction. The 12 inch is actually big enough to feed two. But if you are really hungry, this is also a good meal choice for one. It is priced at $16.

Had I wanted to order something else other than pizza, I definitely could have. They have a huge menu with a wide array of starters and entrees to choose from such as pasta and sandwiches. Also, they cater to most diets. Regardless if you are a vegan or a serious meat eating carnivore, you will have an abundant selection of food to choose from. Which is awesome. 

All in all, I really enjoyed my dining experience at the Magic Oven in the Junction. It's a good place to go to for all ages. The prices reflect the high quality of ingredients they use and their commitment to make good food. Highly recommend checking them out!
