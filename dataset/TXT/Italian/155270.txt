L1PsHcUvdiZvViwYjwGK-A If you're ever in this part of town, meaning Thornhill, Nino D'aversa may very well be your destination for a sunday morning capuccino and biscotti, or if you're hungry--their signature veal sandwich. 

Personally,I am not a fan of the food section. It lacks freshness and quality, not to mention it is over priced. The service is also really slow and disorganized. It took me 10 min to order/pay for a capuccino and there was only one person ahead of me! 

Fairly older crowd..Bring your grandma here!
