IDW4QFw-fN_wk81G9OV-Mg Gluten free options! First timer here and it was delicious.

You place your order at the register, select a seat and they bring your food out to you. We selected the outdoor patio because it was dog friendly and our dog was with us. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They even brought our dog water. 

Beer and wine are available

We recommend the lobster ravioli!!
