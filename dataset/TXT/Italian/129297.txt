i53HvxUdQEMllZ1XmpjjyA Ordered food online and called to confirm order. Waited 45 minutes and when they finally brought my order it was wrong! Had to call and talk to 3 different people to get anywhere. I finally just demanded a refund! All THREE of the people I talked to not one of them apologized for any inconveniences. 

THEY NEED TO STOP PUTTING FLYERS THROUGH DOORS SINCE THEY CANT DELIVER RIGHT.  

Don't eat here.
