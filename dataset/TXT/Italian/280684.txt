yOxuSjJcW7oEWYz9yb4HYA Being a Breeder, Leslieville is a perfect place to live. Espresso shops are open super early for the weekend morning strolls (ugh) as well as access to some great parks and playgrounds. But for the elusive "date night" with Mrs Breeder, we tend to avoid all child friendly places. Enter Leslie Jones!

The previous reviews are right, Leslie Jones is a great place for a date. This is a spot we continue to visit. All candle lit tables, exposed brick walls and open kitchen.Washrooms are great, clean and modern with a hint of incense. The backyard patio is literally a back yard. It's excellent and the best patio in this area for a drink. 

 My dinner was excellent. Slow cooked brisket with a side of pureed butternut squash and root vegetables. I love how they threw in Brussels sprout to make it quirky.  The SO had the daily risotto with Chorizo sausage but it felt a tad overcooked, which is the death knell for risotto, unfortunately. Flourless chocolate tort was a big hit, though. On previous visits, the smoked salmon pizza was superb. Loaded with Kristapson's smoked salmon and capers and red onion. 

Our new date spot. Also, the chefs are super friendly, considering they probably heard our entire "Boff, Marry or Kill" debate. 

This spot is Greg C approved!
