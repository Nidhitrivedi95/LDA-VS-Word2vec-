L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw I was really excited to try this place out as it is Jamie Oliver's first Toronto restaurant, and they did not disappoint. I did see many Yelpers complain about their waittimes and service, but we had no problem when we came in and our server was a sweetheart. On to the food - must-order items are their mushroom fritti, mushroom pizza, tiramisu and lemon merginue cheesecake. The mushroom items were really delicious and the desserts are wonderful. All four of us enjoyed those items alot!! I also had their rabbit casarecce (no longer on the menu), and that was just alright. I do understand people come having very high expectations (because its a Jamie Oliver restaurant), and left somewhat disappointed . But considering their pricing (similiar to Moxies), their food really is quite good among other similiarly priced restaurants in Yorkdale. I would definitely come back to try their other items.
