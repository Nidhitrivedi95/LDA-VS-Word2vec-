IqH-J1D0HIP9wyJs2q_uGQ Calamari is awful.  Hot wings are salty.  I know the pizza is great and so are the stuffed mushrooms but tonights choice of wings was a let down.  *I miss Hefs wings. 

On the bright side the bartender is kinda cute.

OK OK EDIT EDIT EDIT.   

This Calamari is very good.  I wrote that a long time ago and something has changed.  My taste buds, the kitchen management, the pollen in the air, IDK.  

Heres the skinny.   I now order the calamari every time.  The marinara is divine, a little lemon juice and its a party!   

Thats about it.  I will update about the wings when I try them again.  

Cheers!  Life is awesome!
