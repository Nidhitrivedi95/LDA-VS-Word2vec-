JFNv5sKeKAf1ZVPnfbzpXw This is my favorite pizza shop. Every pizza I've ever ordered from these guys has been amazing, reminiscent of some of the best I've had on the East Coast. Most recently, I got their white pizza, first one I've had in a long time and it's great. Most of the time I'm getting straight classic cheese and pepperoni, though, and they make it very good. I'd suggest to them to consider artichokes as a topping offer.
