_Z3XGVbiDn1VbgETp1pwLQ We have been driving by this place for a year and a half and finally decided to give it a try. We were very pleasantly surprised! It is now our favorite Italian Restaurant in the Avondale, Goodyear and Litchfield Park areas. We have been to all the usual chain restaurants in the area (Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill and Carrabba's) but found their overcooked pasta inedible. La Bona Pasta is a jewel in the West Valley! The bread was warm, fresh and tasty. The pasta was al dente and the sauces were excellent! My husband had the spaghetti with meat sauce, my daughter had Linguini Pomodoro and I had Linguini La Bona Pasta Special which was chicken and broccoli in a pink marinara sauce. We were all very happy with our choices! And even better, the portions are all so large that we all took home half of our portions. We have enough for another dinner! The service was superb. Our server was friendly and attentive. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was because the tiramisu was bland. It did not have enough coffee to give it that nice coffee flavor. Next time we will order the creme brûlée. All in all, if you are looking for a nice neighborhood restaurant, check this place out. You won't be sorry!
