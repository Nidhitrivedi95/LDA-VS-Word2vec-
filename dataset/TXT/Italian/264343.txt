wXXqG4igJeJwL9o5sjyMXQ Why is it pizza joints in the middle of a shopping plaza always taste the best? We've driven past this place for years and always thought it was a great name but didn't stop in for dinner until a random Thursday night for Open Mic night. 
My husband and I each had a side salad and we split a large pizza (with food to take home). The pizza was wonderful and so was the service. 
My only complaint was the salad dressing was nothing spectacular but other than that, wowzers. We will definitely be back.
