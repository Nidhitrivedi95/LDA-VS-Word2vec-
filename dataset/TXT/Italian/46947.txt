8v1nk5EcCyEKK61ohAh5Og I ordered a to-go pizza last night for the first time after catching some good reviews about this place (it was Lucky's the last time I was at this location many years ago!) and I do not regret my decision at all!! They were totally great about my order (I asked them to take longer since I had guests coming over and I wanted the pizza to stay warm) and the pizza was delicious! I ordered a cheese with half pineapple and light on the sauce. That's what I got!! The only reason I hadn't given this 5 stars was because I really was hoping the slices would be a tad larger. I'm from Queens so I'm so used to the large slices you can fold and eat. Other than that, this place rocked and I WILL be back! Looked very nice and classy on the inside too :)
