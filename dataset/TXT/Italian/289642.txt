ZtJ6sTq7-5rL9ORUtQJHAQ The food was good. The service was good. The only problem was we had an 11 month old baby and instead of walking us towards the main dining room,  the server walked us towards the back through the bar area and seated us right at athe back by the bathroom.  We were pretty much isolated from the  other customers and there were a lot of seats available!!  My husband and I will NOT being going back there!
