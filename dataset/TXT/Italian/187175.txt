oryS4vX0xkKC4tOekgowDQ Wow..what a waste. Starting with the menus I should have known it was going to turn out to be a horrible meal, raggedy and dirty that they were. THe color on everything that we were served was off and pale. The salads were pathetic and everything needed salt, its amazing what a dash will do to cheeses. The meals were touted as hearty and fulfilling, but its been a long time since Ive seen my husband clear his plate, which is either a good thing or bad thing i feel it was sadly mislead..I was so disappointed but at very least I didnt feel bad about not taking off my running jacket before dinner, this may be the blue plate headQuarters and home of the $10 bowl of pasta, but if your looking for class and/or quality pass.... Olive Garden would be a better bet..
