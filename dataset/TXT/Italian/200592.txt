pvCcrHFAGCml492qoQBsQg Lovely place for the ones who like thick crust pizza. We had standard fair of pepperoni, green pepper, and mushroom as topping. The pizza is done right. Price might seems to be higher than other places, but even a small pizza is huge for us. 

We also had ravioli on the side. The meat sauce that it served with is very good. However the pasta is a little bit undercook, but still enjoyable. 

The panzerotti here also very good, order fried if you don't mind the extra greese. However it's still very good with the baked option. Always order meat sauce on the side, which brings it to the next level.
