VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w Definitely good pizza. Staff was sOo friendly. Well more like the owner. He was chit chatting with my friend and and was throwing out all these innovative secret menu items since he knew we were from LA and did yelp reviews. lolz

Ended with a blue cheese pizza with white sauce, basil, beef carpacchio and red onions. Taste was definitely different from what i've had. Very original and had that amazing brick oven toast to the crust. 

A joint like this would totally rock in Arizona but wouldn't fly in Hollywood area due to competition. I do hope they get their names out because the owner puts alot of heart into the pizza.Love it!! food is all about bringing people together and here I was.

Price gears towards working class. Should definitely expand capacity to accommodate a bigger crowd.
