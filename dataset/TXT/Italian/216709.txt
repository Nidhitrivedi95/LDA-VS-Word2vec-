rU3gQnwoCx_bjDJEsxathA I ordered the gnocchi w/ pesto cream sauce. The sauce was fantastic...so i was really excited. But there was still this strange taste to the gnocchi that I couldnt figure out. The gnocchi itself almost tasted old...but I knew that wasnt it. After one got stuck to the roof of my mouth..i finally realized what it was: flour. It was so prominent! I couldnt finish my plate. The texture and sauce were really nice...so the flour totally ruined it. The calamari was nice though! The dipping sauce...not so much.
