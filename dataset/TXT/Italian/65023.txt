bJ44rSxMNTAAF_WGI_jDEw We recently went here for dinner because we saw that it got great reviews on Yelp and trip advisor, however, I beg to differ. We had dinner reservations for 5, we showed up a little early and it was about 32 degrees outside and they absolutely did not open their doors until 5pm sharp. They unlocked the front door but did not open the doors for us, so we let ourselves in. The waitstaff is all male, they are extremely sarcastic and rude. One of the waiters knocked my mothers purse off her chair and did not apologize. Our waiter was very rude and sarcastic probably shouldn't be in the restaurant business. The way menu is set up they want you to order an anti pasta, primi then second, or three meals essentially. Each meal ranges from $25-$35, so
If you order the way they suggest you're looking at $80-$100 a person. The portion sizes are "European" or what we would consider kid size portions. A side salad cost $13 and it was 5 little pieces of lettuce it was a joke. They were all out of Pinot noir and most beers? I ordered the Roasted Eggplant Ravioli which was $22, the food took 45 minutes to come out and there was a measly 5 ravioli on my plate (what a joke)! If you want my honest opinion, save your money and go to a less expensive restaurant with bigger portion sizes, this place was ridiculous!
