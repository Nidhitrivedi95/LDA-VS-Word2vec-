2kE_CUc6tUR8FU5bjAO_Ag We have visited Rene's several times with our two young children 6 and 4. We generally go Saturday nights when they have their 2/$20 special. They are known for their Fried Zucchini and 1lb Fish Sandwich, which are amazing.  Most items are made in house. Their Fried Cheese is freshly battered and very tasty. 

I would recommend this place to anyone! 

Environment, staff and food are all great!
