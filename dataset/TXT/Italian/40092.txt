I felt a little cheated and very unsatisfied by Carnevino.  Would you believe I left what is being called the "best steak in Las Vegas" wanting a steak?  Yep, that's exactly how I felt.

I enjoyed almost everything about the place EXCEPT the steak.  

Service was good.  Our waiter was attentive, recommended items etc.  The Sommelier seemed unprepared and really made no recommendations, even though I asked, other than confirming my choice of wines.

The Gnocchi, we shared an order as an appetizer was delicious.  Light, creamy, fluffy. 

The Lardo, served with the fresh rosemary bread was delicious.

Sides were yummy - fried Eggplant was the highlight and the roasted Beets were a real treat too.

The sauces were lousy.  The Truffle vinaigrette, which was recommended by our waiter, was overly oily.  The Horseradish zabaione had no distinguishable flavor other than pepper.

The steak, oh the streak.  $160 for 2.  We had the Porterhouse, described by the waiter as the be all end all of streaks.  In truth I found it tough and flavorless.  Not at all what we expected for $80 per person.  The fillet side was more tender but still lacked flavor.  Perhaps that's why they offer a choice of so many sauces to be paired with the steak and we just ordered the wrongs ones.  The sirloin side was tough (we ordered Medium, which came like Medium Rare, which we were told by the waiter would be the case.) But dry the streak seemed, just that.  I would have been happier simply ordering the Fillet of the menu.

In short we left, having spent $450 for 2, and feeling fleeced.
