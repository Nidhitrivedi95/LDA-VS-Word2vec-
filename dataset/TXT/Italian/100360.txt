fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w Not going to lie we only came because we got the tickets at a time share meeting.

Man that meal was good as hell & the staff was super nice. 

I drank a lot and had visited a dispensary so I don't remember too much but I know for sure I wouldn't have had a problem paying for that meal. We will HONESTLY be back on our next trip to Vegas.
