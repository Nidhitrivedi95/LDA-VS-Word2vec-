H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g It's overpriced but what do you expect from the Venetian.  This is probably one of the only 3 stars I frequent a few times a year because I'll bring guests here.  

What I like is that you can get more authentic unique Italian dishes such as the Bucatini all' Amatriciana.  All of the pastas are served really al dente and salted because it is cooked in the pasta salt water.   The taste is real rich becuase it is cooked in bacon...yummm

The rigatoni is also really delicious which is small spiral shaped pasta served in a cauliflower ragu with garlic and chili flakes...very tasty.

The pastas were delicious but they are around $15-20 and come in small portions.  I think this place is a good spot for lunch, but as many other reviewers have mentioned, the service is attrociious.

I stiffed someone for the first time in years and for someone who's worked in F&B in my past life, it takes alot to do this.  Nevertheless, the food is good.
