G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q We arrived about 20 minutes before our reservation, and I was told I would be called when the table was ready.  For our reservation we were sat right on time with the requested window table.
Menus were delivered to the table right away, and drinks were taken after we had a minute to view the menu.  Our server, Nancie, was right on time with everything.  From the timing of appetizers to wine and bread, all was perfect.  She was completely fine with us taking our time between courses, even when we had the best seat in the house overlooking the fountains.  
My wife and I had a couple different orders of crustini (both which were great), oysters, and finished with Spaghetti and Ravioli.  When we placed our order for the pasta, we asked Nancie if she could put that order in after we had a bit to enjoy the view and our cocktails, and she was great to do so.  I also asked her for a nice full bodied glass of wine that she would recommend, not wanting to review the menu again, and she was quick with exactly what i was looking for.  Our pasta and sides (sweet corn and potatoes) were perfect and the experience was great,  Ended dinner with one of the best cups of  double espresso i have ever had.  
This place was top notch with service, food quality and expectation.  Nothing missed on taste, presentation, and timing.
