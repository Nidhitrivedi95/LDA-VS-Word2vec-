WKlMFUCGI7dCysGkFLWvaQ This was our second visit to Stagioni's.  I must say I am very glad we went back...we had a wonderful experience.  The atmosphere was great and the service was top notch.  The group decided to sample many of the the appetizers and all were wonderful....Made to Order Mozzarella, Goat Cheese Fritters, and Taleggio Fonduta.  Everyone enjoyed their main dishes...all were great.  Would highly recommend this restaurant...we'll definitely be visiting again.
