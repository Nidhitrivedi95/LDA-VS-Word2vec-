We showed up without a reservation to eat dinner on the patio, but they were quite busy. I didn't expect it to be as busy as it was on a weeknight, but ended up waiting a bit to see what would happen. There were a couple open tables on the patio, so we thought we'd get a seat somewhere. After waiting a couple minutes, one server ended up coming up to us and explaining that she would return after a bit to see what she had available. She didn't come back for 5+ minutes later, saying there was nothing on the patio. We finally agreed to sit inside, and she put us at a table in the back. 

We started looking at the menus, but no one came to our table after being seated. About 10 minutes later, she said she needed some of the menus from our table since we were waiting on a couple of people. I then asked her for some water at that point (since we hadn't even gotten that), where she said okay but never returned, again!

They didn't have that many servers working at the time, but completely neglecting our table for more than 15 minutes is unacceptable. Even though the restaurant may have been busier than they expected for a Wednesday night, there is no excuse for the complete lack of service! We didn't even get water after I explicitly asked for some!

We ended up just walking out, and I doubt they even noticed! I will not be returning here, as I don't really enjoy the idea of coming to a nicer restaurant to be ignored!
