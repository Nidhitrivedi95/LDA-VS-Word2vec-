ZtJ6sTq7-5rL9ORUtQJHAQ Being an Italian from New York, I am extremely picky when it comes to this type of food. I went here with some family once, and the owner actually walked around to check on every table. Our family ended up talking to him, in italian, because he was born in the same town as a few family members of mine. 

They are extremely nice, food is outstanding and from what I remember, he gets his fish for the restaurant fresh to make sure that the flavor is the best it can possibly be. Its tough to find good fish in the desert, but this place will not let you down!
