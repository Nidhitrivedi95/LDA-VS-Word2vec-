Kz4WS00PcqOJgxfZawk4dQ I'll Forno is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to eat. The wood-fired pizza is just perfect. I love the thin, crispy crust with just a hint of wood char. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and high quality.

The chef came out to greet us and it's clear he has a passion for the food. I love finding a hidden place where the food is better than most other free-standing restaurants. I've had the pizza, the pastas, and the lobster ravioli was awesome!
