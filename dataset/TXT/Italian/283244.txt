Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA As you walk into the door of Joe's New York Pizza, you are greeted with a sign that suggests Joe has received awards for the past 3 years for his pizza. What king of moron gives those things out anyway?

There is one Yelper, who admits she is not a fan of pizza, but says she liked the flavor. This actually makes sense, someone who doesn't like pizza might actually like one that has no flavor what-so-ever.

This is probably the blandest pizza dough I have ever tasted. Just plain blah.

I could not taste the sauce at all, though it was not due to the bland crust or overwhelmed by the toppings, it was just poor sauce and very little of it.

I won't say it was bad pizza, just slightly below average (somewhere below papa johns pizza and somewhere above my Norwegian grandmother's pizza). 

The reason the place can't even make 2 stars is due to 2 parts - 1 - the very poor attitude of the woman who served me at the counter and; 2 - the OUTRAGEOUS price for 2 slices of pizza and a fountain drink ($14 - AYFKM?), puts this place just below crap in my book. 

This place is probably kept open by an endless flux of intoxicated Hard Rockers thinking this place must be good because the sign on the door says so. Of course, they don't stick around Vegas long enough to regret their decision as I did.

Perhaps there was a time when this place served good New York pizza, but it certainly doesn't anymore. The poor quality of the food and the poor service suggest the place is barely staying open. 

I wish there was a sign that we could place on the doors of establishments that said: "We're Cutting Quality to Maximize Profits! GFY if you don't like it." - it would certainly be more useful.
