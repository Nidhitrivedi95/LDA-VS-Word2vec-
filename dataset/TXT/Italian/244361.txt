USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Took the girlfriend here for Valentine's day, and was not disappointed. Service was great, drinks were strong, food was pricey (but I expected that) but definitely up to my expectations. The atmosphere is pretty quiet, but feels a bit cramped, since the place is a home turned into a restaurant. I had a southwest trout dish, and she had the special, which was a steak topped with king crab meat, in a horseradish sauce. We both enjoyed the food quite a bit. All in all, I believe we'll be coming back here, whenever a fancy night out is needed.
