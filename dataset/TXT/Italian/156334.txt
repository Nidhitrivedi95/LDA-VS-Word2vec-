L6ZPG8lO1tMGmHimSjuEMg worst customer service and whoever answered the phone to take phone orders does not even know the menu and doesn't even bother to CHECK the menu before telling a customer what is "safe" to order. If you are the manager of this place, you need to hire better staff. I'd rather wait for accurate information than have someone guess.

I specifically asked what ramen does not include pork, the girl answered "I'm pretty sure the only one is the shoyu, so you should order the shoyu". I asked can you makr sure there's no pork in there? Come to find the menu online after I ordered and see the order when I picked it up that it had chunks of pork in it. And when I pointed out the pork all they did was use their hands (possibly wearing gloves) to pull out the pork and give it back to me. I asked for them to make it again to the issue that for religious reasons or if I were to be a person with allergies that they should be making another order.
