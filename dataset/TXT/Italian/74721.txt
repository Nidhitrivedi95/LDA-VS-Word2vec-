CR2DMfg3uP02PKT_fuygIw Great pizza and fingers. My order was, however, incorrect. 3 different basic pizzas and fingers, and a 2 liter. 

I received the 3 pizzas, but 2 were correct while the third was incorrect. No need to correct the order, but a little attention to detail on tickets goes a really long way. 

Keep up the great work though!
