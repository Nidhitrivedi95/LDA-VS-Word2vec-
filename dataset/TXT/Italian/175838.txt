NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ Probably the worst Italian food I've had in my life. Got the stuffed spinach pizza and my friend got a seafood pasta. For one, the pizza was HUGE - the 3 of us couldn't even finish one slice each (out of 8 total) because it was extremely heavy and bland at the same time. The pasta also had a watery style sauce which is never good. We waited for 45 mins for our meal as well (it was mid afternoon) which I found to be completely unreasonable considering how empty the place was. It would've been nice if the server had warned us of the long wait time or had told us how big the pizza would be. It was so bad we didn't even take the leftover slices home..... Anyways, 6 hours later I'm still nauseous and have been bedridden ever since so yeah. You won't see me back here again.
