4LXZzgsrM1ZyS_-uB9Od2Q Food is great, decent prices, but server was very inattentive. I was seated on the patio at lunchtime on a Tuesday. Only a couple other tables were seated outside- there was not a lunch rush by any means. Server walked right past me at least three times as I sat there ready to order. I had to walk inside the restaurant to let them know I was still outside- ready to order.

When the food came it was great, I ordered the Tonno sandwich (Tuna) with olives, arugula and sundriedtomatoes. The salad was limp, bitter and a little too dressed for my taste. 

I ordered beer but the server had no idea what a lager was. She went inside to inquire about the bar menu. When she returned and took my order, she came back 10 minutes later to tell me they are out of the beer I ordered. I asked what else was on tap and she had to go back inside to find out (there are only 5 or 6 different beers on tap here)

When I was ready for the bill, the busboy came outside to cash me out.  Great location for patio dining- but it took me an hour to get one great sandwich, mediocre salad and a beer.
