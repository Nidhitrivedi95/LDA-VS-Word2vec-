kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg Needs work - service was poor on a busy Friday night. I thought food quality, linguine and clams was mediocre, nothing unique or special. My wife sent her clam chowder back, too salty and lukewarm. I've been to the other location, it was good but they have to fix these issues in this location. They have much better competition in this location. Need a lot more server training and chef needs to ensure quality food is coming out of the kitchen.
