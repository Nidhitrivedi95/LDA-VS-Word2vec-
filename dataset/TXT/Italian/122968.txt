HhPVzZYQI-akaXRK_A4dKQ I love this place.  Nightly specials for under ten bucks where they serve you way too much food (Tuesday I get the fried shrimp, Wednesday Lasagna or Spaghetti or Eggplant Parmesan).  I don't know how they make any money.  The quantity of food is, literally, too much for a reasonable person to eat in one sitting.  And the quality is pretty good, too.  They put the Prima Donna to shame.
