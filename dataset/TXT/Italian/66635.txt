BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg This is going to be fun.  To start with the amount of enthusiasm when I was greeted by the host made me feel welcome and got me thinking this was going to be a great lunch!  When the pot of joy that identified herself as the waitress came over I was sure of it!  

Ok, back to reality. The host made me want to stick my head in the pizza oven and the waitress made me want to bathe in gasoline before I did. 

The pizza was good, the mid day bear was nice but the vibe sucked.  

Now I am going to try to flag someone down so I can get my check and leave! 

Let's hope my next visit the service matches the food at least.
