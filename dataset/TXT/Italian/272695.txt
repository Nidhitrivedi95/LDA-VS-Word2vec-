XvYwUnuWEai7p-95cj8S1w A little disappointed to find two hairs in our pizza and bring it to attention to the front counter. 
It must've been the "What do you want me to do about?" that I received. Seriously. That is what was said to me. 
Our pizza was also not fully cooked. But I am giving up and going home.
