j00iBr6uYnwgFs_J5y9f0w Been here quite a few times now. Service is always good, as is the food. 

Prices are pretty decent. I believe all their dinner entrees are about 10 bucks. Pizzas are cheap. If you just want slices, they have a special deal for two slices of cheese and a fountain drink. 

I can't eat at this place without ordering at least one rice ball. It's so delicious ! Especially with their marinara sauce, so be sure to ask for a little extra sauce with it. 

I've yet to try anything besides their pizza and rice ball, but that's ok. Those two items are good enough to keep me coming back. Eventually, I'd like to try one of their pasta dishes, but I love sausage pizza way too much.
