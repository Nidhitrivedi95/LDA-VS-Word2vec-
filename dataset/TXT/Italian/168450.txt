MLQeuiL9rqOq_rDKGEcU0A We ordered seafood risotto and the potato gnocci as well as the pizza with salami.
The food was pretty good- but not outstanding as I hoped being one of Toronto Life's Best New restaurant of 2012

I like more excitement in my dishes!

The decor is cute- kinda looks like a nice little French place...that serves Italian 

The servers were very nice!
