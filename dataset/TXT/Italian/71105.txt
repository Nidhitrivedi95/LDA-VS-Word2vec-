c5x6HWB8MTZvlTgabihaSw We were skeptical about this restaurant because it was easy to get reservation the day before and we were using a Groupon.  Well we were pleasantly surprised.  It is an authentic Italian restaurant with many Italian staff members.  My husband had a dish with sausage and peppers and said it had great flavor and just enough spice.  I had pork loin in a gorgonzola cheese sauce with gnocchi.   The flavor was nice but it looked terribly bland; all white on the plate.  A little dusting on the dish of some color would be appropriate.  Our one criticism is that the water was served in a plastic tumbler.  Seriously?  This is a white table cloth restaurant with nice wine glasses and fairly high end menu.   The water also tasted awful like it had not been filtered.  All and all a good experience but the water glasses need to go and get a filter people.
