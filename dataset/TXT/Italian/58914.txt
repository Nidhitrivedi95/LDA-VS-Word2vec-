aqrTv6QiU0J9Sxm_T--c5g Needed to be in for the evening, so we placed a delivery order using Yelp's Eat24 app. Two entrees and an appetizer. Got a call a while later from customer service at Eat24 that the restaurant wouldn't take the order because they were too busy. 
Do not order delivery.
Might be a fine place to go sit down and eat, but they shouldn't take online deliveries/take-out if its not their thing. Never heard of a restaurant declining an order before (especially a $110 one).
