esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA This is one of my go to places in Vegas. It's not the fanciest but the food is good. The oysters are always on point! The first time I came here, a year ago - the pan roast was perfect! This time, it was still good but overcooked. They were kind of busy so I won't hold it against them but this place is definitely worth a try. If you're an oyster fan and want something good at reasonable prices for being on the strip - come here!!
