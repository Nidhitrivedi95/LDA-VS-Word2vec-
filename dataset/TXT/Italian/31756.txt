5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ We arrived at Scottsdale resort and conference center after midnight starving after traveling cross country.  This place is open until 4am and delivered a nice large thin crust sausage pizza with extra cheese in about 30 min.  Considering that this is not NYC or Chicago, the pizza was very satisfying and reasonably priced.  Tasty thin crust pizza from a delivery place that opens very late to satisfy post midnight cravings.  Hit the spot.  Would order again. Not gourmet or artisanal pizza but very tasty and satisfying.  Much better than dominos or papa johns or similar chains.  Would give 3.5 stars for late night/early morning opening and delivery.
