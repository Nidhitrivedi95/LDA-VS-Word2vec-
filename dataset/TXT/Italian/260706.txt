wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g My boyfriend and I were in a rush to find a place to eat inside the Venetian before watching the Blue Man Group, and so we stumbled upon this cute little restaurant in the middle of the Venetian Shops. I ordered the Beef Risotto and my boyfriend ordered the Cannelloni Di Pollo. 

I expected a lot from my Beef Risotto since it was priced around $20 for a very small portion of food. The beef was probably the only highlight to the risotto. I did not like the wine sauce that it came with and the risotto tasted hard and not cooked thoroughly. I think I enjoyed eating my boyfriend's food more than my own. His order of the Cannelloni Di Pollo was overwhelmingly cheesy but the chicken and the marinara sauce was good. 

The service here is the main reason why I give this place only two stars. It was really really pain stakingly SLOW (I even emphasized to our waiter that we had a show to catch!). We were in such a rush to catch our show and almost missed it because of how slow the service was. We waited 15 minutes for someone to bring us our bill and towards the end we just walked up to pay for the meal.

I probably won't come back to this place since there are so many better restaurants in Vegas. But I guess if you have all the time in the world and want to pay for overpriced risotto you can give this place a shot.
