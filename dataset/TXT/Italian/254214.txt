VVeT1XqQYwrB_fbp3efdUg Good food. I wanted to try a "hot dog" place in NC because I grew up in NY and there was one on every corner. I had the Carolina dog. It was good, it had a nice snap to it when I bit into it. I like that because I prefer the natural casing dogs. I would like to try the deep dish pizza next time I go back.
