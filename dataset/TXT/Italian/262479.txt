wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg Went here for the first time with bRUNch Running Group Phoenix for their Kick off in Pheonix.  Shared the French Toast (OMG!) and the Beef Rib Hash (Yum!) with my running partner.  She had the Peach Bellinni (sp?) and i had the Red Rooster (Bloody Mary). I wasn't a Bloody Mary fan until I had the Red Rooster very tasty, spicy and delish! The food was fabulous!
