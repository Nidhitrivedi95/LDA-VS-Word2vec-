ZvtELJTUOh0yRrPxyyiakQ I love Oregano's and they seem to know how to hire nice and happy people at all locations. The servers here are attentive and accommodating. My favorite appetizer is the garlic bread with cheese, entree is the numero uno stuffed pizza and all of the pizza cookie desserts are awesome!
