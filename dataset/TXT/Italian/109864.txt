G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Went for dinner with my sister on her 25th birthday and had a great time. Lauren was our server and she was wonderful. We chose this restaurant because of Giada, so I was expecting it to be nice but wow is it classyyyy. It is fine dining and everything that comes along with it. My favorite was the featured bread plate of the day because there were many things to try not just one chunk of bread to eat. I had the ravioli and my sister the cucumber soup and risotto. All delicious!:) 

It was chilly in the restaurant but most places are freezing in Vegas so no surprise there. Unfortunately the neighboring server to Lauren's section was rude and I could hear his nasty comments about his coworkers to his tables. No thanks. 

Lauren was great though! Friendly and made us feel right at home:)
