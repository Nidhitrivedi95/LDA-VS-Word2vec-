I was with a big group of people, and we ordered:
- margerita pizza
- pepperoni pizza
-smokey pizza
-funghi pizza
-sausage pizza

And another pizza that was basically a funghi with proscuitto and duck added on top.

The only thing I was impressed with was the duck.  I thought the pizza was .....   .......   *yawn*
Meh.

I doubt I'll ever be back.
But if I do go back, I'll get the duck club instead of pizza.
