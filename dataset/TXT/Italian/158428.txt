LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA We wanted a Non-casino Restaurant Lunch and since we were across from The Wynn, it was convenient.  When ordering my husband asked if the portions were big (he's got a big appetite) and the waiter said not really. However, the portion is huge!! So, be prepared to eat if you order one of their pasta dishes.  My lunch wasn't so great. I orderd the Crab Cake Sandwich which was salty and soggy. The chips that accompanied were stale and overly salty. I had desperatly wished I had stuck to what they know. . .pasta.  The service was slow and to top it off, I ordered a side salad with my sandwich for an extra $2.25 but they charged us for a normal side salad with out an entree. . .$4.50. Now, Its only $2 and I don't want the hassel of getting it  back, but what if everyone was getting charged incorrectly by the same waiter? No Bueno!  So, I said something and the Manager said he'd take care of it. We waited over 20 minutes for $2 and I was regretting my decision as I munched on the mints in the Host area.  When the Manager re-appeared, he comped our lunch because he made us wait so long!  So, I have to say, I will definately visit the one in Santana Row in San Jose, CA just for that. At least I know to stick to the pasta!
