4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg I stayed at the Encore this past weekend.

We were out and hungry around 4 am.  Allegro was the only restuarnt open nearby (that we trusted).  They were well informed of my food allergies and polite.  Good service, nice restaurant, BUT the food was TERRIBLE!!!

I ordered a GF Caesar Salad and my friends ordered pizza.  Everything we tried was not good at all.  Maybe it had something to do with the time of our meal?  Late night - early morning?

All I know is the $88 spent was a waste
