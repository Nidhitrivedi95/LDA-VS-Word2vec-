PmwKGY3HLpcnC_-g0NCIvQ We have eaten here several times. The service is always excellent, the place is always clean and the Food is fresh and delicious. My personal favorite is the chicken Parmesan sub with fries. The bread is superb, they use just the right amount of sauce and cheese and the chicken is nice and crisp. Best chicken parm I've ever had. Great food, nice people.
