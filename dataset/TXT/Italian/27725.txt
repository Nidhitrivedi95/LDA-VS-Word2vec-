4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ Good Evening!
I just wanted to take a minute and compliment you on your wonderful business. It seems these days we go out of our way to complain, but never take the time to acknowledge hard work and excellent quality. 

We've never dined in your establishment, but we hope to one day. We have ordered delivery through Postmates a couple of times though. And I can only imagine how excellent your food is in person. We have now tried eight dishes altogether and we have yet to taste anything that isn't superb. (Even as leftovers several days in a row) 

For our last delivery, we ended up eating rather late and placed our order towards the end of your business hours. Some lovely person included an extra dish (I assume to avoid having to throw it away at the end of the night). The extra dish of tortellini with sausage in a spicy sauce has quickly become a favorite. You are very thoughtful, and in such a difficult industry, you shine.
