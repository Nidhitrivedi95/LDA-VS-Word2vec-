RuU1P-CW3DJtiLoNTahUHA YEA! Yelp to the rescue again...

Looking for a new Italian place and Yelp sent us to Zizi's... and it was delicious! In a party of 8, every single one of us had a great meal. 

Service was great, decor is beautiful, wine selection decent, and although their deserts did seem to be bought, I can highly recommend the limoncello truffle!
Thanks Yelpers!
