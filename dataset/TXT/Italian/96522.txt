ERnG-1q3igX3VSgm5uLZ6A This place is as authentic as it gets for Italian Pizza in Toronto. To be honest I would avoid pizzerias here until I discovered Pizza e pazzi. 

I have been to the Wychwood location numerous times and I have never been disappointed. Recently I visited their Corso Italia place with a group of pizza lovers. I had high expectations and let's say they delivered on every bit except the service. 

The food was fantastic. I ordered the Diavola as usual. This pizza never fails me. Love the spicy salami and basil with a drizzle of spicy olive oil on top! We also had the crispy calamari appetizer to share. While not the best, it was well cooked and seasoned. 

All of us were very satisfied at the end of our meal. Then Lambert ordered the nutella dessert to share. It was amazing. Fried dough drizzled with generous amounts of nutella and powdered sugar. Every bite was heavenly. I was really full but I couldn't stop eating it. All in all a great experience. I wouldn't hesitate to come back with a group again!
