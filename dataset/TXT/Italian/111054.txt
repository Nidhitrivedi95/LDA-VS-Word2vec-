g-nzfTvso3-4c4gkhkmGbQ Like the last reviewer, I too do not know why I like Frankie Tomatto's! Where Italian food is concerned, Frankie's ranks lower than East Side Mario's (sorry east sides, I love you).  My rule on buffets is this: YOU KNOW the food is going to be lower quality than a-la-carte restaurants, it's practically a no-brainer.  So you set yourself up for crappy food, you starve yourself for the day in anticipation, and so everything (and I do mean everything) looks great! 

Frankie's interior is sorta weird, like they are trying to replicate a small Italian village. Instead I feel like I'm in a cartoon painting of a Swedish Town.  The stations are pretty standard where Italian buffets go. You got the pizza, the pasta, the salad, the meats, the seafood, the bread station  and of course the desserts.  The food actually isn't too shabby, I mean again from buffet standards.
