YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ Two years ago we loved this place and went all the time. But the quality has slipped a lot and at this point the cost is too high for what you get. The Crazy Alfredo used to rock. Big tail-on shrimp and fresh sliced mushrooms. Now? Tiny bay shrimp and canned mushrooms. There is so little cheese in the Chedder mac that you have to order it with double cheese just to it is not a bowl of pasta and béchamel sauce. Which of course, drives the price even higher.  Again, they are close by and we used to go all the time and we loved the place. But I have gone maybe four times in the last 18 months and it just doesn't get any better. Mac Shack doesn't suck. It's clean and the service tends to be competent and mostly friendly. But the quality of the ingredients used has gone way downhill and does not appear to be coming back up anytime soon.
