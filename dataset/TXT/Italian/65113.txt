BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA Came here for my dads birthday and we all really enjoyed it! Good wine list and they had some specialty cocktails as well, my girlfriend enjoyed her martini. Loved the short rib ravioli! Been here twice now and loved some things Ive tried and be "eh" about a few, the things that were great though were really great, just need to make my way through and make notes of what I love. We will be back for sure.
