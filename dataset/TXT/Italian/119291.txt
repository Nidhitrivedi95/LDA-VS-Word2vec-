H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g Holy goodness Batman! This place was pretty amazing. The service was spot-on and the food was awesome.... so much so that I ate there twice during my week long stay.
Have some cheese - I highly recommend the taleggio. It is fantastic by itself and even better with the honey, cherry, or apricot they bring out with the cheese. I got the cheese both times it was just so good.
The fried cauliflower was hands down the best fried cauliflower I've ever eaten.  It didn't need any dipping sauce, just a little lemon juice that's it.
They make their own ricotta in house and you can tell. 
We got great wine recommendations from our waiter. 
Of the 4 main courses I've seen/eaten not one was disappointing. The spaghetti and meatballs was simple and tasty. The veal meatballs on polenta I will definitely have to have next time I go.
