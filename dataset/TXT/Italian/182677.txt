oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw Can't tell you why this place is rated so low, maybe people don't know what to order?  But the food we had here was outstanding! 

After a long day at a conference (ha!) we decided to frequent the closest Puck restaurant.  My fiance & I initially wanted the same dish, but ultimately decided on a second one so we could better experience their menu.
First up is the Ricotta Gnocchi which was out of this world great; It was fully flavorful and cooked with great care.  I know it sounds odd, but sometimes it can be a little overcooked to the point when it almost seems like a rubbery ball of cheese (though anything with cheese is still good).  However, this establishment's version was cooked so well that the exterior merely held the wonderful flavors inside rather than detracting from the overall taste. Definitely one of the better gnocchi dishes that I've had, 5+ stars.
Second on our list was the Green Lasagna.  Now, don't laugh at my naivety (or stupidity) but I expected green to mean vegetarian, so I was happily surprised when the meal arrived at I realized that there was meat inside 0:-).  Overall, the meal was very good as it tasted great and had a smooth consistency like a knife through warm butter, yet firm enough to refrain from spilling out.  It also had a great blend of flavors as their cheese-to-meat-to-pasta ratio was spot on and I also recommend this dish to others, 4 stars.

Being in love with Italian food, I'm always weary of restaurants that come with high praise because quite often they fail.  However, Lupo exceeded my expectations and definitely fit the bill of what people expect from a Puck-staurant.
