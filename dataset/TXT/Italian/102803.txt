FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw Visited the Ritz Carlton Hotel for our family's annual Christmas Day Brunch (2016). For the last few years we have enjoyed the buffet at Toca so hoped to do the same this year. They offered a Christmas family special held on their ballroom instead of in Toca. Turned out to be a bad choice for us. The service was extremely slow -- the waitress as trying but clearly overwhelmed and delayed by having to "go downstairs" for everything we asked for. The buffet was not replenished often so everytime they refilled the raw bar it was swarmed and left in disarray. People were picking food off the resupply tray as the staff was trying to refill the raw bar. Definitely did not meet our expectations of the Ritz Carlton Hotel and Toca. If we decide to go back, we will definitely refuse to be seated upstairs again. But there are plenty of better choices around the city for the money that they are charging for this sub-par experience.
