pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ The restaurant is very authentic Italian. The food was phenomenal and the wait staff was great. Jesseka Stephens was our waitress and was so polite and friendly. She had us laughing. We had a special request and the chef honored it without complaint. The restaurant is great for a romantic dinner as well as family. We came on a Saturday night but they got to seem very quickly. I would highly recommend the spinach cannoli  topped off with bread pudding for dessert.
