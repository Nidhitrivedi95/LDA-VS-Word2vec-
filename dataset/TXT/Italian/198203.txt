pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Thought this would be a great pizza spot, based upon some reviews.. Ordered Antipasto which was a mysterious combination of 1 slice cheese, 1 slice fried eggplant, a bit of sausage and some mystery food (I think beans). This was on the menu for $15. I never had anything like this before, and hope I never will again.  It was gross.
The pizza tasted fabulous.  My only objection was the price of this tiny pie,  12" pizza pie for $20.  Only enough to feed one hungry person.  Way overpriced!
