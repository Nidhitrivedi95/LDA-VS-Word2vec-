kp-FRmyPxjsAoEK1-21rSQ Great service!! My boyfriend and I went to Riccio's for takeout. Since it was our first visit we asked for recommendations from the Riccio's staff. We ended up sharing a caesar salad (really big, definitely share-able), he ordered Tortolloni Bellagio and I got the daily special, Portabello Ravioli. It was SO good. Very creamy and rich. Excellent comfort food. The Bellagio was the standout. We were licking the takeout container after we finished. Sad that I lived in the area for more than 2 years before finding this authentic Italian ristorante. I HIGHLY recommend. Good for date night, dinner with the parents and takeout.
