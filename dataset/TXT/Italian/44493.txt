8Cny1-SYxd8vtgmBFFSJYA If you are looking for an amazing dining experience, this is the place to go. 

We walked in late one Sunday evening and were greeted. By the owner, who forewarned is that it was just him that night. There were two other tables of patrons in the place and we weren't in any rush, a decided to stay. Ennio is a charismatic man who has the ability to make all of his guests feel welcome. 

We ordered the croûte au champignons (mushrooms sautéed in butter and garlic with cream sauce on bread) and my dining companion loved it so much that she wanted to lick the plate clean. 

After much deliberation (everything on the menu looked delicious) we decided on the fettuccini a la Ennio and the gnocchi. Unfortunately the last table had used up all of his cheese and he ran out to get more for our meal! 

When we finished our main course, it was almost closing time and we decided not to order desert so as not to keep our gracious host any longer than necessary, but he said it didn't matter to him if we wanted to stay. We ordered the peach Melba and he added some lychee for a twist. 

In total, we were probably there for 2.5 hours, but time flies when you're enjoying yourself.
