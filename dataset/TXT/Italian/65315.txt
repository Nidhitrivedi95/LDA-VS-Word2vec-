BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA Ask for Jon. Absolutely the most knowledgeable and pleasant server you could ask for.

Had all courses and everything was authentic and well done. Perfect proportions and extensive wine list. 

Reasonably priced. Recommend for a date night or dinner meeting. Even better ambiance at night.
