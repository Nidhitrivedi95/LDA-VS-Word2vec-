D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg The views would be amazing if the original tower wasn't smack dab in the middle of it. The ambiance is a little dated. Nothing a good overhaul couldn't take care of. Took forever to get seated, and the food was good but hardly worth the price. All in all, I've had a lot better for a lot less money. Two to three stars at best.
