kp-FRmyPxjsAoEK1-21rSQ Family-owned and operated food establishment focusing on traditional Italian dishes while offering variety with the virtues of homemade quality in mind.

Everything is cooked to order and the diner will find a plethora of starters and entrees to choose from. The entrees (generally) range from $15 on upwards. 

My one and only visit recently included:

- Veal Parmigiana (4/5)
- Garlic Knots (3/5 ~ a little tough)
- Glass of house Merlot (3/5)

Clearly, the tomato sauce is made in-house and speaks tangy and sweet at the same time. The pasta was slightly overcooked and the veal was tender. Portion was very healthy!

Choosing to sit at the bar, I noted lapses in service. It was several minutes before I was approached by a server. It was not until I finished my meal that I was checked in upon by my server. Service does matter!

Very friendly staff and you'll feel right at home dining here!
