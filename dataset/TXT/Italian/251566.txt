VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w On a recent business trip to Phoenix I had a dinner at this small restaurant. At first I had planned to just carry out a pizza, but once I arrived I decided to dine in, since the small place looked very cosy. The place has a good reputation for pizza (they are prepared in a stone oven visible from where you sit), but I opted for the Sicilian spaghetti dish with vegetables, Italian sausage and tomato sauce. Before I received my dish I was served some warm flatbread with a nice vegetable salsa. The spaghetti was fabulous: tasty sauce, fresh veggies and spicy slices of sausage. The pasta was nicely cooked as well (al dente). Overall this restaurant was a very nice surprise and with reasonable prices. It looks like it's family run with the friendly owners serving and cooking. I need to return here on my next visit to Phoenix to try their pizza!
