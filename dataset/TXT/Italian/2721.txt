Many moons ago, I had a choice between going to the Pizza Hut that used to be at Midland and Finch, or Highway 7 and McCowan. The former has been closed for years. The latter is still alive and kicking. 

A few years ago, this Pizza Hut opened, which is even closer to my home than the old one. I told my parents about it. 

After visiting the Peterborough Veg Fest, it seems hilarious that I would have dinner with my parents and gorge on all meat choices. They ordered two medium pizzas in the lovers series: meat and supreme. They also got honey garlic wings. 

The wings are decent. You can't taste the garlic, so you may be disappointed if you can't ward off vampire and evil spirits afterwards. 

Next to Little Caesars, I love pan pizza from Pizza Hut. I don't mind the oiliness now and again. It's yummy. 

The store is clean whenever I'm there. I'm glad that it's a five-minute drive away.
