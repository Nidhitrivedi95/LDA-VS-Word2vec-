oUvqwPJkorOnYZFKRt0oEg Looking at all of the great reviews for Baci, I truly expected this place to be a diamond in the rough. My sister told me she went prior to our visit and wasn't ecstatic about the place and we should have listened. The bread was decent, the soup tasted mediocre, but the pasta was a disgrace. The four of us at the table each got a different dish from pasta with vodka sauce to the chicken parmesan. None of us were happy with our dishes and didn't even come close to finishing our plates. The server asked us if we wanted a box for the abundant amount of food we left and we said no. Our server was super nice and attentive but unfortunately her kitchen didn't help her out with quality food. There is nothing I want more than to help out local restaurants and give them great reviews but unfortunately I cannot honestly do that for Baci. Drive to San Tan and head to Carrabba's. Sorry Baci!
