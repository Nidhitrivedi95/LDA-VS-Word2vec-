T7yKffTuhiIZclsgjfgowA We found this place by accident while wondering around the area. It was the best accident we ever made. I love pizza and I'm very funny about it. Let me start by saying, this is a real pizza!!! The sauce was incredible, it had just the right amount of sweetness, where you could eat it plain. Real mozzarella cheese slices, not too much, just enough to mix well with the flavor of the pizza. The crust was also delicious and the texture and flavor was just right. The reason for the 4 star was because our waiter was at our table removing dishes and items eat too fast, we felt rushed to get out of there. Do yourself a favor and stop in for a pizza!
