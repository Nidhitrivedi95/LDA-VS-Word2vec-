GmgAToSKHnnB3BUtp9eQzw We had high expectations for Tratto after reading the recent review in the newspaper - perhaps too high.  Although the food was very good, it wasn't exceptional.  The lettuce salad with aged parmesan shavings was very fresh and good and large enough for two to share.  The bread service was excellent - both french bread and sliced focaccia with olive oil.  The tortellini were large and tender in spots and al dente in others, with a rich cream/yellow tomato sauce.  A serving contained 7 tortellini which was about right for one person.  Another person in our party had a breaded, pounded pork chop with a butter sauce and really enjoyed it.

The negatives:  the menu is very short (not a lot of options), service was rather slow even though they weren't completely full early on a Wednesday night, and wines by the glass are very expensive.

We enjoyed it, but didn't feel it was worth the hour drive to go back.
