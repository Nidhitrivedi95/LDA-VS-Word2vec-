The setup is geared more towards a lunch crowd from what I could tell and has an open feel. 
Anyway on to the main attraction we ordered a share size margerita pizza I had the Bolognese. 
Mundane Pasta and pizza that tastes like frozen counterparts. The service is good which gives it a half star bump. It can be a decent choice over food courts if you are just looking for food as a filler. Otherwise keep on looking this area :)
