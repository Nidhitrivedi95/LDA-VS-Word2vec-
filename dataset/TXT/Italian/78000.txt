CzqGem5OaPAk10bQK4bzbg We visited last night for dinner. We ordered the bruschetta and mozzarella sticks. Both were very good. We ordered the lasagna, the prime rib, the spots and penne with marinara. As a vegetarian, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of options. The online menu lists pizza, but when we arrived, the menu didn't have pizza. I was disappointed that the noodles with my marinara sauce weren't al dente, but were on the mushy side. Everyone else enjoyed their meals. We all enjoyed pecan balls for dessert. The service was really good. The crowd is a bit older, but we actually appreciated that it was quiet and we could hear and converse with one another. 

I hope they update their online menu soon and I'd love to see more vegetarian options.
