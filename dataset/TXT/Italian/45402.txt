8lZtLSeJVg28Gb75iklmmQ Well, for Las Vegas. it's a four star for pizza!   Today was my final day to cover our company other location, and I decided to visit East Coast Pizza for their namesake. 

I was very happy with their crispy, but yet chewy crust and it remind me of a lot of pizza parlors in NY, but for Las Vegas this was exceptional, because this is truly the heart of any great pizza!    The sauce and cheese were balanced very well.     Yes, I was very impressed with this pizza, and you folks in Summerlin are very lucky to have East Coast on the west side.

Today, I had to work in the area, and a few of the other employees were raving about this place.    I'm happy that I listen to my boss on this one, because their Meatball sandwich was pretty good!    The sauce could have gotten a little more bite to it, but it was good.     A nice crispy bread, and lots of baked cheese.    Maybe tomorrow, I'll buy the crew a pizza if my parlay hits.
