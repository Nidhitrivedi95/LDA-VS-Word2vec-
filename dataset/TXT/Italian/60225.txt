aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA This place is heaven on earth!!!  It's like the coolest best pizza in town type of place! 

So we randomly stopped a guy on the street and asked where we should go and eat as we are visiting and wanted something different. He told us that Ian's is where we should go and we took his word and found Ian's and thank God we did!

Amazingly different pizzas with the perfect topping that should be on a pizza. I mean, who can go wrong with Mac and cheese pizza, taco pizza or steak fries with ranch dressing pizza. Really... The best pizza ever! The place is nice and clean. They make fresh pizzas all day long so they have something different a few times a day. The staff is super friendly and they take the time out to explain what types of pizzas they have and so on. All the pizza are tasty and done just right.

I can't wait to go back and try their other pizzas.
A side note - so they have different special pizzas ever week so there is always something off the wall different to try!
