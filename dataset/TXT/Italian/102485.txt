fhx1yUZlC1QwovIjdYeGiw Beautifully appointed wine bar and Italian restaurant in their grand opening phase.  The bar is well stocked with many options.  Reviewed the menu to find lasagna, seafood dishes, wood fired pizza and salads.

We were greeted by very friendly staff who were learning the menu.  There is lots of room for groups.

We had drinks and dessert. The long Island Iced Tea was a great mix. The cheesecake is made in house and did not disappoint.  We will be back in December and I'll update my review at that time.
