pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Ok, whoever said this was one of the best places to eat pizza obviously spent too much time in the desert sun, had no palette, or never ate pizza in their life. (or a combination of these)
This was by far one of the worst places I have ever eaten pizza in my entire life.  21.00 for a pizza that the crust was so paper thin and burnt.  

This place is by no means kid friendly.  No butter for their bread and no pepperoni.  Who the hell ever heard of that?  No pepperoni?  I speculate since the crust was so thin, the grease from the pepperoni would destroy the paper thin crust.  Just with the salami, stingy amount of cheese and the wood fired mushroom, they all fell off the pizza.  seriously, you would need a spoon to eat it if it was a real pizza with real amount of toppings.  And it was so thin you just may have needed a spoon to eat it an.

I was just telling my spouse how this was the most unfriendly kid place when in walked a husband and wife with 4 kids.  Wouldn't you know 2 of them were so excited about having pepperoni pizza.  

Had it not been for the fact we had them put garlic on the pizza it would have no flavoring.  I did mention it before but let me tell you again, they were very stingy with the cheese.  For a place who boasts about making their own mozzarella you would think they would but a sufficient amount of cheese on their pizza.  It is alot cheaper to make fresh mozzarella so there is no reason for not putting enough on their pizza except for the fact their crust could not hold it.  This is by far one of the worst pizzas I have had in a very long time.

On the good side, the service was excellent.  Be overall I would say, BUYER BEWARE!  I have had some slumdog carry out/delivery  pizza which tasted better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh Yeah, did I mention, it was burnt like the desert floor too?????
