If you want Americanized-Italian food... This isn't the place to go. If you want a little hole in the wall that is straight out of Sicily, this is your place. 

One of my favorite things about this experience was the "family" environment the staff at with one another. They were joking, laughing, smiling, not only with their guests but with each other. It really added to my experience knowing that they WANTED to be there, not just forced too.

If you want great home style affordable Italian food without the artificial glam of the Vegas strip -- say hello to your new Italian family!
