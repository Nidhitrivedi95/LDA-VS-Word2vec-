N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg This is follow-up regarding my ordering experience. I have to say that Lou's went above and beyond to make things right. Not only did they fulfill my order, the pizzas were delicious! For anyone doubting the authentic Lou's taste, go in and see for yourself. The pizza was just as good as I remember. I fed a large group of Chicago transplants and we all agreed it was just like home. Special thanks to Mike Sterner for taking the time to personally address the issue.
