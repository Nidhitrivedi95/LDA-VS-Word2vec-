99j5vhhtFJIefXDLsmA29Q Wow! House hunting in Charlotte from Boston. I read about this place in Charlotte magazine. Came for lunch with the whole family. Absolutely delicious!! Arugula salad was so fresh, the parmigiana cut perfect, the cherry tomatoes fantastic. My judge of a pizza place is the margherita, not even a piece of crust left on the tray. My wife favorite pizza in Italy is the capricciosa, she took the last piece from me with a smile saying sorry it's mine.
