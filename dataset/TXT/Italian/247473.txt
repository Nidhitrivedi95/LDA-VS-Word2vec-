VA95qAV2PRH9gtTi2Vfv4Q Nice restaurant.  They unfortunately won't accept reservations but other than that everything is great.  I was a little surpised that they wouldn't make an exception in order for me to propose, but it worked out better elsewhere anyways.  

The atmosphere is nice with our favourite table being isolated on the small balcony facing Yorkville Avenue.  A great summer location overall.

The bison carpaccio is excellent.  We;ve had a number of entrees there all of which were good, but nothing amazing.  

I would go here with expectation of having a consistently good meal and enjoying the neighbourhood in the summer, but I wouldn't go with the expectation of having an astounding culinary experience.
