VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w This was one of the first nightclubs I went to in Las Vegas.  We got in at Happy Hour and had the worst tasting free drinks.  I couldn't finish my one drink because it tasted so horrible.  After HH was over, the regular drinks tasted fine.  At first the place started out empty but slowly got packed as the night went on.

It wasn't a big club but the decor and theme were cool.  It had an Indian/Mediterranean theme that carried into the bathrooms.  The girls of course liked the fact that it had a dance stage and small strip.
The music was rockin and played a good variety from Rock n Roll, 80's, Hip Hop and Rap.  It was a bit difficult getting drinks all night since there's only one bar.  Since this place was small, the smoke can get to you if your sensitive to it.  Yes smoking is allowed in all LV nightclubs.  Keep that in mind for the child bearing hotties.  We had one in our group and she had to leave early in the night.
