B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw Went there for dinner and tried a few different dishes: the kale salad and lentil dish for appetizers. Had the mushrooms pizza and veal rigatoni for main course. The everything was good overall. I would say the apps specially were a touch too bland. The lentils dish needed a sauce or some lemon juice or something. The pizza was great. The rigatoni was ok but not the best. The place has a very cool atmosphere and the staff was very nice. The prices are reasonable. I would definitely go there again...probably mainly for the vibe and drinks.
