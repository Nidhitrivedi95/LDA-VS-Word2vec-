QJg8AuqITB4t_iKrLI6tOw Bodira Cafe is tucked at the corner of this little plaza at the corner and 14th Ave and Boxgrove By-Pass.

You can say it is a cafe as it does serves Espresso drinks and some counter for you to drink your morning coffee just like in Italy. Aside from that, there is a little round table for 2 where the owner chilling out with his friend when I walked in.

Cappuccino ($2.50) is nicely made and delicious went well with the complimentary EMMA Almond Biscotti. How he knows almond is my favourite?

Aside from drinks, there is also a great selection of groceries that are imported from Italian.

Really nice small coffee place, a great addition the the neighbourhood!
