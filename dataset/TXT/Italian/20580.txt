31acLzszeCCpeXmyAnoTdg Just finished a fabulous meal here with my wife. We had the 3 Antipasti, Eggplant, Olives, and Ricotta Spread. Added the mortadella for good measure. All were fabulous. Secondi, we had the mussels and the squash blossoms. The squash blossoms were outstanding, and the mussel broth with saffron is just amazing. We split the fish of the day, NC grouper. Again, very well prepared. Throw in the tart of the day, and the chocolate tart as well, and a very solid meal for two. The service was spot on. When we go back, we'll go with at least two other couples, so we can do family style. So many good options.
