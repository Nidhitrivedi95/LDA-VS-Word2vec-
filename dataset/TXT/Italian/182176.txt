After 6 years on Willy Street in Madison, the La Rocca family relocated their restaurant to this space on the edge of Oregon just off of Highway 138. My personal favorite is the Veggie Rolle which is layers of vegetable pasta with cheese and sauce all rolled up. I am not a vegetarian but love this dish nonetheless. The house red sauce is very tasty and made in house. In fact, everything is made in house which can sometimes lead to delays. On my last visit my companion and I waited 15 minutes for bread to be brought to the table because it was still in the oven. I recommend La Rocca's for a quiet date, families, and later in the evening, for groups.
