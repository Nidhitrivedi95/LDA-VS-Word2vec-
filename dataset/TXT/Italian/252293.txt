I went here for dinner on a Tuesday night and it was very busy. I highly recommend making a reservation because we didn't have to wait. The place is beautiful with a bar/lounge area and lots of tables in the back. My friends and I started with the meatball with whipped ricotta ($24). It was amazing. Literally the best meatball I've ever had. The sauce was on point and tasted great with garlic bread. The meat melts in your mouth. To drink, I had the cocktail (meadows-$14). It was ok, a little to sweet for me and reminded me of a mojito. For my entree, I had the penne seafood alfredo ($33). I loved how light the sauce was and there were 3 large shrimp and a couple of cut up scallops. Overall, an excellent pasta dish without making you feel bloated. The service was also wonderful. I'll definitely be back for dinner!
