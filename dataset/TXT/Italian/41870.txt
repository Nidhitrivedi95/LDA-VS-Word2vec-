7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Avocado green walls soothe me.  So do various types of eggs benedicts.  I took my visiting-me-from-afar mom here & she was quite pleased.  Their hollandaise sauce is wonderful & I like how warm & welcoming the staff always seems to be (even when the queue is out the door).

My only mumbling is that I wish they had a still bountiful-dairy-free smoothie option.
