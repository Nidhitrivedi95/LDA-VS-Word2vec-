Cg3sK4ptre1uPPCzPWH1aw These guys are brutal!  So so type ambiance but the food and service was extremely bad. I ordered the Chicken pasta dish (can't remember exact name, but it was a tiny dish... and there were maybe 4 skinny slivers of chicken in there.  I told the server and her answer was " Oh, that's the way it is!".  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager; the manager came and said ..."oh, that's just the way it is!!!".  That's the way it is???!!!!  Wtf?!  So your chicken dish comes with no chicken??? and that's the way it is?   They wouldn't refund, but said I could order something else (no kidding). No apologies, no coupons or comps... nothing.

I will never ever go back to this joint.
