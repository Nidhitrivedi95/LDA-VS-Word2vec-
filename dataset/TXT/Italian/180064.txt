I ordered the cheese stake and it was amazing, the most addicting part of the fries. The menu offer variety of foods with a mix of Italian and American. You can't go wrong, oh and they specialize in desserts! I loved the tiramisu, must get with coffee. This is my second time here and I'm a local. Oh, and free parking at the palazo/Venetian!
