zBsAx28cbiUgqWGjKOGucA This place definitely has some of the best pizzas! I came here for lunch today. They serve wood oven pizza and this place is a sit down restaurant. I had the Slow 'n Low Pie (Pulled Pork, Apple Slaw, BBQ Sauce, Caramelized Onions, and other toppings) and I got the individual lunch size one. It was more than enough for myself. I was super full after that. The "pie" take a very short time to cook - apparently its ready in 90 seconds after you order it. It probably takes an additional few minutes to put the toppings on top though. It was amazing I can still taste it in my mouth while writing this review. The only reason why I did not give this place a 5 star is because of the service. The server who placed our order was awesome! But the server who was taking care of our payment was not. She was VERY slow. We were a large group, but she was very inefficient. She took her sweet time and they only had one machine. 

I will definitely come back again though!
