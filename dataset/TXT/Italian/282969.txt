z2VJoa0l_QGFhl7YqiES6g My boyfriend and I absolutely love this restaurant.  We stumbled across it one day when we were in the neighborhood and now it is part of our  tradition.  The staff is kind and efficient as you would expect from a family owned establishment.  The food is amazing and we have never been disappointed with the specials.  We signed up for their newsletter and look forward to receiving it each day.  Not only does it pass on info about menu items, but the descriptions and research are impeccable.  As a small business owner myself I am thoroughly impressed with the product and customer service!
