Ojw5eTqzbv6k27_Df3q0-A For a chain, this is one of the better selections in Madison. I have been to Biaggi's on several occasions (both lunch and dinner). I have always had a great experience and good food. 

The bread is amazing and probably what sets Biaggi's apart from other places. You receive two different types of bread, one soft and one hard. There is EVOO at the table along with parm. cheese and pepper. This makes for a great dipping mixture. 

I have tried a few things, however, I keep coming back to the eggplant parm. It is fresh, soft and perfectly portioned. I would highly recommend.
