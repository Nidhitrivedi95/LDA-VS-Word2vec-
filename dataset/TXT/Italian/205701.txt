qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA 1 word for this place, EXCELLANT!! Service and food were both very good. The owner makes you feel like you're part of the family. The bread to start was out of this world. I got the Eggplant Parmesan and my boyfriend got the Cheese Ravioli w a side of meatballs, everything was so good and the price was very reasonable. The place is small but don't let the size fool you. I will definitely visit this place again the next time in Vegas. Thanks for a great meal!!
