4LXZzgsrM1ZyS_-uB9Od2Q Had brunch here today. Eggs Benny was pretty good. But it was on rye bread which was impossible to cut. Potatoes were days old and re-grilled. When I mentioned it to the waiter he said they were fresh. There's no way. I know what fresh potatos taste like as I cook and am a human, and these were definitely reheated. Another weird thing: the whole meal was served on a salad plate. There was no room to cut or move anything, or put down your cutlery on the plate. Things kept falling off the plate. And just to be clear, it wasn't just that there was a lot of food, we measured the plates. 

This was a very weird place with all these things. Wouldn't go back.
