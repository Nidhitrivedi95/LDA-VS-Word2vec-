TFftsYkRIUtdo6ZhRwJ2lQ Great food, service is bad. I called this place up last week to make a reservation for a birthday dinner, and I requested a patio seat. The lady didn't guarantee one and she said it depends on availability at the time. She put a note down on my reservation for a patio seat. So I made the reservation anyway, and I got a call on Monday to confirm my reservation. I arrived the restaurant in the evening and was told the patio is already closed for the season. What????! First of all, the last could have told me they were closing the patio by this week, but she didn't. There's no way they didn't anticipate that, unless they just one day decided not to seat customers outside anymore. Secondly, they could have told me over the phone in the morning before I arrive for my reservation. I would have changed venue had I known the patio is closed. I really wanted to dine in the patio. 

Well, it was really busy for a Monday night, and the food was amazing. The service was horrible though. We waited 30 minutes for dessert, and 30 minutes for the bill. Everything took so long. 

The food was amazing, and the ambiance in the restaurant was fantastic. I would come back. But I'm really disappointed for not getting notified earlier about the patio.
