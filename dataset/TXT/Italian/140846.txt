JlMYSLiLnpWiihmzZkQS-w I took my order to go and was extremely dissatified with the quality. I ordered the chicken alfredo for my anniversary and when I got home to check it, the noodles were very dry and had a very minute amount of alfredo sauce. Also, the noodles were halfway over cooked. Next time I would definately check my food before leaving and ask for extra sauce. Brooklyn Boys' alfredo blows this place out of the water!
