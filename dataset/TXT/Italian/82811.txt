DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw Let me start by saying this is a beautiful restaurant, and I was not expecting something so nice to be located in a strip mall. We came in dressed very casually, but were welcomed immediately with a kind word and a smile.
The good-The pinot grigio we had was delicious. The olive oil/pesto dipping sauce was divine. The lasagna was well done,the pasta tasted very fresh, and the size was hearty. The tiramisu was amazing. It was the best thing I ate.
The not so good-The prices were really high. I was not expecting to pay 26 dollars for lasagna and 12 dollars for a dessert. Yikes! The bread was 50/50. It was a mix of a dinner roll and what seemed to be fococcia. The roll was good, but the fococcia was so dry, that the oil mixture didn't even soften it. Our service was slow once we were seated, I think they may have forgotten about us, but they were busy, so I'm willing to let that go. 
Overall a nice place for a romantic date, but nothing some place I would go regularly.
