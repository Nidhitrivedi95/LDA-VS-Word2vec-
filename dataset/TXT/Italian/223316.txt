SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw I went in to place an order today after discovering Bistro Pizza on Yelp. The staff was friendly and offered a warm greeting. After browsing the menu I decided to order the baked penne, a stromboli, pep pizza and garlic knots. The quoted wait time for my order was accurate (I left to go pick up my daughter from school down the street). I asked for ranch with the salad that came with the penne. Once the order was ready I asked again if the ranch was in the container with the salad and I was told it was. I did not check the order but was disappointed when I got home to find that the stromboli was missing and there was no ranch for my salad and it was tossed in a balsamic dressing :( So, i called the Bistro and they were apologetic and offered me a free stromboli (or the one I paid for and didn't get) for my next visit. The food was very good though.
