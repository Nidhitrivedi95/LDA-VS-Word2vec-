pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Lunch here was rely pretty good, lite flavor not too heavy and great crust. Again it's not American pizza but a traditional Italian fare. 

The bartender advised me to get 1/2 of their 2 most popular and it was a great choice. I very much enjoyed my meal. Large detractors were the wait-the food is really good, but the fact that they have out door seating as large as the main restaurant and don't seat it is stupid. Also they don't have enough help. The staff was great and very knowledge-but they were running around like the possessed. They need more staff to handle everything. Now I did come in at an off time but it still speaks to a great idea poorly executed based on how the food was delivered. 

Had they taken care of the few issues I easily could rate this higher.
