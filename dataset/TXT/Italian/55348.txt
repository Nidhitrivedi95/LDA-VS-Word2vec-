aIBvcOjkAURJJ-UH0G-s0g Old school pizza with what was thin crust in the 80's but is now more like thick crust for those who love Margerita style pizzas.

This is not Libretto, this is a pizza from a kinder, gentler time when there was lots of sauce, cheese and pepperoni on a slice.

Tip: get a container of the sauce that is meant for those greasy deep fried Panzerotti and dip your folded slice in it instead.  Delish!

Some rave about the panzo but I prefer the slices.

I tried ordering a full pizza once, and like Evelyn said, it wasn't nearly as good.  The crust was way too thick and toppings didn't stay on.  It was as if it came from a different shop!

Never tried the veal because I won't stray from California sandwiches veal which is just around the corner. and the lineups there don't lie, best Veal in the city.
