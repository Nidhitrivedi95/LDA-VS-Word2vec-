vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw This. Is. My. Favorite. Italian. Eatery.  My mouth is watering, and waistline increasing as I write this.  TMI? I don't think so. There is not a single item on the menu that I won't eat. I sat outside in the hot weather gratefully for 30 minutes. I didn't mind. I knew once inside, I would be in my desert oasis. Thank you for not being in California. I don't think I could afford to buy more clothes. Just kidding. Please come to California! I don't care anymore, I will buy new fat pants everyday.   be with me forever. I'll never let you go.......
