2PrumlGyBhyqzS4m96FYtQ i ordered a lasagna with a side of mixed veggies and had a lime drank to quench my thirst. i liked the mushrooms the most out of the veggies.

the lasagna was excellent. lots of layers. saucy and soft. sometimes you get lasagna and there is cheese that's been melted on top but then it hardens and a kinda gross cheese layer on top. you don't get that here. you can cut through it easily from top to bottom with just a fork. it was quite filling and for those who have a sweet tooth, you can get some baked goods/pastries or gelato. i'm sure i'll be back to try those some time.
