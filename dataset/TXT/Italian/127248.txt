HUWLnKD5LSZY134amUO2Rg Looked at the reviews and they are pretty half and half. But im pregnant and I wanted pasta.. and I wanted it now!! I ordered the chicken susan for delivery. (Chicken, broccoli, fetticini, and cream sauce) Its pretty good. It took exactly 50 mins for it to get here. But my expected time was 60 mins. So its okay. Everything was super wrapped in foil. My tin plate, my cup of marinara sauce, my garlic twists, my garlic bread. Everything!!  Which was greatly appriciated because i saw a review saying they recieved their pasta cold. (Maybe they took note and tried to fix their mistake) Everything was nice and hot!! The sauce needed a little salt but iv always felt that way about every cream sauce iv tried. But OMG the broccoli is perfect!! A little buttery. Not too much. Yummy! The pasta comes with a side salad.. but they forgot mine :( I forgave them because most places you have to pay for a side salad. And they also include a pretty big slice of garlic bread :) yum!! I wasnt even expecting it! I also ordered the garlic twist. Pretty good. But if you like your bread with ranch instead of marinara sauce be sure to let them know. My only complaint about the actual food is.. I wish they grilled the chicken instead of boiled it. Its not bad.. I just think it would taste amazing grilled!! Ill ask next time :) I say just try this place!! And see for yourself. Its all a great price too.
