eQo4kIwIWJbAnfXYl3k5BA I think the people here (at least at the takeout counter) are much nicer & more welcoming that the one on Park Rd.

I got the Antipasti Salad to go.

I love that salad.  A decent amount of lettuce, but tons of delicious Italian meats, cheeses & olives, together & topping the lettuce.  A great house dressing, kind of like Thousand Island, but less tangy... I loved it.

The man behind the counter was a talker, but he kept everything in order & seemed to know everyone that walked in.

Another nice place in the Eastland area!
