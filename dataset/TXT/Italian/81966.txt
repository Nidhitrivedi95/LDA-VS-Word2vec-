ddxASRFYINPwPe5F9MqYzQ My husband and I have eaten at Vinyl Pi several times. Some of my favorites are the pork belly, calamari, wings, and pizza. They just started brunch on Sunday. Wow! The shrimp and grits is just right. The shrimp was super fresh and the gravy was a nice touch. My husband had waffles with pork belly and fried bussell sprouts. Y'all, this combination was to die for! Topped it off with a bloody mary served with bacon. They make their bloody mary mix in house. The chef is only 23 years old. He is so talented!!! They have a great selection of craft beer as well as an extension bourbon menu. The service is always top notch! Put this place on the top of your list.
