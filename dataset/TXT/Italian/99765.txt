F56TiSa71Tk4PIQ0HN8oag The first time I experienced Pizzazz on the circle near JCU I was invited to a party in their downstairs 'Jake's Speakeasy'.  it was a great venue for a party - plenty of space, bar seating and tables.  Overall a nice laid back atmosphere... the food was tremendous and the party was a blast.

My girlfriend and I decided to go back for dinner with another couple.  I went with the Stuffed Gnocchi Abruzzi (amazing) and my friend went with a chicken parm.   He loved it ! My girlfriend, being a finicky eater, was thrilled that the menu was not limited to just pizza; she had the Cajun Chicken Salad which was impressively fresh, not to mention Pizzazz's famous Italian salad dressing, which is great.

This has become a regular spot for us, and will continue to be for takeout and dining in.
