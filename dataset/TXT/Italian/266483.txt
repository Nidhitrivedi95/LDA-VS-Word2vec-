x4aHNNo1osWNCB75q_PijQ Came in yesterday and dined at the fire place seating. Was very cozy. The food and drinks were great! The service was also very good. My only complaint was around 430 you could see the waitstaff was having a meeting outside. You could hear what I think was the manager screaming and swearing at the staff. I found that very unprofessional. I will be back because of the food and staff but I hope next time I can enjoy my evening instead of being interrupted by foul language and yelling.
