zi_qqjCzkerE2dT-ViE2JA Without a doubt the most disappointing restaurant I've ever eaten at in Madison (and I've lived here for 20 years and have eaten at ALOT of places in/around town).  Went with a small group for dinner and while the atmosphere is cool (who doesn't love a pretty old church?) - the service and the food was not.  We obviously had someone very new to both waitstaffing and Bellini as she barely knew the menu and her table service was weird - reaching in between people, fingers stuck in our food as she put plates down, etc.  The food was so so so so bad that we all left most of our orders untouched - just super mediocre, oddly flavored, cheapy Italian food.  I can honestly say that Bellini has nothing on Olive Garden (sad but true)!

My husband ordered the veal parmesan - less than 2 hours later he was throwing up in the basement bathroom.  We're talking about a 6'2, 200lb man who can eat unbelievably impressive amounts/types of food without issue, puking his guts out in a restaurant men's room because of "god only knows what was in the veal."  Never happened before that night, hasn't happened since. :(

Needless to say, our evening at Bellini sucked.  It's such a cool venue but the food is so bad, I honestly don't understand how it stays open.  Hate to think that tourists/out-of-towners are eating here and using it as a gauge of Madison's restaurant scene :(
