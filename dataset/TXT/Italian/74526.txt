cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q I made a reservation for my family of 12 and when we arrived they only had us down for a group of four. That was a minor mistake compared to what happened at the table. I don't eat meat so I ordered one of the few meatless dishes - the minestrone soup, "a vegetarian classic" quoted from the menu. I got it and it looked fine but about halfway though eating it, I noticed that there was ground beef in my soup!! I let the waitress know and she handled it horribly. She told me that there was no beef it in it. She brought it back to the kitchen then came back with the same half-eaten dish and put it in front of me proceeding to imply that I was wrong! The manager got involved and told me that they had mixed two soups in the kitchen together - a vegetarian and non-vegetarian soup. Imagine how many other customers were subject to this mistake that night. Following their mistake they even made us pay for the soup. Absolutely unacceptable.

If you have any kind of allergy or specific dietary needs, avoid this restaurant at all costs. Don't be sorry.
