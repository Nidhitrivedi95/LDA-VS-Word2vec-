dPxZI9lrKTl5dvFfnb1_Ig Lobster Ravioli w/Vodka sauce. First time here, had appetizer plate with Fried Calamari, fried zucchini and shrimp. Pasta fagioli. Food is very tasty and Took some cannoli home for desert, meal portions are good size. Will be back to try more items on the menu, recommend it for sure.
