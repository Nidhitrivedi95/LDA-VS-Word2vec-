qUWqjjjfpB2-4P3He5rsKw The quantity vs. price is one of the best I've ever had in Toronto! 
We had 2 single-size pizza, one pasta and one salad. We 3 people was so full and did not finish. The taste was great! We love the Funghi pizza most. It's definitely worth of trying! 
Definitely will go back!
