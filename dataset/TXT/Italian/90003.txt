e8kK01COAK614-RuKlXHug Oh my gosh, I'm in love with....balls. Yes, the joke was there so it had to be said. 

Found this place while searching of all places, Yelp and decided to give it a shot. Located in a mini mall of sorts it was not super busy on a Tuesday night which was ok. I went to the bar and the adorable bartender offered me some samples and explained the menu. 

SOOOO MANY CHOICES. I'm a girl who has a hard time deciding what lipstick to wear so picking out meat, sauce, etc. The combinations were nearly endless. 

I settled on the ball of the month, Thanksgiving themed of course...Turkey, cranberries and stuffing over white cheddar mashed potatoes and chicken gravy. They were....PERFECT. 

Combine that with the huge tap selection and you can't go wrong. Check them out if you're ever in the area!
