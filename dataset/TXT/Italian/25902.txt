4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg Allegro is a good Italian restaurant at the Wynn.  I really enjoyed the food and the wine that we had.  My only issue is that we were sat at a very weird table/booth that had me  essentially climbing in and out of it.  Not too cute in a dress and heels.  I probably would go back; it's a little (SLIGHTLY) more affordable than other sit down restaurants in/on/around the strip
