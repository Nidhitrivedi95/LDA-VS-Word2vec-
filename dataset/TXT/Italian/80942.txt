dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw I fell in love with the dim lighting and sexy decor while walking by and I vowed I would be back for dinner before we left our weekend stay at the MGM. Well vows are not meant to be broken and this place met all my expectations and then some... 

The service was amazing, loved the bread basket, food was delicious, and the drinks did not disappoint.

I had the mediterranean sea bass and it was simply divine!!! Keep in mind mediterranean sea bass nothing like chilean sea bass which is my favorite of the two... However, they mediterranean sea bass still rocked my taste buds!

My friend had the roasted chicken and boasted it 5 stars!!! 

Everything was perfect at Fiamma Trattoria and this place doesn't deserve anything less than 5 stars!
