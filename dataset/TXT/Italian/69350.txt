bVwFqYiz9acU1W24ZmYofQ I don't like mega-chain pizza.  I don't like Domino's.  I don't care for Papa John's.  I've never had Hungry Howie's because frankly on their flyers it looks horrifying.  And I will never ever eat Little Caesar's again in my life . . . but I gotta admit, Pizza Hut makes a decent thin crust pizza

There were a few great locally owned pizza joints where I used to live in Tempe.  Tessio's and Boulders On Broadway stand out, but ya know what?  Sometimes you don't want to pay $20 $25 bucks for an extra large 3 topping pizza.  Sometimes you just want something decent for only $10 $12 bucks.  Sometimes you really DO want a decent cheap pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less

The three years I lived nearby, I probably ordered Pizza Hut delivery or takeout once every couple of months, and I've never had anything to complain about at this location on Broadway

PS - the boneless spicy bbq wings are dangerously addictive
