Casa Di Amore is about 10 minutes away from the strip so it's not something you are going to just come across on the strip but do make an effort to come here when you are in Las Vegas. One of the main reasons this was a planned visit, was due to the great reviews. I will tell you that I was not disappointed at all. The spaghetti was absolutely fantastic, it was perfectly cooked with gigantic meatballs. The spaghetti was very fresh & hot. 

I do wish they would have had a smaller portion as 1 pound was too much for just myself but I tried my best to still finish it because it was that good. It was a smaller place with a great feel to it and the spaghetti was better than I would have imagined it to be. 

The staff was very friendly including our server and food arrived in a timely fashion. As a nice bonus, the server set us up with a shuttle from the restaurant back to the strip at no charge! I thought this was a nice gesture as again it's about 10 minutes outside of the strip where I wanted to get back to anyway. The shuttle was newer, clean & air conditioned. The driver was courteous and our party did tip him which you should do the same as after all it is a free ride. 

If you like Italian food, don't forgot to make reservations when you are booking your trip to Vegas! I will certainly be returning on future trips to Las Vegas.
