w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q I have to say I was a bit surprised that this was so good. I have been to the Palm and Palm too in NY several times and expected to be let down. However I was pleasantly surprised. 

I went alone and had a seat at the bar. The crowd was friendly and spent some time talking with others at the bar. I decided to order dinner and ordered the caesar salad, 14oz fillet and half and half (fries and onion strings). 

My food was excellent. The salad had a wonderful dressing, and lots of cheese. My steak was cooked to perfection and i completely devoured the whole thing. The only item I didn't finish was the half and half, and that was because I wanted to make sure i could finish my steak, it was that good.

Next time i want a steak in Vegas, I won't hesitate to return. The service was fantastic ( could also be because I was at the bar), but the atmosphere made the meal.
