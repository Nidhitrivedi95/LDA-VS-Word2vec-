ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA We had a great date night dinner here!  Fabulous food, outstanding service (thank you Corbin ).  Good wine selection.  My bf had a cocktail and really enjoyed it.  This placd would also be great for groups in the winter...  Lots of outdoor space.   Excited to find such a great spot close to home: we'll definitely come back.
