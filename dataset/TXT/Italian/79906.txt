d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew I placed an online order worth almost $100. The order was supposed to take an hour and my order arrived 15 late. I asked the driver if there was crushed red peppers or packets of parmesan cheese included and the driver said she was actually a waiter since they were too busy. Isn't it common practice to just provide those things regardless of who's delivering!?  Anywho, my order was incorrect and an item was missing. I called and let them know about the mistake. I spoke to a female manager and she, at first, said she would deliver the item missing and fix my order and provide 20% of for next delivery. I was ok with this. About 10 minutes later the manager calls back and says that they have never in their history of business existence have they had an online error. I told the Manager that I paid a hefty amount for my food and just wanted it to be fixed. She said it was my error and they have never made an online mistake. This is just craziness that a buisness has never made an error before!!!! This totally ruined my football and UFC night with friends. I will never order from this pizza place AGAIN. Horrible customer service, calling their customers liars!!! Please take a screen shot of your online order if ordering from this place!!!
