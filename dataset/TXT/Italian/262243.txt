wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg Excellent Italian cooking. Pastas were homemade- so tender!  We are here the night before doing the Ironman. Great options for pre race meals.  Fresh, healthy and great flavor.  I had the pasta bolognese and my husband had the braised beef short ribs with gnocchi. Also very pleasant decor and atmosphere.
