-8Oaw94x2pYJCVP8ZtuTTw I could not love the lemon butter sauce any more than I possibly do.  I only regret that I have to eat pasta with it.  CHICKEN BRYAN was my pre-vegetarian go-to dish, and I still lust over it when I see someone else eating it.  I've had it a ton of times, and it's always incredibly dry, but they make up for it with the tasty marinade, the goat cheese and sundried tomatoes, and the delicious lemon butter sauce.  Ask for extra sauce; you'll want it!  I am happy to see a recent menu addition of chicken bryan pizza. 

The spice mix served with the complimentary bread is amazing, and I appreciate that they are always accomodating of my request for butter with the bread (instead of oil).
