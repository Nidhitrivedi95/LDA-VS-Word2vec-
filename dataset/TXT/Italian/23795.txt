3yMmo1sERpks50quoaA8PQ uncle sals is nothing special. in fact it's unspecial as in retarded in their customer service. the food is average but service is horrible. we have eaten there twice take out too actually. this evening. my girlfriend picked up the food and was told by the cashier that the salmon bruschetta would not be available so the kitchen left out the salmon and mamagement subtracted one dollar off the bill. complained right then and there.
Nothing was offered. This is the 2nd time our order was prepared with errors and not the tasty food we were anticipating.  My girlfriends seven year old daughter with the rest of her school mates could do a better job of preparing a take out meal.  When my girlfriend called Sal's again to complain the man identifying himself as the manager hung up on her.  
i just read previous reviews where there is a cockroach infestion?
