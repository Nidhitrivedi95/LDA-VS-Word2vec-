mvsnt4q3A5TzcbPFolpsZQ Last night four of us had a fabulous dinner.  We have been coming here for years.
The menu is wonderful....something for everyone.  The food is so fresh and prepared so perfectly and comes to the table "hot".  The meat sauce is a home run, as well, as just about everything on the menu.  The wine list is extensive and has a price point for everyone.  We are never disappointed dining here.  Make sure you make a reservation!
