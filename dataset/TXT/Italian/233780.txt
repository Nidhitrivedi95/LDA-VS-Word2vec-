Tp07u-0AOFRfQhtNpAXaQA Came in to have some pizza while waiting for a car service to be done across the parking lot. The restaurant was not busy in any way but instead of seating me, I was asked to go up front and order then sit anywhere I would like.  When the cashier finally got done looking at something her co worker thought was funny, I placed my order then sat down across the way so they could see where I sat.  While waiting for my order the same cashier came up to me asking what I was doing in the restaurant sitting at a table. I told her "I ordered a pizza from you a few minutes ago and waiting to eat it here".  Eventually it was brought out to me in a "to go" box, not served in a way as if I would be dining in.  I told them that it would be fine, I was too hungry and bothered to ask them for anything else.  After I started to eat my food, they decided to sit down a small family with a few young/loud children at the table two feet away from me.  Again, it was not busy, they had the entire restaurant to seat them that did not have to be right next to someone else already upset with them. Wait, how did they even get seated? When I walked in they wouldn't seat me!!  So needless to say, major fail and will choose somewhere else next time I am near that location.
