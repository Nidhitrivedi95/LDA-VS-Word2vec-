i4hvmTd4RH9HvOyG8ndYGw This place has been here for over 30 years. As an original NYER I know good pizza. The food here is the best in the metro area. I travel from the East valley to lunch here. Both the regular and Sicilian slices are great. They serve up the best #6 (eggplant sub) I have ever enjoyed. There is nothing that is not top quality. The staff has been working forever. No need to go anywhere else
