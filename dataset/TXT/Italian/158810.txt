LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA One of the best locations on the Strip. If you go for dinner ask to sit in the main dining room (floor to ceiling windows facing Encore & the Wynn.). For lunch, I prefer the bar, especially if there is a game on.  Today, a couple of glasses of Pinot and the soup & 1/2 sand... Chicken meatball, killer.  Do it!  Maggiano's LAS rocks. Park underneath at Fashion Show.
