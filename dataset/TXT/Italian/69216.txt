bVTWcZWhtJc4IjWy_74CYQ It finally opened and the waits are crazy!!!

So we went last night, friends got there 1st, placed the name on the list, got the pager and off to Toys/Babies R Us for a little shopping (they needed Diapers).  So we come back, waiting outside after the short rain and just when you thought we had more time, off goes our pager...  Plowed thru the very crowded waiting lobby and to our table.  

They were very busy, but the patrons seemed pleased, not unhappy faced seen.  Our server/service was a little slow, but considering how busy and new the place is, wasn't too bad.  Food was a tasty as we expect.  When the snowbirds go home (think Pebble Creek) the waits will shorten for sure!

We will certainly be back (love those breadsticks!!)
