OlklbRrfBIlc6obPtZPF3w What a welcome addition to the area! Everything we had was delicious - the arancini, meatballs, gnudi, tagliatelle - fresh, homemade, flavourful. One of the owners was a bit snippy and the other very gracious; service was fast enough and the food was really good my only complaints were that the prices for a family meal are a bit high; it's more of a date night price point so that is a deterrent for us in a neighbourhood place. The second criticism I have is the lack of reasonably priced wine; the cheapest bottle was $50 and again, coming there with the family it'd be nice to have a cheaper option when we're just looking for a good quality bite in the hood. We will be back without kids so we can enjoy it more thoroughly!
