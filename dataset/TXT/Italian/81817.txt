This was all of our first time here.  Although we didn't eat I wanted to review because we didn't get that great of service while we were there.  It was somewhat busy and despite only getting drinks, we waited close to 20 minutes to be served.  I don't want this one time to be a spoiler for the future but it seems this place isn't good for medium sized groups.  Maybe if it were two of us it would have been better.  To sit and have to find parking and then have subpar service sucks.  The waiter, although somewhat nice, wasn't no where as apologetic as the hostesses were.  I ordered a Paloma and it wasn't all that great.  It was a new drink off their new menu.  I think we should go back to the drawing board kids.
