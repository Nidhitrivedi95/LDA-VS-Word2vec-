2XHQdSM_FvQ7-PUUKaNDCw Yuk!  I've been there twice now in two years and the outcome is the same:  yuk!

Soup was like it was out of can - actually I had better soup from a can...

I had a seafood au gratin, served with a grilled pineapple on the side.  Vile!  The béchamel sauce was thick with an strange after taste.  My wife had a veal parmesan - there was 1/2 inch of cheese on a thin dried up piece of meat with grilled a pineapple slice on the side...  Sadly, I think the pineapple was the best part!

The service was so slow even if the place was almost empty (on a Friday lunch no less...).  When I got impatient I was told that they did not know I was in a rush.  I was not in a rush, I had just been sitting there for two hours!!

Never again
