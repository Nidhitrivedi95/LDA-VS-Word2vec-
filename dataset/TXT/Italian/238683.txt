u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog We ate here while showing a friend around the Paris Hotel and we thought we'd be in for some incredible food after hearing all the waiter had to tell us. We were prepared to be blown away by amazing food. It it fell short. I like my pasta al dente but this was just too undercooked almost to the point of being crunchy. The sauce was just ok and so was the meatball. The ricotta was really good. The guys that ordered the veal and chicken parm didn't have any gripes but weren't blown away either. I think if you set people up for greatness as the staff does, then you should deliver. That didn't happen. The mozzarella appetizer was good but not over the top delicious as promised. It was just eh....  I come from a long line of great Italian cooks, especially my Dad, and this stuff just can't touch any of their stuff.
