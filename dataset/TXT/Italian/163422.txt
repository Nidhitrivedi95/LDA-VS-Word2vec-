lwpQQflP1CGJPV7QLybzOg I had given this place a great review previously, but I had to edit it because of the lack of customer service and disappointment.
It's very upsetting that I booked a party of 7 (only 6 people had eaten) and was charged an added gratuity of 20% without being made aware. I called to ask for a manager and they passed the phone to someone else. I explained the situation and asked what their policy was for automatic gratuity and I was told  it was for parties 8 or more and to call back when the other manager was there. 
I sent an email to the Upper Crust via Yelp with no response. I then emailed the actual Upper Crust's website via their contact information and also received no response. I called once again and the gal who claimed to be the manager stated that it was the "servers discretion." Granted, I should have looked at the bill closer, but we were a bit focused on the bottle of wine that was charged to our tab that shouldn't have been on there. It's very disappointing that, for #1, the hostess didn't tell me that I would be charged a 20% gratuity for a party of 7 upon booking (again only 6 people were eating) and #2 the server (Claire) didn't make us aware that she added an automatic gratuity. There were three tabs at our table. The total tip that I gave Claire ended up being over $80. For the entire table, Claire made at least a $130 tip. I would have expected at least an email back regarding our disappointment.
