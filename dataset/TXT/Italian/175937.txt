NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ 4 stars for friendly service over the phone and in-person. They kindly delivered to Khoury's last Wednesday when the truck couldn't make it.

I ordered the 10" fettuccini alfredo pizza and fried artichoke hearts. This would almost be enough for two people. Instead of pizza sauce the pizza had thick, creamy alfredo sauce, then cheese and noodles. I felt so ashamed. This pizza was good. The artichoke hearts were also so good. Breaded artichoke quarters (like the yummy kind that come in a can) with ranch and marinara. I want to make my own now, but with panko. I can't believe I ate a meal like this midweek. But it was so good.

Some people say you have to order the "right stuff" to get the Montesano's experience. I'd recommend these. I also heard the stuffed pizzas are really good. It looks like no one likes the meatball sub though.
