The wait staff seemed kind but a bit "above the rest"... if you know what I mean. Just because the location is in Scottsdale doesn't mean you need to act out the assumed local attitude.

In the food department, the food looked beautiful. Plated for a photo opp, so that was nicely done. As for flavor, it doesn't stand out to me as a place that is AMAZING... it is more of a 'good' place to eat. I would definitely not drive out of my way for this restaurant. But if I'm again in the area and craving this type of cuisine, I'll most likely stop in
