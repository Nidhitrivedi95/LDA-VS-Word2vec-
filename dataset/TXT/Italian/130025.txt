I8QpDTJUZ6Mk5IQuQSG2pA I ordered from here today and everything showed up cold, bread was stale and my sandwich had tomatoes on it when I requested no tomatoes. People make mistakes, I totally understand but when I called to ask for JUST the sandwich to be replaced, the girl on the phone was rude. She told me I hadn't requested no tomatoes! Its not like I cant go back and look up my order! After putting me on hold, she said "I'll have my manager re do it" and hung up. Listen, I don't need a turkey sandwich that bad.
