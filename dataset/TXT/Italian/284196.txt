z8H4Mdzl4jS9pYswj6Jf9w Ive come here many time following my first review-every time I have gone the food is always wonderful as well as the service. I came in rather underdressed and was still treated with the utmost respect and courtesy, which is usually unapparant in most restaurants in Yorkville, so I was very impressed. The fungi pizza and their bellinis are amazing. Definitely my favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto, especially because if the exemplary service which is always provided.

Albeit, making a reservation on the weekend is very difficult.
