kQ9gVGp5R_jZwLi0-q8PZQ Really friendly staff. It is great that Toronto has more and more places where you can find local meats, organic veg etc...Hey Meatball is one of them. It is comfort food which will warm you up and amazing solution for hangover. Signature Rodfather sandwich is a must to try. Those 13$ worth it!
