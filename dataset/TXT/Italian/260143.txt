WoXBfzGHcL3x6ME-X06qhA This is a belated review for Winterlicious.
Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised here because it didn't seem like a popular Winterlicious spot but we all really enjoyed our meals! Service was good, portions were good, and the food itself was very tasty. I would come back. Please note the crowd seemed a bit of an older group, but it may be due to the proximity to the theatres and what show was on that night, who knows. Definitely not a youthful or hip hangout I'd say.
