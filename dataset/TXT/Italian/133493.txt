im8sxT2V-drSvxP17qdb2A F-ing MASSIVE chocolate crepe with white choloate chips on top I received yesterday after bellavista nearby. I must say, for the price, you get your worth, at least in terms of sheer size of ice cream you are getting, that thing looked like a giant burrito.

With that said, I enjoyed it, but not the greatest, you can get better crepe from wanda or dimitri, but this café has personality and would be a nice spot to chill at and people watch once the weather gets warm. For that it's a nice spot to be at.
