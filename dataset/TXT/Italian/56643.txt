ALtyWW7_gLMMcrwwHUgdPQ Everything about this restaurant is fantastic! The ambiance, the menu, the staff is all five stars. The specials change constantly with fresh, house made choices. You can start with a bottle of wine (they have bottles starting at $25), and enjoy fresh bread and dipping sauce while you wait for your meal. I ordered the shrimp linguine in a Rosemary cream sauce, which was fantastic. They have a great selection of Italian desserts as well. This is my favorite date night restaurant. My fiancé and I ordered a bottle of wine, the stuffed hot peppers appetizer and two entrees. Our bill was just shy of $100, but there were both cheaper and more expensive options as well. If you're looking for a rustic, upscale Italian restaurant, this is it!
