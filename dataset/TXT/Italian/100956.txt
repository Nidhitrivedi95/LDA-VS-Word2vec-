fbLYRHIZAt3q839whhaBUg We came in for lunch on a Saturday and sat at the outside bar. We were greeted by the bartender shortly after sitting down, and he took our drink order. He brought us back some menus and our drinks very quickly, and said he would give us a couple minutes to decide what to eat. He then disappeared on us, although other people at the inside bar were still being served. We pretty much finished our drinks with no one to take a food order or to check on us. We took this as a bad sign for the service we would be receiving, and just had our 2 drinks before leaving for food elsewhere.
