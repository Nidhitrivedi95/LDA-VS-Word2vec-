r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA We come here for all of our Italian grocery needs, there is no other place for it! Fresh pasta is a MUST in our house. 

As for their restaurant? Wow. Delicious!! Everything we try hits the ball out of the park!!

Gnocchi is heavenly, meatball sub is crazy delicioso, italian sodas are creamy dreamy and the desserts? Well, make sure you save room for a food coma. The cookies are LEGIT scrumptious and the cakes (cheesecake) are perfect and creamy!

They know how to make sure flavor is bold and packed!

Real Italian for real Italians too.
