sKy8HkP6X-8dCKq_SzeIpw This is a great place if you love slow service and a dirty atmosphere. I don't know who hired the people who work here, but they themselves need to be fired. Staff refuses to clean tables, a gentleman came in 20 minutes after two other guys left the bar, pushed their dirty plates out of his way and had to ask the waitress to clean them up. This place smells musty and dirty. Pizza freakin sucks! Just re-headed slices. A 12 inch personal pizza will cost you 14 dollars. We'll go get a hot and ready from Little Caesers for about 1/3 that price and better pizza than Queens.
