kQ9gVGp5R_jZwLi0-q8PZQ Hey Meatball is one of its kind. The food is incredibly tasty, i can't get enough of their Polenta and for those like me that love meatballs, this is the place to eat.
The girl behind the counter is a great server and really good with the clients.
Not the cheapest option out there but worth the money.
