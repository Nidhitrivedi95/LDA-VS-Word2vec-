Food isn't anything to write home about but the value is sure there.  The wine isn't the best but... they give you lots of it.  Overall, it felt like something out of another time and we couldn't help but have a good time with it.  Not fine dining by any stretch of the imagination but lighting fast service, good portions and I certainly ate my portion up so have to say the food was enjoyable too.
