wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg Had a business lunch here recently and just love the restaurant. Our server was new; but, he was being trained by another waitress. Both were equally friendly and enthusiastic about the menu and were very attentive to our table. We were seated on the protected patio outdoors--but I enjoyed the decor and lighting inside, as well. Sort of "urban farmhouse". Two of us at the table order the chopped kale salad and the other had a pizza with a variety of meats on top. For drinks we just had ice tea which was fine. The chopped kale salad absolutely hit the spot. It was mixed in with little bits of diced pancetta, egg, tomato, and gorgonzola. The dressing was light and bright and really enhanced the flavor of the kale. The salad was very filling. I  had a hard time choosing after looking at the other tables around us, as everything looked and smelled delicious and was brightly prepared and presented. I'm pleased to learn that we have a North restaurant as well in Colorado and hope to visit there soon to try some of the pizza and other salads!
