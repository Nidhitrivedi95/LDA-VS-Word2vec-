P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw My friend and I had to build up the courage to enter this seedy looking bar, and it was still daylight. This dive has some of the most innovative pizzas in Las Vegas. I love the Snake in the Grass Pizza and the loaded baked potato fries. It's no wonder Triple D did an episode at Naked City Pizza. My suggestion is place a to go order if you're not into the smokey bar scene.
