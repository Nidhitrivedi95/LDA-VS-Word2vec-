nK7JeIqdBli3umEhBIh33g I LOVE Lucio!! This is one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas!! There's not many great Italian restaurants in Vegas, so my boyfriend and I end up eating here at least once a month!! It's in a business park/strip mall type of thing but don't let the location fool you!! When you walk in, the ambiance is both modern and cozy. It's not super fancy, but it's nice.

You get complimentary bread basket with some chimichurri. It's ok. I'm not crazy about it, which works bc I always need to save room for the rest of the meal!!
We always get the same appetizers - The bruschetta and the calamari!! Both are delicious!! I always add a tiny bit of balsamic to the bruschetta then it's perfect. The calamari is absolutely delicious!! It's hard for us to ever try anything else because it's just so good!!

For my entree, I usually try to order something from the specials but when I can't decide on one, I usually resort to the Pollo Sorrentina, which is on their permanent menu. OMG - it is AMAZING!! It is a sauteed chicken breast in a white wine sauce, topped with prosciutto, fontina cheese, and mushrooms. It comes with a small portion of steamed veggies and roasted potatoes. For $16, it is a GREAT meal! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

I never have room for dessert since I always leave here beyond stuffed, but my boyfriend always manages to make room for the tiramisu, which he claims is the best he's ever had in the 20+ years of eating tiramisu!! so I guess it must be good :)

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in search of a great italian dinner!!
