Ih0f0UyhFufm3C7kR72DSQ My friend and I went to Dante to celebrate a special occasion and absolutely loved it!! The ambiance is really intimate and my friend and I were seated in a corner so we could catch up appropriately and still receive personalized service. First, we ordered the Double Goat Cheese Tartlet. I loved it because goat cheese is my favorite cheese and the pear chutney complemented the bold flavor of the cheese perfectly. We also ordered the Three Cheese Polenta and it had just the right touch of boldness but was not too heavy. The cheeses tasted wonderful together, which is slightly surprising since it was a rather unique three cheese blend. My friend and I shared our entrees with each other. We each ordered an appetizer portion of pasta and split them. This was more than enough food for both of us! We ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara (minus pancetta) and one of the weekly pasta specials.  The poached egg on the Linguine was easily the best part of the dish and made it very filling even though it was an appetizer size. Both kinds of pasta looked really similar when they were served to us, but they were unique and dynamic! Overall, I loved this place so much. This is food you I cannot find at many other restaurants, nor it is something I can make at home myself. Well worth the money. Also, since we ordered many appetizers, the total cost of the meal was not too high at all!
