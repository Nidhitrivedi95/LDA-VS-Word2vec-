SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog It had been a while since I had Italian food so the wife and I randomly picked RigaTony's and we are damn glad we did! The interior is tastefully decorated and charming and it has a cozy atmosphere without crowding the tables together. 

The food starts with a sample of wine and an excellent salad and bread fresh from the oven, I had the Fettucini Alfredo with a meatball and it was just fantastic! The wife had the Fettucini Alfredo with Chicken Lemon and Artichoke which was delectable!

Our service was prompt (we came at 4:30pm on a Wednesday) and our server was friendly, sociable, and helpful! 

Good Job RigaTony's!!!
