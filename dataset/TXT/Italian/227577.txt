stD-LTFFwlmBdzU-0aBntw This is not a gourmet pizza joint but I crave this place so often. I started eating here at the nippers in Dormont. It reminds me of my favorite pizza shop back home. WOOP Johns!

Anyway this is the best hangover food place in Pitt!. Lots, and tons of greasy melted cheese that dribbles over your big bites. I eat here like I'm in a food eating contest shoveling in huge mouthfuls of salty, doughy, cheesy goodness. The ham and pineapple pizza is pretty rad and I love the calzones too. It's so much cheese my heart is ready to stop with each bite. You would think that the 5 cheese calzone is what to get when going for the calzone but I have found that some of the different cheeses that are in it are an extreme salt overload. The meatball calzone or the ones I have gotten with filling then don't have enough cheese! The Goldilocks in me has me choosing the regular plain calzone it's juuust right!  

The pastas are pizza shop pastas, greasy, thicker gummy noodles reminiscent of Chef Boyardee comfort! I like the spaghetti and meatballs. Going simple here is the way to go. The taco pizza is interesting but again it's not fine dining but everything I have tried has been sending me back for 5 years! So if you wake up in the morning with a yearning for a down the block Pizza GO to the Nippers. 

This is a take out place so no eating in, and they have a wide delivery range... they even come out all the way to the boonies of regent square. One of the very few that does!
