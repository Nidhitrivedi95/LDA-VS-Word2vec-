CElwRv4CtK56NljAuCwepw Mon & Tues special to go is the perfect way to surprise your loved one with a delicious meal without breaking the bank or a sweat. One meal easily feeds two people. If you're not a large eater,  u could find yourself in a comparable situation. I ordered two Mon night specials w bread for an impromptu dinner w 2 other women. This being their first time having Babbos, I hit the ball out of the park! After gushing & complimenting my ability to always know the best spots...haha..we were stuffed & had never opened the 2nd container. Between the three of us we were more than satisfied from one meal. But no one complained about having the extra one bcuz it was such a hit we would've hated to not have leftovers! Kudos to you Babbos for not only having one of the hardest menus to choose from while dining in (everything screams choose me!). But you are the only restaurant I know that gives equal food, taste, service, portion size, and value on your carry out items. I stear clear of take out for this exact reason yet u've shown there are still places that deserve the benefi of doubt..Thank you for knowing if a night at Babbos doesn't fit our schedule, our family is blessed to still enjoy the same delicious meal at our dining table as they would if they were there. You Rock!
