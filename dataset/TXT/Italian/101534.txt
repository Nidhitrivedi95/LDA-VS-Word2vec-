FcXGZFrVPaKfe3wJZibfCw Came here after a recommendation or two. Thank goodness I did.

It's a very small place, but that's what makes it so great. The intimate atmosphere allows the service to be beyond outstanding. Seriously, our cups were never even close to being empty.

And the food? Well let's just start with the toast. It was made with some of the freshest bread I've ever had. Just amazing. My eggs, hash browns, and sausage were terrific too.

Just a great dining experience in good old South Side. I'm definitely looking to make this a regular stop on my yearly trip to Pittsburgh.
