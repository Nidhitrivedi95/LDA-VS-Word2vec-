ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag This is not your average pizza place... It is so much better! The menu is pretty limited but the options are straight out of a pizza place in Italy and they are just as good. Artisanal cheeses and meats make this place extra special and the very friendly staff are the cherry on top! Hubby and I had the Salumi pizza and it was delish! The tomato sauce is a has a very fresh and slightly sweet flavor (which I love) that compliments the slight saltiness of the Salumi making it a perfect combo. There was just enough cheese to bring a little mild creaminess to the palate and mellow everything out. We loved it! We will be back!
