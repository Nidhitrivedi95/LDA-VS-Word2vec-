yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w This bizarre and unique spot is the kind of thing you can only find in Vegas. Honesty, I only want to find it in Vegas because what happens here, stays here. 

From the one price for everything including all you can drink cheap wine, to the large portions, and the accordion player from the planet Klepto, there is clearly no other place like it. It never changes. Whether you've visited 20 years ago like I have, or more recently like I have, not one single solitary thing has been altered. You still enter through a weird barrel, the bar is still crazily decorated, and the restaurant itself crams in potentially 100's of people to gorge on Italian American food, wine, and the finest hilarious accordion music in the Western Hemisphere. 

No review can do it justice. Try it once. I dare you.
