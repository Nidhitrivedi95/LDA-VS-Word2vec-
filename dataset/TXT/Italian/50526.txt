Mmmm sip sip sip at the healthy wine portion I've been served.  Hmm is this my first or second glass?

I don't typically eat ham but the prosciutto pizza had me stuffing my face and disappointed when it was gone.

Now what's really to die for at this restaurant is the fruit crepes.  They're HUGE and they don't skimp on the fruit or toppings. Nom Nom Nom Nom... polite burp.

Kiss kiss smotch from the girlfriend for taking her to a romantic spot for dinner.  Oh if the temperature is right sit outside, it's dimly lite with vegetation and hanging lights.

Not for the faint of heart in terms of $ but worth every penny you spend.
