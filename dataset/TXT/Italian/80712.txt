D9OKZdwYtI8vfGdfLpqWJw Bit of a loss how to rate this one. Started with our reservation being lost. They did find us a table, but it was freezing cold. Coldest day of the winter and table was near a door that kept opening.

The restaurant is nice inside and the service was excellent. We started with bruschetta and charcuterie which was good, but nothing extraordinary. The chicken parmigiana was lukewarm, but the kid's pasta was fine. The special heart shaped cheese stuffed pasta with rose sauce, shrimp, scallops and spinach was massive and quite delicious but also not hot.

To end the homemade tiramisu was outstanding. I would go back again for it. Bacio chocolates with the bill were a nice touch.
