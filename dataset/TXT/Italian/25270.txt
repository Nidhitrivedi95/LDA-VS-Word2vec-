4HEF6BuO_BBsTmvcMCbhhg Doesn't get any better than this! What a Fantastic Concept!! 

Wanna go to Napa, CA for a wine tasting tour for just the day!?!?!! Screw the plane fare and just head on over to this lil' gem!!

From the moment we walked in KATIE, the hostess, gave us her time, to talk to us about how the wine tasting works! She was the sweetest person to talk to and honestly, one of the reasons why we came back, after some great shopping! She was incredibly accommodating for a group of four!.... 

As I walked in, I noticed that there was such a "cool and excited vibe" in the air! Lot's of people with wine glasses in their hands, standing around....smiling and chattering!

JASON, our, I don't want to say "server" because he was SO MUCH MORE than that, made our first time experience there, one of the BEST we've had! We appreciate the art of food and wine and have enjoyed many "5 star, Michelin, blah, blah..." places... yes, we like to go out and enjoy!

Knowledge along with fantastic recommendations from, JASON was spot on! We had a blast and left knowing that we had AWESOME sips of different wines, fresh, off the WALL food and were DEFINITELY coming back! 
DO I RECOMMEND THIS sweet place to enjoy a bunch of different wines and delicious, fresh, Bruschetta, the picolo and the caprese salad!??!!?? YES! YES! YES! and what a great place to get to meet tons of people, all enjoying "those awesome wine machine-thingggggyyysss" (quoted from a group that was just as excited as we were)

 I'm telling ya, it's like going to Napa, CA and being able to enjoy a wine tasting, in one place!!

Kudos to the management for creating such an awesome team!!!
