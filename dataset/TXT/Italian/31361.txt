The atmosphere was very cozy and the menu looked very authentic. My husband had the pollo a la Salvatore and I had the ziti al re di Napoli.  Both dishes were phenomenal. We had an amazing dinner. As we were about to leave, the chef came by our table with a post dinner drink, which was very refreshing. I would definitely recommend Naples15 and will for sure come back again.
