I was excited to see a Noodles and Company restaurant  and was looking foward to dining at the restaurant. Today, my co-workers and I decided to give into our curiousty and have lunch at Noodles and Company.

The restaurant was packed, and the patrons appeared to be enjoying their entrée's. The menu at Noodles and Company is tricky to read, since it is printed on the wall. The menu includes 4 Italian noodle dishes, 4 Asian noodle dishes, 4 American noodle dishes, 4 soups, 4 salads, and 4 sandwiches, and most dishes are offered in both small and large sizes.

I ordered the steak stroganoff, and my co workers had the Pad Thai and Chicken Noodle Soup. We both agreed that the stroganoff didn't quite taste like stroganoff and the Pad Thai not quite like Pad Thai.  The beef in the strofanoff was a little fatty and the noodles tased somewhat greasy.  I really didnt care for the taste and my co-workers thought their entrée's,  were just okay, nothing was outstanding or stood out. 

The portions at Noodles and Company can be misleading.  Our large bowls appeared big but were only half full. The service at Noodles and Company is quick and the staff is friendly.  If you are craving something besides a burger it's okay, but don't set your hopes too high.
