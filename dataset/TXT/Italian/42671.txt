7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg Best Italian food I've had in Cleveland to date. I've been to little Italy and Luca in the flats and Bruno's food far surpasses the rest. We started with a small calzone which was not small and could have been an entire meal in itself. It was excellent. Next we had the veal parm. Not only was it amazing it was so large we in hindsight should have split it.
