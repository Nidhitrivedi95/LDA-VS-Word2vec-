I am embarrassed to say that last night was the first time I have been to the Pizzeria. Between lunch and dinner, I frequent the LGO market at least two or three times a week; and I know most of the crew at Postino - yet, I've never ventured into their world of pizza. That is, until last night.

We arrived around 5:45 and ordered a glass of the Rosso and Sangiovese and mulled over the menu. Because we weren't too terribly hungry we debated between the Gladiator and the Roasted Corn Pizza. When our server, Chris, overheard us, he told us they would gladly do half and half so that we can taste both. I was thrilled. When the pizzas came out they were great. The Gladiator is your more traditional style pizza and the Roasted Corn had such an refreshing unique merriment of flavors. 

We finished by sharing a piece of the Red Velvet Cake. Seriously? I could have had another piece all by myself. Its six or seven thin layers of cake, moist and delicious, separated by an addicting cream cheese frosting that I kept looking for more of. 

As we were getting ready to leave; I was admiring the pies that were on the table next to us. I was offered a piece of the Avocado Pizza. I never would have ordered it, and at first I declined, but she insisted, I was curious and I caved. Again, it was pretty good. Not sure I would eat a whole Avocado Pizza - but I loved the taster.

Rumor has it that the wings are pretty good...I have no reason to doubt that its true. Don't wait as long as I did to try LGO after dark.
