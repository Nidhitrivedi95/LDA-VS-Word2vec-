rZRxuGOxTaf11VcsMviQwQ Let me be the first to say that this place has unappetizing food. 

The pizza slices I've had from here (tried on 3 separate occasions before I decided to write this review) were terrible. The crust was soft soggy because of the grease, the pepperoni and sausage slices were unsavory, and the breadsticks I had were under seasoned.

Overall, it's cheap and fast and that's a big draw for most people, but why would I eat here when I would rather go to the McDonald's on Mills and Regent or any other place that doesn't have grease as a main ingredient for their pizza slices. I'll pass.
