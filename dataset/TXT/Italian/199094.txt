We got three pizzas (Margherita, Sonny Boy, and Rosa), as well as the wood roasted vegetables, handmade mozzarella salad, and local organic greens to start. The apps were all great -- the veggies especially were fantastic. We also really liked the the Margherita and Sonny Boy, but the Rosa kind of fell flat with our table. I didn't think it was bad, we just weren't crazy about it. We also got the flourless chocolate cake for dessert, which was amazing.

Still my top spot in Phoenix, and I'll definitely be back soon, but not quite the other-worldly experience I had remembered or expected.
