acjYztYcV97D5DG3aQ4JUQ I was almost done placing my order online. When they suddenly they don't deliver anymore because they are closed. So now they kept my money and I have no food.  I called the location that the website gave me. They say it's not my store. So I call the other location. And they say there are not my store. So now I have to call tomorrow to cancel my order but thy don't even knw what store I belong to. So who do I call to get my money back. No food no money. Good thing domino's pizza is still open. I think that will be my choice of pizza every weekend from now on.
