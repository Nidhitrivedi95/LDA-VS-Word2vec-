pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ This is one of those hidden lil' spots within the Miracle Mile shops at Planet Hollywood. I thought the food was pretty darn good. I think it fits high above an Olive Garden/chain-type Italian place, but not as good as the more refined Italian joints like some of the Batali or other big-name ones. 

I was surprised to see such low reviews for this place, but then I noticed a lot of people were reviewing breakfast. I don't know about you, but when I think about where to go to breakfast in Vegas, an Italian restaurant is not my first thought or choice. I'm just sayin'... 

Anyhow, we split two different pasta dishes and really liked them both. The bread in the beginning was delish with the wonderful oil. I wish we had room for dessert since I love tiramisu. Next time... 

I think this place is undervalued for the better-than-average/not-as-good-as-the-greats section of Vegas dining. I would stop by if you're in the area and looking for a bite to eat - especially since the dining options in PH (excluding the MM shops) are minimal compared to other casinos. Check it out and eat some tiramisu for me!
