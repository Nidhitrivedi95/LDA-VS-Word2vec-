NhMEvtG8TA6AnCLFC63v_A This place has potential that was unfortunately wasted by Annie. Annie is a rude elitist that treated me like a leper during my meal. The food is watery and gross. I paid $40 bucks for gnocchi soaked in a tub of butter and fettuccine Alfredo that smelt like dog piss. I had two Groupons to this place but will cut my losses and not try to attempt to use the second one. Annie can take that money I spent on nothing to make a career change. Taste buds beware.
