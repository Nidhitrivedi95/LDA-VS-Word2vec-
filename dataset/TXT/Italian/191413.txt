pEFO_hU3DNA61XnIpVGkJQ Great pizza. Reasonable prizes, especially for a slice. Fun location. You can even do quick curb pick-up. Only problem is sometimes you have to wait like 30minutes to get served. Once they forgot my order. Didn't even get comped or anything. Good customer service is trying to keep/get people to come back. Isn't it?
