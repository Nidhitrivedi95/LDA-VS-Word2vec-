xYy54Y2VTBAG5k7WJcaH4A My boyfriend and I bought a groupon for Terra a few months ago and made reservations last night to try it out. Our experience was phenomenal. The service was amazing, the food was incredible, and the wine was delicious. We had the meat and cheese plate for an appetizer, and it was the best meat and cheese plate I've ever had (better than nobles). The entrees were fantastic. The risotto du jour (with shrimp and mussels) and the gnocchi with sausage blew my mind. We had chocolate mousse for dessert that was better than any chocolate mousse I've had. I highly recommend trying this restaurant. It's definitely worth the money!
