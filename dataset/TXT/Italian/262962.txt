wV6Nle04jS8I40tUHPUiiQ I'm not sure why there are so many critical reviews.  This is not a James Beard foodie hotspot with a typical 6 month shelf life.  This is a great little local place you can count on to bring friends, have a date night or bring the family. 

My husband, kids and I have come to this location several times since we moved to the neighborhood and have been happy with the service and the food each time.  Are they flawless? No. But when something's not right, they make it right and with a great attitude.  

We love a good Scottsdale or Arcadia restaurant every now & then too but the service is always spotty. We are so grateful to be able to level set by coming back to our fresh, friendly little Humble Pie in a town full of chain disasters!
