2NiBvT5zL272IRcxru_x9A My date and I were in desperate need of a drink on a Friday night after watching a choir of tiny little children attempt to sing Christmas tunes.

They only had one table available with no wait out on the patio. It was cold, but we were near a heater and were wearing our jackets, so it wasn't so bad. Although inside would have been more comfortable, I preferred being outside because we could actually hear each other speak. They need some sort of noise cancelling insulation in that loud room. 

Sangria was fine. Nothing special. The bruschetta left something to be desired. The brie cheese with fresh orange marmalade was very uneven in terms of flavor balance. The sopressata was great! Just enough horseradish flavor to have a kick. Gorgonzola with pear, basil, and balsamic reduction was alright. And the smoked prosciutto with fig was probably my favorite. 

For the actual meal, I wanted to split a calzone, but I wasn't paying so grilled salmon was the final decision. My date was happy with how crispy it was, but I thought the whole thing was pretty bland. And I was a bit disappointed that our salad didn't come with garlic bread. Ah well. 

By the time we'd finished eating, the patio had cleared out and they closed the big window'd garage door from the inside, which left us with much more quiet to chat. At some point though, I realized our server never returned. So by the time she showed up, we already decided to hit up somewhere else for our after dinner drink. 

It wasn't the worst. It wasn't the best. But as long as my mom liked it, I guess that's what matters.
