It started the moment our server discovered we were ordering from the Restaurant Week menu and went down from there. We had to ask for a refill of bread 4 times before we finally got it. Water refills were rare and they ran out of dessert. We were told the dessert would be available in 45 min. and we decided to wait. At that time we were told there would be not chocolate cake. A couple of minutes later we saw trays of cake being carried to the party room in the back, they did have cake but not for non-VIPs like us. It took forever to even get our bill. We then went downstairs to True Foods- where we had the chocolate cake that we paid for at Tanzy but didn't get. . Our service at True Foods was outstanding and our server was very attentinve even though we were not spending a lot of money. We recommend True Foods over Tanzy.
