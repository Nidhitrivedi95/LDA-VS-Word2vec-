jNQnscvgn_dMTS954qW_9Q The first time I visited here was horrible. The eggplant parm is absolutely disgusting. Cinnamon flavor and just gross!!! That was several years ago, so I decided to try again today. The sanitation rating scared me at 92...ehhhh should be a lot better. It was very busy for a Wednesday.  The waitress was helpful and friendly. I got the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were very good, I was impressed. I would go back and get this again...I hope the sanitation rating gets better! Quick service. Good tiramisu also.
