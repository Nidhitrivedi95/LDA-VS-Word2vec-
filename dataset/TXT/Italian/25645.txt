4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg 6 of us went to dinner there last Friday night.   We were seated in the back where it was not that loud.  Our waitress Amanda was amazing.  We always had water and we had plenty of time between courses to take our time.  We were never rushed.   Out apps and dinners where delicious and all came out hot.   I would go again next time I'm in Las Vegas
