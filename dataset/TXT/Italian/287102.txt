Zja7ykq3icDzkN20XX6j1w We found success in our search for good food in Pittsburgh. The pizza was very good. I like the way the crust was cooked:  rustic and slightly charred. The sauce was rich and the amount of cheese just right. I don't care for an overwhelming amount of cheese on my pizza. My son had a slice of the stuffed pizza which had sausage and other ingredients sitting between a top and bottom slice of pie and he really enjoyed it.

They have an extensive menu of pizza and sandwiches and this made me wish that I could spend more time in Pittsburgh to try other items. I also like the pay as you leave setup. And, one thing I really appreciated was the staff looking out for its customers by warning us that there was a meter maid outside the building giving tickets..
