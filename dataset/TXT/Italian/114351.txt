GLObol9ZkKPQOQ1LMsqkew We stopped in again on our way to the airport. My wife and I had the bacon and jalapeño grilled cheese!!! Oh my gosh it was good!!! happy hour from 11-6. Tapas menu from 2-6. We can't wait to eat our way thru the menu. So many great sounding items! Did I mention the wine was delicious too.
