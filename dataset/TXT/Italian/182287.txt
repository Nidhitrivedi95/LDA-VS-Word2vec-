oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw I've been here twice. 2 years ago (can't remember what I had, but it was good) and just a couple of weeks ago...here it is:

To start they brought out breadsticks which my hubby and I gobbled up quickly - we were starving. Then they brought out some fresh bread with a white bean puree spread and a black olive spread. I loved the white bean spread, the Olive spread was OK - a little too salty so I avoided it. 

We both skipped the salad / soup. I ordered a short rib with polenta and veggies - it was excellent. The rib melted in your mouth. They put a little red wine reduction over it and the polenta was perfect. Can't remember what hubby's main course was (mine was so good!) 

I thoroughly enjoyed this meal and recommend this place.
