B7G_2Hx8Rx8l6oQ6K3n5Uw So far I've ate here 3 times. The first was an okay experience with the staff and I had the chicken pesto pizza which was alright, but kinda dry. The second time was take out and the experience with the staff was slow and unconcerned. The third time was the worst and last time I will be eating here. I dined in and had the turkey and avocado salad with no tomatoes (personal preference, no allergy). My sister was with me and ordered the same. It took 30 mins for her food to come out and it ended up having tomatoes on the salad. No silverware was provided and when we asked for it, it took quite some time to be provided. My food however took 45 mins to come out and didn't have tomatoes but it also didn't have Avocado - which is part of the name of the salad. I only had an hour lunch since it was during work hours and ended up asking them to box it to go and adding avocado. The staff didn't seem to care that the food took way longer than it should have and the guy who boxed my food seemed put out that I requested avocado to be added when boxed. Needless to say, I won't be eating here for a while, or ever again if I don't have to!
