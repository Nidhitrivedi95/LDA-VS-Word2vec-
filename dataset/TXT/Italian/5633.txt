_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw Where do I begin? This place is fantastic and the service is phenomenal. I had called ahead to put my name on the list for a larger party. Upon arrival, my name wasn't on the waiting list 2 hours after calling, the staff apologized and put us back next in line. We had to wait an hour extra, but the servers kept coming out to check on us and provide drinks. Once we entered to our table, Pomo had set up a variety of free appetizers for us as their way of saying sorry, not only that, the waitress that was serving us was probably one of the best that I've had in awhile! The food is incredible, the appetizers were amazing, and the desserts were fantastic. Pomo definitely showed us that they cared and I commend them on their respect and admiration towards their customers. Will definitely come back in the future! 

Do not miss out on this place.
