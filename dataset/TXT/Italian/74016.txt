cOWXtCz7F9GQhPIks8gm6Q I really like this restaurant and sometimes go slightly out of my way to have lunch here.  Yesterday I had their Verdure, which is essentially a roasted spaghetti squash dish with a bunch of other sauteed vegetables.  I added some chicken breast, which was prepared expertly, with a browned outside and moist inside.  Friendly and efficient service.
