D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg Been here a couple of times with my family, each time the i am reminded of just how good the food is here. The service is good, but the view and food make up for anything that should go wrong. 

there were eight of us, so we were able to sample many items from the menu. For appetizers, the thinly sliced ham and mozzarella (prosciutto), the mushrooms, and a salad. All very good with the complimentary variety bread, served with butter, crushed peppers and Parmesan cheese.

For main course, we had the filet (excellently cooked), great flavor. The Lamb Ragu Pasta (very good) and Pizza (four meats) very tasty and a side of meatballs!! for veg, it was pizza, also very good and a pasta (suprisingly, veg and very tasty!!) 

All the food was very good, along with the view, we needed to call the waiter a few times but all and all, very good place to go... only bad part, its off the strip so go to ghost bar or moon that night!
