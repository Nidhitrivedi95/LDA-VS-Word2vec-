UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Oh my word! I love Brio! The ambiance is gorgeous. Staff is professional [a little stiff at times though]. The food is delicious! Had pasta alla vodka and I loved it. The portions are moderate so you won't go home feeling horrible about eating out. Brio is pretty popular so expect to wait. But Town's Square is a wonderful place to wait in because there are so many tempting shops surrounding.
