xjjxHavx4RIiW6zS6rasGA Well where do I start here, this is in my opinion the BEST restaurant not just in Scottsdale but in the entire Phoenix metroplex area! 
You won't be disappointed, everything from the atmosphere to the service, the cleanliness, and the food is excellent! This is our go to place anytime we want to have a relaxing evening and great good. Everyone there makes an effort to make each visit personal. We have tried several dishes, the lamb chops, the zin ribs, the spaghetti, pork, halibut, most of the desserts, all of the salads, and can recommend all of them! The live music is perfect and really set the entire atmosphere. They have an extensive bar and there is not a drink or spirit you won't find. You might think from this review that we know the owner or staff personally but we don't. Bottom line is if your looking for great food, great portion sizes, awesome service, great atmosphere, and making a memorable evening, try this place, you will go back!
