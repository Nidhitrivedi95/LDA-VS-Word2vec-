FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Let me just say: red pepper/goat cheese, Brie/apples and warm artichoke bruschetta are AAAHHHHMMMAAAZZZIIIINNNNGGG! I love the vibe here too. The clientele is different than Gilbert so that is definitely refreshing. The service was excellent and the wine selections were delicious. I will definitely make a special trip up from Gilbert just to come here again soon :)
