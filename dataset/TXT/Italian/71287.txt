C63sF-wG4f1doMIMv2qvOg My favorite place in the city, hands down. This place is freaking fantastic. TRULY authentic Neapolitan pizza cooked in an  brick oven the owner imported from Italy, its so soft and doughy and delicious. The ingredients and toppings are top notch, and the wine selection is great. Definitely try the suggested wine, the Gragnano, its a frizzante red that goes amazing with the pizza, the owner imports it specially from Italy, you can't get it anywhere else in Madison. As an indication of just how awesome this place is, when we asked where we could get the wine and found out it was imported specially, the waitress offered to sell us a bottle for a discount to take home!

Try the Maialina, or the Alpina, and prepare to be amazed. And don't fill up on dinner, because the nutella dessert pizza is incredible.
