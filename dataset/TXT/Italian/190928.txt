pCgDALtN-Di5e6qLZuHyaw We had dinner here yesterday (Saturday evening) and it was  a mainly good experience. The atmosphere is great and our waitress, an older blonde lady, was very professional. She seated us at a nice table and brought us waters right away without us even having to ask. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and told us the specials by heart, which was really impressive. 

I ordered a seafood linguine which was about $20, and although it tasted great, it wasn't a whole lot of food. My friend ordered a pizza and it was very small as well. Another problem was that we were seated infront of the windows and they were open because of the nice weather but it was somewhat of a nuisance  because lakeshore is really loud and you could hear every car that passed by.

The quality of the food and the service however was really great!
