VfxlkvZQkLr9tu_w1SU_iw Nappoli Pizza is our go to spot for pizza and wings. I've gotten delivery and pick up. Yeah sometimes they're busier than others and you might have to wait a little longer when you get there; no big deal. I like the garlic parmesan wings. If you get the hot wings they are HOT  not your regular hot. Those are good too.
