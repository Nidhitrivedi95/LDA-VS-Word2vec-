v2xh5qtrlRJSU3OnixJH2g LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Fresh ingredients and FLAVORFUL food!! I love the build your own pasta - the marinara sauce is awesome! I just tried the roasted pork which tastes AMAZING! This definitely my go to pasta take out. The build your own pasta offers a generous portion, I always order the kid's bowl. The staff is also very friendly! :)
