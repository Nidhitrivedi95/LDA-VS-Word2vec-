l-Zjik0MbpabQPv-nNp9YQ I popped into Sanremo during my lunch hour at work and man, you walk in and are hit with a huge wall of "OMFG WHAT IS THAT SMELL PUT IT IN MY MOUTH!!".

They are pretty much a lunch time diners paradise with hot food, freshly baked bread and a bakery desert section to die for: I hear tell that their donuts are the best in town though I haven't had one myself.

Since I did bring my lunch on this excursion (yes, lame I know, as all my friends pointed out repeatedly between mouthfuls of whatever goodness they were mowing down), I opted to bring home one of their jalapeno and olive baguettes.

Which, by the way, was EXCELLENT. 

If I haven't said it enough in my other reviews of the area - I hate Mimico, but with places like this popping up, I may just hate it a little less.
