l1hqzJAIYEs3NQYqjH_kxA Horrible service! Called in an order and they couldn't understand me, so our order was not even ready when I called an hour before pick up. When we arrived, besides being informed that our food was not ready, we were also told that they didn't have one of the items we order....so needless to say, I will never be back here. Plus, we had to sit in the smoky restaurant, from oven smoke, not ciggys, while our eyes burned! Terrible experience!
