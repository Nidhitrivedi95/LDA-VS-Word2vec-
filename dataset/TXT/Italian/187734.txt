OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ I've been here twice and will definitely be back - so many things to try (that would kill my diet if I don't watch out). The pizza is fantastic by Vegas standards and even damn good by (my) picky, NY standards. I'm interested in trying the white pizza soon, since a lot of places can't pull it off (even back home!).

The rainbow cookies (for which we are fanatical) are different than what I'm used to, but having had them twice now, I'm a fan. They are a little sweeter than usual and have five layers (two are almond paste!)... Try a few! I'm getting a cannoli next time for sure, they look so good.

Rocco's has an excellent sauce, in my opinion. This is important; a mediocre sauce can ruin any pizza, sandwich or pasta. I feel safe ordering anything from their menu, and probably will order EVERYTHING, over time.

SUGGESTION: How awesome would it be if you carried Tower Isle  Jamaican beef patties??? :)
