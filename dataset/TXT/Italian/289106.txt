Zt4ljpwfmBufatNM1zPNcQ We created our own vegan pizza which came out really delicious. We were not charged extra for switching out the dairy cheese for non-dairy which I find just mean when restaurants do that and the ingredients were fresh tasting. Sadly we couldn't get the multigrain crust because it wasn't vegan, but the vegan one (we did not get gluten free) was still really good. 

Ordering was a bit of a hassle because our waiter said he'd come back when we were halfway through ordering, because we were taking too long I guess. He went and took someone else's order then walked a way for a bit longer than we would have thought necessary, especially since we had started ordering first. Kind of strange. We had questions and needed to figure out or order based on his answers. Otherwise a good meal.
