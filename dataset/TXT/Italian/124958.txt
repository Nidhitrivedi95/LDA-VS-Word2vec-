Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ We stumbled upon this restaurant because it was close to where we were when hunger struck, but don't let distance be the deciding factor on whether to come and try some of Chef Gio's amazing food, just come.   The menu offers pizzas with a myriad of delectable toppings such as homemade sausage, caramelized onions and roasted mushrooms.   We each had pizza slices with cheese and personalized toppings.   They were humongous and delicious with fresh veggies and meats and lots of flavor packed into the sauce and cheese.  So good.  Dip one of those slices in their garlic marscapone sauce and you'll forget ranch dressing was even a thing.  And it bears repeating that the pizza slices are ginormous.  They are serious about size and no one is going home hungry.  

I also had a Gio's salad on the side.  (Tomato, cucumber, fennel, onion and mozzarella with a house vinaigrette)  the salad was perfectly composed with a great balance of flavors from the acidity of the dressing  and the cool creaminess of the mozzarella.  Just yummy.  (Also, if you order a full size salad it is served in a bread bowl.  Yes please!)

So glad we found this place and I will absolutely be back!  I am looking forward to trying their organic chicken dinner with potatoes and stuffing or one of the daily specials.  This place was a pot of gold at the end of my google search.
