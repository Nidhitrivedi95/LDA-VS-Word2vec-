I ordered a regular pizza with fresh tomatoes, pineapple, onions and mushrooms and Sicilian pizza.  The order was more than $50.  For that much money, I expect good pizza.  What I got was a soggy under cooked mess.  After the first bite that tasted like dough - I called Anzi's too  get it fixed.  The man with whom I spoke was the one who made the pizza and he argued with me.  He told me that the toppings I chose were watery.  If they can't make a veggie pizza that isn't soggy - then why didn't they tell me that when I first ordered?  He continued to argue with me - it was my fault.  He offered to send me something else but told me if I ordered the same thing - it would be burned.  Seriously?  They can't cook a non-soggy veggie pizza?  The Sicilian wasn't anything special.  If there was a way to give no stars, then I would.  

I can't imagine that they will stay in business at this location very long with such bad service and food.
