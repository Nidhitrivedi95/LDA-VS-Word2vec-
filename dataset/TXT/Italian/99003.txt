EytLuPv39VGeQt_NJRJqYQ I heartily agree with another reviewer that this place is lackluster. From the outside it looks slick and modern but once you sit down it just feels like a bit nicer CiCis pizza. When the waiter came by, I asked about the special on craft beers and diverted from my question and told me about the cheap Yuengling special. Not what I asked so I had to ask again.

I don't think I'm their target audience as it looks like they are going for the bro/bachelor-banker type. The food was average and there is something off in the atmosphere. Can't say I would recommend. Food portions are large though.
