Service: FAIL

I finally found my Chicago style pizza. I LOVE their pizza.

If you order during the week for dinner, you should be okay with delivery times.
If you order for lunch, forget about getting your food in a timely fashion, it won't happen. Our estimated delivery time was 45 minutes. I called after an hour to see if our order was lost or something. The manager said they were running behind, but my order just left and I should receive it in a few minutes. We live about 10 minutes away if you hit every red light. It took another 45 minutes to get our food, it was warm at best and prepared wrong. I got a refund.

When we ordered again, I had my fiance pick it up to avoid delivery times. Perfect pizza.

The last time we ordered we were estimated 55 minutes delivery time, again, almost 2 hours later our food finally showed up. We wrote an e-mail (same as the first incident) about the issue, but haven't heard back 5 days later. Needless to say, no matter how delicious the pizza is, we will not be returning business to this location.
