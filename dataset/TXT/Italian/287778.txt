zMLuz0uKeWV0oF-xgAgWqg Wow! I'm happy to have found this place on yelp prior to our stay! 

Service was very friendly, the atmosphere was really nice, I felt like we might have been underdressed but it wasn't a issue! 

Our food was excellent. I enjoyed the bread that was served prior to our meal, there was a tomato pizza like garlic bread and a classic garlic. I enjoyed the tomato one the best, it was unique and enjoyable. We both got a cream based pasta, I got the carbonara with chicken and the husband went with his usual alfredo with chicken. My only complaint of the whole meal and experience was that the chicken was a bit dry and a little odd tasting. The pasta made up for it! It was the best pasta we have had! Very creamy, rich and filling. 

Yum! I will return some day.
