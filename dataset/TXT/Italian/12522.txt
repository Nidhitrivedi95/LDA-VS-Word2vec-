0WAL6O1YvcJbeDRYeRm34w My wife ordered the lobster ravioli and the gnocchi. Both were very tasty and prepared very well. The ravioli was a tad bit too salty though. The restaurant is very clean and well decorated. Our waitress was very professional and served us well. The one thing I didn't like was that there was not enough bread given with the meal. The bread portions were very small and we went through three of them. Other than that, a good little restaurant, albeit kind of expensive. But it's not too bad with the Groupon.
