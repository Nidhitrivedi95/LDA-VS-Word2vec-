yRUZ_sIxV6FyNygZD6MNTg Ended up here today for dinner although it wasn't planned.  Wasn't quite sure what to expect but was really impressed.  I am normally not a huge fan of going out to Italian restaurants as I don't feel most are very authentic and I could probably make a lot of the food at home.  This restaurant deserves its good reviews as the food is authentic and the staff are lovely.   I also loved the quaintness of the interior.   The dinner crowd was also quite surprising given the location and a Tuesday evening.  My rigatoni with sausage and chicken was seasoned very well and the bruschetta and bread was nice as well.   Wish I had room for dessert and espresso as it would have been the perfect finish to s great dinner.
