Tgc2dTcE1xOey2OUt_PvXA Considering this location just opened, a 2-3 hour wait is not uncommon, especially on a Sunday night. We anticipated a longer wait for a table than it actual took. We were able to grab a couple drinks and hang out in front while we waited. Once we were seated our waitress, Casey, was great as well as our appetizer. We ordered their signature pizza and a few other dishes. We did request everything at the same time, knowing it would take 40 minutes for the pizza. It took longer than the times quoted but the food was amazing and definitely worth it. The manager, Dominic, came to the table to apologize and in my opinion went ABOVE & BEYOND what I ever anticipated. Simply due to Dominic's professionalism and willingness to make things right is what will bring me back, even with an hour plus wait!
