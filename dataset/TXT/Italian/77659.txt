cZAU9Gs-rIv8DvsVp3qUTw We went there tonight for the first time. We had pizza which we thought was very good, excellent cheese.  We also split a crispy chicken salad, excellent. 
They give you some baked bread sticks to hold you over till your meal comes out, with olive oil, I could of ate 5 plates of those! The beer was cold, the waitress was good, and it was close to home, what else could I ask for? We will be back.  

I saw the sub sandwiches, they look like an excellent choice too.
