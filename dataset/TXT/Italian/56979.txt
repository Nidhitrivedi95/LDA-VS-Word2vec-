AN9sX6Dh8-QAoJssdyno8A I'm from San Francisco, and this $30 meal would easily be $50-$60 in north beach. We had the locale salad, margarita pizza, and pomodo pasta. I would give the meal 5 stars and our server was not only attentive but super sweet. They were closing and they let us finish our meal and take our time. If I'm ever back on the Phoenix area I would 100% recommend this place. It was honestly some of the best Italian food I've had in quite some time.
