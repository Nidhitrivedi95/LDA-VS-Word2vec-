pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ If I could give 4.5 stars I would. I wasn't the BEST food we ate in Vegas, but it was delicious, our service was great, we were seated right away at 7pm, which would have been impossible at other restaurants in the area, and they have (drum roll please......) A GLUTEN FREE MENU! Whew! I can't tell you how hard it is in Vegas to find gluten free food! I also do not eat meat ( I do however, eat fish).

I ordered the Shrimp and Zucchini Risotto, all I can say is mmmmmmmmm, it was sooo tasty. I don't normally eat dairy either, and I am positive this dish had cheese in it, but oh so tasty! The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and the risotto had so much intense flavor.
I would go there again in a heartbeat.
My husband who ordered basically spaghetti and meatballs, said he enjoyed his meal (getting a food review out of him is like pulling teeth).

For the gluten free menu, they have gluten free pastas, pizza crusts, risottos and more.

It is a bummer to read other negative reviews of this place. Perhaps we lucked out on getting a great server and ordered good dishes??

The prices were reasonable (for The Strip), and the ambiance was casual (it is in a mall across from the Stripper Bar), overall, 2 thumbs up from me!
