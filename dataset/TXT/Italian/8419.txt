Sometimes the difference between an average pizza and an outstanding pizza is in the way it is ordered and if the pizza maker follows those instructions.

Humble Pie at Sky Harbor Airport delivered a perfect Pepperoni Pizza!

I ordered it "Crispy, well done, almost burnt"

PERFECTION! Totally tasty waves!
