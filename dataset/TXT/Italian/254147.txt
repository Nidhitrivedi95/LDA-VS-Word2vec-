VVeT1XqQYwrB_fbp3efdUg With the combo of quality of food and prices, I am between 3 and 4 stars here with the 4 for the food and the 3 for the price you pay for it.  Will give the benefit of the doubt toward the food for this review however.

Agree with the commentary on the hot dogs.  Good quality VIenna Beef dogs which they charbroil for you when you order a "Char-dog".  The hamburgers are kind of thin but the meat is good and charred and the buns are of the nice soft, sesame seed variety.  The choices of starch are both quite good, the house made chips and the fresh cut fries.  I love dipping the chips in some of their blue cheese dressing.  You know the healthy way to eat chips...  The fries are best (like any fries) when they are cooked to order but this isn't always the case and when it's not there is a little sog factor going on.

For their other big claim to Chicago fame, the Italian Beef sandwich, I've found it to be hit or miss.  Sometimes the meat is a bit dry and tough and that is the exact opposite of what one expects from a real deal Italian Beef.  When it's good though, it is pretty darn close to authentic with delicious spicy, juices that it is (or should be) dipped in.

On the service side, I've never experienced anything but friendly and efficient so, high marks there.
