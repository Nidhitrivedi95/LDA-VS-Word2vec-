qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ We tried this for the first time today because of all the great Yelp reviews. They did not disapoint! The manager on duty was super friendly and very helpful. We settled on lunch specials for the girls... 2 slices of cheese pizzas and it was really good! My dh had the chicken parmigan entree also very good. I had the cheese calzone. It was awesome! They put ricotta cheese and mozarella inside with the sauce on the side. I do not like ricotta cheese but the brand they used was yummy and mixed with the mozarella it was perfect. I'm used to calzones with all mozarella which is also good but the ricotta made the dish not too heavy. I ate the whole thing. I can never eat a whole calzone. I don't know if its because the ricotta made it lighter or because it was so yummy I couldn't stop, haha probably both. They also gave us complimentary garlic knots since it was our first time. It was very good but I agree with another reviewer...next time I will ask them to heat it in the oven instead of the microwave.
