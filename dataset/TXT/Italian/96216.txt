eqQnIjAAhOUuHqK6gTWRXw First time dining at Maggiano's. Thumbs up for one of the best Italian meals I have had in a long time. Our waiter was Derek and he made our dining experience enjoyable... Will be returning soon....
  I had the eggplant parm and the portion was huge took half of it home along with fettuccini Alfredo to go all for $15.00. Fresh hot rolls are awesome as well. I can't say one negative thing about our visit.
