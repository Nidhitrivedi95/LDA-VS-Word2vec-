eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA After not loving our first experience at Brio, we visited for a second time with some friends to see if things had improved. There was nothing particularly wrong with our experience, but it wasnt mind blowing either. The service was adequate and we enjoyed dining outside. The bread given as a starter was good and my wifes Caesar salad was tasty. I ordered the seafood pasta and three of my clams were not opened, they could recognise this before sending it out. My pasta had way too much sauce and the fish was almost invisible. One of the meals came out with the wrong noodles but they apologised immediately and made a new one quickly without fuss which was great. It feels like Brio is trying to be upscale but cutting costs on the food. There are several Italian restaurants in town where the food is spectacular and while Brio is decent, it doesnt meet the level of some of these other places.
