G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I cannot believe I have not yet written a review for Giada. I visited her restaurant over a year ago and it was seriously one of my favorite dining experiences I have ever had. I may be slightly biased simply because Giada is my favorite cook on the food network but the food and atmosphere really did impress me. For starters, I probably had the best arancini in my life from here. I also really loved the bread that they brought out too especially the foccacia bread. Of course we had to go with her signature lemon spaghetti shrimp and it was so incredible yet so simple. I honestly don't know how they make it taste so good. Overall, I was super pleased with just about everything and I really want to make another visit.
