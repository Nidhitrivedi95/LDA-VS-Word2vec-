vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw Very cool place, it was my first time going. We shared a Caesar salad which could feed three people as well as the calamari and we split a traditional lasagna. The salad was so good and the croutons were very flavorful. The calamari was very big I just think the marinara sauce was a tad bit bland and could have used some spice. The lasagna was very good I loved the spice the only thing that kind of made me gag a bit was the layer of meat or sausage they used. I've never had lasagna that did a layer of meat Instead of ground beef or sausage and not used as a patty almost. Staff was friendly, very loud with a lot of family's with loud kids but the food overall was yummy. I would come again and try something new.
