1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag Straight up, my only complaint about this restaurant is the portion size.  Too small!  I understand that it's a fancy restaurant and portions are usually small, but that's usually reserved for French/Mediterranean bs, not good old Italian food.  

The prime rib was absolutely unbelievable.  Like the taste was incredible, the juiciness, the flavorful crust, the meat red-soaked with deliciousness... it was really, really one of the best steaks I've tasted.  It's one of the most expensive things on the menu ($45) but sooo worth it.

The wait staff was knowledgeable but mostly just really friendly.  The bathrooms are awesome -- that's one thing about Vegas, they really do it up in the bathroom stalls.  This one had some sort of orange glass bowl sink with a waterfall stream to wash your hands.  

Their free bread came with a reeeeaally good pesto olive oil, their calamari was just right.  And you can see those Lamborghinis in this glass room next to the restaurant.  Pretty neat.
