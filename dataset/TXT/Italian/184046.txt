oH6QAuoTLFaX97oqqpLTMg We ordered 2 large pizzas for delivery. 
Neither one of the pizzas were cut through. 
They put way too much cheese on the pizzas. 
All of the cheese slid off of both of the pizzas. 

It's amateur hour over there. They don't know how to make a pizza. 
They don't know how to cut a pizza and they don't know how to deliver a pizza. Other than that, they are ok. NOT!!!

I highly recommend, for you to NOT use this place!!!
