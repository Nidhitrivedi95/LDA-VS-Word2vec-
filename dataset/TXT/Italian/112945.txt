Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg I came here and was so disappointed. I had heard about how great their food is, but we didn't even get to eat! Our waiter was some middle aged looking guy. He took our order and brought our breadsticks and drinks. We then waited for over an HOUR for our pizza. We watched people who came before and after us getting their food. Our waiter walked by us several times and would make weird awkward eye contact with us but would never check on us to see how we were or to give any explanation as to why it was taking so long for such a simple order. We decided to cut our losses and go to Dominos.

I'm only rating two stars because our hostess was very nice and apologetic about the entire situation.
