First off, the entrance is not obvious, you have to be buzzed in after answering a question or maybe even two. The lighting is a bit dark but it adds to the theme which of course is all about the mob. Capone is everywhere on the walls as well as many of his counterparts from then and even more recent. 

The food was amazing. We had the stuffed mushrooms and bread as our appetizer. That was something I would go back for alone. Both my wife and I had pasta dishes which were fantastic. My penne pasta with vodka sauce and a meatball was incredible and my wife's cheese tortellini with alfredo sauce and pepperoni was just as good.

The service was superb and everyone there was extremely pleasant to talk to. If I'm back in Las Vegas, I'm going to Capo's!
