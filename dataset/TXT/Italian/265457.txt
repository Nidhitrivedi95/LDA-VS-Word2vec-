wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw Gilbert, if you like a wine list of literally ten wines, a menu consisting of bread and bread byproducts, 40 year old Gilbert moms trying to look cool, and whiffing the smell of a far greater restaurant next door i.e. Liberty Market or Joe's, then Postino East is the way to go.

I heard of Postino while reading another great issue of Phoenix Magazine while getting my hair trimmed at Great Clips. Hmm I said. This restaurant sounds intriguing.

Making my way to the Gotham City of the desert, Gilbert, i maneuvered my Mini Cooper through the thriving metropolis, and parked in one of Postino's well graveled parking spots.

It was then I entered Gilbert's version of a wine cafe. When I drink wine at a wine bar I expect it to taste like the nectar of the gods, unfortunately at Postino's this isn't the case. Their wine list is less insignificant then Tim Meadows's career. With so little to choose from I ended up ordering a wine I've never tasted before; a risky proposition to be sure. My wine ended up tasting like the liquid equivalent of Journey without Steve Perry.

After emptying the reminder of my wine in one of Postino's urinals, I decided to eat some food. I ordered the bruschetta sampler in which i get to pick out four different kinds of flour based goodness. The pesto salami was definitely my favorite; sort of like Michael Winslow being my favorite in the Police Academy films.

The atmosphere is interesting the say the least; if you enjoy looking at women with sun spots and 8 year old twins and the creepy men checking them out from across the room then this is your spot.

I'll pass and stick with Joe's across the street.
