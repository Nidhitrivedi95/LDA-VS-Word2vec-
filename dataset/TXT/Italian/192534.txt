pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Excellent Italian food, had the baked ziti which is a house favorite, my wife had one of the veal specialties which was awesome as well. For desert, I had the canoli and shared a tiramisu with my wife, both deserts were very delicious. Overall, I'd go again and recommend it to anyone looking for great, homestyle Italian food.
