qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg I was craving a an eclair and when I walked past this place, they had a beautiful assortment of pastries that looked amazing so I got my eclair. Unfortunately, this was hands down the worst eclair I ever had in life.  It was only midday and this this was hard and dry as a month old loaf of rye bread. The filling was absolutely disgusting too.  It was a very crappy butter cream.  I loved the decor of this place and maybe the other food is better, but they should not be selling anything like that eclair.
