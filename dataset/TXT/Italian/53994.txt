A7waf6G3cvnLfAqKeLL8DA Don't spend your money here. Two years ago I was told this was one of the best high end Italian restaurants by a friend. I'm not sure if something has gone wrong with this restaurant since then but my first meal there in Dec 2016 was overpriced , dry, over cooked and weirdly lacking in flavour. We had the stuffed fried olives which were overcooked and dry. The noudi bread balls were cute but again small and hard ( overcooked) with only a little tiny speck of softness on the inside. It was just a few tiny balls of dough in olive oil and rosemary. The tortellini dish was a disaster. I have had amazing broth based pasta dishes at less expensive restaurants in the city. What minuscule amount of pasta we got was dry and tough, the filling had very little flavour and the clarified chicken stock was lacklustre . The dish lacked any herb and would have looked a lot more appealing if it had something else to bring flavour and colour to the dish besides the yellow tortellini and a similarly coloured yellow stock.  Honestly this dish was an embarrassment. The tiramisu was also strangely bright yellow and was off on the ratio of biscuit to cream. I'm not sure if I had a full mouthful of biscuit in my serving. We spent $140 here for two and probably ate $3- $5 worth of poorly prepared flavourless food that I could have cooked better at home. This restaurant seems to be mostly about hype and is frankly quite a rip off. It wasn't just a bad day , it was bad menu items/recipes and bad execution. I haven't reacted so strongly against a restaurant for a longtime, I felt obligated to write this review. I eat out a lot in Toronto and I have never before eaten in a restaurant at this price point that performed so poorly on all 4 dishes I tried. Diner beware.
