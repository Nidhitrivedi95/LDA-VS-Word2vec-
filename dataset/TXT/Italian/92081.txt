eGTAC8EzcHiYnnZ52tijiQ Stoney's: this place kinda sorta rocks my socks. 

Very busy even when our Yelp group got there at 10am - and it only got busier from there (I'd say that's when the rush really starts). 

The seating & service at Stoney's is a bit unique: you actually stand in line and order at the cashier, pay for your food (no tip!?), and THEN they seat you. I don't really mind this, except it kind of sucks of you want a second drink later 'cuz you'll have to line back up. 

On to the star: the FOOD!

Holy moly! The portions here are HUGE! Come hungry or bring a friend that can help you finish your plate off!

We had the French Toast that comes in 3 giant pieces. Sprinkled with brown sugar, and comes with fresh fruit and a cinnamon spice butter (yum!). Sometimes I find thicker french toasts can be a little too under-battered, but these were perfectly battered and yummy throughout! 

We also tried the 3 cheese omlette which is, again, gigantic! Unless you are starving this is definitely a two person mission, and boy, they sure don't skimp on the cheese! This thing was bursting full of delicious, ooey gooey, cheeses. Mmm.

I look forward to coming back next time I am in the Oakville area!
