cpkBJhBujpBFZ0rOItE-4g Just went there with my family for a late lunch on Wed, 6/29/11.  It was about 2:30 pm and we were happy that they were open and still serving.  We have been going to Ruffino's for over 20 years, off and on, and still like it.  I am writing this review just to give readers some recent feedback.  Ruffino has a limited menu, but pretty decent food and prices.  Nothing outstanding, but decent and worth your time if you want to try their offerings.  My wife ordered their clam linuini, lunch portion, and it was good and substantial.  My daughter ordered the lunch manicotti and that too was decent and substantial.  Lunch does not come with anything -- no veggie, no salad -- just the entree and bread.  I ordered the dinner order of veal masala and it was good and came with veggies, side pasta, and side salad.  The price was fair.  We ordered and shared an antipasti platter to share first, and it came with two kinds of cheese, two kinds of olives, artichoke hearts, ham, procuitto, salami, mortadella, sweet and hot peppers, and about four big leaves of romaine.  Pretty substantial.  So I just wanted to report that it was pretty good and we will go back, but next time on a Thurs, since Thurs is Osso Bucco day.
