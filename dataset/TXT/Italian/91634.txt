EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw Went in for drinks and dinner. The drinks were amazing!  I told Spotty I wanted something with whiskey and let him take over. Each drink was delicious. 

Drinks= amazing
Crispy pig ears= amazing
Any of the raw items= amazing
Dumpling with pork= so delicious I want to just keep it in my mouth and not swallow it. It was heaven in my mouth. 

I will be back soon. Found my new favorite spot.
