15YuEFO59yXd7BTO5NZgYw Molto Bene!!!  We went last Tuesday night and it was packed but well worth the wait.  The very best sausage calzone I've ever had, and I will be 50 this year.  My wife had a chicken salad and loved it, daughter had pizza rolls and loved them and my parents had fettuccine and loved it too.  Thank you Vito's, our new favorite restaurant.
