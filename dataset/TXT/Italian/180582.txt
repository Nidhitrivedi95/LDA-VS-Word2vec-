NvFpFlu-aHzUOtaA0yc-YA Bought a $30 value deal from Groupon. I ordered the 4 cheese gnocchi and my boyfriend ordered the Rotini Cacciatore. The food were 3/5. His pasta could have been homemade by ourselves and my gnocchi 4 cheese were not flavorful enough and lacked some taste. 
Service was good, which I'd give 5/5.
When  it gets darker in the evening, they dim the lights and light up a candle on each table.
