_myTPlWa8QRN5eavs-hNPg Service was great and it had a really cool theme - all the waiters dressed in Al Pacino costumes from the movies.  My wife liked her scallops, but I didn't care too much for my chicken saltimbocca.  I think the whole pieces of sage over the chicken was a bit overpowering.  The broccoli rabe, while cooked well, needed a bit better of a wash before doing so.  The burrata was nothing to write home about.  3.50 for a draft Peroni is not only a great price, but it's tough to find on tap!  We'll be back for drinks and to try the pizza.
