84ezTxVxTCmI65_UeYRJcA I have been to this location twice now, and if I were more a fan of frozen desserts I would be here a lot more.

I must say, our last experience there was very pleasant. There was no line up (not typical - it's just the dead of winter) and were greeted by a very friendly girl behind the counter who offered us countless samples. She was informative, bubbly (but not too) and really made our experience better. She even told us to just relax with our gelato and pay on the way out. 

The two flavours we got were - Ferrerro Rocher and Mixed Berry (separate dishes of course). Both were very good. Not disappointed at all. We were wishing we had ordered two scoops! (The struggle is real)

The Good:

1. Staff. Very friendly and really look to create an experience for you rather than hate their lives for serving (here's looking at you, Tim's!)
2. Taste. All gelatos I've had here are very good.
3. Hours. This place is open late which is great for those late night gelato or otherwise cravings.

The Bad:

1. Variety. For a gelato place, there are not THAT many flavours to choose from. I was actually a little surprised.

Recommendation: Ferrerro Rocher with a scoop of something else because one is not enough and two scoops ($5.50) is a steal.
