4LXZzgsrM1ZyS_-uB9Od2Q What happened to L'il Bacci? Doesn't seem very long ago that it was a brand new addition to the Leslieville strip, and trying effortlessly to please. Last weeks lunch though, didn't please at all. The pizza was mediocre, service was spotty, and the music was obnoxious. To be fair, the soup was excellent, but didn't make up for the rest of the meal.

A dinner in the summer was equally uneven. We sat on the patio and were attended to by a friendly server. While the arugula salad was delightfully satisfying, the spaghetti al limone (at $17) was not. Overpriced, and under flavoured, it was a dry and disappointing execution of a simple dish that could have been delicious on a warm evening. 

Too bad, because from the outside, it's so pretty.
