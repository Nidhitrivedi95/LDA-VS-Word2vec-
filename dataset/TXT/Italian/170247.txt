mULK9fWh8kU4_vQYkd9ntA WOW! Where is the health dept. ?
The place has a 93. 
Should be a 63, filthy is the word, food was OK at best, the walls , floors are gross. The employees have time to stand and talk and watch videos on the phone, but no time to clean. Stay away there are much better and cleaner places to eat. Mike
