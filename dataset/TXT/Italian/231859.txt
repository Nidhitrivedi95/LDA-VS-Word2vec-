tIiiq23utFKTs1At2bVD6w Went here for the first time on Valentine's Day.  It did not meet my expectations for various reasons.  I was surprised that my seating was on the heated patio.  Each couple was sat in a row with no deviation of table between us.  We choose to split the salad which was nice.  I ordered the Fettuccine (added chicken) and my husband had the Fish special (Sea bass).  I was disappointed that my dish was dry.  I do enjoy having extra sauce on my plate to roll my noodles in.  My husband said the Sea bass was the best he's ever had!  Yet, he was surprised at the $46 dollar price that came with it later. The service was attentive and not lacking. 

I do believe this place is good for a casual meal, not a special occasion.  Perhaps the food and atmosphere would be better when not under pressure.
