All in all, the food is good...now if you could just find a clean table to sit! Came here on a Monday afternoon. Wasn't greeted. Stood around so long waiting for someone to take our order that we almost left. Finally an employee came up to the register to take care of the growing line. Now I'm pretty easy so I was willing to let that slide, but once I got my food, there was not one clean booth to sit in. Literally. My group went back and forth from both sides trying to find a clean place to sit until we finally settled for a dirty booth that we had to clean OURSELVES! There looked like there were enough employees around to take care of the place, but one guy was too busy refilling his drink to take notice. My fiancé almost went up to complain, but it just seemed like a bunch of high school kids working so what do they care, been there done that. Glad I got to share my meal with someone else's trash. The girl at the front who had been taking orders the whole time came out a few moments later and started cleaning up. Either she's the only one with any drive at this place or they are severely understaffed. 

In conclusion, pizza and wings are great, but if I have to eat next to someone else's trash again I will look elsewhere for some pizza.
