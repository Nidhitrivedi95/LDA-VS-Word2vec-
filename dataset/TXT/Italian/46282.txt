8pmGz3Lg4f_r7HdDZPa4dQ Awful! Two burnt slices of pizza and a can of soda was 6 bucks! When I realized that I could get a 16" pizza for 8 bucks Vinnie (the poor example of a manager) said "its to late!" He was rude and when I said I'm going to write a review about this terrible experience he said "do what you gotta do!" NEVER AGAIN! Also he changes the prices and cant give you a legit receipt. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. YOUVE BEEN WARNED!
