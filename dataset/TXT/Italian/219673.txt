SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Very yummy dinner and definitely more affordable than most steakhouses around Vegas. (During happy hour 5-8pm) 1/2 price steaks during the happy hour. We both had the filet minion which was delicious. I had the truffle mac n cheese and my husband had the garlic mashed potatoes. I wasn't a huge fan of the mac n cheese and preferred the potatoes. They also poured a good glass of bourbon even though it was on the pricier side.  Total came to $82 for two peoples dinner and a glass of Blantons bourbon. We will be back for sure.
