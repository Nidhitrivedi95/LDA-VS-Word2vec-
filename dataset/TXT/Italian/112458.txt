GCen6oV-_6PfMP_uKN-dZw Don't get the Fettuccini Alfredo. I tried to eat the leftover and heated in the pan. It was pretty much fettuccini soaked it oil or melted butter. It was more like frying in the pan. When you eat it fresh, it taste ok, but doesn't look appettizing. When you tried to re-heat it, yeah...it's something else. Garlic knots are delicious. Will come back to try their pizzas.
