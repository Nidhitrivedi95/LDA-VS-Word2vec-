DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q I found this gluten free spot from the phx website skyharbor.com.
I ordered a gluten free Mother Earth pizza that was quite delicious! The crust was a little crunchy like flatbread but the cheese and toppings made up for it big time!
The food was also prepared professionally and quickly!
The pizza person was extremely helpful and friendly.
I now know where to get good grub in the airport.
And the price was quite alright at $13 for a small gluten free with like 10 toppings!
