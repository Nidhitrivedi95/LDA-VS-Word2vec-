The Grilled Shrimp on the Stone was a huge mound of little shrimps with a slightly spicy kick. It came with a creamy horseradishy dip that I wasn't too excited about partly because I'm not into horseradish but also because the shrimps were already a little spicy and perfectly marinated. I did however wish the shrimp were a little bigger; I wouldn't have minded getting fewer of them. 

The Arancine consisted of three large fried balls with a gooey filling of risotto, mozarella cheese, ground beef and peas with a marinara dip. They were good but it was also very filling and a little too heavy to be a thoroughly enjoyable appetizer.

The highlight of the night was definitely the home made linguine with scallops and shrimp in your choice of sauce, which for us was an absolutely delish garlic cream sauce that our server recommended. The linguine had a great bouncy texture and was cooked just right with sweet fresh scallops and large shrimp. This was one of the specials for that night but we were told that they often vary this dish so you could try something a little different each time. This is sooo good but I love scallops so I might be a little biased here.

I thought it was a tad warm out on the patio that night and it would have been nice to have ceiling fans or some kind of misting to make it a little more comfortable. Although we were seated outside, the staff were attentive and kept our glasses filled and checked on us often.

UPDATED on 8/19/2010: I signed up on Ventano's website about 3 or 4 weeks ago and only just received a one-time-use coupon from them for $25 off $50 purchase that expires September 1, 2010. I don't live near Henderson so if you can use this, please send me a message and I'll email it to you.
