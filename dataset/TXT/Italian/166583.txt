me17NOULVwu40AdKGYHIaQ I love this place. I live in the neighborhood  shouldve came here alot sooner. Forgot to take a pic of my food. But for the retard who gave 2 stars because of a to go order with a paper plate, knucklehead. The food rocks. Authentic NY style Pizza. Almost wish I hadn't found it because I'm probably going to be eating here ALL the time and I'm gonna get fat.
