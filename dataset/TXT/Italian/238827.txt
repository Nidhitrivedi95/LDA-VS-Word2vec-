u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog Nice location and atmosphere,  but that's it!!
The server we had was unhelpful and messed up the bill three times and still didn't get it righ.
A couple of us had the salad and couldn't eat it as it was all vinegar,  them came the worse pasta clam dish ever.
Also the pricing is outrageous...this was not a good experience
