FXiPQQGr_2bwlJ4wOrW2eA I was far from A-OK on this place. I wasn't impressed with really anything except, they took reservations on Easter. It seems most other places either didn't or were closed.
We were a party of 12, and no one really enjoyed their food. We were all hungry, and we ate, but most of us had a decent amount of food, whether it was appetizers or entree, left on our plates. It was not good italian, IMO. It wasn't really good food. It was like going to someones house who doesnt really know how to cook. You eat it and smile, but would to never come back! Service was Ok, nothing great, but I guess you could say it was Easter and a large table?
