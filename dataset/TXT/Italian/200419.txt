Pueu_ofuGNpX2dRf-GHt_A I have dined here twice now and have found the food of good value and the service efficient and courteous. Both times we were off to a play and our timeliness was never in jeopardy.

The decor is a little odd because of the huge entry way that turns into a dance club later at night, but the ambiance is otherwise comfortable and quiet. To date, I have had the veal scallopini twice: slight hint of lemon and herbs, tender and flavourful. Although the presentation of the prosciutto and melon was somewhat hohum, the melon was firm without being underripe and the prosciutto was well-cured without being tough or stringy. We also had the straciatella soup, which came piping hot and delicately flavoured.

In all, we have not been disappointed with the food, service, or the value. We'll be back.
