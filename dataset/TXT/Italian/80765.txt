The interior is dimly lit with a romantic ambiance that permeates throughout the entire restaurant.  Now for the food, I sat at the bar and ordered the linguini marinara with mushrooms, which came with fresh baked bread, an olive oil dipping plate, and a house salad consisting of assorted greens with an Italian vinaigrette dressing.  The portions are quite plentiful and unless you have a ferocious appetite, you will likely be taking some home.  The wine selection is massive and there probably a couple hundred bottles lining the bar area; however, I opted for a $4.00 glass of Sangiovese.  Some things in life come can be ignored or swiftly forgotten, but the cuisine here certainly cannot!
