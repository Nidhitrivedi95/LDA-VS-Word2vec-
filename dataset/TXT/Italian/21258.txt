38-sjGYYVcQEKrZe5Nu47A Trekked to Henderson last night and this pilgrimage was to convert my girlfriend to the artery clogging goodness of these Johnnie Mac Wings. She's been converted. Oh, the flavors are medium, hot, and firey suicide. I had the firey suicide on the side and it wasn't suicidal for me it was spicy hot but tasty, my eyes were teary and the nose was runny after a few. The staff is genuinely nice and expedient.
