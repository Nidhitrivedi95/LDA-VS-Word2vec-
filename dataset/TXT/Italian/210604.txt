qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ Decent local pizza place. I wanted to give it 5 stars but not quite there. Garlic knots were OK. I don't really like the idea that they make 25,000 of them at one time. It would be nice if they were made fresh to order.Pizza is decent. Kind of expensive for me. It's busy every time I go in so that's a good thing.
