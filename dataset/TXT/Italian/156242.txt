As for my friends, they also didn't particularly enjoy their ramen, though they thought it was better than mine. One was too salty and the other too fishy. The noodles are fine, though I personally prefer the alkaline ramen noodles with a bit more bite to them (just a fair warning if that's what you're expecting).
