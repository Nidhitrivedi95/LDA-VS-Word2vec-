9S7RUjzkdpU4MDxUxkvLvg Well, I went specifically to try their black bean burger and sweet potato fries. My to-go order came fast, though my sever was kind of rude and I stood there right beside her with my receipt and money while she did everything but acknowledge me. I almost walked out until one of these people made eye contact and let me pay. I must say the burger was great. The fries were kind of soggy and also, maybe I'm a pig but for a $15 meal, the size of my fry order is kind of ridiculous....I almost took it back but I didn't feel like being ignored again.
