2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg I have been to this Cafe numerous times and I will keep coming back. Very friendly staff and an awesome selection to choose from.  My wife and I had breakfast there and it was delicious. I am not a coffee drinker,  but my wife loves the coffee. Desserts were not overpriced, and were very tasty. Nice place to people watch and just hang out and talk at Tivoli Village.
