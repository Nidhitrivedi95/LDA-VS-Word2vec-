GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA I make it a general policy to avoid "Celebrity Chef" restaurants like the plague BUT a friend told me that this one was outstanding.  I am forced to concur, the Oxtail gnocci was just wonderful and then it was overshadowed by the sheer GLORY of the Veal Shank!  I eat here whenever I swing through Vegas!
