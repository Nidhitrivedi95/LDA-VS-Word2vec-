nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow Near the top of the hill, just as you enter Little Italy, this is one of the few restaurants on the main strip with its own parking lot. It's mildly romantic inside (thanks to dim lighting), the waitstaff is attentive, and the food? The food is Tony-the-tiger grrrrrreat! Try the homemade gnocchi. I'm getting wistful just thinking about it.
