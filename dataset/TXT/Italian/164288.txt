LXheNwqZPoXuXNNeP1sNew We had a groupon for this place so we thought we would try it. We were very disappointed and won't be back again. We ordered the strawberry Gorgonzola salad and the BBQ chicken pizza. The salad was ok but had hardly any dressing so we had to ask the waiter for more. The strawberries were slightly mushy so I'm guessing they were previously frozen and were not fresh. The BBQ chicken pizza was a huge disappointment. The pizza was super spicy and was not your typical BBQ pizza with a sweet BBQ sauce. I wish the waiter had told us it was going to be spicy because we would have ordered something else. The service was ok but overall we were disappointed by our experience.
