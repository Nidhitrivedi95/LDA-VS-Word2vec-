Kykw3ho8wHtLV6gr9qbWTg This is the first time we've been there since they went all organic. The menu isn't as obnoxiously large as it was before (HUGE bonus!) but the food is just as good. We tried the whole wheat crust but our taste buds didn't like it too much. I love that there are options for those who are vegans, gluten free, etc. There is pretty much something for everyone. The pizza is not bad but you definitely have to be in the mood to try something new, especially if you are new to the "foodie" world like I am. 

We started with the spinach/artichoke dip. Highly recommend it! It comes in an edible bread bowl with slices of pita, celery and carrots. The dip was good with all four options. 

There were only two servers on at the time and the place was busy! We still never waited for a refill on drinks. We will be back.
