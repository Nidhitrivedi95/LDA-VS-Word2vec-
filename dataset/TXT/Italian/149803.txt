KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ I went here with some friends who state that this is one of their favorite restaurants in Vegas, so I was really looking forward to trying some delicious Italian food!  I wasn't impressed with my meal, unfortunately, and maybe it was due to the food I ordered.  After being meat-ed out from a steakhouse visit the prior night, I was in the mood for seafood, so I ordered a house salad and a mussel special of the night.  The $15 house salad was a huge platter of basically iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and fennel.  I should have ordered the beet salad as my friend did.  The entrees came out on a cart and are served table-side which is a nice touch.  My $35 special was some spaghetti with an average tomato sauce and mussels, some of which were still sandy.  I was not impressed.  However, I tried one of my friends meat balls and those were very good.  I don't mind paying for a good meal but the food at least has to be good.  Too many other options in Vegas... I won't be back.
