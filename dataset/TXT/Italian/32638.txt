5ykOWYZ44sUvu9qxD8rPeg Can't say enough about my meal here. From start to finish it was a pleasant, enjoyable dining experience. Friendly, attentive service and delicious food. Three of us shared a bottle of wine, caprese salad, Biaggio and Carmela pizzas, and a taste of their homemade amaretto. Wonderful homemade crust and top notch toppings make Il Bosco a special place. They seem to do a brisk carry-out business, too. They also have a portable wood-fired oven to do catering. Wish I lived here so I could be a regular!
