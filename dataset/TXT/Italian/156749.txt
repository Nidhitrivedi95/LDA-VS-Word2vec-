Great service!
Warm atmosphere.
Delicious food!

Their table bread is addicting, chicken Marsala melting, and spaghetti and meatballs savory.

They have great marinara here!

High on my list. I felt guilty walking out of the restaurant, staring into the Bikram Yoga studio next door! (I go there, too)
