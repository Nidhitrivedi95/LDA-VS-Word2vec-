x4aHNNo1osWNCB75q_PijQ unbelievable non-existent service. We were shown to our table by the hostess and given menus. The place was 2/3 full. Sat waiting tried to catch attention of waiters - all too busy to look up. So after quite a wait I went to the front desk - hostess and what appeared to be the manager were involved in a conversation that did not involve looking up at customers. Rather than interrupt I decided to see how long they would leave a customer standing there before noticing. They won - after waiting for 2 full minutes with neither one of them lifting their gaze from the table map I said excuse me - the manger raised his finger as if to ask me to wait. I returned to my table, gathered my party and we walked out. again no one looked up. 
If there is one thing that drives me crazy it's these places that get all self-important. They think the customer is a necessary interruption to running the place.
