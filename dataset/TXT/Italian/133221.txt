Plus, the place is really nice (maybe a tad crowded) inside, and the wait staff was excellent! Try the pink sangria if you like slightly sweet - it's rose, fin, and st Germaine, and it's delicious. We brought parents for my mom's birthday and the restaurant lets you take your pick of the dessert menu for a free birthday treat. My parents' only complaint was that the chairs aren't the most comfortable. Other than that, they loved it too!
