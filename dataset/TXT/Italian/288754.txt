ZrtROjmux0QieMkwqlnnTA I came here after walking up and down the street looking for a restaurant to have a late lunch.  This was the only one that caught my eye. 

This restaurant was pretty much empty with the exception of 1 table of people when we strolled in around 1:30pm on a week day.  This place looks like your typical classy restaurant with a large bar with a wide array of wines, white linen tables and exposed brick on both sides of the restaurant.  Service was friendly but the food was a tad slow - probably because they didn't have much kitchen staff onboard at this time (when I walked by the kitchen, there only seemed to be a couple of people in there). 

Anyway, I had their lunch special which was $18 for a soup of the day, a main from a short list, dessert & coffee/tea.  I chose their bolognese penne and their soup, we were told, was zucchini but we think it was butternut squash since it was orange. Umm...yeah, maybe we heard wrong.  No matter, I really like butternut squash soup so I enjoyed it.  We were also served crusty bread (yummeh!) with olive oil & balsamic vinegar.  My penne was a bit on the oily side but the bolognese sauce was hearty with the ground meat.  I wanted a bit of spice so our waiter got me some house made chili oil - fantastic!  It gave the kick I wanted and I do prefer chili oil over chili flakes. My fiance had the fish of the day which was halibut.  It was cooked really well - flaky with a seared crust on the outside.  It came with broccolini, yellow peppers & potatoes. He really liked the fish and yellow peppers but didn't care too much for the broccolini & potatoes. 

My dessert was a bay leaf flavoured panna cotta.  Niiiice!  Never had it before so I was looking forward to it.  It was very good and the bay leaf flavour was strong but not overwhelming. I thought it was interesting and tasty. 

Glad we stopped here.
