We were lucky enough to get a table with an awesome view of the street performers, which is probably what pushed this review to 4 stars.  We ordered a pizza and a pasta to split, and while the pizza was amazing, the pasta was overpriced.  I say it was overpriced because it was 6 bucks more than any of the other pastas, and it's price wasn't listed on the menu (our server recommended it to us as a special).  That kind of rubbed me the wrong way, it seemed like she was trying to get a little more money out of us.  Even worse, when we were done eating she took our plates, left a dessert menu and plopped down an empty bowl with two spoons and told us to pick which dessert we wanted.  She didn't ASK if we wanted to dessert, but rather put us in an awkward position where we couldn't say no.  I eat out all the time and that had never happened to me before.  We got gelato, it was delicious but at 9 bucks it better have been!  Overall I would likely return and stick to pizza only, as it was amazing.  If you eat there, be prepared for servers who just want your $$$
