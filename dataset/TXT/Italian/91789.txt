Egd-0nDgzZGEVA0R09yyUQ Long time customer. Food was decent now plain lousy. Recently ordered dinner to go and was so disappointed. Pasta was almost red from absorbing sauce, meat was old tasting not spoiled just far removed from fresh food. Called them. Lady said she recognized my name that I was a regular and wanted me to talk to owner. Asked me if he could call me back because he just walked in. Never was interested enough to call me back. I am not interested now in ever going back. Too bad they were so close to home. Customer service does not exist here.
