dSEcQPPUlATxZf5pvN_t5Q It's amazing that I've never been to a Red Devil before.  Grew up right down the street from one, and a friend's family did big dinners there all the time.  Just never happened for me.  But today was craving Italian and figured I'd give it a try.  

The atmosphere of this location is definitely - utilitarian.  Kinda reminds me of some Chinese buffet restaurants.  Old school padded/metal stackable chairs and booths with rips in the vinyl covers.  Based on my seat, I got to hear all about the conversations of the folks working there as the waitress hang out seemed to be just out of my eye shot.  Not the smartest kids in class, but they're young.  My server was very, and a bit overly, attentive.  I had to avoid her eye contact as if I lifted my head and looked straight forward while eating she was at the end of the wall just staring at me.  Can you say uncomfortable? 

Anyhow, pretty good selection of food, but on a weekday at noon there was no lunch menu.  Not that dinner prices were over the top or anything, but it surprised me.  Pizzas looked great, and I'd heard good things in the past.  I tried their chicken lasagna and it was pretty good.  Nothing that is going to make me go running back for more, but it was fine.  

My favorite thing about the place were their rolls.  Hard on the outside with a crusty cracked top and when you open it the inside is soft, doughy and dense with quite a nice flavor.  Again, even that wasn't 100% amazing, but with a little tweak, or some garlic butter or herbed butter  vs. regular butter, they could really be great.  

Anyhow, seems like a nice family spot.  I may go again if the mood strikes, but I wouldn't feel heartbroken if I never went again either.  And that about sums it up.
