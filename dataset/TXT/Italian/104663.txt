fOqRkFQNazfaAkH2eD_G6Q Exceptional service!  Food is extremely good (reminds me of local Roma trattoria!), Fresh homemade pasta and fresh seafood.  The Steak cooks perfectly.  Love the personal touch by the head chef!  Frank the owner is extremely friendly.  Definitely a MUST TRY! I'll be Back Spinello!
