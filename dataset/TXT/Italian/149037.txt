Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA We ate dinner here one night as we had just gone up the High-Roller Ferris Wheel and were very hungry.  The décor and atmosphere feels almost diner like and is not the most appealing to the eye with all the florescent tube lighting.  The prices are on the high side and the food was okay.  We had 2 small pizzas (about $17 each), chicken parmesan ($27), salads ($?) and beers.  

The service was okay, our waiter was trying to be funny, but wasn't.  Our thoughts after we left were that we would try something different next time.
