6PQve0oFCLPSh4wnIzvJtg After having three people tell me I needed to try this restaurant. I made an attempt the past 4 days but every time I called or drove by it wasn't open. Tonight finally it was , I ordered take out. I ordered baked ziti with eggplant and garlic bread. First let me say that the guy (not sure of his name but has lots of ink)  who took my order and was at the counter when I arrived was super nice , excellent customer service. I got my order nice and hot.  House salad dressing was delish ( was recommended) now for the baked ziti. Not totally what I was expecting it was ziti with cause topped with cheese and 5 pieces of eggplant. Flavor wasn't bad  didn't have much ricotta cheese in it. I guess I should have asked but the eggplant was just that pieces of eggplant. I was thinking it would be baked into the ziti.  I will probably try it again but  go with a different dish
