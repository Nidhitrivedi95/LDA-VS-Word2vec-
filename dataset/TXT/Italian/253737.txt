VtiHtLI2t0OjFjbrnR70lw So it was my first time going there today evening. I've heard a lot about this restaurant from my friends who are in the UK and I couldn't wait to try it out. I must say it was one of the best Italian food that I've ever had. The pasta was just delicious and not to mention the appetizers are a must eat. Plus the ambience is very nice. A little bit pricy but it's worth visiting.
