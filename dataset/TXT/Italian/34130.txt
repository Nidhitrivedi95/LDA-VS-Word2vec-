65MopK4YgW-nmcvy_LIqiQ It's Saturday afternoon and you are a bit tired from Friday night... What do you do?? Stop for coffee of course! But where?   You can go for a big box store or you can support local business and stop here! 

You will not be disappointed! Cool hangout spot with comfy seating, good soft music, beautiful decor... And let's not forget the coffee.

The coffee is amazing.  My usual go to is an americano. I find that you can get the most taste of the beans and if the place can make it right (all you Americano drinkers know what I mean!) then I'm pretty sure the rest will be great for everyone else! And they definitely made it right! Quality beans brewed at just the right temp and poured perfectly! 

Come here if you want a nice local small town coffee shop for great coffee and a nice place to relax for a few. There is a small selection of sweet treats to compliment your coffee but the primary draw is definitely the drinks. Save the big box coffee for a day there is no other choice... Otherwise support local!
