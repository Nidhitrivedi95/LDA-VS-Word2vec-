Server was attentive, they graciously accommodated us even though they closed in 45 minutes, and the food was beyond delicious. We ordered the mushroom pizza as an appetizer, the steak burger (cooked perfectly medium and only available on the lunch menu), mushroom ravioli, and the spinach tagliatelle with chicken. The menu changes often and I've been there multiple times and enjoyed my experience/meal. Definitely a special place to take out of town guests but we also enjoy it for a lunch or dinner when we're feeling fancy! I do agree that the portions are on the smaller side compared to other restaurants (of lower quality) but I feel very satisfied after because the food is good quality and delicious. You get what you pay for here.
