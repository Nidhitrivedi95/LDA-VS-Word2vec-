Luxe Kitchen is a pet friendly restaurant that allows you to bring your dogs to their patio and order food for them! When I came here with my friend, it just had such a nice vibe to it. 

I came here for Brunch so if you want to know about their brunch food, read on!

A table next to me ordered the egg sammie (yes, i went up and asked the name of it) and i was immediately jealous that I hadn't ordered it. So, I would say.. when in doubt, get the egg sammie! But, here are the dishes I tried:

Breakfast Bake (3.5): I loved the fontina cream that came with it and I loved the bacon (who doesn't) thrown in there with the perfectly made potatoes. What I wasn't sure I liked was the egg. Given that i'm not a huge fan of raw egg, I thought the egg didn't look very....fresh? It was just a bit disturbing. But all in all, the breakfast bake was pretty delish!

Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict (4.5): YUM YUM YUM! Love it! Salmon was fresh, muffin was good, side potatoes were perfect, and the eggs were cook well.

Overall, I'd say their sandwich (which I didn't taste) looked really good and seemed to be what most tables were ordering so go with that if you're hesitating on what to order. Oh, a mimosa with it might not be a bad idea while you enjoy a patio full of dogs!
