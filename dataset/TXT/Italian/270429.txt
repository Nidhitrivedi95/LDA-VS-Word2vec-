xmWs-su5eB5_57CIw4sqfw This is a hidden gem! This small cozy place is owned by an Italian family that clearly has a goal of making their customers feel like they are having dinner in Italy. The service is topnotch and the food is excellent. My suggestion is do the whole thing, appetizer / dinner / desert, with a glass or two of wine then take home what's left. Don't hold back at this place. It's all good!
