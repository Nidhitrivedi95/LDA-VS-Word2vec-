wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g Stopped in this place in the Venetian for happy hour drinks and a light snack before heading to a wedding.  The drinks were strange.  You could only get certain ones.  Which I totally get but they were all strange concoctions.  I wanted a regular martini, but could only get strange flavored ones.  So that's what I ordered and didn't really like it.  Our waiter was less than attentive and made us feel that because we were shopping off the happy hour menu, we were less worthy of his time.  The margarita pizza was delicious though and that's why I gave it at least a 3 star rating.  This would have probably been a cool place to have a full dinner.
