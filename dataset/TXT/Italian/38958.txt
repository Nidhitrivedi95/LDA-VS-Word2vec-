So I  decided to dine in once.  What a  mistake.  We sat for over 30 minutes and no  service.  The place wasn't that  busy but apparently business  is so good they don't have to wait on customers.  If you want take out, then I recommend  it, but for dining in, forget it.  Hence the two star rating.
