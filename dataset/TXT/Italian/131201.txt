iFZpyiDUgwldTWuW-5YW6A I've had drinks here several times, but finally had my first sit down meal experience here over the weekend.

We rolled in here with a crew of ten for dinner and adult bevs before the Benny Benassi show at Label Friday night. Our server was nice and a really good sport (we can be a rowdy bunch sometimes). 

Our orders: a couple calamari apps for the table to share, chicken parm, seared tuna, seared scallops, meatball pizza, prosciutto & roasted mushroom pizza, and the pork shank. I tried a little bit of everyone's. Pretty good. Two of us got the tuna and ordered it medium rare. They both came out medium well. Bummer. I think I would've liked it a lot more if it wasn't so overcooked. The roasted butternut squash mushrooms that accompany it were delicious. Next time, I will be ordering the prosciutto & mushroom pizza. Prosciutto just makes everything better.

I love the decor here. Very trendy and swanky. Overall, I would say this place is probably around 3.5 stars. So, we'll round up to four and call it a day.
