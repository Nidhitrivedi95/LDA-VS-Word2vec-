nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g I've had lunch here before and it was great but having dinner here a week ago was definitely an experience!

Thumbs up to the attentive service with a dash of comedy from our waiter who was also knowledgeable on the wine selection right down to the ingredients in the dishes.

It was fairly busy inside so we were sat outside on the patio which actually was a bit nicer since it wasn't as loud as inside. Aside from the waste truck that came by it was a good time out there.

Food was incredible. If you like Italian food then you will not be disappointed. Everything is very traditional and is prepared with incredible detail. You could order almost anything off the menu and be impressed. The sauces are light and flavorful and nothing is overpowering. We had the Gelato for desert and were very impressed. Apparently they brought in a special machine from Italy and from the amazing taste of the Gelato...it's definitely authentic!

While a bit on the pricey side you definitely get what you pay for from the exceptional food to the great atmosphere. If you're looking for a great Italian dining experience downtown and outside of the College St area then this is it!
