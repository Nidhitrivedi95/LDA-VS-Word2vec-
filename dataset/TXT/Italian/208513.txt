qpjEu9iBBzIrBGCD-6ENMg One night, I was craving some really delicious pizza, after a night out with friends. Walking down E Carson street back to my car, Pie Bar caught my eye. 

It's pretty nice inside- updated, spacious, and clean. Two workers sat inside on their phones, barely looking up. After taking our order, they went to the back room and played on their phones while our pizza was being heated up. We had a chance to admire the place a little more- reasonably priced and looking like your standard pizza shop, we were impressed and wondered why we hadn't learned of this place sooner. 

When the pizza came out, it was hot to taste and we were asked if we needed napkins or a drink. I'm not sure why, but I have always been a fan of canned mushrooms rather than fresh ones, and that's the type that was on my slice. My husband ordered a gyro and thought it was really delicious. 

Glad we ran into this hidden-- or not so hidden-- gem on our walk home. It hit the spot, was reasonably priced, and was a perfect place to grab a bite after a night out.
