LMdUoR00jPxQDWLYRq93FA I have been to a few high end restaurants in my day. So Ill summarize right up front. I wasnt that impressed.

The Pros:
Fantastic ambiance
Knowledgeable wait staff
The yam-stuffed raviolis are to die for (some of the other reviews mention them as well)
Excellent assortment of local and small California wines
Excellent home-made salamis

The Cons:
They killed, and I mean KILLED my NY Strip steak. Past well done. Sawdust. You just dont do that in a $300 place. My 12 year old does that. Didn't offer to re-do it, but wanted to get me "something else"? WTH?? Like I dont know what sawdust in my mouth is and what a NY strip is supposed to taste like?
The halibut was under cooked as well. 
One of the wine courses didnt come out with the meal course.
They added a automatic 18% gratuity. Even on the alcohol. You just dont do THAT either.

So go for the atmosphere and anything "tuscany", but stay away from anything else. For a "high end" place they fall short. Go to Fleming's or something instead if you want better all around food. Dont say we didnt warn you.
