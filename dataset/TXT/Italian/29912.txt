5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g I'm new to the area and discovered this place on accident. I've been to both locations and they are both fantastic! I've lived here 5 months and been probably 5 times already. The food is fantastic, I've ordered a few things on their menu and it's always good but I tend to eat most of my husbands pasta-it's a simple dish but it's the best pasta I've ever had. The customer service here is great too! I went to this location a week or so ago and ordered the tomato soup as an app without realizing there was goat cheese on it so I had to send it back (I'm pregnant) and the waiter was so gracious about it! We told him why and at the end I also ordered a dessert which came with flakes of brandy (or some kind of alcohol) so he warned me just in case! The prices here are also very reasonable. When I could drink the mojitos are very good! So far it's my favorite place in Charlotte and we've been to quite a few!
