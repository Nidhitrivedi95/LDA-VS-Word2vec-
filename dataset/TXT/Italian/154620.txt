l-Zjik0MbpabQPv-nNp9YQ I love everything at San Remo! The sandwiches are so good (turkey on foccacia or roast beef on focaccia are my fave). We often cater San Remo sandwiches for our family events. They are a big hit. Great rye bread and my kids love the doughnuts. It is a chaotic place on weekends because it is so popular, but that's part of the fun.
