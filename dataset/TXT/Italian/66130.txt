BMR_AsSBzTQHqW-SQabI4w Been a couple years since we've been to CPK. Knew they were having a free meal for Veterans Day so we took the opportunity to go. My husband was able to choose from 13 different items on a special Veterans Day menu. He went with the Hawaiian Pizza. Surprisingly (not!) he ate the whole thing. Said it was good. I never tried so I'm going to go with that! I was so looking forward to getting my favorite pizza of all time, the Pear and Gorgonzola. I almost cried when it wasn't on the menu!! Our waiter said it had been gone for a few months already. If the powers that be are reading this review I demand you bring that pizza back. PLEASE BRING BACK THE PEAR AND GORGONZOLA PIZZA!!!! I went with the spinach and roasted artichoke pizza instead. It was good, but not as good as the other one. It had a very, very thin and crispy crust and there was one piece of artichoke on each slice of the pizza. I would have preferred more, but that's what I got. That as well as the spinach was layered over a well thin spread of CPK's spinach artichoke dip which is one of their appetizers. I did like it though and wouldn't hesitate to reorder. For an app we went with the Avocado Club Egg Rolls. People, these are amazing. Every time I get them I think they couldn't be this good, but they are. I insist you try them. My husband is not really an avocado fan and even he thinks they are awesome!  The are stuffed with amazing goodness and deep fried in a crispy wonton. Dip these puppies in the ranchito sauce, a little bit spicy, and you have one of these best bites to go in your mouth. Love them so much!
