"Underwhelming" was the word of the day. 

-- APPETIZER: Tuscan Fries ($7)
Chipotle lime salt, tapenade aioli. It was a rather small portion with a non-existent chipotle lime salt flavour. The tapenade (olive) aioli didn't have much flavour either.

-- APPETIZER: Brussels Sprouts ($7)
Brussels sprouts, black garlic butter, pancetta, vincotto. This dish came out warm, which made me question how fresh it was. Again, the menu listed a non-existent flavour because black garlic butter was M.I.A. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Especially since I've had good Brussels Sprouts (Home of the Brave), this was a disappointment.

-- MAIN: Mafalde ai Funghi (aka Mushroom pasta, $17.50)
Portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, truffle cream sauce. This was the best thing of the night. The portion is decently sized, but it's heavy and filling. I really enjoyed it.

-- MAIN: Spinaci (aka Spinach pizza, $18)
Spinach, buffalo mozzarella, pecorino, fresh ricotta, garlic. This was a flop and again, the advertised garlic flavour was nowhere to be found. Spinach itself is not very flavourful, but even with three cheeses, the pizza fell flat. There was no kick, there was no surprise, no edge. I'd steer clear of this. 

-- DESSERT: Dolci Platter (aka all three desserts: tiramisu, budino bar, gelato, $15.50)
Of the three desserts, I liked the pistachio gelato the most despite it being rather ordinary. The tiramisu was a bit formless for me; I prefer ones that resemble more of a cake. The budino bar was like a dense brownie and I don't think it's worth its individual price of $6.50. In general, all three desserts were nothing out of the ordinary, but they were perfectly fine.

The restaurant itself is nice. Its dim and the décor has a rustic and industrial charm. If I were to nitpick, I'd say that it feels a little cramped, like there are too many tables too close together. Despite being an obvious standout, the mushroom pasta in and of itself would not be enough to convince me to visit or recommend this place. I wouldn't advise against visiting because the food was average at worst, but it's just not very special to me.
