yCstxbTqAbdBKr4jDjMGFA Went here last night. Food was good but is far too overpriced for the type of restaurant. Service was limited to a few quick interactions to take orders and bring the cheque.  

Just saw on the news this morning that a broken watermain flooded the place.  While I'll abstain from any "fresh seafood" comments they should definitely take the opportunity to update the place. I would only go back if someone else was paying as there are many better options for the cost.
