EdPpsG0GujcVefs3ANGEGA We don't usually dine out in this area, so we used Yelp to find somewhere near my friends home.  We were originally looking for a full service restaurant but took a chance on this little place in the back of a strip mall.  We were served by Amos, who was very helpful and shared the specials for the evening.  When we asked for what we must have, he recommended the Pepperoni special. Fresh basil and Mozzarella with homemade sauce and a crispy crust made this unique.  We added dinner salads and garlic knots.  

Nothing fancy, but we enjoyed the service and food.  We will be back!
