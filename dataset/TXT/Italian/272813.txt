Despite the kitchy decor, mismatched chairs and tablecloths,  the food was fantastic, and the service was attentive.  From the scallops to the rack of lamb, my family enjoyed everything that we ordered.  It's nice that all of the entrees come with garlic bread and a salad.

When I'm back in Pittsburgh, I'd definitely return.  My only concern: we were there on a  Saturday night, and the place was pretty empty.  I know it's a little off the beaten path, but I wonder how it's going to keep surviving....
