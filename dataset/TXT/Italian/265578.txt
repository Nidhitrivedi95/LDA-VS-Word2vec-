wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw Downtown Gilbert is so family friendly it can make the most diehard single guy gag. That is why it was surprising to see all the happy gilbert folks dishing out scottsdale prices for their bread covered in toppings. The food, while overpriced and smallish portions to share, is pretty decent and decent looking. I only managed to share a cheese board on the first half of an eventual failed two-tier date. The board had three cheeses of your choice and the hard cheddar was the best pick out of the brie and another one that looked like cottage cheese. The rest of the board had six small pieces of bread (half toasted, half not), a bunch of mixed nuts and good apriot jam and regular dried apricot. Not sure of the happy hour deals on food, but if you can get it half off the $15, it would be a deal.
   Basically, the place gets a good review because we were there between 11 and 5pm and all glasses of wine were five bucks. Now, that is a deal and a good way to make out with your date soon after.
