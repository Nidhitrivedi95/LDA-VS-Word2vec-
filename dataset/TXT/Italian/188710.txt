oX7lSVsg4j7-SrSZVGWVnA We were celebrating a particular school success--and payday, and the holidays--and my daughter wanted Italian. I had read the review and the website, and I recalled seeing the billboard on I-17. Some of the menu items sounded good, so we chose Babbo's over some of the other Italian places in town. Smart move!

Don't expect quiet conversation here--the atmosphere is fairly noisy, with no soft surfaces to blunt the sounds. On the other hand, after a few minutes, it just sounded like people really enjoying themselves.

Then, the waiter came to take our order, and brought us bread and a plate w/olive oil and balsamic vinegar. He was prompt and polite, and took our order without writing it down. Not something I could pull off! The wait staff, each and every server, was attentive to the diners needs throughout the room. The food came quickly, and then the rapture set in!

This is some very good food. My wife ordered a calzone, and it was the size of half a basketball! OK, maybe one of the smaller playground ball, but it was huge! The dough had puffed up above the food, but it was still quite full. My daughter had some type of Italian soda that was quite good. Her stuffed manicotti was wonderful, as was my Bowl o' Bolognese.

Highly recommended. Bravo, Babbo!
