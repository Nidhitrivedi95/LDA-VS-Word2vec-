One night in Bangkok- a little too sweet, but not terrible. Store-bought noodles. Pre-shredded carrots, etc. We ended up sharing this because my wife didn't eat her own dish. 

The Devil went down To Georgia - frozen shrimp, store-bought noodles, bland sauce. Meat and shrimp seem to not be cooked in the sauce. Overall flavorless. Left it uneaten after about 5-7 bites. Tried doctoring it with salt, pepper and hot sauce, but the patient was too far gone. 

Fun decorations and good music. Maybe a good happy hour spot, but not cutting it as a restaurant. 

Parking is difficult.  Will not be back.
