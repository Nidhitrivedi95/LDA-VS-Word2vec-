d5TMOfz_CrjKDGbIpfoVCA DC pasta is an excellent place for people who enjoy pasta and sampling.  The verdure misti salad was crisp and clean--great if you want your daily serving of vegetables, but if you're there to maximize the experience for stomach volume, you'd be better skipping salad for pasta.  Don't miss the bread, though.  Their thick, pillowy slices of Italian bread with white bean spread were scrumptious.  The highlight is the pasta.  The media option is perfect for those with smaller appetites and those who want to sample more than one variety.  After the salad and bread, the media option was plenty.  I opted for the ditalini with english peas.  I adored the subtle sweetness and creaminess from the marriage of the peas and ricotta, while the light mint butter sauce made it both savory and refreshing.  Altogether, I'd definitely visit again, if only for the opportunity to try a new pasta flavor.
