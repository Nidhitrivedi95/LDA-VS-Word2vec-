VraSwdw04w1LASF1xRBkdw I'm originally from NJ so prefer NYC-style pizza. Thin crust, big slices, lots of flavorful sauce and no skimpin' on the cheese. I've been to this place twice now and it did not disappoint! I had both a veggie pie and pepperoni, both tasty and well executed. Draught beer selection is waaaay above average, too. Be sure to ask about daily specials - they exist but on both of my visits I had to ask. Free garlic knots if you check in on Yelp & share with your server. Do it - they are Sooooo garlicky and delicious. I'll be back.
