y2SaaWClzB6Pb360V-m98w I love Driscolls! Friends of mine live close by and every time I'm out in the Pittsburgh area from California, I have to stop at Driscoll's! Last visit, we went there for dinner and it was absolutely fabulous. This time we went for lunch and it was just as good. Our waitress was amazing and we were seated by the little creek so we could look outside. I ordered the steak wrap and asked her to put grilled chicken instead of steak and I was accommodated. My boyfriend had a Cobb salad and my adopted mother had a grilled cheese and she just loved it. Everything about this luncheon was perfect. Our waitress kept checking on our drinks which is always key to me!  Driscoll's is in a very small town and the parking lot is always jammed because it is the best place around! Whenever you're in the area please stop by! In the summer months they have an ice cream joint out front and that's perfect too. Kudos to the staff at Driscoll's!
