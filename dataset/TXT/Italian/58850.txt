aqrTv6QiU0J9Sxm_T--c5g Very disappointing food, but excellent staff. We chose this restaurant because of the fairly good ratings on Yelp and it was one of the recommended restaurants from our hotel. However with all the dishes we tried (it was a party of six) only the mushroom ravioli was fine. The other dishes were bland and the sea bass was way too saucy. Given the price of the food, we expected way more than what we got. Only saving grace was that the waiter and staff are very nice.
