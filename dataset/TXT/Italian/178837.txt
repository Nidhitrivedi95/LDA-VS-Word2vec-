nS6QENxe6YODNrQ45bpC-A I had to come to the front of hard rock to get my food. The brownie was average to bad and the lasagna was bland with barely any ricotta cheese. I asked for Parmesan and red pepper and I got a packet of each. Wasn't worth ordering except they do have bottled water and I needed that lol. Don't waste your money. I'd rather have not given into my lasagna craving.
