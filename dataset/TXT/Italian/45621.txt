8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA Service was excellent, but the pizza was subpar.  Being that I'm from Chicago originally I had high hopes and standards for today's meal.  The ambiance of Amore is amazing and I was thoroughly impressed with the service.  I ordered a deep dish pizza that came out "ehhh."  To me it tastes like a pan pizza from Pizza Hut with sauce I could find at the dollar store.  It's unfortunate that the pizza wasn't better because deep down inside I Wanted to like it.

It's got a 3 out of 5 simply because I couldn't get over the lack of taste.
