6D4L8YpkhAh_YwaLmhoMNg Happy to be seated promptly on a Friday evening.  5 stars to Deb our waitress who was so pleasant, never let our drinks get low, and so quick to answer our questions.

My princess enjoyed her mac n cheese, the fettuccine was creamy, trio was huge, calamari = tasty. Spaghetti, meatballs and pomodoro were divine.

So why not a perfect rating? While we lucked out with Deb, I'm just not sure how others fared with the people helping them. Usually when we walk into or out of a restaurant, staff smile and say hi, say, "welcome to..." or acknowledge patrons in some way shape or form. Yesterday, all 4 of us were greeted with blank stares (again, except Deb).
