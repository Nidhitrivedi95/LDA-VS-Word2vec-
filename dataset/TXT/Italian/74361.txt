cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q I was at Olive Garden today and I have to say it was very pleasant, my wife and I went around 11ish and there was some customers, but waiting was no issue and wasn't to too busy, we had excellent service in my opinion, because were not at a 5 or higher rated restaurant, so I don't expect to have some waitress or waiter act like my personal butler lol and account for every little detail I need. 

Yet the atmosphere, music, food, and service was 4 stars, the 5th star would of been due to pricing, because for a beer 5 bucks is a rip off in my opinion and a glass of regular whine 11.95 is far beyond my reach when I can go out and buy a bottle, but I still felt it was a great place for myself and my wife.
