J1qzIVBt3lGpiz-8UdjhXg The Old Spaghetti Factory is a great choice for dinner espessally on Sundays because they usually have good deals that include salad and ice cream! The atmosphere is great, the server's are very nice and the food is always tastey! Almost Everytime my girlfriend and I come on Sundays, Henry always takes our orders and is a really outstanding guy! He's polite, very upbeat and is always attentive to his guests. We will always be back for more!
