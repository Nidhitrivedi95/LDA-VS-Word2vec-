Xra1TtWtf069Am5hHWs3Ug This is a small indepedent mom and pop Italian restaurant with amazing friendly service. Food is above average. Pasta selection is limited to rigatoni,fettucini or penne. Vegetable lasagna is delicious. Marsala is good. Fried beans as appetizer is passable. Desert menu is tasty. Probably one of the better single standing Italian restaurant on the west side. Saturday night that we went was surprisingly empty.  
Parking could be a problem. 
Bottom line: was there anything in this place that would make me crave to go back immediately:-NO.......or may be yes for my better half's love for veggie lasagna :-(
