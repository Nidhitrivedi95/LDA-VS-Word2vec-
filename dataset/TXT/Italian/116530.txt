GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA I just want to update you cocktail junkies on the bartender situation. I really talk up Eric Hobbie and Adam Rains in this review and owe it to them to keep you updated on their whereabouts. Eric is now at Carnevino just across the Palazzo casino from B&B and Adam Rains is at Gordon Ramsays Pub & Grill in Caesars. B&B is still a must do and Ian will treat you right at the bar but still make an effort to visit Eric and Adam.


A Vegas must do. Best Octopus on the planet and a lot of dishes you can't just find anywhere. Great service and a very knowledgeable staff especially the mixologists behind the bar.
