BHE5NJPrYy7Nr0cjki-4sw Seriously awesome.  In town for family vaca and we have a couple picky eaters.  They had something for everyone and that something was great in each case.  Great service (Eva); great atmosphere; just great all around.  Desert was awesome too.  Also, when I couldn't get a mobile signal to get Uber, Eva the waitress hooked us up with a cab within 3 minutes.
