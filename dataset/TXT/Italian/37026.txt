72_6srKAdZPSHCGNwK2Hfg The location of this restaurant is lovely as it overlooks the lake but after reading some very good reviews here, I was disappointed with my meal---I had a ho-hum corned beef sandwich and my side salad came with no dressing (when I asked about that, I was given oil and vinegar bottles to pour onto it). The others I dined with had breakfast items that they seemed quite happy with so my advice would be stick to those items (and perhaps Italian dishes) if you go. The prices are very reasonable and the service was friendly so I may try again.
