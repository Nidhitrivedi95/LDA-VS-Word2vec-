DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA Last weekend when my best friend and I were trying to decide where to eat I suggested ABC Bistro, and she looked it up online and told me about some of the crazy reviews.  I was surprised, but I convinced her to try it anyway, and she ended up loving it.  She said she'll definitely come back, but she wouldn't have wanted to go there in the first place based on the negative reviews.  That's why I thought I should write a review myself, though I normally never take the time to write reviews of restaurants.  This is actually my first time.  

Anyway, I have eaten at this place with different people on four occasions now, and each time, the food has been fantastic.  The pizza crust is so delicious you will dream about it at night.  The pastas and appetizers I have tried have also been great across the board.  

I found the owner to be very friendly, and he even offered to put our leftovers in the fridge for us on a couple of occasions while we went to see a movie across the way.  

So, I hope people will give this place a chance despite some of the negative reviews out there.  It really is a charming place with excellent food.
