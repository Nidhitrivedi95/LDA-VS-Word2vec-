O5vXNIody0SMddowzrAMXQ Terrible customer service!! I came inside and ordered a large pizza and an order of wings. After waiting for 30 minutes, they hand me a dinner box with pizza, bread sticks, cinnamon sticks, etc. I say this isn't my order. The cashier tells some ridiculous story about how the cash register sometimes changes orders, which made no sense. 

The manager approaches me with an attitude like I was in the wrong and says well you will have to wait 30 more minutes for us to make the pizza you ordered. No apology or anything. This will be my first & last time coming to this Pizza Hut.
