Tried to take my parents in town from Oklahoma to enjoy a super early dinner (5:15pm) on a Friday night but were turned away.  We were greeted without a smile - "do you have a reservation?".  I scanned the huge dining area to see maybe 12 folks seated of their just about 300 person dining capacity.  "No, we do not but hoping you can fit us in".  After 2 other ladies joined the stand and conferred, I was told the wait would be 30 to 45 minutes because they are completely booked up and just waiting on people to show.  Not offered a seat at the bar to wait.  Just a good ol' fashioned No.  I asked why 30 minutes since I doubted all the people about to show up would be cleared out in 20 minutes or less?  Why not just let us sit at one of those tables that are kept back by the bathroom for just in case situations...or as a hedge assuming one of the 60 (give or take) tables that apparently were fully reserved would not show up...she was super confused and told me "I dunno".

My message to the fantastic restaurant manager at Ilios Noche off Providence - You lost a very long time patron due to the absolute easiest thing to get right.  Your food is amazing, wait staff is always on, wine list is well put together and very reasonable, but....the folks at the front of the house were both cold and irrational.  Good luck.
