KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ First of all we went in and they were rude. We ordered the waitress was horrible. We received our salads and it took them 50 minutes to get our food. Everyone around us received their food before us when we arrived before them. The food was horrible. My seven yr old could make a better dish....for the price we paid...the 4 of agreed we should have gone to subway and had more of a quality dining experience,,, 190 tab for four people. ..horrible horrible!!!!!!!
