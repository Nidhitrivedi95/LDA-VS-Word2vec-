JlkHGjgS3MJ5FqEDJdu8xQ I am never one to embrace chain restaurants, but I gave this one a shot per my friend's request.  I started my meal with a side salad that was doused in dressing and not that fresh (so if you're going to come here...definitely get dressing on the side), but it wasn't so bad. Then came my pasta...I made sure to state twice while ordering that I didn't want chicken in the Pasta Woozie, and what did I get? Chicken. After a few minutes (a suspiciously short time actually) a fresh plate sans-chicken was delivered to me.  My waitress never apologized, but when she came back over, I asked for some parmesan cheese.  That was the last I saw of the waitress until our check was delivered.  The dish itself was nothing special-- not a very rich sauce, boring shrimp, and not a very large serving.  For the price and mediocre service, there are plenty of better places you can go.
