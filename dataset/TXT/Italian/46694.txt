8R6VkHg7pNvW0mW2_KjDDg The service at Brio is a crapshoot. We like the food, and the atmosphere, but we have gotten more than one free meal or appetizer here as compensation for the poor service.

Once the waiter took 10 minutes or so to bring back the check and our credit card and the manager came out and took care of our bill (free food yay!), another time they spilled wine all over someone in our party, and the manager arranged for free drycleaning and 3 free appetizers. This isn't just us, I have quite a few friends who have also gotten free meals, desserts, or drinks at the hands of poor servers. I should mention that the servers are always very friendly and gregarious, it's just that they are not always efficient and adept at handling large trays.

I like the food enough that I never really mind going and seeing if we get bad enough service that something is free. It's actually kind of fun. The food here is a little pricey, and the appetizers used to be huge but they have scaled back a bit. This is supposedly an Italian steakhouse, and the steaks are very good, the pasta selections are good but not perfect (for example I don't think they have  fettucini alfredo on the menu, and their lasagna is a little bland). The desserts are typical fare. Salads are excellent if a bit small.

I do like the decor, and on a nice night it's always fun to eat outside. I definitely plan to return.
