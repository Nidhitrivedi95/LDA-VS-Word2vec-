hcHaWzM5wfdAbCWs4zmmqg The place has a nice vibe and the staff were friendly.  The food we ordered was not very good. The Tuna nicoise-style salad ($16) had a lovely presentation but lacked flavour.  The Margherita-style pizza ($12) and excessively salty with the salt overwhelming the tomato flavour.  There were only 3 small basil leaves clumped together on the large surface.  For some reason the waiter recommended this pizza over the gnocchi.  I really wish I had selected the gnocchi or anything else for that matter.  The name of the appetizer we ordered escapes my mind.  It was these pillowy dough things filled with a cream like cheese.  It was probably the best choice of the night  although the prosciutto had a weird taste like it was imbibed with other foods from the refrigerator.

Questions I should have  asked:
- why did you leave us a small dish of very salty beans on the table with an accompanying small empty dish?  Even if we eat the small salty beans there is nothing to discard.
- why tell me this horrible cheap pizza was good?  It doesn't compare to a good Margherita.  Just tell me what is actually good.  I want to eat the good thing.
-why is there no pepper? on the table or freshly ground by the waiter.  I would take either.
- Is there supposed to be a complementary bread basket?  It looked like most tables had a basket of bread except for ours.
