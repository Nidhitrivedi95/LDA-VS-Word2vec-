72_6srKAdZPSHCGNwK2Hfg I have been coming here for years and definitely would have to say this is one of the places you have to eat at.

Great views of the city and the lake.  Everything I have ordered here, I LOVED!  We decided to order in last night and ordering healthy and delicious was our choice so we chose Eden.  Ordered a grilled chicken dinner with roasted potatoes and roasted vegetables and a chicken parmigiana with roasted potatoes and roasted vegetables as well as a regular size cesar salad.  Got a side of French bread with our meal (warm).

Both meals were delicious.  Cesar salad could use a bit more parmesan and dressing.  Bread was amazing.  My boyfriend doesn't eat bread and finished the entire loaf (although small loaf).  

First time we went there, there was a really long wait and he wasn't interested in waiting.  After a bit of convincing, we stayed and had a great dinner.  But I think it kind of put a sour taste in his mouth having to wait so long.  After ordering in last night, he might be a fan now. Everything was cooked to perfection and now is one of his fav places to order in from. YEYYYYY FINALLY got him hooked on Eden!
