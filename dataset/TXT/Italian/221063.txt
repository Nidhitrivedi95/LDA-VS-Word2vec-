SEH79jbg5Q8cCozCnhqMHA The carpaccio di manzo was OK but I felt that the carpaccio was over powered by the arugola. This was followed by the fagottino di pollo. I have never had chicken that was so tough that it was hard to cut with a knife. It was quite the disappointment for what I was anticipating to be a wonderful experience. We cut our losses after that and ended the night elsewhere.
