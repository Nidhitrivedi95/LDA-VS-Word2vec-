RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ Finally an Italian restaurant that's almost as good as my kitchen. Re-design of this space is open, a little more casual (could have done without the TV's in the bar area) and the food is good. Service was great. A little over pour on the balsamic in the olive oil for the bread but that was fixable. Only complaint is that they need to kick the seasonings in the pasta up a bit. The signature Vodka sauce is wonderful but could use some red pepper flakes. The Vongole could use more garlic. They did get the pasta al dente which a lot of places totally fail on. Veal chop was stellar. Whoever wrote the menu needs a little lesson in Italian...don't use the word "gravy"....use sauce!
