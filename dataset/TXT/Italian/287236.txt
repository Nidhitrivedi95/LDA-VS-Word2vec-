ZKklfxHUlL8_xReUyZfSUQ I ordered their bruschetta and fried calamari as an appetizer (opposed to many other options which were equally if not more appealing). They turned out to be absolutely phenomenal. I then ordered their lobster risotto which absolutely blew my mind. The server I had was so welcoming, and polite. I would definitely recommend this restaurant! Loved it
