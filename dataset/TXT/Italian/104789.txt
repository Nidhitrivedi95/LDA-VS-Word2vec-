fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ I have to agree with some of the comments here. My wife and I were unimpressed with this restaurant from the start. We arrived during the lull period between lunch and dinner and stood at the host stand for a few minutes with no response despite servers in the room. As we were about to leave a girl came in that was clearly getting ready to start her shift and sat us despite not being in uniform. Strike one. 

Our server took a few minutes to get to us for the first time and pushed the appetizer special pretty hard despite us not being interested in having one. After that it took over five minutes to get our drinks - a water and a Coke - despite having enough time to walk in the kitchen, back out, drop off bread, pick up dirty dishes from another table, then back into the kitchen. Strike two, although the rosemary bread is rather good. 

We decided to get some side items before the meal since we were a little hungry. I ordered a bowl of soup and my wife got a side Caesar salad that we requested before the entrees. The salad was pretty dry, requiring her to order a side of dressing from the manager that was walking around since the server didn't follow up. My soup portion was extremely small - one layer and almost no broth. Unacceptable for a five dollar bowl. Strike three. 

At this point we had maybe a few bites down and the entrees came out. I had the chicken marsala which was about average, though not as tender as it should be. She had fettuccine alfredo with chicken, also average. The portion size for both meals was about normal. 

Overall our experience was very subpar, despite the friendly nature of all staff members we encountered. I can't recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for anything more than an average chain Italian experience.
