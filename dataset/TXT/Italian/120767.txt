h96UFhWMM6k2xGgvmMoszg Prior to me coming here, I would pass this place and scoff at their sidewalk board sign that claimed they served the "best breakfast burrito in downtown Phoenix". I mean seriously, it's an italian restaurant, so, why would they serve breakfast burritos?! Ok, I admit it, I was wrong and Focaccia Fiorentina's right they do serve the best breakfast burritos downtown. Get yourself the Twin Classic which are two burritos for $5. You get a choice of ham or bacon. The burrito isn't large but one burrito is satisfying enough but eating two wouldn't make you look greedy rather you'd be quite full, and could skip lunch. I usually get the Twin Classic with egg whites (no extra charge), I add spinach (dollar extra), no potatoes, and I get it with ham. The bacon is okay but the ham is yummy. Don't get there 15 minutes before 10:30 since they close up breakfast despite their sign saying they serve breakfast until 10:30 (it's a fib), anytime before that is fine and depending on the day expect a line because they're that good. Oh and avoid the coffee, One Coffee is across the street and worth it moreso than their pedestrian coffee that's no better than what's made in an office break room. Oh and the green salsa is worth it!
