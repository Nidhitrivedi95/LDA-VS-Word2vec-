DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw I do enjoy Farraro's. I like the location, I like the food, and I like the service. However, with such a huge influx of Italian options in Las Vegas, not to mention the countless celebrity chef Italian options on the strip - I think the menu prices are a little outrageous . We use to go in almost weekly for 50% off for locals, but they recently reduced this to 25% which has now lured us elsewhere.
