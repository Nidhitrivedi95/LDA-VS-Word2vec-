By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g We had a delicious dinner here! As a native New Yorker with every restaurant at my finger tips I have high standards and DOCG exceeded them! I had the branzino which was probably the best branzino I've ever had. My boyfriend had the filet which was also delicious. Service was extremely efficient and everyone was very kind. I also appreciated that this wasn't the kind of restaurant where you pay $40 for a tiny entree. You get your money's worth portion-wise.
