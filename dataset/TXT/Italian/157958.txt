They have a lot of good savory crepe options and the grilled chicken and mushroom is my favorite. I've also tried the Spicy Sriracha Steak and it's also great! Of course their Sweet crepes are good too but sometimes inconsistent on the fruit filling.

If you happen to be in downtown or looking for a food a delivery, this is a must try and I definitely recommend this place.
