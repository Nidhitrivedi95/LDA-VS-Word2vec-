LWcn5_F8c5iDLvVCootw3A Not really worth the stop to be honest. Been a few times.  Pizza is hit or miss, but usually a miss.  Service?  Always a miss.  Best bet is to go with a pasta dish and prepare to wait... A long time.  But the pasta dishes are good and the Ceasar salad is very good. If they can get some actual flavor on their pizzas and fix the awful service..it might be worth it. But I'm not going to hold my breath.
