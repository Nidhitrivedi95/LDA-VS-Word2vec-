A7waf6G3cvnLfAqKeLL8DA This was my first time at Buca, but it won't be my last. Overall, a great meal and experience.

To start, the place is hard to find. I felt like an idiot wandering down the little alleyway trying to find the entrance. But once inside, it is lovely: decorated simply and comfortably, it has a spacious feel without being pretentious. 

Service was excellent throughout the night. We were a bit picky about tables and temperature, first asking to be in a corner or side, then asking to move because it was a bit warm, and finally asking to turn off the forced air as we were chilly. The hostess and waiter were very kind and accommodating. Our waiter was very "present" without hovering, and ne'er was the water glass empty nor we without attention. He presented the daily menu, and then did an exceptional job of explaining almost every dish when I asked for his recommendations. Cocktail orders were taken promptly, and while they weren't the *best* drinks I've had, they were well made and arrived quickly.

Our waiter suggested an appetizer each (hot or cold) and sharing mains and sides, which was wise as portions were on the smaller side. To start, we had the cold "sea bream" and tuna paté appetizers. The tuna was unusual and creative; good but not amazing. The sea bream was fantastic: light and fresh, and very flavourful. For mains, we each had a homemade pasta. Mine was agnolotti stuffed with rabbit and cheese (marscapone?) and it was rich and salty and delicious. We also shared the cauliflower "carbonara" which was a bit salty but also scrumptious. Upon request, our waiter recommended wines by the glass that paired perfectly with each meal. 

All in all, it was a bit pricey but not exceptionally so, and the entire experience was lovely and enjoyable. Will definitely be back and would recommend...
