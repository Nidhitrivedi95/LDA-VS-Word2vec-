E9b73ETPw0VYUJ2_YSJJdQ This place was absolutely fantastic! My mother and I went there for a girls night out, and everything from the service to the food was amazing! We were served so well, and felt so welcomed by the staff. They have a must-try, delicious appetizer- grilled vegetable and goat cheese. It is a baked phyllo pastry filled with goat cheese topped grilled zucchini,eggplant & sweet pepper! We shared 2 scrumptious pizzas. We ended the meal with a NUTELLA PIZZA!! Such an amazing night, we would most definitely go again!
