G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q We went to Giada for a nice birthday dinner. 

The first thing you notice when walking in, is the environment is intriguing. By that, I mean there are so many things to look at. From the fresh pasta being made to the decorations, the environment can be a little intoxicating (in a good way) 

The food was amazing! We got the cheese, the bucatini, and the veal chop. As well as a bottle of sparkling. The sommelier was great! I can't remember his name off the top of my head, but he was very willing to chat with us about the winery where our wine came from, and spent a good amount of time with us. Our glasses were never empty. Whether it was the server or sommelier, both were very attentive. The desserts were incredible. The ricotta cake was a delightful surprise, and the lemon cookies were addictive. 

Our service was top notch. Our server was Rocco. As an italian, he fits in perfectly at Giada. However, his service was absolutely incredible. I highly recommend asking for him if you make a reservation at Giada. I believe service is the key to a great restaurant, and here, Rocco makes this experience and restaurant absolutely amazing. 

I highly recommend Giada, and Rocco as your server.
