_Kp1IPTi17wBywYOd30raA Utterly disgusting. I was stranded in Pittsburgh thanks to Delta and booked a hotel up the street from this Pizza (the) Hutt. Since I didn't have a car and University Blvd's sidewalks were covered in snow, I figured I'd walk next door and get some pizza. Ordered a Meat Lover's of sorts and it was just disgusting. Covered in BBQ sauce, not cooked all the way through, soggy and mushy. Really disappointed. I should have walked the extra steps to Primanti's.
