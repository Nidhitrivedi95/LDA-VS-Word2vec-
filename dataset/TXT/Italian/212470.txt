r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA Great sandwich shop with a couple dozen sandwich options and awesome deli. Well worth The visit. I had half a meatball sub and half a steak and cheese with mushrooms onions and peppers. I got 2 halfs instead of a full sandwich because I couldn't decide between the two. I could only eat half of each of the halfs. And then for dessert I had a chocolate covered cannoli. It's a fun ambience with tables spread around the Italian deli. Looks like a great place to shop for meats and cheeses as well and they also have a lot of Italian related ingredients. I look forward to coming back soon ( but unfortunately don't live around town ) and trying a few of the other sandwiches - it was hard to choose so many look so good and the meats were so fresh.
