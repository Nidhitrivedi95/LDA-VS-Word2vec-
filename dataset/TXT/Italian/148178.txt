kdA5JlSuysSCsphCWpoqpg Best pizza in my area.  It's always our go to when we have family over and need a quick meal.  Their prices for half and full sheet pizzas are really good.  The quality of the pizza is excellent.  The owner works in the shop, answers the phone, etc.  The only knock against them is that their delivery time (45-60 min) is a little long, but I just order earlier, and it's worth the wait.
