0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q I don't know Yelpers, $550 for 8 of us with tax & tip. I'm serious. Half of us had soft drinks, half had one glass wine, a few two. We shared apps. I mean come on, it's just spaghetti and pizza and salad.  Nothing at all spectacular about the food or place except the prices. You are certainly not paying for a view of the convention area hallway off the buffet. Our main server (Marie? Maria?) was absolutely excellent...friendly and professional.
My brother and I split the $10 side of Caesar Salad. It could have fit in a double shot glass.
