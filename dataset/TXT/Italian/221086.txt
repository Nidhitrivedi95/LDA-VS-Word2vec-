SEH79jbg5Q8cCozCnhqMHA Restaurant Week Fall 2015

Terry T and I went here with non-Yelper Julie on Monday, Sept. 21 and had a truly outrageous meal. Everything we ordered was split between the three of us.

We started out splitting the mozzarella and prosciutto, polenta al funghi and scallops con pesto. I ate them in that order, because I knew--while all should be delicious--the scallops would be amazing. And they were, on all accounts. The mozzarella was fresh, served with roasted red peppers and fresh tomato; grilled polenta fries surrounded perfectly sautéed mushrooms; and the scallops were perfectly cooked and rested in the best pesto I've had in my life!

Next course: ravioli del giorno, gnocchi Sorrentina, and filettino al tartufo. Same eating pattern applied here. Three huge (like, the size of my hand) raviolis stuffed with spinach and ricotta [if I'm remembering right] and a brown butter sauce were easily split between our group. The brown butter sauce was a bit understated, but otherwise was a really good dish. The gnocchi--dang, I love gnocchi--were tender and cradled in a delicate tomato sauce. I'm generally not a huge red sauce fan but this was executed wonderfully. Finally, the medium-rare grilled filet was mouth-watering and the Barolo reduction was decadent.

Wrapping up our meal, we ordered two servings of tiramisu and one panna cotta. In hindsight, we'd probably order two panna cotta if we were able to do it again. Not that the tiramisu was divine; it's just we had a harder time sharing the panna cotta. Both were fantastic, I assure you.

We also checked out there non-Restaurant Week offerings and will be heading back for those.
