pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Dined there for Valentine's Day . I understand Valentine's Day is a big dining out holiday but we had a show and they were already a half hour late for our reservation so we dined at the bar , which we would have clearly rather sat down and had a nice dinner but we were time crunched , and they were late . The manager thanked us but that was it . Our experience was not exceptional in any way and the manager was giving out free champagne to a lot of other people who they were also clearly running late on there reservations but we got nothing . We didn't even have time to have dessert because the food took so long . We had to ask them to bring us bread even though it seemed like everyone else just got some . It was just frustrating when you decide to spend a special day at a restaurant and receive just a bad experience all together .
