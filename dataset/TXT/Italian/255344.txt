VYLQ3bMCqmHiNO2FS8aAsg I would like to start off by saying I have been to NYC many times. This is not "New York style" pizza IMO.

We ordered spaghetti and meatballs which was mediocre at best, cheeses sticks that were average,  and a large pizza that was OK. 

If you really are looking for NY style pizza....Casanova Brothers pizza is fantastic and is the closest I've found in this area so far.
