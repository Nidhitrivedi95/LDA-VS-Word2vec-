g6AFW-zY0wDvBl9U82g4zg Love this place - it's has the best latte in the area. So far I've tried the latte, coffee, cookies and pizza there. All were very good - except the coffee that I personally found to be watery in taste. Sticking to my latte next time!!! 

Have to thank @grasshoppereats for this great recommendation on her social media, as I would have never know about this cafe otherwise as it is hidden in a office/commercial-like building. The owner is always there, and juggling all the orders, super efficient and always asks how things are.

Looking forward to trying the pasta next time. It will be my 4th visit by then! :)
