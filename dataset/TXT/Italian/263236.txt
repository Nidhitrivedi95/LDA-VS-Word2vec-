wWDNwNb6ygJorKujOuifhA I had absolutely no expectations going here because of the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure who to believe. But because a friend recommended this place and last night my dad was craving pizza and we live nearby, we decided to make the walk to try Forno. Now it could have gone either way. But thank goodness we had an amazing experience here. And I know this because my parents just came back from a trip to Italy and decided it was comparable to authentic Italian food so great job, Forno! We came on a Friday afternoon after work, my parents, husband and I. The owner (I have learned from reviews is Roberto), sat us within seconds then went right into suggesting what we should start with which I didn't mind at all. The mozzarella (something) burata (on the specials menu) with sautéed spinach and heirloom tomatoes was the perfect start. The pizza (we got the 301) was so good and  the sauce the most amazing flavor and acidity was perfect. The homemade gnocchi was by far my favorite, I could eat that dish all day. We ended with the panna cotta and I was surely pleased. The appetizer, pizza, gnocchi, and dessert was the perfect portion for the 4 of us (and we are big eaters). I hope our next experience is just as lovely as this one was.
