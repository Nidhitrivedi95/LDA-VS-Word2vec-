Tf13Wexrt6WmNw-CDW5Gyg I don't understand all the negative reviews - the meatballs at this place were delicious, service was quick, and the price for dinner was a great bargain!  I came here with a couple of girlfriends and were immediately seated. The restaurant looks like the love child of a high-end diner and a cowboy dance parlor, and its servers looked more like tattoo artists bordering on a gothic-chic look. Despite appearances, service was fast and friendly.

We each ordered a meatball dish. They have a pretty good selection of meatballs from different kinds of meat - beef, pork, turkey, and chicken. There is also a vegetarian option. For those who aren't in the mood for meatballs, they also offer several types of salad. You get to choose which type of sauce to go with your meatball entree. To my surprise, none of the meatball dishes came with any carb. So I ordered one meatball dish with an additional side of their risotto of the day (zucchini). The meatball special was a southwestern chicken meatball with jack cheese; it came with a good amount of spice and was tender and tasty. The risotto was also deliciously al dente. During dinner, the servers came several times to fill up our water. My friends also enjoyed their meal, and among the three of us, the total for dinner came to a whopping $35 + tips! That is one great value for your meal! I would definitely come back and try more of their meatball selections.
