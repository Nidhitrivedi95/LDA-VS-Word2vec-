BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA My wife and I tried this place out because it is very close to our home. We had a 30 minute wait which is normal for a Friday night. The mussels where very fresh and the sauce had great flavor. I had the veal piccata and it was ok. The veal was not as tender and the sauce lacked any lemon flavor. I must say it is very loud inside. Next time will try sitting on the patio. I have hear the calamari is excellent! Will try it next time. Our server never told me her name and the service overall was just ok.
