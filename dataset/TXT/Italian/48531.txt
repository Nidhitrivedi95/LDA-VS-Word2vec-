98V9R-7YT20KmcmJyMiJmg Upon entering and being seated, a huge waft of stinky odour hit my face (smelled like poop or something)... The whole time I kept asking what is that smell? I thought maybe it was their wooden furniture or flooring... but it couldn't be. It bothered me throughout the night and really just interefered with my whole dining experience. I was still guessing what that smell could be... a friend suggested it might be their parmesan cheese. But I've never come across this problem at any other Italian restaurant. Now reading another Yelper that this is indeed from the wooden flooring just changes my whole mind about the experience altogether. That is just absolutely disgusting that they kept the old flooring...who knows what mystery lies underneath it all.

I ordered off the summerlicious dinner menu for a fix price of 25$. It came with a choice of appetizer, entree, and dessert. Dinner rolls were complimentary. I got the Insalata Caprese (appetizer), Pasta Stefano (beef entree), Ice cream with Ontario berries. I would have to say the salad was my favourite part of the meal. The entree was huge but not amazing; I found that the beef tasted too dark/strong. I couldn't finish mine sadly... the food was not bad, but with the smell in the whole restaurant was making it hard as well. I would have to say that service is on the slow side... took forever to have our meals as well as dessert.
