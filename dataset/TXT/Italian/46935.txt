8un5h1h8NXs0hzeVraaPbA I am going to say yes, this was a 5 star experiance. The place has been here for many years now. They started good, went down, came back up ,and now they are great!
Yes Olive Garden has really improved a lot. I like the way they have decorated the place, all of them seemed to have a make over.
They have a great selection of wines, and the menu has all changed again.
One thing that is quite different than other places. Is they give you unless salad, and endless Soup, You can even trade the soup out. By having one bowl of one kind of the soup, then you can have another bowl of completely different flavor of soup.
All for the same charge,it comes with your meal.
You could never say you left here hungry.

The food is really good now. as well as the soup. I liked them all. The salad has a lot of dark green leaf veg which is another plus.
It is a really great time out. The staff is great,the food great, and the place is clean and even the restrooms.
Lots of parking in the lot as well.
