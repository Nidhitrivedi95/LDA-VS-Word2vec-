JTKzGJvIK9yuoUf-erV2qQ We order banana pepper wraps because the menu didn't say anything about containing meat. They looked delicious and were stuffed with sausage. The staff were great and so understanding of us not eating meat for lent! We ending up getting some pasta and a tomato wrap instead! Both were delicious!! They also had a special where if you bought a sam Adams draft you got a free glass. Great people, good food, and lots of beer opinions. Can't wait to comeback after lent and try some of their other food!!
