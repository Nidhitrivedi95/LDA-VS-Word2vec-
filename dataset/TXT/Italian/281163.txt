ySIsBnsZpcvmBoCOkjWruw This pizza hut is the worst I decided to give this location a try since the other pizza hut down the street always has issues. I picked up my pizza checked them it had so many toppings on there it was a mess. All I ordered was a pepperoni pizza. The cashier told me the website messed up my order. Smh. Then I guess what appeared to be a manager came over and said that I would have to wait on some more pizza. no type of apology or anything I just waited. Finally got my pizza the toppings were so skimpy I only had about 10 pepperonis on the whole pizza. Never again.
