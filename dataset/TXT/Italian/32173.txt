5sTFevXhGx01eLT4wF7Urg I frequently go to Scottsdale Quarter for shopping (love the Apple Store and Carol's Couture) and sometimes the iPic theatre...but I had never been to Tanzy until I was invited for a date with someone I met online.  The evening was fabulous...and not just the date!  They prepare mozzarella tableside...yum.  The wine cellar is excellent.  By the end of the evening we were no longer sitting across from each other...we were sharing the same side of the booth.  I loved this place... Great restaurant and great date!
