XxmziAeRqMKwsDjyyjVgeg I honestly can't get over how much I loved the salad here. It was some of the best vinaigrette dressing I have ever had, period. Also the bread and olive oil was especially tasty. Stuffed banana peppers were something unique as an appetizer. Not earth shattering, but solid nontheless. The ricotta noodles were good. The ravioli was actually very good. The sausage was better than the meatball, but both were definitely above average. The ambiance was quirky and weird. Service was friendly enough, but definitely slow. Prices were good (at least for someone from Miami). I would definitely recommend giving this place a shot.
