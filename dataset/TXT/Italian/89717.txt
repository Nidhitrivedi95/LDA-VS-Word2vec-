E0ZBxYiCbmkTe3W0CxxEbw Really like this place! Good food, great price and lovely staff. I loved that they start you off with warm fresh bread and loads of butter and our waitress was very lovely and attentive. I ordered the clam pasta with rose sauce which came up to $18 including tip and tax. Although the noodles weren't hand made, the sauce was yummy and they did not skimp on the clams! My boyfriend ordered the manicotti and there was sooooooo much cheese it was delicious! The portions are huge! Only 1 person in our group of 6 finished their meal, everyone else had to take a doggie bag!
