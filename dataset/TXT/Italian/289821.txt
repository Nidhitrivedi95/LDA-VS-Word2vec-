zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA We have been going to this place for years...way back when it was Llonghitano's.  

I enjoy the family owned aspect.  They have done many improvements to the interior as well as the menu over the years.  It is a solid meal, cosy environment, and a decent value.

 Room for Improvement:
- add some homemade blue cheese dressing to the menu 
- when they employed some Scottsdale culinary peeps in the kitchen the menu had a few more faves, but I still enjoy it (miss the gnocchi and pork chop, a lot!)
- wait staff is usually good, but can be stretched during prime dining hours.
