JlkHGjgS3MJ5FqEDJdu8xQ Bravo is a pretty decent Italian place with the exception that they portions are small and the prices are a bit high. The taste / quality of this food is very comparable to an Olive Garden; but, it is 50% more expensive. If you are looking for good, quality Italian food at a reasonable price, stick to OG. This place will not knock your socks off but will leave a significant dent in your wallet!
