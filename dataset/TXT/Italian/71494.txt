c8DsYusKjQYUxnTj9BtVvA We went to this restaurant being one of the first ones in the restaurant, and ended up being almost one of the last people to leave. The waiters were super patient with us despite being very indecisive on our orders. We started off with beer (of course) and appetizer that had bits and pieces of everything luckily the waiter informed how large the portions were, and we ordered it for 1 person and it was decent. For the entree we ordered the fussili con polo, and the was very light and delicious. Despite it being an Italian restaurant and carbonara was not on the menu, the waiter requested the kitchen to do a special order for us. And that satisfied the craving for it. The servings were huge that we only finished half of both pastas.  Lastly for dessert, we shared a cheesecake and it was quite decent. Although we could not finish it. All in all it was a great restaurant, and the atmosphere and environment was really good. A lot of people had birthday gatherings that night as well, so great for parties.
