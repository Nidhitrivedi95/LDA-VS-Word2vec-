eHLUQ2W_hXx61NmiL9kSVg Fool me once.........I've tried this place twice and both times the service has been sooooooo...slow.

This time we sat at the bar on a Sunday afternoon to grab a bite to eat and have a beer as we just got back in town.  The bartender thought he was on top of it but service was slow.  He used profanity in his conversation with children in the room.  He was giving out free drinks to some of the patrons.  
The temperture was hotter in the bar than outside.  Took us a long time to get our check though the barkeep was standing in front of us the whole time and seemed not be able to multi-task.

In summary....slow, sweaty, and unsatisfactory!
