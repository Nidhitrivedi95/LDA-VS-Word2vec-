v2xh5qtrlRJSU3OnixJH2g I have been wanting to try this place for a while. Today after doing some shopping at Target across the way, I decided to pick up lunch from here and take it to go.

The build your own pasta concept is nice, especially for picky eaters such as myself. Choose your pasta, sauce, cheese and toppings, and you're good to go! The cashier asked me if I wanted to do the lunch special, which was the build your own pasta, plus Focaccia bread and soup or salad, starting at $6.99. Sounded like a good deal, so I went with it. Ordered the Rigatoni with Alfredo, Parmesan and Chicken. Also decided to get a Macaroon. I was disappointed that they didn't have Cookies and Cream, but ordered the Chocolate Caramel one. After that, I waited about 10 minutes for my order. Its cool that they make everything only when ordered and from scratch. 

Got home, took a few bites and was disappointed. The rigatoni was alright, some of it could have been cooked a bit longer. The chicken was juicy and nicely shredded. But, the Alfredo sauce was just horrible because it was watery and lacked flavor. I'm sorry, but if the sauce isn't good, that pretty much ruins the entire pasta dish. I mixed in the entire packet of salt, which barely helped out. Every bite went like this - pick up pasta and chicken with fork, hold it until the sauce stopped dripping, then eat. I ended up eating only half of it. The Focaccia bread was alright, but I have definitely had better. Didn't try the salad because there was too much food. The macaroon was pretty good. Tasted fresh and not too sweet. However, they are very tiny. I don't think $1.50 is a fair price tag for it. If they are going to charge that much, they should be bigger. $0.75 would be good price for them, LOL.

They really need to work on improving the taste of their food. Then, maybe I'll think about coming back again.
