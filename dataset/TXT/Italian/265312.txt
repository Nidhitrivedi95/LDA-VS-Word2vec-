wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw BRUSCHETTA! Whatever you do here, get the bruschetta. In fact, that's all we got! 

Stopped in around 3 after our flight, being slightly hungry but not wanting to spoil our dinner. We also ordered cucumber lemonade ... Soooo good and refreshing. The outside area is fabulous. The waitstaff is pleasant and attentive. Huge fan of this place. If I lived in the area I would visit frequently.
