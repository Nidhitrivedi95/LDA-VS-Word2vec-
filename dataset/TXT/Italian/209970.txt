qUWqjjjfpB2-4P3He5rsKw I love trying new places to eat and am totally excited to see a Levetto pop up in the area.  A fast Italian restaurant in Chinatown! What more could you want?

Naturally I had to go try it as soon as I saw it open.  The location although it was small in term of seating was very nice.  I like the decor and design on the wall.  The service was quick and friendly. They brought us water immediately and took our order.  The owner came over to check on us and make sure we had a great time. 

We had the rigatoni with braised beef.  You could tell the pasta was made fresh which is a real highlight of levetto in general. the beef was tender was a nice balance with the sauce.  We also had the Trecce which was very flavourful for a lighter option.  Everyone really enjoyed it as well.  But the real reason I was there was to try something you can't get anywhere else and that is the Peking Duck pizza!  I'm hesitant of places that use other sauces other than tomato sauce, like cream sauce or a BBQ sauce because I find the flavour often over powering.  But the hoisin sauce they used was PERFECT! Cucumber and chives with the duck made it feel authentic to the traditional dish.  The crispy skin flavour was the best part bringing the whole pizza together.  If you are going here you have to try it. I wanted more but we ordered so much I thought better to leave it til my next visit.

The price was great for the service and quality of food.

With that being said we will definitely be back!
