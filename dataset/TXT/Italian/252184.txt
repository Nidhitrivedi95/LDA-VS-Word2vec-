VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w One of the best on the Vegas Strip... Kobe Meatballs, Veal Parmesan and the Ricotta Cavetelli were the most outstanding!  Also check out the Peanut Butter chocolate layer cake.. out of this world and can feed a table of 8.  Great atmosphere too. There is a lot of competition, but this one you will not be sorry for if you are looking for not your average everyday Italian restaurant.
