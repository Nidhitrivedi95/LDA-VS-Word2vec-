aNYunG3j5zNJ4F0dQcZMyQ This was my absolute first time at Tomaso's. What an experience!  From the moment I walked in I was greeted very pleasantly by the hostess and three staff members. 

Staff were extremely knowledgeable of the wines as well as the menu items. Some spoke very heavy Italian...I don't; but it didn't pose a problem. After my arrival, the place filled quickly; ranging from couples to eight member parties. Noise was at a minimal.

I began my dining experience by having a glass of resieling as I admired  the artwork, lighting, furniture, etc. and soaked up my surroundings. I noticed that every occupied table had a bottle of wine on it... except mine.

Meal options: I chose to start with the Fiori di Zucca - stuffed zucchini blossom with organic ricotta, basil & mozzarella. Talk about a treat for your palate! For an entree, I chose the Menage a Trois -  lobster, scallops, and shrimp in a savory fresh tomato sauce, olives & basil; served on linguine. Yum. Yum!  Everything was on point and served in a timely fashion.

I was please with the entire experience. I recommend Tomaso's for special occasions or for those that missing true authentic Italian food.
