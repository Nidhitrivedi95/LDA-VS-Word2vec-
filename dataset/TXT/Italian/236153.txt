Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA The pepperoni pizza is good but the crust is the scene stealer here!  If it wasn't for the crust, I would have rated it a 3 for "meh" just for the pepperoni.   The next time, I will try one of their specialty pizzas to see if its more creative and flavorful.  Until next time...
