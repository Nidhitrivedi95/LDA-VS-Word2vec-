0s1DqJlSSgR1Ftg9Q_HEOg Love this place been coming here since I moved here 16 years ago. Everytime I come in Enzo already knows my order. I like my pizza thin and crispy and he always makes it great, I'm super picky about chicken wings and they are great! The sause is awesome and they're always cooked perfect. Don't even get me started on the garlic knots they're so addicting!! I always get the special Large pizza with 10 wings and 12 knots for $23 great deal!
I read some previous negative posts and couldn't believe it. The whole family is so nice Margaret and her son always chat with me while i wait for my to go order. Love mom and pop places like this. Everytime I go in Enzo is always working hard in the kitchen, I don't think that guy ever takes a day off.
Highly recommend I order to go for my family every Friday night.
