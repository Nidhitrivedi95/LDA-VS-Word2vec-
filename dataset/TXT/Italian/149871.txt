KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ Rao's took excellent care of us. The spinach and beet salad was amazing. Rao's organized a fantastic family style dinner for us. The Meat Balls and Veal Picata and the best in Las Vegas. Every plate was wiped clean at our table. I highly recommend Rao's and can't wait to return.
