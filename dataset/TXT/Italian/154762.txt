L_thK7r3K_h5M4tV7amEKQ Great food for the dollar you pay!!

Where else are you going to get a decently made GRILLED AAA 8 OZ. STRIPLOIN for $10.00!?!?

And this place is legit 24 HOURS :)

They have great apps foe $2 like beef skewers and really good $7 mussels with white wine cream sauce.

Their dinners include potatoes and veggies or add $3 to include soup OR salad AND dessert .... or add $4 include soup AND salad AND dessert. And their dinners include the striploin, lamb rack to ribs. Decent right!? From $10 to $20!

Their pasta .. most special I'd say is the BLACK SEA GOOD SQUID IN SPAGHETTI for only $17.

They also have all day breakfast of course. 

They do have liquor license which Includes beer, wine and cocktails ... but their wines are limited to only one red that they have ans one white that they offer. It's not the greatest but it'll do ....same with cocktail ... there's not a lot of selection... oh you CANNOT bring your own wine.

The inside is nice and simple. Not bad! My friend's son owns this place :)
