yGd87bkFijZ6YHrHtW5maA Ordered thru eat24 not only did my food arrive incorrect and half hour later than the time given. It arrived cold with the rude driver that tried to charge me when I paid via credit card on the phone. Called the restaurant back to inform them my order was wrong; I was told they will not resend the driver because I was not satisfied and that everyone else does not complain. Idk wtf kind of day the manager had but wrong day to eff with me. I was told if I don't like their type of food I don't have to order. Went down and got my money back and gave them their food back. Will never order from here
