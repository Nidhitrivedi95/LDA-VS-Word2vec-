7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw IF, you are 40-60 and looking for a "double-date" location, this is your venue.

It's awesome because it is located in Kierland Commons - an up-scale, outdoor, shopping district with plenty of places to spend a buck. 

NoRTH has indoor sitting but it's absurdly noisy. Therefore, I would recommend the outdoor patio. Our waitress was amazing and on top of her tables. And for our Arizonian delight, they have outdoor heaters just in case the temperature should drop below 85 degrees. ;)

The trio of spreads appetizer was good (goat cheese=awesome, humus=great, olive spread= ehh?). I had the Buccatini (short ribs with tomato and pasta) for main course. Flavors were there but the presentation was not. The BF ordered the Grilled Ahi and I immediately had entree envy (seared but still very tender- I highly recommend). And if you like Tiramisu, order their Tiramisu.

All of that with a house bottle of Red, $90.
