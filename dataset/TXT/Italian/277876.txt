YJS7cXGLAvWw9DUDXpw84Q There are quite a few good Italian Restaurants around this area, but often they often have a limited  number dishes for a vegetarians.  I have to give these guys high marks for the variety of creative and  vegetarian dishes. We split a the beet and brussel sprout salad and a pasta prima vera dish both of which were very good. The Tiramisu was very good, but not quite as good as Vincitorios along the road.
I have been twice now in the last 2 weeks and on both occasions I was curious to see how organized they were and if there would be any service hiccups in the first week of opening.  Despite being pretty busy on both occasions - the service held up well. Decor is good and eating out on the patio is great, but i would recommend they invest in a misting system for patio before the temps rise any more.

Overall high marks for friendly efficient service, great selection of good food and nice decor. lets hope they keep the high standards up.

Overall still enjoy coming here - wife especially loves the vegetarian options. She usually goes with the beet salad.  Must admit the last 2 times we have been they had got the order wrong  and meals had to be returned and done over again.  Marked them down a little for that. Service is always friendly, food tasty and ambiance good. Let's hope they get the next order correct?

12/1/13 - Quality of the food and service  has definitely gone downhill over the last year. Pity cos it seemed very promising at first.
