Pt4rt1u_5KuS_NSMqerG_Q Pleasantly surprised.
To me, sauce makes the pizza.  The crust is the canvas, and very important, no doubt, but the sauce is the base layer of paint, the flavor platform that all else is built upon. 
PPE has a great sauce. No "Daddy Joe's" red simple syrup here; herbaceous, zesty, bright tomato flavors.
Toppings are of good quality and generously portioned.
Oh, and the crust?  It's pretty tasty, as well.
Go with the thin crust; it's not as thin as you'd think, and is a good balance of crisp and chew.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a pizza to order.....
