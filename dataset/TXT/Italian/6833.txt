0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw After reading good things about this place we decided to give it a go at around noon on a Sunday.  There was a line but it wasn't too bad and they moved people through quickly.  I ordered chicken tenders with fries & hubby ordered a burger with onion rings.  His burger was good...a bit too "flame-grilled" for my taste but he liked it.  My chicken seemed like good quality chicken but it was horribly bland.  No seasoning on the chicken or in the panko type breading.  Nothing.  The fries were also bland.  No seasoning at all...not even a hint of salt.  The onion rings were cooked in the same panko type of breading and they, too, were lacking in seasoning and flavor.  We were very disappointed.  This place isn't cheap and when the food is subpar the cost adds to the disappointment.  Our meal was $28 and change for two baskets and 2 drinks.  I give it one star for the atmosphere - lots of outdoor tables among large shade trees as well as indoor seating, and one star for being dog friendly.  We will not be going back.
