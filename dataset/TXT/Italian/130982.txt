IfdaoLWUc8LJU8BE3qb0Ng We decided to check out this restaurant. I'm really glad we did. We ordered the garlic bread app. I had the chicken masala. The roasted potatoes were so delicious. My husband, who doesn't even like roasted potatoes typically, kept stealing them off my plate. He had no complaints of his carbonara. Everything tasted homemade with fresh ingredients. We will definitely be going back.
