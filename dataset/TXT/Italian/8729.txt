0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ We came for a quick bite for 3 and bought 2 pizzas. It was good. Crust is thin. The bottom is burnt but the pizza is placed in a brick oven.  The tables were dirty with crust. Place was pretty empty at 8pm. The dining room was huge. This made me a little hesitant when we came in. Big restaurant but large empty tables makes you think twice. We came on a Wednesday night. I don't know what the stink about the device was. The busters on came to clean up after is and greeted is and asked how we were doing.
