2WhAe8nUUl6TkX9mY8EKzQ I went to this location for lunch with my coworkers. The restaurant has nice amount of seating and the service was good. The person at the door and our server were extremely friendly. Our server was very quick in providing drinks... so the service was decent.

They started us off with some bread, it was quite good. For the main I ordered their Blackened Grilled Salmon with vegetables and Penne Pasta in rosé sauce. Lets start with the fish...Wow cooked well and not dry. The vegetables were good and the rosé sauce was very good. Portion size was good and to top it all I closed it off with a espresso shot. 

Overall an decent Italian restaurant with good Italian food!
