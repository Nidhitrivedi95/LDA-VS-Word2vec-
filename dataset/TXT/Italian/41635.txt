7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA OMG I finally had a chance to visit the newly opened Lady Marmalade.  I'm happy to report that I was pleasantly impressed and the place lived up to all they hype I've been hearing from west coast peeps who have eaten at the original location in Victoria.

The place is very eclectic and welcoming.  The staff were very friendly and services was pretty good considering the place has only been open about a week and has been way busier than they ever expected.  Unfortunately, today was another busy day and they ran out of food an hour before closing and had to turn some people away.  I say this is a good sign though, since I would rather be running out of food due to popularity, rather than having no one interested in my new restaurant.

I ended up settling on a veggie poached BLT masterpiece.  Instead of bacon they swapped in some avocado.  The flavors were amazing and multi-layered.  My eggs were a little over done, but even without a nice runny inside the meal was still amazing.   Beyond breakfast they had a ton of other items I will definitely try on future visits - curries, sandwiches, etc.

This place is destine to become one of my new local favourites.  Hope they can keep up with their popularity.
