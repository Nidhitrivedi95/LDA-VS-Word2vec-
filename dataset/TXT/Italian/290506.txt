ZvtELJTUOh0yRrPxyyiakQ If i could i would give it no stars. By far THE worst birthday ever. Server (Danny) lied to my sister about onions which she is allergic to. We were seated in a waiting area. Lied to over the over the phone and on site.  Told we'd get the patio. We were told to call ahead and they'd set something up for us, but we felt like we were just shoved in a corner. Will never return and will be letting anyone who is even thinking about coming to this location not to come.
