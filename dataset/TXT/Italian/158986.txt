LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Maggiano's is conveniently located in the Fashion Show mall below The Capital Grille.  It was my first time here and the food was better than I had expected.  I went with my beautiful girlfriend for lunch.  She had signed up for their mailing list and received a coupon good for $10.00 off our total meal.  The server was really nice and she even gave us her card at the end of the meal (after she had learned that we were locals).  We ordered Chicken Fetuccini Alfredo, Baked Ziti, and the Fried Zuchinni as an appetizer.  We were about to order more than the Fried Zuchinni for an appetizer, but I'm glad we didn't.  They turned out to be Zuchinni Spears (6) and they were huge! The breading on the Zuchinni was to die for!  It was cooked to perfection. I wonder if they used Panko to bread it?  I highly recommend it.  The Ziti was not that impressive at all.  It was way too meaty and sauce was bland in taste.  My Alfredo was good and rich in taste.  I had no complaints about the service (they even were able to give us a window seat when we asked...no reservation made).  We had a good view of the strip and Wynn casino.  I'd definitely come here again.  I would have scored them 5 star, but the Ziti knocked 'em down.  Next time, I want to try their Calamari!
