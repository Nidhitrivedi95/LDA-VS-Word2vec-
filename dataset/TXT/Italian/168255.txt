MjQptGzmlOSmxzfE-pktEA Another diamond in the rough amongst the not so great cusine of the Cleveland area. We enjoyed the atmosphere, fast & friendly service, and exquisite Italian food. I am full blooded Italian from a very traditional family who has secret passed down recipies of their own. So I KNOW good Italian when I taste it. After being not so impressed with a few tries of the overpriced "commercial" Italian food now served in Little Italy I decided to give it one more shot here and we finally found a winner.

I literally cannot stop ordering the lasagna here. It's better than my moms and that's saying quite a bit! Every time I walk in the door with the intention of trying something else on the menu... then I smell the lasagna or see someone else ordering it and that's all she wrote.

A few negatives for example the deserts are a tad on the small side and are very unremarkable despite having a variety of them to choose from. Also the very first time we went there the waitress spilled an entire glass of ice cold water directly on my crotch. NOT ENOUGH to prevent me from enjoying that world class lasagna though! A++
