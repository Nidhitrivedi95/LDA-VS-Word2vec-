esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA We stay at Harrahs regularly so it is convenient to eat here, but that is not the reason we do. This place has some of the best prepared seafood I have ever eaten. The oysters are flown in daily so despite a negative review I read on here they are FRESH ! All the waiters are taught to prepare all the dishes which make it very convenient. The following are dishes which I have enjoyed; creamy clam chowder, shrimp cocktail, crab cakes (superb), a shrimp dish with bruschetta under it, king crab and on and on! You will not be disappointed if you venture over to Harrahs and belly up to the bar! Enjoy!
