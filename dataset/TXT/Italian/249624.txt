vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw Took my friends here yesterday for lunch.  I am a huge Oreganos fan but never been tobthis location. 

Food-  it was great.  Had the Ziti with meatballs.  So good!  Co-workers had doable pasta and egg plant pasta.  Both ate every last piece.  Huge portions as usual.  Food 5 stars.

Service-  amazing as always.  Waitress was awesome and always checked in.  Even joked with us a little.  Only wish the food came a little faster.  Tough to eat here for lunch since the food is fresh, takes a little longer to make.

Overall-  not crazy busy for lunch, got straight in.  Everything was great and what I expected from Oreganos.  Prices are a tad steep, paid $20 for drink and pasta but that included tip.  

We will continue to return.
