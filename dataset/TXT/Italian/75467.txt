CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA My top tip is to go for slices. I have much preferred when I've just gone for slices, any time I got the pizza it has been disappointing. I think the pizza is too greasy. Maybe when you get the slices that have been sitting out for a little while and then get reheated, it takes off some of that grease and cooked the cheese a little more. I love the slices!
