93FVxoipAIYG07gisMOQhw We just came from having the BEST pizza we have ever eaten.  We had the Sicilian and added artichokes.  Unbelievably delicious, Artisan style and fresh.  It was wonderful.  The owner/cook and entire staff made their way over to our table just to greet us.  They sell homemade french bread and rosemary/kalamata olive french bread.  Took two loaves home.  Don't listen to one word negative about the restaurant, service or food.  It really was delightful. 

fyi:  to Lenne O from Denver...  You must have been in the pizza restaurant across the parking lot because 1)you do not serve your own beverage  2) there isn't a chalkboard and 3) you don't prepay or pre-tip.  None of that...
