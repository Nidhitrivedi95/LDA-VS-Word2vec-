DWWK7M6SsQwz0Dd2pOTOUQ Barro's is out favorite pizza in Anthem.  It is also one of the few that also offer sit down area in a clean, comfortable environment (not waiter service).

Also they have the best wings in Anthem, with an overall rating of very good (I'm so picky about wings - it is hard to get to great on my scale).  Their biggest sin is the pool of sauce for the wings.  By my calling, you should not need a napkin after each wing, they should have a light coating of sauce.

Anyway, Barros is good pizza at a good value (with a coupon)  standard pricing tends to get a little high.

Given the options in Anthem (and the loss of Rosati's - which got the other 50% of our pixzza business), this is our go to place for 'za.
