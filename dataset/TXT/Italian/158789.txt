LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA We went here for our Valentine's dinner last night and man was it busy. This is a very popular strip restaurant for good reason. The servers struggled a little because of the volume of customers but held up pretty well all things considered. I had the veal Marsala which was some of the best I've had and the wife had a chicken and potatoes dish that was equally tasty. This was a very nice meal even as busy as it was. Good job guys on a challenging night for restaurants.
