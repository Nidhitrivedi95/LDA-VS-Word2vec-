7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ I've lived in AZ my entire life and one of my favorite things to do is try out new pizza places. My friend always talked about this place, but we would always vie for Oreganos, Sauce, Grimaldi's, Nello's or somewhere else! I'm giving it three stars for a few reasons.  We just ordered a pepperoni pizza. Pretty simple. I didn't like how you got a Solo cup with ice, and you got to pick a can of soda. Personally, I don't drink coke out of a can and I only like it by fountain, so I thought the whole grab a can and pour it in a cup thing was weird. Plus, no refills, which is lame considering the cup is a kids size small. The pizza was good, but way too expensive for just one pizza. Also, the parking lot is way, way too small for a popular place like this. What I did like was the atmosphere, the pizza was fine, and setup is nice. I like the TVs as well.
