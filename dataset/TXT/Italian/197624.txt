prPOsr3aS9IStGdBil9l5A Since we just moved to LV, we have been trying to find a good pizza place, and I think we found it in Prima.

We ordered delivery, and it was great.  The delivery came a lot faster than we anticipated, quicker than they quoted and fast for a Saturday evening.  The pizza itself was tasty, as was the dinner salad.  I was slightly disappointed in the garlic knots - although they give you a dozen, they aren't very flavorful & leave some garlic taste to be desired.

Check out their specials on their website - they offer great deals for all sized parties.

It was even good the next day.  We will be trying out Prima in the future.
