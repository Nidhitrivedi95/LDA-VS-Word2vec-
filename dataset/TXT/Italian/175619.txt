First, be careful about the size of your party. Ours was a party of 6, they were basically empty and it took a while for them to set the table up. Party of 4 or less is the way to go here.

Their calamari was delicious. It took a while for it to come out, but it came out hot and tasty. Best thing I ate here.

I would strongly recommend against their Pollo a Marsala. It was average. Nothing special. Their pizza was decent enough. Again nothing special. I imagine most of those who have left overly positive comments about the pizza haven't had great pizza before.

My wife asked for a straw at the beginning of our meal and the server got caught up in a conversation and had completely forgot about the straw. To be fair it may have been such a good conversation that my wife's straw wasn't the least bit important, I'll be fair about it. I mean she is pregnant and high maintenance I guess. It's whatevs.

Check it out if you want. New places can be fun... I've never been to prison... maybe that'd be interesting?
