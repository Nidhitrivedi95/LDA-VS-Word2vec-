VraSwdw04w1LASF1xRBkdw I don't think I have ever had more flavorless pizza.  We had previously eaten pizza from this establishment when it was Tony Saco's, but the reincarnation is not good.  I have had MUCH better frozen pizza from the grocery store than this flavorless concoction.  Never going to order from Kenna's again.  Sad that they are even in business.  YUK!!
