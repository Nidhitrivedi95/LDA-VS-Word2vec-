FdiZDOs8LbSnBpA_e5R5HQ I was told about Jet's from a colleague from work. It is a bit out of my neck of the woods but I am very happy that I made the effort. The food is great! Pizza made with tasty ingredients and cooked just about as good as you want. I was particularly impressed with the crust. We also got an order of Jets bread which was just as good as the pizza. I was fortunate to be a Le to chat with the owner of this restaurant, cool guy who deserves kudos for the effort he is putting forth to provide us with some really good food.
