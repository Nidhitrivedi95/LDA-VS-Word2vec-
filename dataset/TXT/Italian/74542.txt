cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q My first time eating at an Olive Garden. The food was good, just like any home cooked meal. The services was amazing. Our server Justin made sure we were well taken care. We didn't wait long to be seated nor for our food. I can honestly say that I'm very pleased with coming to this location. I'm sure to come back one day!!
