RP7P33XWuVyEN_YZhk652A Great Italian place. Its been a resteraunt since the 1890s and the current place since 1963! The food is classic Italian-American fare with no frills. They also do some pizzas, steaks, and burgers but I'd recommend the pasta dishes. Chicken Parm with penne (garlic and oil) and a side salad is my favorite dish
