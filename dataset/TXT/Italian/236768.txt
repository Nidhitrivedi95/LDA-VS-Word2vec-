TWt-6EilZoSH99CheLPD2A Hmmm....well I need to update because I've been there several times now and my first visit was definitely the best.  They've been hit and miss ever since.  I feel horrible because I really want to love this place but it's not living up to the potential I saw during the first visit.  I'd give it 2.5 to 3 stars now.

The service has been up and down.  I called it distracted in my first review...it became non-existent and now is much better so overall it's definitely improved.

The food, not so much.  The wait times can be insane even when it's slow and meals often don't arrive at the same time.  I was there last week with three people and two of us received our dinners a good 15 minutes before the other two.  More attention needs to be paid to the sides as well.  The main part of the dish is consistently good but whatever it comes with (let's say the veg for example) seems to be an afterthought if it's a thought at all.  

Rod has come over to apologize to us on a couple of visits and has given us cookies on the house as we were leaving so he's definitely aware of the problems and trying to fix them.  I'm still hopeful but not as enthused as I was the first time out.
