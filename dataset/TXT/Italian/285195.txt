zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g Went here today for a work Christmas party. Our HR plans everything and last year it was a success, but this year not so much due to the poor communication of the staff. 

Prior to arriving to the restaurant the company had already emailed the chef what our orders were to be, but there was some confusion and two waiters came by to ask orders and write down what each person was going to eat. 

Our appetizers came out fast and the setting was nice and that's where the two stars came from. When our food came out that's when everything was messed up. They all of a sudden ran out of prime rib which we ordered 20 orders of! Then they forgot 6 of us! So 6 people were sitting without food while everyone else ate for at least 30 minutes after everyone else received food. Once most of everyone was served the waiters neglected to check on us to see if everyone was served. They left 1 person out and that person waited 1 hour to eat after everyone else was almost already finished. The staff was not accommodating at all either as we had kept asking what other choices do we have if you ran out of the food we has pre-ordered. They said we had no choice but to stick with their chicken Alfredo pasta which was mediocre. 

It was not a very good first experience coming to this restaurant and I'm not sure I would willingly come here on my own or tell friends about this place.
