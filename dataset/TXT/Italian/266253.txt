X3UyZfplYAXdSJpWPaxUIA A great restaurant for authentic Italian fare located in the last place you'd think. I've been here multiple times, sometimes for a lunch or relaxed dinner. I think the price-point is fair and on par with other solid Italian places. Have always received consistent and attentive service here. 

Food wise it's a great menu; lots of selection. I always try to get something different each time I dine here, and haven't been disappointed with anything yet, but when in doubt I go for the pizza. I never worry about leaving hungry because the portions are decently sized. 

One star off for it's location, surroundings can seem a little sketch at times but nothing to worry about.
