bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw Beautiful restaurant with outside seating and complimentary valet. 
However the food was not up to par. We started with the bread it came with a dip that was tasteless n the waitress did not tell us what it was.
The bruschetta was way to sweet.
For dinner the risotto with scallops. The scallops were extremely salty.
Even the tiramisu was not the norm, it had a gelatin like layer, layered throughout the cake.
