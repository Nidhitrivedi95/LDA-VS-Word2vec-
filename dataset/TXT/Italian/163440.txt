lwpQQflP1CGJPV7QLybzOg Came by here for the first time to get take out on a tight time frame. Awesome! I wasn't sure if it would be good, you never know, but we were pleasantly surprised!! 

We headed inside to the bar to place a takeout order. We only had 15 minutes. 

In 15 min, they made honey BBQ wings, pizza, Stromboli, two salads, fried mozzarella & cheesecake in that time frame. They were super fast and their sauce is excellent. The fried cheese is in pizza dough. 

The salads were excellent - they were just house salads but had marinated red peppers, mushrooms, onion, tomatoes and olives. The dressing is awesome. 

Pizza is thin crusted and crispy - we got 1/2 cheese and 1/2 pepperoni. It may be not the kind your kids  like but it's very, very good! I would come here over 
The service was fast, prices good and service is very nice. A+
