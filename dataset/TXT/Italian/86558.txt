dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg I'm not generally a fan of chain restaurants, but as chain restaurants go, its a good one.  It is a bit cheesy (both in food and in sense of humor) but the food portions are huge and taste pretty good.  The price points are good and the service is friendly.  This place is always packed.  So be prepared for a wait.  They have pizza to please both fans of the thin crust or the thick.  Although if you get the thick crust pizza be prepared for a wait.  I always get the wedding soup which is delicious with meatballs and small bits of pasta in a chicken broth.  It is not too salty which makes me super happy!  If you're brave get a pizza cookie they can get it to have two different kinds of pizza dough and topped with vanilla ice cream.
