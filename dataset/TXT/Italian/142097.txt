JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A What a great place. Wonderful pasta, salads and great service. 
It's small (cozy) so you might have to wait... We shared the Moroccan
Chili, a house salad and the Penne Arrabiata. The portions were 
fresh, very tasty and generously sized. This place is a gem ihmo and wouldn't hesitate to return if I was in the area.
