hmfAdo6LuVOvBLiu75C8ZA My Mother and I have been to Luca a couple of times and everything was perfect!!  However, we went yesterday after KINKY BOOTS at Playhouse Square , with my husband and uncle, wanting to share what a wonderful restaurant it is....We had reservations right at 5pm when they open so we sat at the bar while they prepared our table.  The male bartender was an arrogant jerk.  My husband asked him what bottled beer they had, and he through the menu at him...  When I ask him about the choices of 2 different red wines, he said rudely " I don't drink it".  That was our first slap in the face...   We were shown our table and from the get go, our waitress, Terry rushed us....She took our appetizer order, salad and entree all at once without giving us ample time to enjoy each course.  I expressed our disappointment to the Manager who said we had the table all night if we wanted and offered free dessert, however, it was past the fact, we did thank her.  Then the manager must have mentioned to the Terry, the waitress, and she had the audacity to confront us about saying she rushed us by saying "that's how we do things here"...   Not true I hope.....  It will take a while for us to return solely because of our poor service....
