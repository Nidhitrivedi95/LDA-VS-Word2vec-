83C5ysOCnmNGB_fDsVdr9Q I get this place zero stars I ordered food two times here the first time I ordered I asked for extra olives in my salad it look like they gave me whole 2 olives ... I didn't call and complain.... this time I specifically ordered extra jalapeño avocado and macaroni salad they gave me a potato salad no jalapeños or avocados they said they don't have avocado and the jalapeños were extra charge so they didn't put it on there because they didn't charge me mind you it was coming to my door and I was paying in cash and on the order slip  when I ordered it it said will be an extra charge so  I knew it was gonna be an extra charge so she said she called me and she gave me a number that wasn't even on my Oder Horrible customer service ...didn't even apologize there is a way to handle customer service I've been in customer service for a while and there rude customer service and  food won't be and we ordered it will be cold and not what you want never going there again
