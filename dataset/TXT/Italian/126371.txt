HSoKTWnsu7f3yvywWvBQ4w Usually lunch-time pizza is just so-so as its been sitting for awhile but hubby and I were pleasantly surprised   We ordered the two slices and a drink for $6.95. I got the meatball plus the cheese slices. It was so weird biting into the plain cheese slice!  I felt like I was transported back in time when pizza had that old fashioned taste. Can't wait to order an entire pie -- if the precooked    Slices are this good, the fresh one has to be fantastic!
