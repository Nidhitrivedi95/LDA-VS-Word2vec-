fuBpjG-lsD94_BdpjHxbuQ Recently dined at Lo Zingaro for a friends birthday. Nice ambience but do not get a table by the front door (at least during the colder months). Every time the door opened we could feel the gust of chilly air come in. 

As for food, we ordered the Fresh Fettucini with lamb and the Seafood Risotto. I definitely recommend the fettucini. The risotto was good but nothing out of the ordinary. For desserts the tiramisu was amazing! 

Service was good but slow. It took a while for our orders to get taken, our glasses refilled, and our meals to arrive. I noticed there was another birthday party so maybe they were just very busy that night.
