82-wE5pkxyBKhfxyyZap_A I just ordered an order of Cajun wings and spicy buffalo pizza. The quality of the food was good but omg it was soooo salty!!! I'm a person that likes salt but this was way beyond painfully salty. I would not order from here again. I had to drink a gallon of water after 2 slices of pizza and 2 wings .
