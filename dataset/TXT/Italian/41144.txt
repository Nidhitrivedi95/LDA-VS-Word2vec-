7JWWeXqil03Ua_wV9KN8ZQ My husband and I were at Lake Las Vegas for a marriage retreat and decided to dine here Saturday night for "date night."

My husband and I shared a caesar salad, mushroom ravioli with bolognese sauce (a request we made after the very polite server, Giovanni, mixed up the specials of the day), and a pizze margherita. 

YUM is all I have to say.

First of all, we told the owner of the restaurant how amazing Giovanni was. I actually spent half of the meal speaking to him in Italian. Molto Bene! She was so funny about it, she kept saying "I know," in regards to his fantastic service.

The ravioli was amazing. The bolognese sauce was even MORE amazing.

Lastly, the margherita pizza was phenomenal. We ended up saving half of it, but it was so tasty that we devoured it once we got back to our room!

I cannot wait to come back! Next time, I think we'll just get the pizza. It was drool worthy, and better than a pizza we recently had at Pizza Rock, our previous favorite pizza spot.
