JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A I went here for dinner and drinks earlier this week. As others have mentioned, the interior is pretty wonderful. It kind of reminds me of being in the world of Harry Potter. It's cozy and warm and dimly/romantically lit. I ordered the bruschetta and then a chicken sandwich. Pretty basic orders, but both were really delicious actually. Service was friendly and prompt. The black leather couch on the third floor is my favourite spot. I see why this was rated the best first date place in Toronto a few years ago. Anyhow, I'll definitely be back here.
