n8fGqb4CCheGyWtr9KM6qw I usually don't go to restaurants that are inside a strip mall because I'm a very visual person and the building needs to be appealing to me. I was craving pasta so I decided to google italian places close to me. Found this place so I went there and placed a to go order. The waitress was very nice and she offered me a free house salad with their bread and butter so I can try it since it was my first time there. I ordered the linguine with pink sauce and imitation crab, very good! Great service and great food.
