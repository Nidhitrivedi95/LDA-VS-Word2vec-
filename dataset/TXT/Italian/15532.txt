1RROh1rSDB4ASIZ-kwxT2w Made a reservation at bravo for my grandmothers birthday. It was an early dinner but of course everyone was late. The hostess was very nice and let us sit at our table since it was ready for us. Our server on the other hand was very unwelcoming. Petite blonde who was obviously not in the mood to work a large party. I asked for her to bring bread and water for everyone as we were still waiting for many of our guests to arrive. After half of our party showed we ordered appetizers and cocktails. 

Mini calzones about the size of a beef patty. Deliciously stuffed with different cheeses. Dipping sauce on the side. 
 
Fried calamari was cooked just right and came with a marinara and cream sauce. Typical calamari wasn't bad but wasn't anything special. 

Spinach dip was really good and cheesy. They added red peppers to it which gave it a nice kick. 

Things were looking up as we enjoyed our apps and drinks. Then a new server popped up and we were confused. So we asked what happen and she was honest and told us the blonde was complaining about us. Funny thing is my boyfriend could hear her while she was standing all the way by the kitchen talking about how we weren't ordering enough drinks. Mind you it's my grandmothers birthday, not exactly the moment to turn up. We were happy to have Natasha as our new server! She was very polite and patient. Did not rush us and made sure our experience was pleasant so that we MIGHT want to come back again. Not going to elaborate on the entrées they were mediocre. Lobster ravioli was the best dish I tasted out of everyone's.
