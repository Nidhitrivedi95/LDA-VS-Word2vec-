0VOh4VIq13oFburRU9gddw I really am a big fan of this place. I've been here about four or five times over the last year and am always happy with it. Granted I always order the quesadilla and a glass of red - but it always hits the spot.

I love that it's a quaint little place and the bartender - I think her name is Jenna - is always super sweet. She always pours a big glass of wine too. I can't always finish it!

As most have said - it's a great neighborhood bar.
