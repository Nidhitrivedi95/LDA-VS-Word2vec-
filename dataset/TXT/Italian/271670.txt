Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ I love deep dish pizza, and square deep dish pizza is even better! Northside does Detroit style pizza which means it's deep and it's square (just like Detroit?). Their restaurant is decorated with Detroit gear set with an orange Detroit Tigers wall and a red Red Wings Wall (sorry Pistons, I didn't notice a wall for you) which is cool since they are my hubbies teams. 

You walk in and order at a window where the menu is located on a machine top or you can grab a menu. Then you can sit at any booth. We happened to have a Groupon for $20 so we got an 11 inch Guys and Dolls pizza, two fountain drinks, and hubby got a beer. With the groupon we only paid $4. The pizza is delevered to you and placed on a platform at your table. The deliciousness is hot so don't burn your tongue. I didn't think we would finish it all but three pieces for me and six pieces for him later and it's gone! If you love deep dish crust, the square-ness of the pizza gives you that extra crust love with the corner pieces. If you're not a big crust fan, go for the sans-crust middle pieces. Something for every pizza lover. 

When our lunch was done, they even gave us a customer appreciation coupon for the next time for a free mini-skinny pizza which is thin crust. They do have other things on the menu, but why do that when they're so good at pizza? Love it and would definitely go again!
