Ordered chicken Caesar salad and a side of mac n cheese. My guy ordered the Penne Rosa, and my son the kid's spaghetti and meatballs. 

Noodles were cooked perfectly, cheese sauce was a bit lacking but still tasty. The salad was good, but nothing special. The Penne Rosa was very flavorful and the chicken was also good. 

Extremely courteous and helpful staff, the tea had run out and I brought it to their attention. A gentleman walked right over and brewed some more on the spot!

The only thing keeping this place from a 5 star rating was the prices. They're not outrageous, but a bit on the high side for the portions.
