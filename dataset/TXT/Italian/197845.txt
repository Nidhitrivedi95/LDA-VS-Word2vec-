pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Rude! We sat down after visiting the children's museum and the waitress came over and took our drink order. Our drinks were delivered to our table and a couple questions about the menu were asked. A few minutes after that a woman came over and asked us if we just sat ourselves. We answered yes because there was an open table on the patio, no sign, and no one had greeted us as we walked up to the patio. We didn't think about it as we did not see anyone standing and it's a pizza place. But we were wrong. The woman told us we cut in front of a bunch of parties and we were brought our tab and asked to leave. I was upset because she was very rude about it and the waitress never said anything. So I ended up having to pay $18 dollars for our drinks and then we walked across to the pub across the street where the food and service was much better. I would never eat here again. At least they could have asked us to wait. Plain rude!!
