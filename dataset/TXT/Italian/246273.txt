UzjCvrNuK4crxi0IS9Jp5A This is one of the worst places ive ever ate at!! There was a roach crawling around and a long curly hair in my daughters pizza. On top of all of that the manager had poor customer service skills and didn't give a crap about the hair or the bug he wanted  to make us another pizza to go. Why would we want another hair to eat? Then he wanted to charge us a $20 tip!! My family and I will not be going back here!! The manager even told us we were not welcome back because he got butt hurt over my review! Mind you we spent over $100 that night and he called us liars!
