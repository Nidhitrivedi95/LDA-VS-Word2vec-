ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw I love the fact that this location stays open later than the Mesa location (probably due to its proximity to ASU).  But it just couldn't top my experience at the location in Mesa.  If you order the Deep Dish Crust Pizza, be careful!  We had no idea it would have SO much cheese.  We thought the cheese would just be in the crust but it was ALL ALONG the bottom of the whole crust.  My body wasn't feeling that and fearing that we would "pay for it in the morning", we asked for a flat crust pizza as a replacement.  The manager was really great about accommodating us (thank you!) but unfortunately in all the confusion, the waiter forgot to put in our order for the Pizza Cookie which we ordered as soon as we sat down *sad face*.  We wound up going back to the original location in Mesa the next week and yummed that up!
