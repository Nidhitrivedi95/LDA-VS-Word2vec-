hrNIDao4XnOhrv7aaFehTg I've been ordering pizza here for several months and generally the service is prompt.  You order online and it gives you a timeframe for order to be ready.  Today it said 15 minutes.  It's now been almost 25 minutes since I ordered and PAID online but the workers tell me it'll take another 5 minutes (like they couldn't even find my order ticket). Opinion of this place went down real fast after this experience.
