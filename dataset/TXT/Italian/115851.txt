GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA This place was delicious.  It was basically my second time at a restaurant of this caliber, but the staff was there to guide my fiancee and myself along every step of the way.  They had a sommelier that helped us choose a wine off of their EXPANSIVE list that worked for both of us.

The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave good recommendations so that we could make educated choices on what we were ordering.  They were also very attentive to what was going on: I had dropped my napkin on the way to the restroom.  I picked it up and placed it on the chair. When I returned there was a brand new one folded near my utensils. Great stuff.

I strongly recommend that you follow whatever the "chef's recommendations" are.  They really do add a new dimension to the flavor profiles that are in your food. This increase in complexity definitely lets the food go the extra mile so that at the end of it all, when you receive that massive check, you realize that it was completely delicious and wish all restaurants tasted the way B&B does.
