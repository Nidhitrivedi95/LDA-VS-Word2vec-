CStQJ-ADmhxuepLooO2NXA Great wee find! Totally local for me but first (brief) visit and was totally impressed.

Small but perfectly formed, legitimate family Italian restaurant on I think its Dundee Terrace. We had no booking but at 6pm on a Wednesday night, we had no issues getting a table.

Menu typically Italian with pizza, pasta, risotto and meat/fish dishes. We only had mains but pizza/pasta/risotto mains around £7-£10 mark, starters around £5 so not breaking the bank for a mid-week treat.

I had a tasty chicken risotto and my friends all opted for pizza. Every plate was cleared. 4 mains, 3 beers and two cokes came to around £46 which is brilliant. Service friendly, quick and efficient :-)

Well definitely return. Kicking myself that after living locally, this is my first visit in 6 years but won't be the last.

No gf pizza or bread but gf pasta is available at £1.50 surcharge which tbh, I don't mind as the prices are cheap. Well worth a visit!
