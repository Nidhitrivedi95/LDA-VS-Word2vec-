mIlwCZYr8uQH0mHJEhuf4g Best Panini I've had. Coming from the east coast you take for granted the Different Italian restaurants but really pleasantly surprised to find this gem in the middle of the desert! Soup, salad, bread all delicious. Haven't had the pizza but it looks great. CHECK THIS PLACE OUT PEOPLE!
