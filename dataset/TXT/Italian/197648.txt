PSDpvQJXABP4i-MP7mP4-Q I had the meatball pizza and a walnut salad. My food was very fresh. I had a local draft (a wheat beer). Everything was excellent. As others have noted, the staff is great. They have a fantastic service awareness as well. It reminded me of the "Pikes Seafood" in Seattle that made videos of choose your attitude don't let your attitude choose you. Dewey's rotates waiters so you experience several while you're eating. One young woman could have been a stand up comic she was so hilarious. My encounter set the bar very high. I hope the can hit it again as it was incredible. Great job with fresh food and hiring exceptional employees!
