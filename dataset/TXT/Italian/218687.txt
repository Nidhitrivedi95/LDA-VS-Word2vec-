s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q Great food if you pick the right items, otherwise it's overpriced and mediocre.

Our favorites were the eggplant, fried risotto, and meatballs. The pasta dishes are just average. We've been here twice. The first time we got chicken parm and parpadelle Alfredo and both were weak, especially for $30 a plate.

The next time we got smaller dishes and shared a baked pasta and were much happier that way even though it cost the same as out previous visit.

The price kills the star rating. If they were more reasonable I might give it 4, but the price almost makes it 2.5 stars in my humble opinion.
