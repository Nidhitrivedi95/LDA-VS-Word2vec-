PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA We had one of the best meals ever!  We tried so many dishes and each one was extremely well executed.  Favorites in particular are the polenta with ragu, wild mushroom salad, chicken liver vasi, cacio e pepe and the polpo. . . The staff is very helpful in explaing how to order, small share plates etc.  Cocktails were divine and we were treated to a delicious Malbec, selected by David Johnson.  We cannot wait to go back and try more of the dishes, and we are really looking forward to when they start doing the famous bloody mary bar.  We are hoping to bring a group and do the suckling pig dinner, it was served while we were there and it looked so delicious - what a great idea.  We are thrilled to have Davanti in Arizona!
