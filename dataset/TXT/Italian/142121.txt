JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A A bad breakfast experience.  We tried it because of the high Yelp ratings.

To be fair, they apparently were "down one cook" (we were advised after a 40 minute wait).  But still, we were a party of 6, and there were only two other two-tops occupied, and even then we waited an hour for our food. Two of our party just had toast, so this was not complicated!

When it arrived, finally, the food was very average.  One of our party ordered oatmeal and it was dry to the point of inedible. My vegetable omelette wasn't cold, but it had obviously been sitting in the kitchen for a while before being served.

The service was barely adequate. Our server, while friendly, was inattentive. At one point I got up and grabbed the coffee pot from behind the bar and refilled our table's cups because she was no where to be found.  Remember, there were only three occupied tables in the place.

Unfortunately, this was our first time in Toronto, and hoped for a solid breakfast find - this wasn't it.
