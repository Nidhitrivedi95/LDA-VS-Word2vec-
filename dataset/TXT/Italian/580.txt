-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw I had a really good experience here at Brio; the food was warm and good..the dessert was delicious, but the menu isn't anything really special. they are just regular, run of the mill items.

It's clean, the waiters are nice and it's not very crowded! it's in a pretty cute area that you can spot it from the street. 

my opinion is that the one thing that stands out at Brio is the steak salad and the alcoholic beverages. those are my go-to favorites!
