UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ My goodness!  I room a friend new to town here.  I talked it up since I had such an awesome time at the Tivoli location.  Walking in, the AC is so cold that I could see penguins.  We asked to be seated outside and were quickly seated.  We were quickly fogotten.

After waiting for some time, a nice himsel man introduces himself and takes our drink order but never returns. This keeps happening over and over.  Finally we get someone and we ask for drinks before we order.  

We had to keep asking for the bread basket but they kept forgetting. The server didn't know the soup of the day.  Finally we ordered and our food came. The dressing on my Field Greens salad was too heavy on the vinegar and the salad was drenched to the point that the greens were soggy!  My soup got cold because no one brought me a spoon and I had to ask a couple times. No one brought me any crackers, offered pepper or cheese for the soup or salad, or my friends omlette.  Our drinks were often empty.  

Fortunately the manager walked by and we were able to share about our experience.  He was too kind and comped our meal, but I am quite reluctant to return to this location.
