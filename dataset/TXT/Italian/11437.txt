I ate here twice, and was surprised and disappointed each time.

Lunch during a busy rush.
I'm not sure anyone working had ever hustled, or worked a fast service there. We all watched in awe as they clumsily bumped around getting orders out. Plating, unplating, plating again. Snipping basil (nice fresh touch, but how about pre chopping what you need for the next 15 minutes+ ?), and generally confused. I waited forever and a day, and ended up burning my mouth because I was eating so fast....and still 10 minutes late back to my class upstairs.

Afternoon snack when there was no line.
Inattentive cashiers more focused on chatting with each other. Way too long of a wait, considering nothing else was going on, again clumsily plating, unplating, replaying the food. Sent my tiny ti go snack order in a HUGE pizza box. Embarassingly large. The garlic bread knots were kinda cold in the center. Ugh.
