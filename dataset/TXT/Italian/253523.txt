VsHhy9ixEze-AxNYt6UxLA Yum. Almost perfection.

Intimate, cozy, relaxed atmosphere.

I started with the dirty martini which was very tasty and expertly mixed.

My husband, who is currently on a low carb diet, has a choice of a salad with chicken or the grilled chicken entree. He chose the Greek salad with chicken. He was craving carbs real bad so imagine the mixture of delight and sadness when his salad came in a huge bread bowl. He caved and had some of the bread bowl which I tasted. It was really good-  herbed and buttery. 

I had a small house salad and the eggplant rollatini. The salad was nothing extraordinary. Very basic. 

But the eggplant rollatini... OMG. Eyes rolling to the back of my head good. Perfect dough... crispy on the outside, brushed with butter and garlic. Filled with breaded eggplant that melted in my mouth. Lots of delicious cheese. And the marinara sauce it comes with may be my favorite marinara sauce in Phoenix. And that's a big deal. The serving size was huge. I could only finish half.

Service was good. Started out a bit slow, probably because they were very busy. But they caught up and were very attentive.

We will definitely be back... I am fantasizing about the rollatini right now as I type...
