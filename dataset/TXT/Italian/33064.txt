5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA I ate here once almost two years ago when I first moved to Henderson and have been meaning to write this review for some time now. 

I don't remember exactly we ordered, but I do remember that it was so salty that my friend and I both could barely choke it down. Like spit-it-out ack-sound salty. The only reason we ate more than two bites of our meals was because we knew we were going out drinking after and wanted our tummies to be full. I will most definitely never be eating here again.

The view was beautiful and service was fine.
