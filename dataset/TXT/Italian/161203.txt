lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ The bottom line: STAY AWAY

Over priced, middle of the road, food even with restaurant.com certificate.

Horrible service! Waiter was NOT interested in waiting on us. We're not demanding with special orders or extra things either.

Waiter helped himself to a 20% tip (suppose to be 18% per cert) and over charged my credit card by $10. After I got home I called and spoke with a manager and he corrected the credit card charge. When I told him about the tip he gave me his email and said he would mail me the 2% back. The tip issue isn't worth my time. 

I recommend staying away from Slice of Vegas. There are WAY too many other better places to eat. If you have eaten here check your credit card statement.
