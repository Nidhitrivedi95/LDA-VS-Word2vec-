JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw Great food & selection of wine.

Loved the interior and the atmosphere.

Great, attentive service.

I tried the Bollito Misto upon reading the yelp reviews...
It's SOUPY & MEATY (pork, chicken, beef, lamb, sausage all slow-cooked in one dish) 

Beware if you're not a fan of lamb though..
i couldn't overcome the lamb smell so i sadly had to stop eating after a couple bites....

That was my fault though for not knowing about the lamb part.

Everyone else in my group enjoyed their food. 
Heard the steak dish for 2 people wasn't THAT great though.

I'd recommend you try something different. something more exotic.
they have some daring dishes here.
