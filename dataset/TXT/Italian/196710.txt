pOhX1XjbBdPoO2Fyy8RGJg My husband and I joined my best friend and her parents for dinner. We had a hilarious, outstanding server. We shared a pizza which was delicious. The side salad was huge and full of veggies and cheese. The creamy Italian dressing was a hit. My husband had mussels for dinner and he described them as clean and the garlic wine sauce was very flavorful. I got the gnocchi. They were okay but the sauce left little to be desired. It tasted very bland. I'm glad everyone else enjoyed their meal at the table but I know I'd rather go to other Italian restaurants before returning here.
