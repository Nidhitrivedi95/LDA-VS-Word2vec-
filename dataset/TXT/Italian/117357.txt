GxfgOFgUhv2rfr3FXVWfCg So far, the pizza is great. My daughter loves it and she's pretty picky. We usually get pepperoni with marinara sauce. Everything else though, aside from the drinks, is not so great. The mozzarella cheese sticks, NY cheesecake, tiramisu, chocolate chip cookie pie and wontons have all been kind of gross. Tastes as if they were frozen and then thawed and/or heated up. I still order from them but just the pizza. They are courteous and usually on time if not early. They even offer plates and napkins with each order. I may try something else on the menu just out of curiosity. If the pizza is good, there should be at least one other item on the menu that's just as good.
