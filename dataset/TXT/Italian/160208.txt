LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw It is a sad time for long time fans of Oregano's as they have stop offering all drums on the Buffalo wings. You now can choose 10 or 14 and it is 60% regular wings and 40% drums. Sucks. It was the only place where you could get all drums. Now they don't set themselves apart as far as the Buffalo wings go. I gave it a two stars only cause the size is still descent. Oh well, when I want wings, it don't matter now and I won't have to wait an hour to be seated.
