pOhX1XjbBdPoO2Fyy8RGJg The food was decent-nothing extraordinary. It was overpriced and the salad and bread were underwhelming.The salad was iceberg lettuce, purple cabbage and cherry tomatoes in a very small Styrofoam bowl. The bread was not toasted and seemed to be purchased from a grocery chain.For 15 dollars I expected more portions and better quality sides. Establishment takes cash only.
