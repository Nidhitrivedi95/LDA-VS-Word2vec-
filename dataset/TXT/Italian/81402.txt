dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw My boyfriend ate here over New Years and had a great experience, so during another visit to Vegas, he decided it'd be a great place to take me.

We arrived and were seated promptly on time. The decor of the restaurant was beautiful, but they seated us at the very front next to the open walkway for hotel guests and it was a little too distracting and loud for my preference. 

The waiter we had was monotone and very bland. Wasn't really interested in giving suggestions or checking in - mostly just took our orders and delivered the food. He was also quite behind on refilling waters as both of us had to ask twice. 

The food, however, was a good thing. We ordered the bleu cheese and arugula salad, which I could've eaten the entire bowl of. The parmesan crisps in the bread basket were salty and delicious to accompany our drinks.

As for the main courses, I ordered the sea bass with panzanella and my guest had the short rib ravioli. The former was just ok. The fish was cooked well, but didn't have much flavor. The salad dressing was the best thing on the plate, while the panzanella barely had any bread in it! More like a plain salad with some croutons. The ravioli, on the other hand, saved the day. The truffle sauce was maybe the best sauce I've tasted and you could taste the short ribs perfectly.

All in all, this wasn't a terrible meal but it wasn't what I expected from a quality Italian restaurant.
