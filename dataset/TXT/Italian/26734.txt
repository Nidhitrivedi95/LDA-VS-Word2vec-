4Odbtgh9g8XUKorRg7MTHg We thoroughly enjoyed our first experience at IAC. Table 101 was great with excellent waiter Rene and the band nearby was the perfect environment.

Food was Delish.  Fried calamari with remoulade and marinara sauces was an excellent starter. Caesar served in parmesan bowl was unique and tasty.  Pasta carbonara was perfectly executed as was my wife's filet of sole. Cannoli and cappuccino  ended the meal on a high note. 

Spend a few minutes on you way out to check out the photo wall - shots of Sinatra, Bennett, Damone, Martin, Steve & Edie - pretty cool. The place was a hangout for the Ratpack in the 60's.
