It has been featured several times on the Food Network, and was on an episode of Guy Fieri's "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives," which have definitely put the restaurant on the map. 

Everything about the place has character.  For example, the menu has standard hamburgers, as well as unique and tasty items like the Ahi Sandwich, or whatever special they happen to offer that is not on the menu.  When I was there, they were offering Pork Tenderloin and fresh-squeezed lemonade.  Everything we got was great. 

The restaurant itself is located on a working farm, and has a nifty little outdoor seating area with benches underneath a huge and ancient pepper tree that provides some shade from the heat of the sun.  There is also a little grassy area where kids can run around, play, or have a picnic.  After you eat, you can also walk through various areas of the farm.  You can make your visit here a short one, or stay all afternoon.  There's a lot to see. 

Though there are only two bathrooms, they are clean, and feature old school barbies and G.I. Joes in stainless steel, LED-lit cases in the walls.  They've also got old episodes of the Thunderbirds playing on small T.V.'s.  It's unique and compellingly awesome, like so much about this restaurant. 

Be advised, however, that it can get slammed with customers on the weekends, and if you don't get there before the rush, be prepared to wait!  This is despite the fact that they are prepared to handle volume and pump out the food at an incredibly fast pace. 

Overall if you are in the area, this place is worth trying at least once, for the experience.  In my opinion it's worth going back several times, just to try all the food.
