uqYB53z5GrtzJq8WHTF-xg Will never return to this OG. Reasons:
1. Slowwww service. All the waitresses were friendly enough, but there is some serious inefficiency. No matter how crowded a restaurant is or how backed up in the kitchen, it should never take 10 minutes to get drinks. 
2. I know Olive Garden isn't known for its high food quality, but I do expect some consistency with national chain menus. Tonight I tried the new creamy mushroom sauce. Pictured below is what I found at the bottom of the bowl. Yuck. Also, I found a solitary potato chunk in the noodles?
3. Nasty bathrooms
4. You may not believe it, but the inside of my water glass smelled musty. I thought it may have been a fluke, but then read other reviews on here complaining about various odors at this particular establishment
