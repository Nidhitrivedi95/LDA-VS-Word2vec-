WyKJkdw7PEZD1I0qtPN17w Absolutely delicious! Super friendly staff and great service. Had a lovely dinner. I tried the eggplant park and they gave me the option of broccoli instead of pasta, which helped me to lighten up my meal so I could have some more yummy bread, hehe. The Napoleon was super delicious too! The cream filling was amazing.
