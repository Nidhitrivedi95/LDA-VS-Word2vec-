fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg When a waiter takes an order by memory, his accuracy must be 100% or he opens himself up to criticism.

Guess what?

He forgot an entree. 

There were just 2 of us and 4 dishes between us.  He apologized after delivering the dish about 20 mins after the others came, telling us the kitchen was backed up. If that was the case, why were the other dishes on time and why did he act surprised when we reminded him of our missing dish? Just own up to it! Btw, he ended up comping the dish.

Portions were not huge, so take advantage of the low prices and double up on your orders!
