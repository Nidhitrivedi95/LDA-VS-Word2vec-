JPjckeTpc-Y4dXEPS17JiA Normally I wouldn't bother to write a review for a Pizza Hut. Or even check in on Yelp. Some secrets are best kept in the family. It's Pizza Hut after all. Everyone knows what they're going to get. 

So what's the motivation this time? I noticed some really bad recent reviews for the carry out location I occasionally use. The workers there, however, are consistently nice and really seem to be trying to do a good job given the limitations that Pizza Hut presents. I just wanted to give them a little "thumbs up". 

Three stars, the maximum rating allowed by law for a Pizza Hut.
