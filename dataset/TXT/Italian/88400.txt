DZhcJ89A6lTE7a8GYeG1VA After a long day of touring Old Montreal, we needed a break. We came across this italian deli and coffee shop. I'm glad we did. The owner and staff  we awesome, very helpful. The sandwiches are fresh prepared in front of you. The coffee was perfect. If I lived in Montreal this would be a regular stop!
