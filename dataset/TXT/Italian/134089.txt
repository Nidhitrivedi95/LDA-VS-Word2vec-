IqH-J1D0HIP9wyJs2q_uGQ Decided I wanted a canzone for lunch and wasn't sure whether I wanted to go to Mellow Mushroom or not. It wasn't busy and I was seated as soon as I walked in. The guy who seated me also took my drink order, then placed my food order as soon as he came back. After that, I was subsequently ignored. The waitress only checked on me once and that was from the middle of the room. She didn't even refill my drink until I asked for my check. The calzone itself was ok. It seemed like they simply slapped ricotta and mozzarella in without a care, instead of mixing it together. But, maybe that's just how they make their calzones. There was also no seasoning used, it relied only on the various flavors of the ingredients.
