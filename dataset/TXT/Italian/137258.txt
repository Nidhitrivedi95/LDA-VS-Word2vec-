j4s9X08gDTZH3MwcByfCHQ I ordered through GrubHub recently, and was really disappointed. We got 2 burger, 2 fries, 2 drinks special. First of all, the drinks were missing. GrubHub reimbursed us for those. The fries were soggy, very obviously, pre-frozen (not fresh) fries. The burgers were really gross. They were pre-frozen boxed burgers, and barely tasted like meat at all. These were not even Bubba Burgers, which aren't that bad. The taste resembled a bad frozen veggie burger. We couldn't even eat them, and honestly we're not that picky. We got "Jumbo" wings, which were exactly the same size as every other pizza place's regular wings (not jumbo at all). They were okay. But they don't put tin foil in their containers, so if the driver sets the bag on it's side, you will end up with wing sauce all through your bag and on every other container in there. This is what happened to us. It honestly wasn't worth the money we paid. I can't vouch for how their pizza is because we didn't try it, and since we're never ordering from Pizza Pronto again, we never will.
