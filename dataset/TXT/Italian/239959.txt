UbwOMRjGtQnwwRF2Afnt6Q This is quite a quirky Zizzi. Why? Because you can get spectacular views across the Forth on a clear day. What's more if the Scottish weather is particularly feeling nice, you can even sit outside and eat! Ta Dah! (although on this occasion the second bit we did not do!).

Right. Food.  That all important thing we devour.

They have a menu from which you can choose 2 or 3 courses for £10.95 or £13.95 - which I think is pretty darn good.

I didn't go with the deal option as I spotted my favourite, Arancini of course and a cheese dipping fondue on the main menu!  We shared this between the three of us and was quite satisfactory for starters.

Main was ok.  Seasoning or depth of flavour was missing for me.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't up there.  I had the pappardelle pollo fungi - a tomato sauce with mushrooms and chicken. 

We skipped desserts but had coffee. It wasn't the best as I had to add sugar and my mum didn't finish her (that's saying something massive, without saying anything).
