I gave my credit card to Scarpetta'swaiter on 12/31/12 around 11:15pm to pay our New Year Eve dinner bill. 2 preset menus, A la carte filet for my daughter, champagne and generous gratuity. Slightly over $1000.00. So far nothing wrong.
We left the restaurant and went back home. Around  0:05am on 01/01/13. someone at Scarpetta ran my credit card again. This time for $864,--
I noticed the issue a couple of days later. I did call Scarpetta and explained the situation to the hostess. She assured me that the manager would return my call and would certainly correct this mistake. The manager never called me back.
I filed a claim with my credit card company the next day as I did not want to waste my time calling Scarpetta again or drive there to try resolving this error. My credit card company credited back my account right away. However, Scarpetta did resubmit the charge along with apparently supporting documentation. My guess is that the so called supporting documentation is copy of card credit card receipt with some sort of a forged signature). Unfortunately, my credit card company had to re-bill the charge to my account and now I must provide my credit card company with additional information/documentation to support my claim.
Since I must now waste my time supporting my claim, I will also file a police report. I am probably not an isolated case.  BRAVO SCARPETTA
