wWDNwNb6ygJorKujOuifhA This is a real bummer because I had reasonable expectations for this place. Living less the. 30 feet away for 2 months I finally ordered the sporcacciano pizza which I had hoped would be 'loaded'. To me utter disappointment, there were only 4 pepperonies and maybe 3 pieces of prosciutto on the entire pizza. And for 15$ after tax, I just feel like I was ripped off. sure the pizza did taste pretty good but for the money, size, & quality, I just don't think that this will be a return spot for me. I hope that the pastas fare better but I don't plan on wasting more money on a mediocre portion. pros- pizza was done in 10 minutes! cons-watery sauce, SCARCE toppings. any recommendations people? prosciutto & fig is my favorite but hard to get right for some reason.
