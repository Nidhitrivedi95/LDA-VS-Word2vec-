D1lAVtlav4atQTJnIvtcpw A bit upscale restaurant serves Italian cuisine. The restaurant is gorgeous and very modern and spacious! There is available seating outside as well with plenty of room. I sat outside and the seats were in the shade so it did not feel too hot! Thank goodness!! 

The menu is great! There were plenty of options to choose from and they have different endless amount of drinks and a beautiful full bar. I ordered the Spagetti Bufala which is just regular Spagetti. My dish was good and the perfect amount, not overwhelming! Before the main course we ordered the cheese board that I highly recommend! It comes with jam and coated walnuts that my friends loved (I personally don't eat walnuts). The cheeseboard was a perfect appetizer and it was 6 of us! The wine was perfect with the cheese! 

The service was great! We loved our waitress she was so nice and always checked on us. The food was served quickly too. 

The food wasn't pricey but the quality was great! 

Overall I enjoyed the experience and I would recommend this restaurant to others.
