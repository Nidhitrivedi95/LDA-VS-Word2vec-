dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw This was my last meal in Vegas and I was quite pleased! We had to change our reservation time a few times, and they were more than accommodating.

The menu is pretty large and balanced - plenty of appetizers, salads, pastas, and main courses to choose from (and dessert!). I settled on the special pasta for the day which was the penne in a cream truffle sauce with pancetta and peas. I thought it was really good! Could have used a touch more salt for my taste, but that's my preference, nothing to knock the dish for. My friend had the short rib ravioli and she devoured it within a few minutes (sorry if you are reading this, but, you did). My other friend got the mezzaluna, and hers was by far my favorite dish of all of ours. The cherry tomato sauce was tangy and tasty and the filling was flavorful (ricotta, basil)

I was really impressed by the extensive wine list. They have glasses ranging from $8 for the wine liker and more expensive for the wine afficionado. You can definitely find something of your taste and your budget. And they have so many wines - over 200 I would say. I would die to see their wine cellar.

Service was excellent from the moment we arrived and were greeted by the hostess, to our server, to the management who came over to ensure everything was going well. I would definitely go back the next time I am in Vegas!

The restaurant is also absolutely beautiful. And, we had a seat where you could do a ton of people watching of people walking through the MGM. Win win!
