FOzChvW-f6mp0BGbrS-ywQ Esthetically, the restaurant is lovely, modern and vibrant. We ate here on a busy Saturday night after hearing from locals that Il Ponte was top notch - their glowing reviews was far from what we experienced. The serving staff appeared overwhelmed and disorganized and we felt more like an inconvenience than we did patrons. The food wasn't much better. I ordered the linguine frutti di mare -$24- (pasta with seafood) a mediocre dish that was made worse by the fact that the seafood wasn't washed properly and every mouthful came with a bunch of grit. The absence of mussels in my dish (as stated on the menu) was curious but I overheard the server telling someone else that mussels weren't in season (they're available fresh at any seafood place year-round). The baccala -$28- that my mother-in-law ordered was too salty. Someone should also tell the servers that for Italians, it's blasphemy to put grated cheese on fish. My fiancé ordered the orata -$29- which was good but not staller. We didn't even consider desert because everything else took so long that we just wanted to get out of there.  

They could have just had a bad night but the signs point to a need for more experienced staff. My reservation was never logged - thankfully they had a table open or it would have been an embarrassing start to the evening. We ordered sparking water and the waiter just plunked the bottle on the table and didn't pour it for us. We were also left to fill our own wine glasses throughout the night. It points to rookie staff that were too overwhelmed to handle the volume and cracked under the pressure. 

The restaurant has potential but with so many great spots in the area that deliver consistently, why would I bother coming back?
