yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Just took our son with a big group of friends and family to celebrate his 21st birthday on our visit to Vegas.  Been here many times....no it's not 5 start dining, but the food is good, portions are big, the place is fun for a group, and service is good....gotta see/hear Gordie and his accordian.  Just go, drink the 'free' wine and have a blast...
