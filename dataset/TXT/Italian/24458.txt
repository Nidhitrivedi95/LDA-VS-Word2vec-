4BBda3yy_8GXGmYLcgggHw We went to this place on a Friday night around 7:30 PM. We had a reservation. When we arrived it was not busy, but by 9 PM it was packed. We got the sausage pizza and Calamari to share between 2 people. The pizza was good, the Calamari was a little too sweet for my taste. 
Overall it is a nice place to hang out with friends.
