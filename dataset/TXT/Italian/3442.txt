_AVXgkX4DiNQAQj_3tNhFQ I dined here for a business lunch yesterday. Glad we had reservations because the restaurant became full very quickly at 12pm. Although the kitchen turned out our dishes very quickly, the service was lacking throughout the entire meal. We were not greeted by our waiter or asked if we wanted to order drinks. He showed up after 15 minutes asking if we were ready to order food and we never saw our waiter again until he brought us the bill.

Despite the terrible service, the flavour of the food was spot on. I ordered the rigatoni with brisket and pork Bolognese. My pasta was a little more al dente than I like, but the sauce more than made up for it. Overall, this is a convenient location next to my office with great food. I will dine here again.
