JB065aFyfEl8mRAIUT0b8g Had some take out from here last night. Pizza, pasta and salad were all fresh and delicious. Thin crust, wood oven pizza with prosciutto artichoke and black olives. Spicy penne with sausage and leaks. Caesar salad.  Would recommend them all! Portions were on the smaller end but certainly did not take away from enjoying the food.
