Nf9s7ULgb0Shnc5Mr7JweQ Really great local pizza. Probably the best crust I've had in a while. Very inexpensive for Pittsburgh but you can taste quality ingredients. They don't have many specialty pizzas. So, don't call in an ask for the works. They don't have it. But if you want a delicious shredded Italian sausage pizza, or a white pizza with tomatoes, they got you.
