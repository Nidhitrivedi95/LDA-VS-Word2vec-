2NiBvT5zL272IRcxru_x9A We went here for a family dinner and were sadly disappointed in the food.

The service was GREAT, very friendly and attentive, restaurant is very cool but the food was totally bland. I ordered Mussels limone - pasta with lemon garlic caper sauce, mussels and lemon zest - sounds delicious right? Absolutely NO flavor or seasoning. Literally tasted of boiled pasta with mussels on top. Very disappointing. Kids ordered pepperoni pizza and again, was just extremely bland, no flavor or seasoning.

To be fair, the server did not charge us for the 2 pasta dishes which was appreciated but I would have preferred a tasty meal in the first place.

This was our second visit to this restaurant as the first visit was the same - bland food - but we decided to give it another try. Sadly, we will not be returning.
