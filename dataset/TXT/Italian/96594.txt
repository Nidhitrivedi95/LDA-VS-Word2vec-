esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA The oysters are like pearls of goodness....rich, fresh and succulent.  There are plenty of restaurants to choose in Vegas, and since it was my last night at Harrahs with the hubby, I really just wanted to stay in the hotel, find a good place to eat without compromising flavor.  Voila ... Oyster Bar! 

We sat at the bar and Trent our server, who's been working there for 19 years was super fabulous.  His service was impeccable and really showed that he loves his job. 

So I ordered the Grilled Oysters with Garlic-Parmesan Butter and Alaskan King Crab Cocktails....both hit the spot!  I came here for Oysters and even the crab legs did not disappoint.  Overall, we had a great experience and walked away with a happy tummy.

So will I come back here again ...Absolutely!
