pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ I bought a theater ticket which included a meal. I presented the voucher and my family was seated. The waiter was nice but we could tell she did not want to service customers with vouchers. They gave us bread with olive oil, cheese and balsamic vinegar which was not good. The meal came with a house salad which was just ok. I had the chicken Marsala which was bland and had not much flavor. When dinner was finished, the waitress brought a bill with the cost of the drinks and in large red ink a suggested amount of about $100.00 for dinner so tip needs to be at least $20.00!  I am sorry that your  employer does not pay you enough but I should not be expected to compensate poor service.
