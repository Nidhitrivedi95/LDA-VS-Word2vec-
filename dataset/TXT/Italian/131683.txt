We had random servers stop by our table to chat. I've never experienced that a restaurant before! After our meal a worker outside asked us how everything was and gave us a bunch of tips about the tremont area. She talked about how much she loved working there and told us a lot about the food.  In fact all the workers seemed happy and that means their boss is great and that makes me happy as a customer. 

Calamari appetizer: fresh, good but too salty for me
Foccacia bread and hummus: delicious!
Cheese polenta: delicious
Pasta cabenera (sp?): good but too salty for me. 
Desserts: hello...amazing. I am a dessert expert and this is one of my new top dessert places in CLE. (my favorite was the chocolate crem brulee)

I thought all the food was fresh and expertly prepared but i didn't love how salty some things were.  However i definitely want to come back and try other things. There is a cool table in the vault and it would be fun to eat there on a special occasion!
