exz9aZqMqjpqzUOFBAl9Gg Met with an employee today for a meeting and then decided to try this place out. Didn't know where anything was so when we saw an Italian restaurant, we decided to stop.

The overall atmosphere was the same everywhere. Dim, romantic, not the atmosphere we were looking for. But, as we were hungry and it was 8-9 pm, whatever right?

The service wasn't very good. We waited quite a long time for the person to show up with our drinks. Nothing special either.

The food portions were quite large. Once the appetizer got to the table, I regretted ordering it. I knew I wouldn't be able to finish my pasta. 

The food was good, not amazing, just good. If I wanted to be very picky, the pasta was a ligule bit soft, but it was still pretty average.

Overall, it was a very average restaurant.
