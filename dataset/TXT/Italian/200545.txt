pvCcrHFAGCml492qoQBsQg My fiancée and I completely agree Ricci's has hands down the best Panzerotto anywhere in Vaughan and in the GTA. There salads are huge and very flavorful, their pastas are fresh and also a great size.  If you're looking for amazing Italian food at a fast food atmosphere, Ricci's is the place to go.  Kudos on upgrading your location, very beautiful.
