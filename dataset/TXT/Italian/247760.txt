VcGyezSNtkNBr2HidcaM1A I love this pizza! I was looking to try a different pizza place and saw this on Yelp. It's not too far from my house and I didn't know it was there. It's kind of tucked back in a plaza that I drive by all the time. I called and placed a take out order and they were very friendly on the phone and in person. It's a nice little place and I will be back for a sit down meal. The pizza was incredible and so was the garlic bread. I have found a new favorite that I will go back again and again.
