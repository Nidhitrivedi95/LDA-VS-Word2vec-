nOkSC1GtMUJ_I70sb0SaeQ This pie was fantastic, and I don't say that easily. Being from the East coast, I am pretty unimpressed with pizza out west. My wife regularly makes fun of me for saying that something is "good for the west coast" this pizza is not west coast good though, it is just plain GREAT. The crust is a perfect crispy shell with chewy bread. The sauce is mild but delicious and the cheese is great, and real. I am a big fan of their specialty pies, which are pretty reasonably priced for how much goes into them.

With their Yelp special, eating here is a no brainer. Hell, I would eat here anyway.
