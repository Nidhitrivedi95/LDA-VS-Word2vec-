E9b73ETPw0VYUJ2_YSJJdQ Went here for lunch last weekend with some friends, let's just say both the service and food could have been a lot better. 

To begin with, we didn't even get menus until we requested them ... 

After that, the owner went on to bash Wahlburgers across the street complaining that they take away all of his business and that their food is crap, etc. Well sorry to break it to you buddy, but instead of blaming other restaurants on your lack of customers, maybe you should look around and see what you can improve upon! 

Here are my suggestions: 
-Provide free bread to each table, it's a small gesture that goes a long way, and is the norm in Italian restaurants 
-Don't bash other restaurants in front of customers, it's extremely unprofessional! 
-Focus on more quality dishes and a less extensive menu, the menu was huge and I was not impressed with how much I paid for such a small serving of cannelloni 
-Customers should be acknowledged right away, there's no reason it should've taken so long for us to even see the menu 

Hopefully you see this and take it to heart. I had previously heard great things about this restaurant!
