c5x6HWB8MTZvlTgabihaSw I would give this place no stars if I could. It pains me that this place is even listed as an Italian restaurant. As an Italian-American I do understand good quality Italian food. This place served quite the opposite with pre-made frozen raviolis and stale bread. The service was awful and slow. Had a rude waitress. Do not recommend!!
