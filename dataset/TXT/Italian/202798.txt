q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Horrible. The bread has changed. Bread sticks cut in half, stale. The salads are a third of the size and the dressing is out of a bottle. Waited 45 minutes for our entrees and my chicken Parmesan was cold, my dads lasagna was so burnt you couldn't even cut it with a knife, brothers penne alla vodka was mushy and over cooked and the meatball on the spaghetti tasted like dog food. It was so in edible we all spit it out. The best thing of the night was my glass of chianti. I felt bad for out poor server who was extremely friendly but had no control over the disgusting food. We all got home and had stomach aches even though we just had salad and bread! VOID AT ALL COST!
