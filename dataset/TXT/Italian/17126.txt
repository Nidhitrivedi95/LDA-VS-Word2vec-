2A1wvIFdKQZZe-vtTO7olQ I only got a carryout pizza, so can't justify giving five stars based on that alone, but guarentee that I will be going back very soon based on my pizza, and the carryout menu I picked up when I was there.  They have a ton more going on than just pizza, and lots of the options looked amazing, but I am on my mission to try all the pizza around Cleveland.  
Got a proscuitto and onion pizza, and it was perfect in almost every way.  The bacon-y meat was crispy, crunchy, and perfect, and the onions were not cooked to death, and had just a bit of snap left to them.  The cheese was a good quality, and there was just the right amount.  After looking back at how I am describing this, I think I figured out the perfect word to describe it "Goldilocks Pizza".  Most of the time there is one component off on a pizza, but none of them were here, which brings me to my last "just right" part of the pizza.  The crust was good.  Had a crispiness to the outside, and was just doughy enough, not too thick or thin.  The one thing that excapes my mind is the sauce.  I will do further research and get back to you asap.
