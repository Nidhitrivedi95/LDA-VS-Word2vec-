G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Ok, Great Spot. Service was average. My wife LOVED it, I thought it was good. Good as in, not craving to come back, but if a friend wanted to go I would. Bread Solid, Salad good, Pasta, Pappardelle was average. Wife had Risotto and loved it. Now, I'm not a seafood person and the menu is heavy in that, so maybe I'm a bit skewed.
