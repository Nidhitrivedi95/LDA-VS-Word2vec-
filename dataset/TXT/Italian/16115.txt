1vSag1McXH4KgRJHupJapw For a mall restaurant, I generally keep my expectations low, but this was definitely a pleasant surprise! It was also packed for a Saturday night with people of all ages.

The pizza was great with an interesting-looking crust, with pesto sauce. The pasta was also excellent. A glass of wine was a reasonable price.

Convenient if you're headed to a show across the street at Place Des Arts. You don't even have to walk outside to get there, just use the RESO!
