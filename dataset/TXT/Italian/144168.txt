Jxbw1bIsLvZ3UAvN59xj8Q Hidden above a busy pub (in itself a great place for pre-meal drinks) the New Bell is a modern restaurant in the Newington area of Edinburgh.

The food is splended, with the Guinea Fowl main being a particular hit with me and my fellow diners. The staff are friendly and helpful, but without being over bearing while we were thrying to enjoy our meal. There is also a lunch menu available. 

The New Bell has an informal atmosphere more akin to a small cafe than a restaurant, giving it a relaxed and friendly vibe over all.

At the end of the night I was more than suprised at how much the meal had come to, in contrast to other restaurants of this standard. Despite the slighty expensive prices, it was agreed that the night had been a success, and we would return.
