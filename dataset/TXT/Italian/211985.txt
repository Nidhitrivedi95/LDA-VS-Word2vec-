r2BP0Irh63hqYUDSZd0ijQ Haven't been here in several years. Mainly because the food was not great and it was getting on in the years. 

BUT after the remodel and a shake up on the menu. And I believe a change in management. I have been here twice and the Food is much better than you would find in a chain. Wait staff is very at attentive and friendly.  Good for just about any occasion.
