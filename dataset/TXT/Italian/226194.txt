SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg I ordered a medium pepperoni (like $15) which is one step up from a personal pizza.  Ok, not cheap but ok.  It was super hot - great - but when I got home and looked at the pizza it TRULY could have been a FROZEN pizza.  You know how the crust on frozen is flat and kind of tastes like cardboard?  That described the crust.  The other disappointing thing was there was NO pizza "bone" on the crust.  The doughy end part.  It was flat all the way to the ends but not a traditional thin crust pizza. If you look closely at their photo you can kind of tell this but I did not look super closely as I never dreamed I would receive a pizza like this for this price.  When I placed the order I asked if it was a typical round pizza and was told it was a traditional New York Style pizza - more like a traditional frozen pizza. Red Rock was also empty of any customers. Next time I will do even MORE homework until I find that perfect pizza! Too bad, I could have had frozen for cheaper and same or better pizza. Bummer!
