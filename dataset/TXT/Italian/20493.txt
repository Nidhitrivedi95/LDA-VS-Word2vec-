Right after the four of us paid paid several hundred dollars for dinner, we were asked to vacate our table because someone else was waiting for it. Wait, what?! None of us will ever go there again nor will we recommend it. Too bad because one of the group is on the board of a large public company HQ in Charlotte. Stagioni won't get a second chance to make a good first impression.
