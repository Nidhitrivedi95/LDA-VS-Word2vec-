ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA The salads alone will bring me back, but sadly this spot is not kid friendly even for my little foodie.  Most of the menu is spicy, and when I ordered the salad without dressing, it came doused anyway.  The ribs were tender, a little over charred but serviceable.  Not sure that we'll be back in the summer - but the outdoor dining looks inviting for fall.  Wish the menu had less spicy options for my little foodie.  She is a well behaved adventurous diner, but we felt out of place here.  We don't do kid menus, and the team seemed non-plused to point out the few dishes that had no heat.  Surely this can't only be a child's preference?
