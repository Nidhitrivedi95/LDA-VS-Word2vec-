lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ It was a Sat. evening, so it was pretty busy. First time here, so unfamiliar with the rules of this place. They have two sides...A takeout side when you order and seat yourself and a side where you are seated and then order.

We ordered a slice of pizza from the takeout side..not really thinking...and after deciding we would rather sit at a table...we waited to be seated. After being seated we informed the hostess that we ordered from the togo side, wherein we were told by a manager I'm guessing (who was very pleasant) we would have to order more food if we wanted to sit at a table. Okay, not a problem :) let's do it...and she left.

Then the waitress came over and ...if looks could kill...we would be dead...lol. She was extremely rude and refused to hear the fact that we were going to order more food. Once my date left the table to check on why the food was taking so long, she walked over and demanded I leave....and at that point I lost my appetite and didn't want to even bother causing a scene or addressing the manager... there was really no reason to ruin our night over whatever issue this waitress was having. Customer service is not a priority here.
