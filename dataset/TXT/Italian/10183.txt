Service was impeccable and food was innovative and had very distinctive flavors. Their free bread basket is so good - had to resist the urge to ask for another basket before the meal. I wasn't the biggest fan of the short rib and bone marrow starter or the duck and foie gras ravioli (it was good but maybe I just don't have the taste for it), but their diver scallops and polenta with mushrooms were amazing! Overall they pasta main courses were fine, but didn't blow us away. The black cod entree was a small portion but delicious. The atmosphere and experience of a nice Vegas restaurant with relatively reasonably priced (by Vegas standards) with several chances to catch the fountain shows... That's what gets you!
