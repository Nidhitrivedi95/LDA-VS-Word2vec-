829Kv1uZJj5q8sr2G0mnvA When you live in the boonies, you are happy to have a decent local pizzeria.  If you are looking for a good simple topping pizza you will not be disappointing.  The topings were just right and the crust was perfect.  If, on the other hand, you get one of their specialty pizzas, ask for a longer bake. The specialty pizzas always come out doughy and unappealing.

The service is so-so, but out here you get what you get.
