zY6f_cFY8HTI3hLlJj3SOg Ordered pizza(personal) 6 wings, basket of fries.  We were in a rush to pick it up, paid $45.00.   All of us got sick!!Then when we went a few days Later to complain about price and quality, we were told a manager would call.  Weeks later and NO call.  Not great customer service!. They just lost a good regular customer!  Now congrats to Rosati's we are regular weekly customers!
