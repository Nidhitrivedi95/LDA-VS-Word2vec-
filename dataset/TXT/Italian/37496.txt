76u0BfurPWxXTEUdkRTefA Went in at 1:00 PM for lunch.  The waiter acknowledge us and told us he would be right with us.  He was in the back folding napkins.  He than went into the back, brought a bill to a table and than went back to folding napkins.  This was about 5 min and other people came in waiting also without any acknowledgment.  I found this very rude and unacceptable, since there was a sign saying wait to be seated. After a few more min. we walked out.  The restaurant was not busy.  Stay away, till they get better waiters. I saw one other waiter who went passed us but didn't make eye contact.
