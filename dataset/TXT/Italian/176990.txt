The bartender is the best you will find. He is a doll, and if you show up regularly he'll know what you like. 

The pizzas are great; we usually get the Capricciosa pizza with the Caprese salad. And lots of bread with olive oil, balsamic vinaigrette, and Parmesan. I could fill up alone on the Caprese salad and bread. 

I honestly can't say anything about the other food, because I've only ever been in for happy hour. It's so good, I never want to go for anything but. 

Be sure to get there early, because the happy hour is only good in the bar area, and there aren't many tables. It fills up quickly.
