UbwOMRjGtQnwwRF2Afnt6Q Zizzi's is the kind of place you know what you will get. It's not going to be spectacular, write home about it kind of food, but it will usually be consistent. It's the kind of place I would never go as a 'destination' dinner, but when grabbing a bite to eat before the cinema it's a fairly reliable go to.

Maybe it's just me but Zizzi's seems to have fallen slightly out of favour, especially since more restaurants have opened up at Ocean Terminal. It feels like where you end up when you forgot to book Pizza Express. 

In it's defense it does offer a far more varied menu than Pizza Express, and there are a lot more pasta and meat dishes. We went for their garlic bread with with caramlised onions served on a rustic board. It's was better than having dough balls, a dish whose popularity I never quite understand.

The meat calzone as a main course was a bit of a disappointment. It looked OK but the filling was lacking in any particular flavour; just a non-distinct tomato-y meaty thing. I have a feeling that a more traditional pizza may have been a better option. 

I've always found the venue itself a bit of a mixed bag. You can get nice views out to the water if you sit at the back. However in general it's in such an open space, it feels very much like you are eating in the food court of a shopping centre rather than a restaurant. Pizza Express upstairs manages to feel a lot warmer and intimate. 

This is not going to be top of my list to come back to at Ocean Terminal, but they often have vouchers and promotions which make it a more attractive option.
