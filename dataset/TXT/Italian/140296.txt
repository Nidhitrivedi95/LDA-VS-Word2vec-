Its all about watching people, having a beer on the patio and enjoying the summer's warmth.
The Cafe Diplimatico is somewhat of a renaissance cafe situated in the heart of Little Italy. Its all about comfort Italian food, fresh baked pasta, and great thin crust Pizza. The service is exceptional, and the entire staff is as good as the food.
This is the place in the summer to relax on the patio, watch the beautiful people walk by, and enjoy the comforts of Little Italy.
