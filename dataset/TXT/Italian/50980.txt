9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg Came here with some girlfriends on Wednesday night. Ordered the fig jam mozzarella and baked carbonara. The fresh mozzarella was pretty tasty. A bit on the pricey side, but definitely worth trying. My carbonara was ok, a little too peppery and found that it wasn't creamy enough. It had some fresh shaved green onion though, which added an interesting taste to the pasta. Atmosphere and service was good. Good place to come with groups.
