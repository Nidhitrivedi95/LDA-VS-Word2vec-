oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw My girlfriends and I stopped by for happy hour (which runs 5pm-close daily). We were seated immediately, but in the "dining only" section of the restaurant. The hostess was accommodating and moved us to the bar, once we specified that we were planning to order from the happy hour menu. 

My friend noticed that there was no difference on pricing between the main menu and happy hour menu, but the happy hour menu did offer a couple of "unique items". It just seemed pointless to have a separate happy hour menu when almost everything was on the full menu and there wasn't anything truly special on it. 

Now, lets get to the adequate food:
$11 margarita pizzetta -- literally you can get this at any Italian restaurant. There wasn't anything special about it. 
Grilled octopus -- looked beautiful. My friend who ordered it was satisfied. I was underwhelmed. 
Chicken parm bites -- they were fine, nothing special to me
Handmade fettuccini with mushrooms, peas, and pea tendrils -- yummy, but it was missing something for me (probably sometime hot). This was the only entree that we ordered. The size was good and the pasta was well made, but it did not blow me away.

I was NOT blown away. The food was good enough, but we had eaten appetizers at a different restaurant before hand. If we hadn't then I would have been sorely disappointed by this restaurant. The price of each dish must be due the brand behind the restaurant. I have no problem spending money on food, but I expected more.
