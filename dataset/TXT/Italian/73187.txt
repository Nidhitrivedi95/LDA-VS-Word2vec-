cKbPGglAjIGG6MeVy7n8XQ This is my favorite pizza place. I would absolutely recommend this place. There are tons of delicious options to choose from, but for my kids, they like pepperoni and black olives. This restaurant does not have black olives, we tried the green olives and my kids loved it. I would also recommend this restaurant because it is very close around were I live. I live in Upper St. Clair. Whenever I am hungry I take my family out to eat here.
