pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. 
I had it to go. The girl that took my order was very friendly. I picked up my food, it was ready as promised. It smelled good but the real test is in the taste. 
I would give it an EXCELLENT! Next time I will ask for more sauce. This place is a MUST revisit! Hey, I know Italian food... I'm from Brooklyn! Lol
