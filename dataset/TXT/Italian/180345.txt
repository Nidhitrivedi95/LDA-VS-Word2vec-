nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Nothing touches this food. Nothing. This is the one restaurant I recommend in Vegas over everything. You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you're in Vegas & looking to eat Italian & don't come here. Don't break the bank at Rao's or Carmine's or some other fine dining Italian restaurant. Eat at the place that feels like home but has the quality of food that can compete with the more expensive places. At those places you're going to pay extra for noodles with your parm. At Buddy V's it's all included for a lower base price. 

I'm not going to give a review based on a specific experience because each time I've gone it's been nothing but the best. Girlfriend and I love it. We start with the meatballs that will blow your mind; I order the chicken parm & she orders something new every time. While you wait, piping hot, fresh bread is delivered to you with classic oils for dipping; however, I'm a much bigger fan of dipping it in the meat sauce that comes with the meatballs. Red wine to wash it all down & I am a very happy man. 

Aesthetically, the restaurant feels like someone's home; classic oldies & doo wop are played throughout the restaurant. Seating has never been an issue for me even when I go at 6 or 7 PM on a Friday or Saturday. Restaurant may be packed, but there's plenty of bar seating. 

Two entrees, an appetizer & a glass of wine runs you roughly $70. Kinda pricey, but well worth it. Servings are huge. Most restaurants in Vegas will run you close to that amount anyways. You came to the wrong city if you're looking to pinch pennies and be frugal.
