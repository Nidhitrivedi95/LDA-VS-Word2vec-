pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Like all others I think the pizza is just ok.  The true hit on the menu is the Spiedini appetizer, Italian fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served hot.  
We arrived Tuesday just after 8p and we were not seated until 1030p but we went knowing what we were in for and enjoyed a wonderful bottle of wine suggested by the helpful and friendly Danielle.  The cheese board was also good & plentiful.  I have been here a number of times tried every pizza on the menu but its just ok and not worth the wait or drive.
