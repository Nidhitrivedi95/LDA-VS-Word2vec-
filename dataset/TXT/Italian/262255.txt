wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg Happy hour is awesome here. The ambience is pretty nice too with plenty of light and a crisp freshness to the place. You can spend a couple of hours here relaxing, eating and drinking while chatting with friends. 

The best thing during happy hour is the board which consists a variety of things from prosciutto to jam to bread at a lower price. That will fill you up. I also had the personal pizza special for the day. Couldn't finish it because of all the food. The vanilla vodka drink was decent. 

So either the board or the pizza will decently fill you up. And probably a mimosa will top off a good experience. About $15 for that during happy hour. Although I didn't mention it yet... The food is really delicious. :)
