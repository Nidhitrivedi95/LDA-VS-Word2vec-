zfOum9_rEhaLAqoAV3nYaQ Fabulous food!  Beautiful restaurant inside with outside patio seating as well.

You have to order the chicken shish kabobs!  Better than homemade.  Delicious chicken (nice portions) fresh onions/bell peppers.  It comes with rice and sautéed vegetables.  All are cooked to perfection.  This entrée is served with an amazing garlic/olive oil dipping sauce that is out of this world!  

We have also tried many things on the menu.  Everything has been flavorful and cooked perfectly.

Highest recommendation!  Great, pleasant service too ~
