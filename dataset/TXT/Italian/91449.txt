EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw I really, really, really have been and was looking forward to coming to this restaurant.  It didnt necessarily disappoint, but wasnt what i thought it would be based on opinions of others. Drinks were okay, the food menu was a bit hard to understand for a 1st timer, but the food was good. Definitely recommend the pig ears for a starter and the short rib for main course. Both amazing.
