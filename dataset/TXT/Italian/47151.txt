8xrwjD-Udv7cm_emVcVo3A This is the absolute, bar none, sweetest pizza ever. By sweet I mean sugary. The sauce is ridiculous. And I could tolerate it if it was the natural sweetness of tomatoes; it is not. They dumped an obscene amount of sugar in there. I couldn't even taste the cheese or the vegetables on the pizza. The only savory taste came from the meatballs, which were not that great. I also had their cheesecake. Not horrible, with a nice cheese tang, but again ungodly sweet for cheesecake. I ordered strawberry cheesecake. It came with a strawberry "topping", and that is used loosely. This had to be the worst topping/jam I have ever eaten. Nothing but sugar, and no fruit taste.
