We showed up at lunchtime on a weekday with a field trip group of 17 high schoolers. Angela, the owner, was very kind and accommodating, and made sure we were taken care of. We let her know what our budget was from our school and she made sure we had plenty to eat and stayed below our budget. The pizza was very good - a perfect combo of crispy and chewy crust, and fresh ingredients. I suggest the garlic & butter sauce with basil, chicken & tomatoes. The supreme was also good. The kids loved it and we had a great time. We are so happy we decided to go with a locally owned restaurant  with hot fresh food rather than going to the processed food chain right next door.
