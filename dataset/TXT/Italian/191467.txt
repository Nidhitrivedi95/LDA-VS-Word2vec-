PF8sx9WxPddAf8qdK6tr0g Oh my ever loving God! If you ever find yourself in Montreal you must RUN to Drogheria Fine for their $5 gnocchi - it is the best gnocchi I've ever had in my entire life! Everything is hand made right there in their tiny shop, and La Nonna is there stirring her secret sauce which is to die for! It's flavorful and perfect.

If you've had gnocchi and didn't like it because you thought it was dense or tough or chewy, this is exactly the opposite. It's like eating tiny bites of perfection. I wanted to bring it home with me (and if I didn't fly to Montreal with only carry-on luggage I would have!).

The portion that you get for $5 is really generous. Seriously - try it. You won't regret it!
