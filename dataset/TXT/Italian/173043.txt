N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg First time I had Chicago style deep dish...I think I'll stick with thin NY style.

I got a small pepperoni to go.  It basically tasted like a hunk of cheese strings with bread and a touch of sauce.
I don't think it was cooked quite enough.  It had very little sauce with only 2 pepperonis on each slice.

What makes thin NY style better is the even distribution (typically) of ingredients.   Chicago deep dish, at least at this place is all cheese with barely any tomato sauce.  

Very disappointed and will never waste my money here again.
