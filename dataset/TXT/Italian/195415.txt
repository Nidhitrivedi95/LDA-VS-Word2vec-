PJVjfGtVc71M0XlUr83teQ What more can you ask for from being from out of town, late, tired and need a place to eat with a 2 year old???? This place is amazing!!!! The prices are affordable and you can't beat $4 draft beers and wait for it... $2 refills???? What is that??? We must introduce that to Los Angeles!!!!  As soon as we walked in Grant greeted us and told us about the favorites! Then moved on to Kyle who told us about the drafts and his recommendations! The guys here are very hospitable and very attentive to our needs and kept checking on us to make sure we are ok. We arrived close to closing but Grant made us feel at home and didn't rush at all!!! We are here for a good 2 months and this is the best place to unwind after a long week and eat great tasting pizza, salad, addicting garlic rolls, tasty crisp draft beers, and OMG the chocolate chip cookie, YUMMY!!! Love this place and the staff!!! Grant is the best host!!!!
