I'm definitely not a fan of hip, trendy places with no substance so I was wary, but the food and service delivered 100 percent.  The gnocchi appetizer was delicious.   The caesar salad was a bit cheese-heavy but still good.   I was feeling adventurous so I tried the Scallop Risotto with beets and spinach.  Amazing!   My boyfriend had the spaghetti and meatballs and though the pasta seemed a bit thick to be a spaghetti, it was all really good.   

If you still have room, get some dessert.   They make their own liquors there - I tried the orangecello to go with the chocolate molten cake, but they also have lime, lemon and seasonal strawberry.   Strong but good.    The cake was everything I wanted it to be.   Yum!

As for our service, we sat upstairs and were not wanting for more water, drinks, food, etc.   He was really on top of his game and made the experience that much better.
