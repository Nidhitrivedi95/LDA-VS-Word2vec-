cpkBJhBujpBFZ0rOItE-4g I am just going on record stating that I visited this establishment with one Italian and one Belgium.  These guys are tough on restaurants and complained the whole week about the crappy Phoenix cuisine.   Ruffino hit a home run with both of my business colleagues.

Appetizers - 

Sauteed Mussels in white garlic sauce.  Spectacular.  Hint - take the garlic bread and dip in in the sauce.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Bruscheta - old skool and tasty, the only complaint is that true Italian Bruscheta does not have Balsamic Vinegar drenched on it.  I loved it, the Euro boys did not.

Antipasto Platter - Lots of tasty stuff on this very large plate of goodies.

Soup - Reviews for Lobster Bisque were stellar.  My take - to much cream, not enough lobster chunks, in fact, none.  Tasted like cream soup.  Just not for me, I would rate in 2 stars or 5 out of 10, mediocre.

Dinner (we shared)

Veal Parmigiana - About an 7 out of 10, kind of no flavor.  Decent but not the best I have had.  Served with grill veggies, which were excellent.

Seafood Ruffino - 10 out of 10.  Just plain to die for.  Lives up to my fellow Yelpers recommendations.

Cannelloni Florentine - Excellent.  10 out of 10.  Served with a cream gravy. 

Wine selection is excellent.  What impressed the Euro boys the most is the excellent Limoncello to finish off the meal.   Very happy eating, indeed.
