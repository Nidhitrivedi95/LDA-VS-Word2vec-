LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA This weekend I had a beautiful private dining experience at Maggiano's at Fashion Show.  My friends hosted my baby shower in a private room (with a great view and patio included!) for 30 people, passed appetizers, food table, dessert table and open bar.  It turned out beautifully and I could not be happier!  We worked with Sabrina, banquet manager, who was superb.  She recommended a menu (which was delicious and everyone loved the food!) for my mixed group (vegetarians, kids and adults), and helped us orchestra a budget that worked for the hosts.  I cannot tell you how grateful I am to have someone so lovely and gracious be a part of my special afternoon with my dear friends and family.
I would do this again the exact same way and I'm looking for reasons to book another get-together in the same spot.
