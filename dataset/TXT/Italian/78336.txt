D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA We had a great experience trying EVO. The food was delicious and quite different, and we would definitely return for if. The pizza and pastas were great but the EVO salad stole the show. We were pretty disappointed with the service though. Our waitress wasn't clear about what was on the menu for vegetarians and wasn't too responsive to any of our questions. She did have a few good suggestions when we were struggling to decide what to order. Her suggestions on proportioning though were very off so I am glad we didn't go with those. The food came out very slowly which was fine for our group since we were conversing, but in a smaller group I think could have been frustrating. We ordered a bottle of wine when ordering our food and we didn't receive it until after our food was served so we ready had to drink it quickly and were unable to enjoy it. They also didn't allow us to taste the wine before pouring for everyone.  Overall, great food choices and good atmosphere (but don't go when a live band is playing because you can't even hear yourself think).
