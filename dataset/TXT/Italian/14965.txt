1muT5zEqoC4qp9ms08qJtQ I was not impressed. The sauce was amazing and the cheese was to die for but the crust was a mix between garlic bread and corn bread but it was overbuttered, crunchy, and hard.

It's the first week in phoenix so I will give them the benefit of the doubt. 

I had the wings they were great and I love that they had large pitchers of beer. I did not like the padding of paper at the bottom of the wings and I mentioned it to the manager when she walked around and asked. She turned as away and inored my comment. Don't add fluff to your wings to make it look like you gave me a lot of wings. It was six not a dozen as the buket made it seem. I was disappointed in being fooled. I have no problem ordering a second bucket, had I known it was only 6 wings. (-/+)
