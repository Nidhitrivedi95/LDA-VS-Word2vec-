hpjtDzqQeP6WyLwKpephYg Tried spaghetti with tomato sauce and grilled chicken as well as a sausage panini.

Both were pretty good. The panini was slightly better in my opinion. It was a pretty big portion so the price is justified, can easily share one for lunch. The white Italian bread was quite delicious and the toppings were tasty although not particularly flavourful. In fact the whole panini lacked a lot of flavour but somehow hit the right buttons. The sausage tasted great though so can't complain.

Spaghetti was cooked just right and the sauce was also quite good. Not as good as what you get at Abruzzo but quite good nonetheless.

Service was quick and upbeat. The owners/staff are still getting used to the pace and their customers but I suspect they will be successful as the quality of the food is pretty good.

One thing I noticed they sell pizza by slice however they seemed to keep the pizza not under a warming lamp so not quite sure how they plan to serve the slices, whether they will reheat them or whatnot. Just something to be aware and maybe the restaurant can improve on.

There was no menu or take out menu so I took a shot of the wall menu and uploaded for other Yelper's.
