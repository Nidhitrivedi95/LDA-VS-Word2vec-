MLqSxca8xQvbhI8WqhqHLA Well now this place has the title if "BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN SCOTLAND" and by heck it still lives up delicious meals and great service! 

It's a great asset Tk have in Bonnyrigg as you can sit with your girls zany giggle the night away whilst indulging in home cooked meals and the wine glass constantly being refilled. 

It's great value for the quality and there is so much choice. Don't go for a pizza though as the other dishes would be a crime to miss! 

The service is fast and friendly and always on hand to help with any questions or tough choices with what dish to have! 

"I will be  back" as Arnold so put it!
