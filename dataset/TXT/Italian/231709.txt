THsU2vYT1sYm9amz9d0e4A I was extremely excited to try this place out as I am a huge Bears fan and my husband is from Chicago and loves all the teams. We visited last night for the Blackhawks game. 

We made reservations because we were told the place is packed for games. Omg I had such a great time! For as busy as it was we had excellent service. The owners sister, I didn't get her name, checked on us regularly to make sure we were ok. Our waiter Nick made sure we always had a drink. The shots of fireball for each score and the great atmosphere were a total bonus. I can't wait to watch a Bears game here!

Now the food. It was really good. I had a Chicago dog and fries. My husband had the gluten free pizza and he loved it. I tried it and it was the best gluten free crust I've had. Our friends got a regular pizza and it was really crispy like I like. 

If you are looking for a place for a nice quiet meal then do not come on game days. And if you do come on game days do not complain about the service. I think they did a great job for as crazy as it was in there.
