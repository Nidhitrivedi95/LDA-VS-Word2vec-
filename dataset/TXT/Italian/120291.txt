h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ Horrible service will never go back. Used groupon and was charged extra fees. Waiter was also supervisor he had bad attitude didn't have good customer service.  Met with owner of mezzo and he calm the situation down but will never go back wish I would of went to olive garden or carrabas better food and service.  Mezzo wine is watered down and had the nerve to charge expensive price for some bull crap.  To anyone who is looking at this save your money it's not worth it .
