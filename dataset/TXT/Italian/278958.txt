YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ Was very excited at first to try out a DIY Pasta restaurant, but there really isn't anything special to their pastas. Just so-so..
Although their ingredients are quite fresh and choices are endless, you could make the same pasta with Ragu sauce at home for much less. Not too much worth the price unless you're really craving pasta you are in a rush.
On the other hand, really quick service and clean and open dining area.
