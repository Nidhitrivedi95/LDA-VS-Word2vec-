The theme of this place is a study in odd combos and contrasts. 

See, the thing about Danny Boy's Pizza is, it isn't JUST pizza. Now the pizza is GREAT, but so are the sandwiches, the amazing bread...pillows (they ain't sticks folks, more like pillows of doughy, tasty goodness with sauce and cheese,) and other items you can buy...like the Woogie. A "Woogie" is like a stromboli with attitude; they have BBQ beef brisket, Veggie and Buffalo; yeah, they're awesome. 

Also,you'd think with a name like Danny Boys, the place was Irish...

No. 

The place is as Italian as you can get...and has more Frank Sinatra decor than you'll see anywhere...including Frank's home. Add to that the fine staff, the nice atmosphere and the food that will kick your butt, and you've got a winning combo that you'll keep coming back to. 

BTW, if you get a chance, try my favorite sammich, the "Elliot Laudermilk", Grilled chicken, melted cheese and BBQ sauce over kettle-cooked chips on a toasted roll..covered in coleslaw:) 

Now, the place isn't huge, at least not the River location, but they've branched out to half-a-dozen more spots in the area, so give them a try, and if you're a Sinatra fan, make sure that you ask to have it your way...cause they'll be very accommodating.
