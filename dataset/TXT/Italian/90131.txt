Food is ok but the ordeal that their customer service is really makes the whole thing not worth your while.
I ordered from here, they didn't have what I ordered and made a replacement without asking me what replacement I wanted. When I asked them to address it, I was told to email the manager. 
Food was delivered very late and cold. The driver called me to get me to spell out my address even though I had inserted it twice during the ordering process. 
Their "tiramisu" is some hybrid of a chocolate cake with some pudding thing on top -definitely not tiramisu, and they definitely changed the recipe because I had had tiramisu there in the past and it was reasonable.
When I contacted management, I was given a rude and dismissive answer and no responsibility was taken for the situation.

Over the last three years, I ordered from this place a lot, and it used to be great, but something happened in the recent months that has turned into a terrible option. We spent a lot of money ordering from here but there's no sense that our custom or feedback was welcome, on the contrary, so I will never order from here or go to their restaurant again.
