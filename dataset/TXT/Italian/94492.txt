ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA My first time eating at Ocotillo with a friend today and I thought it was great. The place was packed for the 11:30-2:30 lunch rush, so if your party is larger than 4 i'd recommend a reservation. The wait wasn't too long for a table, unfortunately it being 107 degrees outside we could not take advantage of the many delightful patio areas available. This place offers new and updated twists on some very common items, and it does it so well!! My friend and I shared several items, all served quickly, all presented well, all stayed hot and all were simply delicious! Our servers were attentive and accommodating. The only downside was that it was soooooo noisy my friend and I were shouting at each other to talk lolol. Maybe if I went there at a quieter time that wouldn't be the case. Regardless, I can' t wait to go back and try the other fare offered! I will be lunching/dining at this place with many a friend in the future! Recommended!
