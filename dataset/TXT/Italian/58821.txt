aqrTv6QiU0J9Sxm_T--c5g i would like to give this restaurant a 5 star as the food was reasonably good.  I am very disappointed when I was told that the special was chilean sea bass but was served cod instead.  Although server was told that i wanted the chilean sea bass, the alaskan cod was served without telling me that they were out of sea bass. I had to question the server before he admitted to the switch. This is very disappointing for a quality restaurant.
