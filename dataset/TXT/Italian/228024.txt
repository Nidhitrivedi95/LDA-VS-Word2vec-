SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog On my second trip here we actually made it to a table, be sure to go in a bit later as the 4-5pm special brings in bus loads of slow eating seniors who clear out by 6:45.
 
It was a bit tight getting to our table the layout is not the best.

After reviewing the menu we decided to start with the fried zucchini. It came before our bread and salad.  It was decent the breading had good flavor, and I liked the thinner pieces.

Our Salad and bread came. and just a note to the veggies out there, remember to ask for your salad salami free, as it usually includes salami. The Salad was decent bit heavy with the creamy Italian dressing and cheese but good.

For my main dish I went with the salmon pene. The salmon it self seemed to be of a lower quality, it was pre cut to little chunks and a bit over cooked,  the sauce was under the pasta making it messy to toss on the elliptical plate.

The person I was with got the stuffed shells, the ricotta was a bit too creamy for our tastes. 

It was a decent filling meal, at a decent price but the quality is not the highest.
