IXUwuNjy707wJNW2U4sRVg This is a place I really wanted to like but didn't.  It sounds great in theory;  authentic Italian food with an attached wine bar but, unfortunately, the atmosphere just won't bring us back.

First off, It seems to be a place geared toward regulars.  Rather than sitting in the restaurant, my wife thought the bar was cute and wanted to sit there.  Although several chairs were empty, a couple sitting at the bar told us they were "saved."  Not even a hello from the bartender.  Hmmm, ok.  Feeling like the uncool kids in the cafeteria, we accepted a table in the dining room.

My wife ordered a pomodoro dish and I had a veal piccata.  Mine was better than her bland, watery pasta, but definitely not anything to write home about.  We both enjoyed our wine - we always like wine!  Like the food, the wait staff was marginal at best.  Not particularly attentive, and probably hanging out in the bar with more important people than us.

Overall, not one to recommend to friends or neighbors. The 2 star rating says, "Meh. There's better places to go."
