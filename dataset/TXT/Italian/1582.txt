-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q My hubby and I went here about a month ago and forgot to talk about it.  IT was a small place but it smelled sooo good.  The pizza was really good.  We both had the personal pizzas because we like completely different toppings.  The wine was a bit pricey for the brand names, but the service was great and the atmosphere was kinda romantic.  We will definitely be telling all our fiends to go there.  IT is in the heart of Glendale and worth the trip from Buckeye.
