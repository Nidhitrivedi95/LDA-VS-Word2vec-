_lW7i2zGl54a6XtumbtZFQ Doppio Zero has delicious food, attentive staff and a location right in our neighbourhood. The polenta in a mushroom cream sauce I ate was mouth-watering and the chocolate martiinis were done well. My fiancee enjoyed the seafood pasta which she said was delicious, and our friends devoured their steaks and drinks. Oysters afterward were fresh. $130 for four entrees, drinks and oysters. I would recommend the Italian beer!
Great atmosphere too!
