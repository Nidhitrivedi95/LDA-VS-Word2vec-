UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ I am currently eating at Brio in Las Vegas' Town Square Mall. I am not sure if this was an off day but the service was  not good. I had to ask for items repeatedly. The food was OK but nothing to scream about. Overall,I am disappointed and will not come back. You rarely get a second time to make a first impression.
