C16ogi6ASv-sQW3SGScmNQ I thought the food portion here for the price was a joke. I still felt hungry when I was done and left. It was no wonder why this place was empty when my friends and I were there at what is considered peak business hours at a normal restaurant. As for the taste, food here is good but nothing to rave about.
