OIBF9WI7vuWo03AyvJd-0g Went back to this location and almost had the same menu with the exception of the Salomi starter and pasta side.

I found the Salomi starter okay but preferred the carpaccio starter I had on my first review.  I ordered the steak once again but found it was cooked past medium rare despite turning away an incorrect order if medium (my suspicion was that the server may have served me the same medium steak I initially turned away when informed him I had asked for medium rare.  Also found a bit of a gristle on the edge which my knife had a bit of trouble cutting through (I was surprised at that??)   Either way the steak was definitely not the medium rare that I had asked although the flavors were still excellent.

I had the tiramisu again for dessert and it was just as awesome as the first time around.

Overall another fantastic meal but lost  perfect marks from the steak.

Still a restaurant I'd recommend.
