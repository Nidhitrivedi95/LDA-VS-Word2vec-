aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw Wonderful Italian seafood restaurant. Fresh  seafood flown in daily from Italy. Extremely attentive and knowledgable staff. They bring the fish to you tableside and explain them and they will filet them tableside as well. Be careful through the fish prices aren't listed and it is pricey, but worth it. Also have a chef tasting menu. They have an option to sit outside when the weather is nice. It's a great experience and I will go back.
