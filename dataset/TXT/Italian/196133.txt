PmLFk1s8pPVNXChqETM4MA Coco Lezzone is a place where men can take ladies out to dinner on Thurs, Friday and Saturday nights, and still watch sports in comfort with their friends. There are big screen TV everywhere you look in Coco's, but strangely it doesn't diminish from the decor.  Indeed this place is the perfect mix - it feels upscale with chrome steel railings, wood covered walls and white marble counters  The food is terrific. The staff is friendly and vibe is lively and sporty.  The restaurant stocks a vast selection of expensive liquors and offers the best vintages from a carefully curated wine collection. I had the Osso Buco - slow braised veal shank with saffron risotto, and it was delicious, and the taste of the saffron i wont soon forget as its not something i encounter very often. I'm giving it five stars because it exceeded my expectations in every way...
