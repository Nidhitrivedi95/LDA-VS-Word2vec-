JsRt9LPgv-7guVcY4u6OQA My husband is very particular with Italian food coming from an Italian family with Nonna's cooking. He has been thoroughly impressed with Antico! He believes you cannot order a bad meal here! 

We enjoy the house wines, the bread is great and every meal has been perfect. My husband typically gets the specials or one of the seafood dishes. My favorites include the fettuccine alfredo and pesto pasta. Only downside to this place is the dining room is small so their can be a wait. This doesn't bother my husband as he hopes the place stays small enough so that the quality of the food is consistent.
