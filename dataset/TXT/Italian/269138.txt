xjjxHavx4RIiW6zS6rasGA I came here for a dinner with a group of 11 & they were able to accommodate and add 2 more people to our party for Ironman Arizona carbloading.  Because I'm gluten sensitive I chose Tommy V's and enjoyed it!!  Both the food and service were great.  Since the reservation was earlier in the evening, we all got our orders in quickly and didn't have to wait too long to be served.  I would definitely come back next time I'm in town.
