I went up to the hostess and asked for a table for two and she said please get in line behind the rope. The line was pretty long and we ended up sitting by a nearby fountain. As we waited for a table we saw people being seated so we went up to inquire why we were not seated before the people they were ushering in. The hostess responsed by saying "because you were not standing behind the rope." I explained to her that we sat there because at the time when we first got there the line was long. The hostess was rude and instead of offering to seat us she continued to argue with us that because we were not standing behind the rope that was why we were not seated. She clearly knew we were waiting to be seated and instead bypassed us. The hostess was very unprofessional and had poor customer service skills. We will never go back.
