Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ Two visits, two home runs. I tried the "crazy good" chicken on the first trip and found it moist and holding a lot of good flavor. I actually found the roasted potatoes and garlic that came with the chicken to be even a little better than the chicken itself. My next visit included two of the monster slices, one with meatballs. The ingredients all are high quality, from the cheese to the sauce to the dough. The meatballs clearly are made in-house as well. The crust is thin like New York pizza, but has a little more crunch. The service is friendly and helpful, and it's pretty hard not to like the place. I only wish I lived a little closer.
