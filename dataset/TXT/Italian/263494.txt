wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q I was rather disappointed in this location, now they have limited ones here in town and have only been to this one, but this makes me question even going to the other locations. First when we got there we stood around for a good 5 minutes or so when people (workers) were walking around looking at us, never once said "welcome, we will be right with you" nope just got looks like "oh great more people" Then the hostess was "busy" cleaning off the tables and seemed to not notice us. Then she was like "oh your here" then sat us down didn't say anything once she sat us down, then no utensils napkins nothing. I dont know if it was close to their closing time who knows but she didn't seem happy at all. Then once we got our waiter she took our drink order, which took like 10-15 minutes which we only ordered soda and tea. Keep in mind the place was not busy at all just seemed like no one wanted to wait on us. then after forever for our drinks, then he took our order, and we had to flag him down to take our order, then what seemed like too an hour or more our food finally came. The food was good its just the service was not the greatest, no where i used to live they closed these locations and i was glad to see them out here in Vegas, but now after this issue, I dont think I will be going back. No one ever apologized for anything so I guess this is how they operate here. I would not recommend this place.
