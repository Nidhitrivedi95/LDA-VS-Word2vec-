cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q I get about a once a year craving for Olive Garden, and yesterday was that day.  And it was pretty good.  My server was excellent.  I wish I remembered names better.  But she was very attentive and very nice.  I ordered the ravioli and it was good.  The breadsticks and salad are still the best thing about the place.  The place was clean.  The manager came around and asked if I needed anything to please bring it to his attention.  I thought that was nice.  Overall, it was a good experience.  The two reasons I didn't give it five stars, is the wine list is not good.  I had a Coppola Cab, which was not great.  And the parking is terrible.  They seem to share a lot with a BJ Brewhouse and another restaurant.  Olive Garden is sandwiched between the two.  I went at 4:30pm, and it was full.  I can just imagine what it is like at normal lunch and dinner times.
