Aw4HH_bjUL8L_EU61mgQHg I joined yelp so no one else would make a mistake and buy pizza from here. This pizza stunk. No flavor, almost no toppings, 15 bucks for a tiny pizza, and I actually wish I would have bought a pizza from Aldi...that tastes better.

If you want real pizza, drive 40miles south to Luigi's in Akron...bring cash, best pizza in NE Ohio
