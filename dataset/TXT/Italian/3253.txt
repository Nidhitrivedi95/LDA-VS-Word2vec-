When I put them in, they were connected. When I tried to pull them out as one piece, they separated. THE CHEESE MADE THOSE LOVELY MELTY CHEESE STRINGS. When was the last time you saw a pizza that did that? I can tell you that it's highly uncommon in my experience (I clearly don't eat good pizza enough). One of the two slices was mushroom and onion. The other was hot peppers, green olives and some kind of deli meat. Both were very good. I'd get them again.
