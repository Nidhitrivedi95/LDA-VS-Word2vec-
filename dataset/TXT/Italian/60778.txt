AWJhMTYsIYzCIYAIUA-waA Love the location in Scottsdale, but our experience at the Desert Ridge restaurant was truly awful. Seated in a location so dark I could not read the menu even with my glasses, it didn't start well. Our waitress leaned over me continually trying to take the drinks order which was annoying. No bread came. We asked about the bread and got "so you want bread". Dinner was poor to say the least. My daughter's chicken was rubbery and tasteless and husband's sausages were inedible. The management agreed and deleted two items from the bill. We took the instant survey and got a call to say there would be a gift certificate on its way, but a month has gone by and nothing turned up. My advice, go somewhere else!
