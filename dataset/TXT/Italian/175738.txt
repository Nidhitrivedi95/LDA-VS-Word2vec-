NFHlMOEyVsbqY_VQNJFafQ My daughter and I came here for a late lunch. We were the only ones here. We ordered the caprese salad and a pizza with half margherita pizza and the other half capricciosa. The salad was good and the margherita pizza was good. The capricciosa was fair. The service was great. The waiter was attentive but not overbearing.
