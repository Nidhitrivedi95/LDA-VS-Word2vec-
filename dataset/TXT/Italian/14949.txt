1muT5zEqoC4qp9ms08qJtQ My husband and I along with our three children checked out Gino's East last night for dinner.  The wait was an hour which we were prepared for.  We were greeted at the door and were advised that we could sit out on the patio while we wait for our table.  We immediately found a table and listened to a live band.  The one issue we had was we could not order appetizers.  We were told we could only order drinks. I was perplexed on that.  In addition they had no severs working the patio.  So if we wanted another drink we had to ask the bartender ourselves.  The bar was packed so at one point and I wanted another glass of wine but saw the line and thought it wasn't worth it.  The restaurant could me making more money is my point.  After an hour we were escorted to our table where we quickly ordered soft drinks and appetizers.  This is where it got interesting.  Our food came out before our drinks.... when the kids mentioned they were thirsty and when we couldn't find our waiter we had to hunt another one down where she apologized and our grabbed our drinks immediately.  We saw our waiter once in approximately 25 mins.  He never came back to ask if we got our appetizer or to check on our drinks.  After that we waited an additional 45 mins for the pizza. The pizza was amazing and the appetizers and salad did not disappoint. I think the downfall of anything will be the  service at this restaurant.  My husband and I have lived in Arcadia for 12 years now.  Theres is a wide selection of restaurants and word spreads fast about service and food.  I would suggest that management button up on the customer service.  It's unfortunate but the service really killed it for us on this restaurant... food and sauce was amazing though!
