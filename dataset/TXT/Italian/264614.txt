Love, LOVE, LOVE the food! We got a pizza and ceasar salad to split and it was just enough food for the two of us. The restaurant was small and quiet and there was plenty of room/seating for a Friday night. I ordered a special martini and it was QUITE strong. The recipe stated that the drink would have cinnamon [it was a holiday drink] but the cinnamon turned out to be goldschlager [ew.] Our food came out very fast and was just so good!

Now, the reason why I gave it a two out of five;

When we walked into the restaurant my friend and I stood in the doorway for a good five minutes before we were approached. The woman stated that we could sit anywhere and our server would be with us soon. About ten minutes later, the same woman came back and stated that she would be taking our drink order but our real server would be with us soon. Ten minutes later, the same woman came back with our drinks and then took our food order. My friend ordered a white wine and she came back with a red. When it was time to go, we put our forks and napkins on our plates, indicating that we were done. It took another ten minutes to get our check.

We left a four dollar tip. Never, in my life, have I left a tip under five dollars.
It was well deserved. 

I will be eating the food from humble pie again, but I will be taking it home to REALLY enjoy it.
