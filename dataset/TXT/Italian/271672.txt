Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ First of all the pie was not worth almost 17.00 !!! It was not what I call deep dish !! At least not like Buddy's !! Not even close !!! It was maybe 1/2 inch thick !! It was barely enough for a hungry man !! Sorry for bad review but I still have to give you one star for value , thickness and taste !! The sausage was awful !!!
