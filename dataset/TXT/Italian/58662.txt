aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA I recently checked out Oregano's at it's new location. I am so thrilled that this new space is much more spacious that the previous location. I came here for Lunch during the week and as always there was a slight wait. The wait wasn't that long, but as you wait they offer you free samples of pizza. As you walk through the Restaurant, pretty much every employee greets you. It doesn't seem cheezy either. It made my feel happy to  be greeted so nicely. Needless to say, the staff was fantastic and service was prompt and efficient. If you order a fountain type beverage, you get what looks like a 32 oz cup. I seriously needed two hands to drink from it and never needed a refill. For eats, we ordered the large dinner Salad and the BBQ Chicken Pizza on Whole Wheat Thin Crust.
The Salad- pretty basic but adequate.
The Pizza- Was disappointed in the whole wheat crust. I know it's hard to get right and they haven't got there quite yet.  The crust was too crispy and sometimes burnt in places. Besides that, the Pizza was still enjoyable. It had the right portions of everything. 
Look forward to returning again.
