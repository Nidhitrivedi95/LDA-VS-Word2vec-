One word says it all. (Supercalifragilisticexpiallidocious)

Seriously, this place is awesome. The food, the drinks and the service are all outstanding. 

They have a good-sized parking lot so you should be able to find a spot close to the entrance.

We decided to eat here before going to watch Blade Runner. As we were 30 minutes away, we told them we were coming and then headed up the 51 hoping that we would not run into too much traffic. We arrived at 5:14 for a 5:15 eat time and we were seated immediately. 

It's Happy Hour! We lucked out. We wanted wine with our meal and Happy Hour prices gave us $10 off any bottle.

We shared an appetizer, mussels in garlic. Absolutely splendid. The sauce was so good, it needed bread so it could be used as a dipping sauce.

For our entrees we ordered the Chicken Bryan, the Salmon Cetriolini and the Fettuccine Weesie. All were delightfully delicious. With my Chicken Bryan I had the garlic mashed potatoes. Another perfect choice.

By the time we had devoured our food, we wanted dessert but our stomachs were overly satisfied and we decided to save dessert for another day.

You will not be unhappy if you decide to eat here.
