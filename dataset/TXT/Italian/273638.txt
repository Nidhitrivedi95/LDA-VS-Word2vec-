Y_SKyssv8ClQ_p25lCsbAQ I have been hearing good things about 1905 Eatery so I met a friend there for lunch today.   
We ordered the appetizer "fried provolone".  I am a huge fan of the fried provolone  and often order this appetizer when I go out to eat so I expected the typical wheel or stick shape... but folks what I didn't realize is that I was about the eat the best fried provolone in town!! I am so glad I ordered it.  It was bursting with flavor ...it was like real homemade fried provolone.  Accompanied with a side of their sauce .. our taste buds were singing! 

We both ordered a house salad with our meals and had the homemade dressing (oil and vinegar or Italian not sure) but it was good. The ingredients in the salad were fresh. 
 
My friend ordered the cap egg and cheese sandwich and told me that it became more delicious with each bite. The sandwich was oozing with fresh ingredients and had a nice aroma.   
 
I had the lasagna and it was good.  Plenty of flavor and it wasn't all cheese.   

The service is a little on the slow side since there is only one waitress working. I wouldn't  expect to be in and out.  BYOB- fun to bring your own bottle of wine.
