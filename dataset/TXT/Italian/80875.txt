dcFMlXIEun1ax2ebW_Y7-w $7 for a big slice of horribly greasy and bland pizza. It was fast and convenient since it's located right next to the Blue Man Group stage, but I'd say you're much better off with McDonalds next door. The service was also horrible!! There was no one waiting in front of us but we still waited a few minutes to be acknowledged by the staff that was too busy talking to each other. When I finally made eye contact with one of the workers, she responded with, "Yes?" Wow. 

Don't go here.
