dSnQTUJC0tCHadU1AGzvrw I'll start off with the things I enjoyed here. We came in for lunch at around 11:30am and sat outside in the back. The pretty and fun furnishings complement a beautifully green and well-maintained golf course.
For our appetizer, we chose the artichoke dip. It's different from the typical dip seen at other restaurants, but its unique flavor was really tasty.

Now for some of things I didn't enjoy as much. As other people have said, the wait is abnormally long. I'm sure there are reasons (maybe the food is made from scratch each time), but it took 20+ min for our appetizer to come out. Also, when that came out, we had to remind our waiter to take our order. He was very nice about it and did try to explain the wait *As a side note, there were, at most, 10 other customers here. Afterward, we waited about 30 min for our main meal. I ordered the lasagna and for the price of $17, I was a bit disappointed in the flavor. The fish sandwiches were alright as well. The ones we had tasted a little too fishy for our preference. The final item we had was the Islander pizza. It was like a Hawaiian pizza, but definitely with a nice flavor upgrade. 

Tl;dr
Pros and cons from our experience:
View and ambiance is really nice
Servers were friendly
Food was either a solid hit or miss (depending on your expectations)
Wait time for food was LONG even for lunchtime and the lack of customers
