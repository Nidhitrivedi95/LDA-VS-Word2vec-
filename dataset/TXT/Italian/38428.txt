7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ Love the pizza here.  The crust is tender, bready but slightly crunchy as well . . .not as crunchy as the most authentic Italian pizzas, but i don't think they're trying to replicate an Italian pizzeria.  The crust tastes like it's been glazed with a subtle amount of something . . . a butter blend?  but just the right amount so it isn't dry, or greasy.  Mouth-watering.  Contemporary and wonderful.  Bless you.
