LMdUoR00jPxQDWLYRq93FA I liked the idea of using locally produced products, unfortunately value for money was not there. With a food and wine bill at over $100/person the food quality should be extra special.
Our overall opinion was that the food was either a little too salty and or a little bland (most dishes).
The fish (marlin) cooked to perfection, the butter nut squash great flavor and mushroom soup tasted like a packet soup - so some dishes really nice, but others either bland or over salted.

The young lady serving us, although very attentive tended to be a little too serious. A little smile or joke might have been in order.

We were never rushed and spent 2- 3 hours just chatting - setting was wonderful so high marks for the ambiance. 

Just a pity the food did not match ambiance etc. I guess I'm spoiled by my wife's cooking.

8/18 update - perhaps I was a little harsh the first time-around. Second visit to the restaurant - food and ambiance excellent. Great way to spend several hours with friends
