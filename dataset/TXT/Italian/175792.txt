NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ Went to a special event here over the weekend.  They served spaghetti and meatball to all who attended along with thier garlic knots.  When the spaghetti came out it was ziti which was kinda confusing but I'd prefer the ziti to spaghetti anyways.  A big meatball was plopped right in the middle of the ziti with red sauce.  I must say that was the best meatball ever!  I do prefer my garlic knots a little more doughy....and I did feel like I needed some sauce to dip them in.  They are so little that some of them seem kinda hard.  Anyways, who can complain being that the meal was free.  The service was excellent.  There were alot of people who attended the event but these chickies were on top of it!  Overall a great experience.  Its on the other side of town so I doubt I'd be back but if it was in my neck of the woods it would definitely be on my radar!
