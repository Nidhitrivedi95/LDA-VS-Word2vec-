7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA My boyfriend and I decided to try somewhere new for brunch last weekend. We waited about 20 minutes for a table but definitely well worth it. Good food, great service. The bacon was perfectly cooked, and I mean perfect. My boyfriend had one of the huevos dishes, and I had just the traditional breakfast. Will definitely be going back here.
