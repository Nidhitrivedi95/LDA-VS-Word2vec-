xJ94FRxbFwkmpi1hjuWlaw WHY IS THIS PIZZA SOOOO GOOD??? AND WHY IS IT NOT IN VA???? :( 

We came across this wonder pizza spot while staying in the hotel next door, and I am sooooooo glad we decided to eat pizza that night! We had the THE BIANCO and it was by far one of the best combinations of flavor on a pizza I ever had! 

It was so good that we order the same thing and a pepperoni pizza the next day around 8:30pm so that we had it in the room when we got home from partying later that night!  While the Pizza is rocking, the owner and staff are equally as amazing. I L O V E  this spot, it is a must have for my trips to the Charlotte NC area!
