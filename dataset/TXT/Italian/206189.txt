qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA My fiancé had the Linguine with Clam Sauce and it was pretty good, but clams were a little overcooked. I had the Baked Ziti, and it was delicious! However, I thought it was a little funny that the pasta was actually penne not ziti. Unless ziti can be considered multiple types of pasta? News to me if that's the case.
