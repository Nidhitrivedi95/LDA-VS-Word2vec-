4RL5ydKIIFpU8bevsOKRdA I've had two experiences with Libretto's and both of them have been negative. 

The first time I ordered delivery from Libretto's the delivery driver brought up the wrong pizza. Wrong toppings, wrong size and everything.  Long story short Libretto's called us back and told us the next time we ordered there would be a 20% credit on out account. 

Flash forward to today. We called to get a pizza delivered again. When we called the attendant took our name, address, and placed us on hold...for 13 minutes. 13 minutes later a new attendant answer the phone and asked for all of our information again. They quoted us that it would take 45 to an hour for our pizza to arrive. We called Libretto's at 7:25 the delivery driver rang our doorbell at 9:26. The pizza wasn't bad albeit cold. I can't say I'll give Libretto's a third chance.
