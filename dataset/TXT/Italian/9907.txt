The service was great, however, it did take some time for the server to get to us. They were hospitable and made sure everything was set in order for you. Their selection looked great. The dish I chose was $45 (Prime Beef whatever lol I'm not sure what the dish was called). It was tasty but small. I will admit, I like to enjoy my food but I do want some quantity in it as well. For that $45, I would be able to get a bigger piece of beef elsewhere, however, it wouldn't have been cooked by the famous chef and that restaurant. Sadly, I do not ever no who that is. HAHA! Nonetheless, the beef was amazing and tasted great. The side potatoes and mushrooms added flavor to the beef and mixed well.

When it comes to the drinks, I advise you just get it elsewhere. Small martinis or little drinks were $15+ and when it came to wine, just be careful with your wallet! Some bottles are worth over $1500! And that's wine that was bottled in 2002-2005! Just go to the nearest store and enjoy that Stella Rosa!
