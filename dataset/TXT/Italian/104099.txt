FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA I REALLY DON'T KNOW what the hype is all about. I came here with my husband expecting good food, good service, and a clean restaurant. I'm very OCD when it comes to cleanliness of a restaurant. I always inspect my cups, plates, and forks before I ever use it at a restaurant.

STRIKE 1- My husband's water cup had a very visible and distinct LIPSTICK stain on it. The outline of the person's lip was still there! We informed the waiter, he looked embarrassed, and gave us a 'new' cup.

STRIKE 2- The 'new' cup the waiter gave us still had lipstick stains on it... but it was much smaller. We're not sure if he just wiped off the first one, or if many of the cups are this disgusting.

STRIKE 3- My OWN cup had food debris on the inside portion where my lips would have been. I flicked it off with my nail and finger.. and was so disgusted. Both of us didn't drink a sip of water the whole time there.

STRIKE 4- My plate had visible and distinct food debris on it. I wiped it off with the napkin... my husband gave me his plate to use. I had enough of this 'yucky-ness', so when my food came, I literally ate over my napkin.

Now for the food, we ordered the Bruschetta and Nine Iron Panini. You get to choose 4 flavors for the Bruschetta. We tried Smoked Salmon with Pesto.... Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato... Salami with Pesto... and something else I don't remember. Visibly appealing. Too bad it doesn't taste as good as it looks. I'm not saying its nasty, it is just not 'all that.' The bread wasn't as crunchy as I thought it should be. The bread was more... chewy than anything else. My favorite out of the 4 we got was the Bacon one.

The Nine Iron Panini was just okay. Thick bread, nice portion, but nothing I would get again.

CONCLUSION- If they were more clean, I would maybe give them a 3 out of 5 tops. But seriously, who wants to eat that dirty? WILL NOT BE GOING BACK.
