kDu6EvknXAygJf1KSfwhUA I had lunch here recently and was generally satisfied.  I ordered a caprese salad which was served in an odd boat shaped platter, but was ample, if slightly over-salted.  I asked for a chicken breast as a side which was included for a nominal up-charge.  A potato leek soup was nicely seasoned and thick.  Two people at my table split a salmon dish, and the kitchen was willing to separately plate the split dish with no sharing charge.  Two others split a pizza and took about a third home.  The service was very friendly and attentive, in addition to frequent visits for water refills.
