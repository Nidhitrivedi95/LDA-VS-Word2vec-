cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q Normally service is good , but today was very disappointing!
I tried the new lunch chicken sandwich and the bread was hard as a rock , chicken was all dried up and very small. 
The server never asked refills with our waters or more soup or salad. 
Just all bad all the way around. I would rather just go to the Decatur location Olive Garden.
