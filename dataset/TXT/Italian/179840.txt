nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Great restraunt. Great place, The meals are huge! 

 I went there for my 33erd Birthday and was stuffed. The Granny meatballs were great. If you love meatballs you gotta try them on your visit. Also the calamari is a great dish as an appetizer very good. 

Chicken parm was a good dish too but if I go again I'm getting the lasagna..
