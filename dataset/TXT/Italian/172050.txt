N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ I had a few guests over last night and we decided to order out.  We picked Stromboli from Biaggio's.  There was 6 of us, one man, a couple of delicate flower eaters, and a few more enthusiatic ones.  I never want to commit the party foul of not enough food, so I ordered two meat lover's strombolis and 12 garlic knots.  It was a lot of food because we had also made a large salad to accompany our take-out.  Well, the stromboli was so juicy and deeeeeeeeeelicious, that even our little delicate flowers were taking thirds!!  Yikes!  We almost ran out.  I have had pizza from here before and it too was fabulous.  You can eat in.  The place is small but cute.  The proprietor is very friendly and accomodating.  You must give it a try!
