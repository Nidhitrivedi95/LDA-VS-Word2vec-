ii9kqE9s4456Jn9asz-BPQ Stumbled on this place one afternoon wandering through Old Montreal. The pizza selection isn't huge but they are cooked perfectly! The crust is fresh and exactly what a fresh pizza dough should taste like. They have a great outdoor seating area perfect for people watching. The beer and wine list is good. This is a great spot to sit and grab some good pizza and drinks. My only knock against it is at night on the weekends the music is blasting and it almost has a club vibe to it, if that's not your scene find another place to hang out. Can't wait to go back for the pizza though!!
