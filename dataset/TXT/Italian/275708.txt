Ya9FMj-MWMkeMcog06N5bQ Randomly found this place, and was very pleasantly surprised.  The interior is spacious and roomy, with lots of space between tables.  Kind of an airy, industrial feel, I guess.   Also, the staff was very friendly.  

I had a beer and one of their "signature" martinis--which was very strong and well-made.  My portabella mushroom burger was also delicious.

Finally, I should mention that the happy hour here is a ridiculous deal. In fact, I thought they made a mistake on the bill when we got it, no joke. My share of the bill, which included the aforementioned beer, fancy martini, mushroom burger, and part of an appetizer was like 8 or 9 dollars. Seriously. Granted, it was dollar burger night, but still...
