You order from whichever food group choice you want - pizza/calzones, salad, pasta - by laying the card on a small screen and telling the person behind the countert which dish you'd like. Then you get a pager and go select a table. 

The food was delicious - I had the Toscana pizza and part of my friend's salad. It would be nice if the salads came in smaller portions, but if sharing worked out for us. 

The main drawback I found was that you don't have a server. I got up four times while having lunch - Once to get my order after they paged me, twice to refil my glass (the glasses are small), and another time to get a to-go box. I don't really care to interupt my lunch so many times. To be honest, I'd rather leave a tip for a server so that I don't have to get up (I'm not lazy, I swear!).
