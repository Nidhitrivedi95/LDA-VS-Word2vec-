AWJhMTYsIYzCIYAIUA-waA As you can see, the reviews are all over the map for this restaurant. 

We would agree, though the three of us came here this past Saturday night and we very much enjoyed ourselves.  Our server Dylan was very professional and on top of things. He made our experience Four Stars!

The food was good, "A-OK" Three and half Stars, while the bill ran us about $50 including taxes, but before gratuities. The major weakness of the evening was the reintroduction of an old favorite -- Italian Nachos (see photo).  There was a lot of chips and puffed raviolis, but very little meat or cheese for $9.00.  They might want to rethink this one.

The Macaroni Grill chain has been in limbo for a while now, with several corporate owners and varying degrees of focus.  

After Brinker (Chili's) bought Maggiano's ten years ago, they tried to cheapen the brand, as a way of differentiating it.  Think Olive Garden, or Johnny Carino's.  Then it was sold to VC firm Golden Gate which tried to restore the old Macaroni Grill that Phillip Romano had in mind.  Now Ignite Restaurant Group (Joe's Crab Shack) has recently taken over, and it appears that this finally might be a good thing for Macaroni Grill!  We hope so.

Houston based Ignite closed on its $54 million acquisition of Macaroni Grill on April 9 and has named David Catalano as president of the brand.  The new ad campaign will feature Macaroni Grill's create-your-own-pasta platform. Ray Blanchette, Ignite's chief executive said. "We think it's unique to the brand and a compelling message," he added. "It delivers everyday value. We're not discounting it. We believe at the $11 price point, it's already a compelling value."  http://www.igniterestaurants.com/
