5nMvlKW5n2-O0tT44DYnDQ Antoinette and Michael are very welcoming and extremely polite. For our dinner entrée, we had Pollo al Marsala and Shrimp San Marco. Both entree's were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of food. The bread severed with the entrée is delicious. We highly recommend a visit to the Gran Canal Caffe!
