qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA My girlfriend and I decided to eat there before leaving sin city. Seeing 4 stars on yelp, we thought that we were gonna enjoy good Italian food. 

She had the veal milanese and I had the spaghetti meatball. My question is why 4 stars ? Has anyone ever tried Italian food ??? I only give 2 star because our server was good. The food is really basic and is definitely not worth the price. 

My girl said that this place should had been in the food court along with burger king.
