xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA Delicious meal from start to finish. The salad was fresh crisp and cold. The house bread has peppers on top of them and the olive oil dip with garlic and tomato is great. Good size and price for cocktails. 
 
 Main dishes are large portioned but I wouldnt split a plate because they charge $10 for two people to share 1 meal. $10 is cheaper than any meal on the menu but id rather be adventurous and get two plates and try both dishes. And you can always take your leftovers home. Amazing dishes as far as what I ordered. My husband enjoyed his as well. 
( I had the chicken copa )

The cappuccino cheesecake is shareable size and served with fresh berries. Very elegant place. Yes its pricy 18 and up per plate but its an authentic italian restuarant. Its not olive garden. 

To quote someone elses review, yes going to steak and shake would be cheaper to feed a whole family. But the two are NOT comparable. A burger joint vs italian fine dining. So just know what youre willing to pay so you arent suprised when the bill comes. 

I would def come back again. Not to mention the service was fantastic.
