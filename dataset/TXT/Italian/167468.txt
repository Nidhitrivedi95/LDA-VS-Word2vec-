Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw Such a great lil lunch spot.  What it lacks in atmosphere it more than makes up for with the food and value.  I'm not a huge meatball person but i LOVE their meatball parm lunch special.  For $8, you get a HUGE meatball parm sub sandwich and a drink.  I always eat half the sandwich for lunch and save the other half for a later meal.  Delicioso.
