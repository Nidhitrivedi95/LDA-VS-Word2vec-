eGTAC8EzcHiYnnZ52tijiQ Wow! I challenge you to find a better sandwich. After ordering from an exceedingly cheery man at the register, we waited for a table. Thank you Stoney's for not seating people until they've ordered, or we wouldn't have been able to sit while eating. We grabbed a couple glasses of water from the self-serve pitchers on the counter, and not long after our sandwiches arrived.

Not only do they look appetizing, the flavor is out of this world. My daughter ordered a balsamic chicken sandwich, and actually sighed with delight after the first bite. Moist chicken,  generously topped with greens, roasted red peppers and more, drizzled with balsamic. Likewise, the grilled vegetable sandwich i ordered was bite after bite of deliciousness. Loaded with veggies, served on wonderful thick slices of grilled bread that might have been from Heaven. Bursting with flavor. Y u m !!! I should have asked what kind of balsamic they use, because I think I could drink it from the bottle. Slightly sweet, full-flavored goodness.

We easily could have shared a sandwich, as they are large. But where would the fun be in that? Now we have dinner already prepared for tonight. And I foresee dinner being excellent this evening!
