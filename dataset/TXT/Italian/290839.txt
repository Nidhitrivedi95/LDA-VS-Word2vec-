Zx4iQCmQfAaXvwPc3TlF9Q Smokey, old style, run down building........but great food, nice people, nice staff, decent play on the machines, and I place I stop by when ever I am around.  It was a taxi driver who told me the drivers know where the best food is all over town.  He said they fight over fares by this place just so they can eat here. Right On!
