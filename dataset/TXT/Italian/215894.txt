RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ My husband and I came here for dinner while staying at the resort I'll start off by saying the view definitely does not disappoint. After looking at the menu we decided to go with a five-course meal prepared on the spot by the chefs it was $90 per person but it was well worth it, every bite of every course was absolutely divine the scallops cut like butter the steak was the best either of us had ever had although crazy overall was such a wonderful experience great service and divine food will definitely be back
