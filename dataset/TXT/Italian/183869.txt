oglIZt5mg2nErhpTH_AakQ Good food, good service, nice atmosphere. I recommend the peroni beer and the carbonara, The pizza was popular was well, with a crisp thin crust. We also had the puttanesca, but my wife and I didn't like it . Maybe it was too strong for her, but I thought it needed more anchovies and hot peppers ;) 

To sum up, there is a friendly atmosphere of a family restaurant and the food is good. This is a a place for a date or special occasion, yet affordable enough for frequent visits.
