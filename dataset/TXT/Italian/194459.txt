PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ Not bad, it's more like a 3.5 rating I rounded up because I definitely will be back.

The menu is a mixture of Italian and American dishes....I feel like it's more so Italian than American. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, comes with steak fries and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Milanese. I know it doesn't matter to some, but I love my food to be pippin hot. And pippin hot was what Zest delivered. To my surprise, my sandwich was on the smaller size. I finished the entire thing in one sitting. Normally I would have leftovers but nope...not here. It was just right for a dinner portion though. Boyfriend actually loved his dish more than I liked mine. I wasn't in the pasta mood that night, but next time, I want to give some of them a try. They looked (from Yelp pics) and sound really good!!!!

Service was attentive. Atmosphere was a nice locals-feel restaurant. Just be aware of the one person bathroom. Don't wait until you really have to go or else you risk running to the bathroom only to find out someone is in there. I don't know why restaurants do that. It should be against code laws to only have 1 bathroom per gender. Even most Mc Donald's have multiple stall restrooms.
