bRR4gsjHv0F_RnRGjQBqlg This place is fun.  I mean... it's a custard, gelato place.  But the lighting and colors and everything just exudes "fun".
Tasty creations that you get to mix and match.  
Part of the fun is mixing and matching..... so if you are the indecisive sort... this might not be the best place for you because the options are limitless (it seems).
I usually share whatever "we" order... because the custard is rich and the toppings sweet... so I just need a few bites to satisfy my cravings.  
In fact, I highly recommend sharing... that way you won't feel so guilty for indulging in this yum-o-licious treat.
