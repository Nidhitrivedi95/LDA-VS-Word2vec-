WX8cx6tfFcEn0cK4cIbWag You pay for the atmosphere here, essentially sitting in the Venetian's St. Marks square.  It's fun to see the crowds and listen to the performances.  The food was average, shared the calamari to start .. our group had the gnocchi, eggplant Parmesan, and shrimp scampi.. best to worst in that order, starting with decent to bland.  Won't be coming back.
