esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA AMAZING! If you love Oysters than this is the place to be.  Its not a easy place to find if you never been there but the staff in the casino makes it a bit easier. From a stand point outside looking in. It dosnt look like anything great. But once you meet the staff and try the food your whole aspect on it will change fast.

  They have premium oysters for a bit more than the normal dozen. Normally they have 4 different kinds from around the world. If you want, you can make a dozen any combination you like. Staff is helpful to identify and describe the oysters to help you get a better understanding of what your eating or about to eat. If you love fish tacos I highly recommend them as well. They are grilled, so you dont feel as bad about eating them. Plus they have a Amazing sauce that they put on top. If you love Crab legs they are amazing as well. They cut them in half and it seems they grill them but I am still unsure. Having the crab legs cut in half makes it easy to eat and allows them to add a seasoning to them.

  I hope everyone that loves seafood gets at least one chance to eat here. Ive ate at many seafood places in town and have still yet to find one that beats the Oyster Bar.
