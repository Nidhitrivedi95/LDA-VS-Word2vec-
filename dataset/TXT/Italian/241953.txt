UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA I've been going to Rinaldi's for years. My dad used to talk about their sauce, brisket, meatballs, and breakfast items when he lived on this side of town.

When I moved to Scottsdale I gave it a shot. I'm in almost every weekend now and cannot stay away. I am a big fan of their breakfast croissants but I also love their breakfast burritos with the homemade salsa.

I always bring my friends to Rinaldi's when they are in town. It's not unusual for them to tell me later that they miss those breakfast sandwiches after they return home.
