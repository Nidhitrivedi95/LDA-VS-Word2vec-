Y-hmtitiRfg7vmc3N-lTww Excellent authentic Italian pizza.  After living in Italy for a while, this is one of the closest pizzas to what I ate there - great crust and toppings without too much gooey cheese.  Had one with proscuitto, arugula and fresh mozzarella - wonderful! The foccacia bread was also awesome.  The pasta bolognese was good, but more typical tomatoey that what I found in Italy.  The homemade sausages were great. Meatballs okay.   Wish they made their own pasta.  Server was very friendly and helpful, but they seemed understaffed as she had to keep running.  Will definitely go back.
