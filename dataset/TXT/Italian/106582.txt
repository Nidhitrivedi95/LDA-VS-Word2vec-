FTVDICd-uxoEGYh4pU0pcw My 3 year old is the biggest pizza snob you will ever meet. And he loves Joey's. I come at least once a week for his afternoon snack and it's like 5 bucks for 2 slices of cheese and a water/can of soda. Every Friday, my husband picks up a couple boxes of pizza. A little on the pricey side, but it's definitely worth it. Over the generic chain pizza...and my boy always looks forward to it!

The owner and I believe his brother are really nice. It can get busy during dinner time so you might have to call a couple times, if there's no answer. I did get attitude from a teenage girl who works there (once) but she's a teenager, I suppose, so whatever. That doesn't deter me from the pizza!

Restaurant is clean, small, and worth the drive to anthem if you're looking for NY style pizza!!!
