Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg I have been going to Roma Deli for awhile.  It's the greatest.  It's authentic, the people are friendly (don't mess with the deli lady though, she's tough!), and the food is delicious!  

I discovered it during a work lunchbreak, it was crazy busy, but the food was wonderful.  The bread...oh the bread!!  I had remembered a friend said this place has the best meatball sandwich he has had in his life.  I have never ordered meatballs before, but I gave it a try.  Delicious, and I'm a foodie at heart.  My girlfriends at work and I started coming here for lunch.

I took my boyfriend here for dinner, and it was a completely different atmosphere, just like the perfect hole in the wall Italian place that you dream of finding in North Beach in the Bay area.  My now husband, when he was in town, would always want to come here.  We love it! 

And we've tried a lot of the food.  My fave is always the spaghetti and meatballs, which I get with angel hair and a side of capers.  It is divine.  The house salad is absolutely wonderful with their homemade dressing. My husband has tried all different dishes on the menu, and it is always great.  And if it's close to closing, sometimes they'd send us home with an entire grocery bag of fresh bread.  

Now that I've moved to California to be with my husband, we have searched high and low for this place (or a near second).  We are still looking.  Not even in North Beach have we found its equal!! So much, that a yr later, I had a friend driving through from Vegas, bring me 10 servings of my dish to have frozen, and they sent her with a ton of free bread too.  

I wish this restaurant were near my home.  It has captured both our appetites and our hearts.  It's hidden treasure in Vegas, that has yet to be discovered.
