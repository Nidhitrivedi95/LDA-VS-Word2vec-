fi6s29AbDqLjoQ1LSe5lrg My partner wanted to try it out after we've seen tons of ads on insauga.com website. I wanted to go to Capra's Kitchen nearby (which I regret not going because of tonight's meal). 

We didn't know there was free parking behind it so we parked at the plaza across from it on the main lakeshore street. 

The atmosphere is quaint and it looks like a hidden gem to bring your date. 

Question: would I go back?? NO! Why? Read below..... 

Happy: Service was wonderful and the food came out quickly. There was bread, but it wasn't anything to remember by. 
My partner's farfalle pasta with shredded crab meat was hot and had good flavour to it. The portion is pretty good for $21.  No veggies were added. 

Unhappy: I ordered veal al limone with roasted potatoes and some veggies which were cold. The three pieces veal didn't appear fresh and wasn't the same temperature of hotness as my partner's dish. The sauce was sour so it was a turn off. I understand it's cooked with lemon BUT it tasted like bad meat gone wrong. I decided not to finish it to avoid stomach flu - in case. 
For $24, I'll rather get a simple noodle soup to fill me up. 

Definitely regret coming here. Not a happy feeling leaving the place. And it was a pricey dinner. 

Verdict:  we had to get bubble tea to cheer us up.
