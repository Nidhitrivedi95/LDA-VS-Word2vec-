fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I think enough has been said about Cherry Blossom so I'm going use this review to pledge my love for Zaru Soba.
When I was 18 I spent nearly a month in Japan in the Sister City exchange program. It was during the summer and my host mother would always make cold noodles with dipping sauce, a very popular dish during the humid summer months. I nearly fell out of my chair when I first tried the Zaru Soba at Cherry Blossom, I was instantly transported back to my incredible time in Japan. 
Cold buckwheat noodles, a light soy-based dipping sauce and a little fried panko fish on the side, the perfect dish for when it's hot as sin outside. A little banana bread to start doesn't hurt either!
Say what you will about the service, I often only go at lunchtime when there aren't that many people but I have found the service to be unintrusive and very polite. 
Now if only I could find a place in Phoenix that serves Japanese pancakes....
