Price for food is terrible.
Owner who argues over a groupon with customers, terrible.

I think this restaraunt may be on it's way to going out of business.

I had heard that the food was great several months ago, but what I think now is that the food USED TO BE great.

I ordered the $19.00 chicken marsala.  The chicken was like rubber, very thin small portion and the sauce was more like gravy and had very little taste to it.
The side vegetable was a lump of spinach, and the potato was a wedge of a potato.
The owner was sitting at a table with an overdressed couple and  once they left, the owner went over to a table to argue with another couple that tried to use their groupon, and were told that he no longer excepted the groupons. 


I called my friend who had recommended this place to make sure I was at the right place, and she said she had also recommended this place to others, and I was the 3rd person who told her the food was terrible.

It was a bummer to have chosen this place for my birthday dinner, I was sorry I went.
