q6BzQz426uH6rB7bmZvexQ We were visiting from VA and went based on a suggestion from a family member.  Our waitress was very sweet but clearly overwhelmed with the demands from the neighboring table.  The buffalo roll appetizer was outstanding.  I ordered a meatball sub and was pleased as was my cousin with her personal pizza.  My other cousin ordered a tortellini dish that she didn't care for and my husband took one bite of his pasta dish and opted to skip it (including no to go box).  Maybe pizza and subs would have been a better choice but at an Italian restaurant you expect the pastas to be outstanding.  Disappointing.  We won't be back.
