wNy3CnWWAnTCfDYsZTSUPw Giuliano's is another Italian restaurant on Leith Walk and this one is probably the most popular.  I'm not too sure why, however, as my experience in this place didn't really stand up to that of the others in the area.  It looks inviting and stylish from the outside, and the interior decor is also contemporary and comfortable.  The menu has the usual pizzas, bruschettas and pasta dishes as well as some tempting deserts like their homemade tiramisu.  I went for the pepperoni pizza which tasted pretty good when it arrived some forty mintues after I ordered it.  Also, it was barely warm when it arrived and the last few mouthfuls were cold.
The place is virtually always busy, but even so the staff just don't seem to care.  I douibt I'll be back here again, but plenty of locals seem to visit reguarly so it must be doing something right.
