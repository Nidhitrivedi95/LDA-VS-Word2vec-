oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ Pretty surprised by the negative reviews for Cibo Wine Bar. Being a bit of a Yelp snob, when my colleague recommended this place time and time again, I kept pointing out how poor the reviews were and how there seemed to be better choices around. However, having been to Cibo twice now and as someone who admittedly holds high standards in terms of service and food, I've really enjoyed my experiences at Cibo. 

I went to Cibo once for lunch and once for dinner, and neither times did I feel as if service was lacking in any way. I'm a huge fan of the complimentary bread they give you and the peppers they leave on the table. So fresh and delicious! Everything I've had at Cibo has been either good or great, with frontrunners being the Mushroom Risotto and the Linguine with Seafood. It's a pretty good price for the quality of food. 

The first time I came here I was with a group of around 20 people for a work lunch. The food came quickly and did not lose out on quality. On top of that, they were very gracious in assisting us in splitting the bill. The second time, I was with a group of middle school friends I hadn't seen in almost a decade, and the waiters were very patient in letting us sit there and chat and drink even well after dinner. 

To top it off, I'm into the decor of the place, especially the skull bottles, the wine "cellar" right in the middle of the restaurant, and the somewhat creepy portraits of girls near the bathroom area. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone, but I do agree that the By the Glass wine menu is lacking.
