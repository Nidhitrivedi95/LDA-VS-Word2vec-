UirWbEXBYqw9cE63Ph-Png Slow Sunday night( 25% capacity).   Waiter had no idea difference between white and red linguine. Salads arrived, soggy. Bread arrived 2 min before entree. Burnt.  Linguine in clam Sauce was overloaded with stock. Soup like. Owner asked if I was done and needed a box in the middle of a bite.  Staff has no idea what beer was in stock. Chef Ramsey would by pass this place.
