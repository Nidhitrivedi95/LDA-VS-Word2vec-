uOJ87zqbU1MtShCSHDkiyw We had read several reviews of VB on Yelp that were less than stunning, but we have been trying to find a good Italian restaurant, so we wanted to try it and we had a very enjoyable evening.

Our server, Boris, was knowledgeable, efficient and had some good suggestions. (For example, my wife ordered the veal piccata and he suggested fettuccini as an accompaniment instead of the mashed potatoes that it comes with.) 

The food was excellent, as I said above, my wife had the vela piccata and I ordered the linguini vignole.  Each was well prepared and the pasta with each was al dente.

The wine selection is extensive and offered a good variety.

Overall, we had a great time.
