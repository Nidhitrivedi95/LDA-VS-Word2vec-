Avf-PGE8lkDY1jkRSUZErw The food is actually not bad at all. The reason for the poor rating is that the place is way over priced. It's $10 for a chicken sandwich and the cheapest thing on the kids menu is $6. Really?  

The location is in an out of the way shopping center near Highland Creek. About the furthest thing imaginable from a high rent district. They need to do a little research of comparable establishments in the area (e.g. Pippa's Cafe, Johnny Brusco's, Afton Pizza etc.) and they'd quickly see the discrepancy.
