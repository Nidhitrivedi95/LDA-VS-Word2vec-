-PUPEpMsjBjk_rX5lFaWng Over the last month, ordered pizza to go and dined in as well. I like this place. Nice decor, very nice cocktail bar, which is semi-separate from dining area.

The pizza is terrific. Medium thin crust, excellent sauce. Dining in ordered a pesto calzone--superb. The sauce is simmered with Italian sausage, even though meatless, it produces a sublime flavor. Calzone is lighter than doughy versions elsewhere.
Service was excellent.

Recommended for solid Italian fare and pizza or a couple pops in the nice cocktail bar.
