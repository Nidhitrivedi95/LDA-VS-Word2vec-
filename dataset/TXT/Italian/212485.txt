I used to work at a cheesesteak restaurant that specialized in making greasy, cheesy, melty deliciousness like any classic cheesesteak. however, the defalcos cheesesteak is more than that. the bread has a perfect crunch to it, the meat is hearty and delicious... 5 stars. not to mention the rest of their menu... all i need is that cheesesteak though
