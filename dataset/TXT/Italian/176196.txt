nGaHAOp191884-yx5CHHCg Great place to eat, Lemon Chicken is the best in the world. Many entrees available.Portions are always big. Kids meals are big enough for a 300 lbs man. Fresh Bread and oil given at start is awesome and I am sure you'll be going for seconds. Price is very reasonable. We did a private party there too...great service.
