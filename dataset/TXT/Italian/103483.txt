Fn_IxcCtZl1EoS81sq_s9w The garlic knots were so small!!! The size of a grape tomato.  The pizza was terrible.  No taste.  A few slices of Pepperoni and a sprinkle of beef and sausage flavoring.  Couldn't find the meat. And it was called a meatlovers pizza!  Wheres the BEEF!    Not worth the trip.  We never order again.  Pizza Hut would have been better even though thats not real pizza. NYPD Pizza could you move to RIGGS Please!!
