QGUeajuwtOSegh7JbrbuXA Been here a couple times now and like the place so far, although I haven't had a full meal. Their staff is friendly and accommodating and they have a good bar with big screen TVs - a rarity in the neighbourhood. There's nothing that totally stands out, but I've gotta say it's a solid place. I like the little appetizers that they do in the early evenings.
