-b-waFIsc6BJdXWOJMRKEQ I stopped by Marinellas for dinner while I was at the Taste of Italy festival recently. I have never heard of them before, and I must say that I was quite impressed by my experience there. We sat outside on their patio, and enjoyed some sunshine and people-watching while we waited for our food.

The waitress told us that Marinellas is a family-owned restaurant, with the family members working in the kitchen and managing the food service. It's definitely an authentic Italian restaurant! Best of all, all of their pastas are handmade!

I ordered the Penne Alla Vodka, which has prosciutto and mushrooms, cooked in a delicious vodka-infused tomato sauce. The penne was cooked just right, not too soggy or too dry. I also tried some of their Fettucine Chicken Alfredo, which was very tasty as well. The handmade element definitely made their pastas extra delicious!
