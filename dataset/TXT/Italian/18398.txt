2NiBvT5zL272IRcxru_x9A Todd was our waiter and definitively stood out above any aspect of our dining experience. Knowledgable, warm, friendly and quick to recommend from his vast knowledge of Boccas menu. 

Garlic fries were the big deal meal treat of the night. Crispy outside and soft, non oily core. Very good  flavor, a bit robust but I like my garlic strong. 

Pizza was pretty good, a little thick on the bread but overall pizza size was perfect to split with another fellow pizza lover 

Overall a fine dining experience!
