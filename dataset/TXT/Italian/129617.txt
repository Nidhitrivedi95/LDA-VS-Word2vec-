i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Came across a Restaurant.com certificate for this.  So when we show up there is a meat case selling salame and a few other things, and a really big blackboard listing all their sandwiches.  They have both hot and cold sandwiches.  It took a while to make a choice.

I ordered the (hot) pork sausage, and my wife ordered the (cold) salame, prosciutto, asiago, mortadella.  Plus we got the beef soup.  You can order half or whole sandwiches except for one or two of their sandwiches.  They have their own in-house made bread, too.  When the sandwiches arrived they were very big.

We both liked our choices, and the beef soup too!  One thing about their bread is that it is not wimpy sliced bread from the store.  It's crusty and chewy.  The bite force necessary to get a bite sends the other ingredients shooting out the other side!  I ended up using a knife a fork instead.

This is a good neighborhood deli.  Not like Subway or Quiznos.  Much better.  Better ingredients, more choices, better bread.  And it's not a chain, it's owned by a couple.  I think we'll be back.
