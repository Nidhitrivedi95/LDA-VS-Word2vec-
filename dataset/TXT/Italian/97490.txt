Somehow every time I have a take out order I can't get away from ordering their large GET MEATY pizza! I just stop eating it!!!!. My wife orders their custom calzones, and loves them!!!! The staff remembers you, and are always friendly. In the busy season, this place is very popular so paring can be an issue, but solved by ordering early....this is the the best pizza restaurant around!!!
