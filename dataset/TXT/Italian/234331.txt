TQqhfjlPVEz41K_wAogQSQ What a travesty.  Sysco headquarters.  Ingredients were terrible.  Pizza, if you can call it that, was almost inedible and the kids pasta was worse than a cafeteria.  The interior was corporate and obvious.  They were running a raffle for a bike or something that was bizarre for a restaurant.  Terrible Disney-fied Italian.
