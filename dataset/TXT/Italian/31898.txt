The atmosphere was very warm and relaxing. I had the cheese tortellini and I thought that it was delicious! We had their signature meatball, which they call "the 8th wonder of the world", for an appetizer.  It was really good, but it's just a meatball. The portion of pasta was pefect, athough I am so used to over portions and getting a doggie-bag. We spent about $60 for the two meals and appetizer. Honestly we probably couldve got the same meal at Olive Garden for a lot less.  Reservations are recommended for the weekend after 7!
