neHvFz_Q2thklke5wJ7LiQ Terrible food.   I ordered 2 stuffed cheese crusts. .. one was made wrong,  it was suppose to be cheese only ours wasn't,  apparently when you put in certain codes it changes your order? 

I don't know how but the pizza was undercooked but dried out... made very sloppy, messy, terrible flavors.
Could barely eat one piece! Greasy cheese crust wasnt defined so there was no cheese crust really just melted all over....yuck!

Crust was so thin in the middle could barely pick up a piece yet it was doughy.

Not worth another try.
