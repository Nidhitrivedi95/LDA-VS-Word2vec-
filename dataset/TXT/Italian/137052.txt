J1qzIVBt3lGpiz-8UdjhXg I went here with a large party. The servers did a good job keeping up with everyone. The White Clam sauce was outstanding. Very good pasta. The Rich Meat sauce also was good. Bread service was average, as was the salad. I'm not a big pasta person, but this was a very good meal.
