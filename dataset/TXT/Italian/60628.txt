aVvMVhCSNT3d4W37Ue1aUw We are neighbors to this restaurant and had high hopes for it.  The escargot appetizer was initially very good.  But the pappardelle bolognese was overcooked and flavorless.  It was bland and had no seasoning.  And the pasta was from a box-- not made in-house.  The ravioli, which was made in house, was fine.  The pork tenderloin was way overcooked and chewy.  The owner, Daniel, was initially very charming;  that is, until we told him about our thoughts and constructive criticism regarding his food, after which Daniel became argumentative.  It was interesting to see the change in his personality:  from gregarious and polite to mean spirited and defensive.  Perhaps Daniel's food was acceptable and even considered good years ago-- but now, with all the competition (e.g. Claudio, Bianco, Marcellino and the myriad others,) Daniel is a relic and the food he produces simply cannot compete with the new, cutting edge chefs.  Instead of dining at Daniel's, take a short drive down the street and go to Bianco's, which is infinitely better.  Or Central Bistro would be a nice choice as well.
