SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Current obsession: Herbs & Rye

I've sat at the bar both times and have been wildly entertained both times. The show stopping bartender is Spotty who somehow manages to mix cocktails like a boss while still taking great care of the people right in front. 


During my first visit he and Joe took great care welcoming me as a first time guest. Stopped, shook my hand, asked my name, welcomed me to Vegas. I felt like royalty! I drank the Hemingway Daiquiri which forever changed the way I think about the Daiquiri cocktail. Not overly sweet. Tart. Delicious. 

The filet sliders are juicy bites of heaven. You know it's going to be mouth wateringly delicious when they ask what temp you want the meat on your sliders. The bruschetta flatbread was refreshing and delicious. The showstopper was the shrimp cocktail. I want to go back in time and thank that shrimp for its service. 

Before I left Joe asked where I was headed. He made a "boomerang cocktail" message to take with me to the Velveteen Rabbit bartenders. 

I already feel at home at this place. So much so that I went back the following night and enjoyed their HH steak. The New York strip was a steal!! Garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus + all the cocktails makes for a delicious evening. 

See you soon because I'm going to boomerang my booty back asap.
