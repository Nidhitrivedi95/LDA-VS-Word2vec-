0Ovh4Vn9ntMt5Ara-ZP2sA Sure, I can't pronounce the name of the place but that doesn't matter when the food is so amazing! My co-workers and I tried this place out on a Wednesday for lunch. We got there just in time (right before 1pm) as it filled up quickly. 
We were greeted by a friendly lady who explained that lunch doesn't have table service so she ran through the menu with us at lightning speed. My ears zoned in on the calzone with artichokes, roasted peppers and cheese. The rest was all Peanuts parents' style "mmrrrr wahhh wahh"
I added a side dish of mushroom risotto for that extra carb indulgence. The calzone was packed with large chunks artichoke hearts and gooey cheese. The risotto had an amazing creamy, rich and garlicky flavour. it got my italian friend's approval (whom I'm trying to convince to start writing reviews on here since he's a foodie). My co-workers ordered the meat calzone and a pizza which looked fresh and delicious.
My only complaint is it's very awkward to maneuver around to pay up the bill. It gets too crowded with people placing their food orders, the tables & chairs right there and people trying to leave. 
I'm definitely going to come back here again. Now, I just have to master saying the name of the place so I can recommend it to my friends!
