IqH-J1D0HIP9wyJs2q_uGQ So far not good.    Just moved to the area, a mile away, and ordered for the first time.  Girl who answered couldn't figure out how to add a new address to a new phone number and after 5+ minutes trying, put me on hold for the manager to help.  After a few minutes another person got on, and same thing happened again.  

My girlfriend called while I was on hold waiting for the manager, so I went to talk to her and was disconnected in the meantime. 

Called back, asked to speak to the manager right off the bat, and even the manager took time to figure out how to deliver to a new address.  This time I was ordering for delivery to a hotel since it had been so long and we weren't going to be at our new place.  

Same issue with hotel, took 5 minutes to figure out the address.  Finally got order in and was told 60 minutes.  75 minutes later I called and was put on hold for another 5 minutes without even being acknowledged, finally got to ask the whereabouts of my order and was told any minute.  

Delivery finally showed up 85 minutes after ordering and of course one of the pizzas was the wrong order.  Tried calling back to let them fix it, hold again forever and I finally hung up.  To the manager's credit, she called back using caller ID or the number on my order, but by then I finally had a bite of lukewarm pizza and had lost my patience.  

I hear Mellow Mushroom pizza is pretty good.  Will try that and many more before giving Libretto's another chance.
