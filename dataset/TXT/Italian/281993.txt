The food started with antipasto of grilled shrimp, grilled calamari, olives, cheeses, fried crab cakes and of course tomatoes with fresh mozzarella.  Great starter that pair wonderfully with the wine.

I had to order the osso buco which was served with risotto.  I rarely see osso buco on anyone's menu these days I had to order it and I was not disappointed.  their version is made with veal shank and the meet was sweet and tender.  It was what was needed for a long day and week of meetings on the road.

My colleague's dishes were just as appetizing especially the salmon and home made gnocchi which I must try the next time I am in town.  This is a great establishment to visit and share a meal and enjoy the great service and food.
