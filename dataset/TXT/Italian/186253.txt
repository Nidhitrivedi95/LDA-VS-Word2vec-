OpCWTpPscK2WCAO_XlztUg Having passed by this plaza on a regular basis for a few years, I had no idea there was something in it that sold food, let alone good food, so imagine my surprise when my friend said, let's go eat at that plaza by huntingwood and pharmacy. "EINH?!" was my response..."do you mean bridlewood mall?" 

I was still in a disbelief when the plaza came into view - there's no restaurants in there! Except I was wrong. Duh. The bakery is tucked into a tiny tiny corner and virtually unseeable to the naked eye of a muggle without special food searching prowess (well in summer they have outdoor so that helps a bit more, but otherwise, you could easily not realize it's there).

So now the question is, why only 3 star and not 4, given my elaborate description of the restaurant shop and the simple fact I said the food is good? Well convenient travels from my personal location doesn't really account for a star bump right? If you happen to be in the neighbourhood and looking for somewhere to eat without having to go all the way down to Sheppard or up to Steeles, then this place is the bomb. Sandwiches, salad, and pasta freshly made with friendly service and decent price point: $5 for a plain veal sandwich, $1 extra for mushrooms, $1.50 for cheese, $0.50 for cooked onions (they dont have raw), $2 for eggplants, etc. Basically every topping you add will cost you extra. 

But would I make a special trip out there just to eat the sandwich if I have a car and am not too lazy to use it? Not really. It's good food, just not good enough to travel far for. 1 proletariat michelin star.
