IvovJ3sfYrjHKH_hS5XrNA So it's 6:15pm on a Tuesday evening and we ordered an x-large works pizza and 2 small drinks, which are refillable. I asked the young man at the counter if we can substitute bacon for ham. He told me yes, then tried to up-charge me for the bacon without mentioning a charge to me. The drinks are literally half the size of any small drink anywhere, about 3 inches tall (child size), yet cost over $2.00 each. Then the pizza comes, barely cooked and the cheese is not even completely melted yet. Barely any toppings, yet cost $18.99. Sardella's and even Little Caesar's taste a hell of a lot better and cost less! The kicker was when we sat down to wait over 1/2 hr for the pizza, the TV SHOW were all in Spanish. I looked around and all 8 tables around me were not Spanish. I asked a young lady employee if all the TV SHOW were in Spanish and she looked insulted and said she could change it for me. I simply said this is America, and I would think that the majority of Tvs would be in English. She said there are a lot of Spanish speaking guests that come there (which is not particularly evident tonight) but that wasn't the point. I have no problem with TVS in Spanish, but it would be nice to have one in English while I wait too long for my crappie, over-priced and undercooked pizza and my childlike  $2+ dollar drink. 
Definitely don't recommend THIS particular Peter Piper Pizza, which I used to really love. Very disappointed.
