Q8qsbFqIE7lwA-zkv07fxA Came here for an elementary school spirit night. The food was ok, but there was no kids menu. They charged $8-10 for a small plate of noodles and plain red sauce for kids and extra for kids drinks! Unbelievable! You can cook spaghetti noodles for a whole family for $2! For 4 kids this added up to whole lot of wasted money and the biggest tab we've ever had at an average quality restaurant such as this. We felt totally ripped off and will not be returning.
