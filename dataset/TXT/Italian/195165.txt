We had the good fortune of stumbling across this place on an exploratory walk (although I was aware of the good reviews...) before closing time for the afternoon (2:00 PM) and we ordered the Marghareta - which is our favorite - and this was decidedly one of the two best we have had the pleasure of enjoying here in Phoenix.  The other is just a few blocks from here and from where we are staying and it is going to be a difficult choice to decide which one to come back to first!   The service was great - friendly, quick and informative - and the location is fabulous.  We had the pleasure of sitting outside on the porch.   I have to admit I have no idea how the Pizza Hut across the street stays in business!   The prices were quite fair for what we received.  The pizza was at tasty as any I have ever had...and I just decided that Pomo will be the next place we go...again!
