XH2TZmZt6gzHHpjqk8C6pg I love this restaurant in fact my husband and I go here so often because its a sure thing.  I am really surprised at some reviews, I guess not everyone knows what tastes good.  I love that the food is organic and home made, and soo fresh.  As for the portions, they are perfect. No one wants to go out to a restaurant leaving like they will explode, you want to feel like you could have more.    Big portions is for chain restaurants not fine dining.  The atmosphere is great too. Also price is very fair.  You pay for the quality and service you get.  I am also happy to say it is one of the few restaurants I feel safe to eat in , they handle allergies with care.
