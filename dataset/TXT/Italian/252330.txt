Before starting the madness on industry night, we stopped by LAVO for a fairly light dinner.  We ordered an array of different appetizers, entrees, and desserts.   The wait was lengthy and unfortunately, the food and service were only mediocre. Considering the prices - averaging $20/appetizer and $30-$40/entrees, I think the food could have been a lot better.  I was more impressed with the appetizers than the actual entrees.  The beef carpaccio had nice flavor and was served with parmesan crisps, which was a nice touch.  The tuna tartare is worth ordering.  Fresh tuna with just the right pinch of citrus.  The pasta and lobster were both sub-par; they were both lacking in flavor.  Nothing that was worth paying premium prices for.

If you're big on desserts, try the deep-fried oreos. It sounds ridiculously fattening, and I'm sure they, however they are heavenly.  Little warm oreos deep fried in batter and served with vanilla ice cream.  Do I really need to say more?

Overall, LAVO is convenient and a great comfortable setting for getting together with friends, although don't come here expecting a magical culinary experience.
