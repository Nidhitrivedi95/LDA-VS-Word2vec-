ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw I have gotten take out here many times, and it is usually good. last night I got a combo meatball & sausage side, & a kickbutt garlic bread. The garlic bread was a soggy, garlic butter soaked mess which needed to be put under my broiler before eating. At about 2:00 am I woke up and the worst explosive diarrhea  ever!! I suspect the garlic bread, as I have had the meatballs & sausage before, and they were fine. I had to wait about 10 minutes for my food even though I got there 25 minutes after I phoned in the order, and was told 20 to 30 minutes on the phone. The girl who took care of me was high or something. She didn't have a nickel to make correct change, as I paid cash. And while I was waiting she put someone else's bill and credit card in front of me and asked me to sign it. WTF???
