pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ The food is delicious and I love the staff.  It took longer than usual to get our food in the new location but I just contributed that to the fact that it was a bigger crowd and perhaps the chefs are just adjusting to cooking for more people at once.  I'm addicted to the veal Scallopini and they make it gluten free if you ask. Be sure to sign up for their email club and get their olive appetizer for free.
