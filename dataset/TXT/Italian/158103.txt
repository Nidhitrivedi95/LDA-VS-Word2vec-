leZNWLccyBaXpPIRPK_lsA It is hit or miss with this place.
I miss the good ole days before the menu changed several times.
The pizza they had back in the day was so darn good!
I don't like to go here with out a coupon just because I don't want to pay full price for something that just tastes OK.
But with a coupon I feel better.
We don't have a lot of options over here besides the Burger King (that location is terrible) and Capriotti's (which is tasty-full heaven) so it is a nice change when o a bargain.
The bread sticks are unlimited if you eat inside which is a nice perk and you can get free refills on your soda.
The staff is usually very friendly and helpful.
