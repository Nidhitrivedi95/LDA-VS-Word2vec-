Not many people here during dinner on a Wednesday night. Hostess was nice, waitress was really sweet. $2 glasses of wine, always a good choice. 

Bread and dip was amazing, loved it
Had calamari for an app, was a little salty and chewy but still not bad
My ravs were good, not out of this world or anything, but still decent
And my date's chicken marsela was good too.
Had cannollis for dessert, not bad either!

Overall it was a good experience! We had one of the discount deals where you pay $25 and get $50 gift certif. I think it was worth it, however, the drive, not so much. A hike for a west sider like myself, but a good experience.
