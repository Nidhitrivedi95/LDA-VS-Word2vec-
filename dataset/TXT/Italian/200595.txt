PVdy4harWpqcqQZH8mZXkg Decided to eat here because of other Yelpers. I'm not a big pizza person, but the boyfriend is and it was his turn to pick the restaurant. I am so glad we ate here. The pizzas are amazing. They are Italian pizzas not American pizzas so you'll find they have no tomato sauce. Trust me you don't miss it. We had the margarita, Hawaiian, mushroom, and BLT. You get a discount for ordering four small pizzas. They were out in minutes and disappearing off our plates just as fast. 

They also serve pastas but we were too stuffed to try them. He said he makes his own sausage and mozzarella, and he was making dough while we ate. You can buy pizza crust cooked or frozen as well. 

We heated up our left overs in our Nuwave oven, so we didn't have an issue with the crust as another reviewer mentioned. 

We can't wait to go back!!! :)
