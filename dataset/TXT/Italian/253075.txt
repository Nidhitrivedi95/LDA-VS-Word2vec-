VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w pros: free entry for girls and open bar from 11-12 and guys got in for 10 dollars and also got a free drink card so pretty much it equaled out.

cons: bartenders are bitches and make shitty ass drinks :( and dance floor is ridic. music is kinda crappy in the beginning.. a lot of lady ga ga crap  and old school hip hop. =/ they started spinnin some house / electro music around midnight.. i personally did not like how the club is upstairs. i didnt like walking up all those stairs in my high heels =( and then walking all the way down again. fml
