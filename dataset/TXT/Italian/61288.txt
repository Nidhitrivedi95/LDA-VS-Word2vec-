aYjZc-3aVbPIPaJgGiUK_A My husband and I recently ate here, and while it wasn't an unpleasant experience, for the money I'd rather dine at Eno Vino. The cocktail menu lacked anything light and fruity but they did accommodate my request. Our server was polite, but she made little attempt to explain the esoteric and limited menu even though we told her it was our first visit to Nostrano. She also made little attempt to bring our drinks promptly. As a former server-now foodie, this is a huge no-no. I actually enjoy the anticipation of waiting for a well-prepared meal, but I expect to be offered a drink the first time a server visits my table, not wait ten minutes after her second visit. The menu has few vegetarian options, and if I wanted a salad I can make a magnificent one at home for about 1/8th the price.

Hubs had the risotto, while I had the seafood brodecco. The portion size was perfect and the flavors were amazing. My tastebuds were dazzled, and I sampled his risotto-which is what I will order if we do end up going again. Our server didn't bring our new drinks out until halfway through the meal. Perhaps she was new, or having an 'off' night? The place didn't seem so large that the bartender could have been that backed up. On the plus side, our drinks lasted us through dessert, which was a chocolate torte with gellato. Made from sheep's milk, it was slightly salty, but I thought this only added to the flavor.

I would have given more stars if there were more options for those of us who prefer not to eat mammals. I also would have appreciated more welcoming hospitality as opposed to the indifference we encountered.
