Uqs18_AgDYsByvtSSOMzkw I went here at 8 pm on a Monday night and the place was practically empty, which I never consider to be a good sign. 

The service was fine, but I would have expected nothing less, given how few people were in the restaurant.

Monday night football was playing on several big screen TVs, which I thought was interesting, because at first glance Boccacino doesn't come across as a sports bar.

I ordered the Pizza Italiano. It was very average, basically only a half step above what you might get at a take-out pizza place. Plus, the crust got soggy about halfway through. I can make pizza equal or better to it at home. Also, the bread they served before the meal wasn't very fresh. 

Montreal has so many amazing restaurants in the same price range as this place - don't waste your money here.
