qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA Went there to enjoy the prefix dinner last night. Excellent service delicious food beautiful ambiance. I would return again. The prefix was a great deal and it was awesome. Little hard to find in the mall upstairs overlooking the canals but worth the effort.  

The Branzino was delicious. Also loved the Sicilian  Cabernet which was only $10 a glass.  Stefano was a great waiter.
