dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw Had to eat a late dinner and Fiamma was open.  The menu is pricey, but the food was pretty tasty.  I think everyone in our party of 5 were happy with their orders.  Felt a little pressure to order more food though...With all the choices in Vegas, I don't think I would return, but if you happen to be at the MGM, I'd definitely recommend this place over Craftsteak which is right nextdoor.
