-raUM9T-1dKPiB5_vRmFYA ITALIAN BEEF = Sensationally, Soaking Good
** Served hot and fresh, super tender meat, soft roll absorbed nicely from  a very flavorful au jus sauce, under $7! [Very Filling]

HOT DOG =  Chicago-style Good
** Vienna beef on soft, steamy poppy seed buns
** Great tasting toppings, no complaint here!

FRIES = Hot and Crispy!
** The way I like 'em!

VIBE = Cozy, Low-Key, and Sporty (Scottsdale Location)

COMBO = HOT DOG + FRIES + DRINK = approx $6

Key Note: Beverages are RC Products :)

CONCLUSION: Its not a fancy joint, but its the closest to Chicago you can get in Phoenix.  The Scottsdale location makes the Italian Beef the same way, so there is consistency all the way around.  Luke's has been a regular lunch hit for me.
