N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ This place is OK but be prepared for your order to be substantially wrong. We ordered a chicken Philly cheese steak, got a beef Philly cheese steak. Paid extra $4 for black and green olives in calzone, could find neither. Fries were oily and mushy. Most of what we did get was good but one person had nothing to eat and the food is overpriced considering that you don't get what you order. Won't order from here again. Dinner for two with soda and cheesecake was $67 plus tip. Disappointing!

Manager wrote to apologize and offered to replace sandwich. We'll give them another chance! Appreciate the kind response.
