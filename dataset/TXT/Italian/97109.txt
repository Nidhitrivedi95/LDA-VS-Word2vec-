esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA DO NOT COME HERE FOR THE PANROAST. 
- overpriced
- Palace Station's panroast is 100x better

Clam chowder (4/5) - This was good
Calamari (3/5) - Just okay

I must say, i did NOT try the oysters. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes here but I would not come here to try the panroast. This place is WAY overpriced compared to the oyster bar at palace station which is much better.
