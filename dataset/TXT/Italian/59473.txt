AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw Did a search on Google for the best cocktails in Phoenix and ended up here. Was not disappointed. The food and cocktails were excellent. Followed Yelpers suggestions for the crispy chicken skins with the chile honey sauce and had my first taste of ho cakes with prosciutto. The wife had the beef brasato with broccolini and enjoyed it immensely. Another place to frequent on Fridays:-)
