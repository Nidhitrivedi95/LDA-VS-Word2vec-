j54J0Ky4ruVbN_NTJ3daFg It's a small restaurant with great food. For those that think the kind old man is the owner, you're wrong. He's half in the bag by 9pm, but he's what makes the place special. Know this and you will be fine. Great salad, bread and pasta. I need to try some other things on the menu, but I stick to what I like. They will make what you want if you are nice about it and it's not complicated. It's not off the charts expensive like most restaurants in Pittsburgh. Since it's small it is hard to get a table most nights and it can be loud, but I don't mind.
