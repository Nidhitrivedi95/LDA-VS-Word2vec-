Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw Came with the family and ordered fried zucchini, 2 philly cheese steaks and a sausage and peppers/onions sandwich.  All were very good.  They have also serve Pelligrino by the large bottle so were given a few cups to share.  Located in a strip mall right across the street from UNLV.  Fairly large and they have a large TV so you can watch football while eating.  A steady stream of customers in and out.  Prices were a little steep as just a sandwich was $8.99, but they do offer daily specials, which I didn't notice the board until after ordering.  Solid choice though.
