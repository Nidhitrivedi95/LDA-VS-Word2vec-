9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Oven brick pizza here is delicious. Great romantic intimate atmosphere and on some nights they have live music outside. Love this place for dinner but not for lunch. I like this pizza better than the famous Bianco's pizza. Parking in the street is your only option and that is the only major complain I have about this place.
