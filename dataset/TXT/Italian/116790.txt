GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q Italian Deli???  With all of the 4 and 5 Star reviews I was expecting a real Italian Deli. Not even close. Where is the Capocolla, Mortadella, I could go on and on but it is non-existent.  The menu is limited to a short list of hot sandwiches and a short list of cold sandwiches. Nothing is custom made. From all the reviews I tried a half chicken salad and a half hoagie.  The chicken salad was chicken, celery, and mayo. They bobbed it on a decent french roll. No lettuce, no tomato, no pickles or peppers of any kind.  The "Italian Hoagie" was also on a decent french roll and contained 3 slices of salami, a slice of boiled colorless ham, a slice of cheese you could see through, a little shredded lettuce, 2 thin half slices of tomato, and a small amount of dressing that was hard to find. Nothing else.  The prices are inexpensive, but it's no wonder. Italian Deli?  I don't  think so.  Makes me think all the reviews are phony.
