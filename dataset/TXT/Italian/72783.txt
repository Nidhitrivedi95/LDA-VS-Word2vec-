cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ your experience at this restaurant depends on who serves you.  we did not even get to the main entree because it took 40 mins to get wine one ordered.  after that it was not much better the appetizer came out after again having to approach the "? matre'd appetizer grilled octopus came out cold Made comment to waiter if the appetizer were coming this long he needed to tell the customers he blamed the kitchen.  Then when we asked the hostess to settle the bill told her did not want the main. meal and attempted to tell her the prob her answer was she was the front of the house and has nothing to do w the back.  any other restaurant would have had a "manager " try to reconcile the prob not here im sure the summerlin crowd will forgive this sort of service i know i expect higher standards?  how can a hostess say that ? chef marc why do u have a hostess and ? matre'd and not have our situation appealed?
