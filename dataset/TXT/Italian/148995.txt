Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA Walking through the plaza by Linq, I stopped at Flour and Barleys to go outdoor window. I loved that they had a window to just grab a slice of pizza from quickly! The convenience was awesome! The staff was quick to get me a fresh slice and it was only like $5, which wasn't bad for Vegas pricing! The slices are huge and filling, I got pepperoni. The had Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes by the pick up area all ready for customers. They also had standing tables outside for ppl to eat at after they grabbed their slice.
