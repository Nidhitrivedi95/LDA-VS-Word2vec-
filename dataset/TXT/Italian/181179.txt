nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ $25 for dinner. Don't be fooled by the the front face of the restaurant. The food looks amazing and you can definitely tell that it's made of high quality with fresh ingredients. Unfortunately they lacked consistency with their portions (especially since they have a fixed menu) and flavour for all dishes. It was just too salty and I wish the veggies were cooked more. I honestly felt that the plating of the dishes deceived my taste buds.They also do give out plastic water bottles instead of glasses. 

Great service! They were very curious about how you found out about the restaurant and really emphasized how fresh the food was. It was also good to know that the food does take a while to make.
