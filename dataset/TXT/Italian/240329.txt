Seriously, this place is great.  The concept is super simple.  Gi-huge-ic pizza by the slice for only 5 bucks!  Get a whole pie if you need to feed the Brady bunch.  Just be careful.  The box won't fit in your car.  You'll need a few bungee cords to strap it too the roof!

Benny's is open late every night.  They rock it out until 3AM on Friday's and Saturday's.  It's pretty genius when you think about it.  Everyone getting kicked out of the bars at 2AM just floods into Benny's for a slice before heading home.  Late night herb enthusiasts can get their midnight munchie fix on too.  A better business model does not exist.  #nailedit

Don't expect a 5 star dining experience.  It's four walls and a pizza oven done right.
