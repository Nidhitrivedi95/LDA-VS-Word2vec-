Pizza Hut was on my way home and I was hungry so I just ordered it. Came in and picked up my order, it was ready on time. Came home to find I had picked up someone else's order.   I want to be clear that it appears that the manager who was male picked my pizza order up.  It was not the cashier checking me out, it was not her fault.
I know I really should have checked before I left the parking lot but I was tired and on my way home from work and they were absolutely not busy, zero people there so I figured it was my order.  This lack of customers should've also give me a hint as to when I was about to get.   I decided just to eat what I had picked up because the toppings were OK but the quality of the food was just gross, like the worst quality.  No flavor, just blah.  I don't know if they have been going downhill since I don't here here often or it's just this one in particular but I will not be returning.  Ever!
