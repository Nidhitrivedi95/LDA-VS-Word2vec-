aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ noca is good.  but not GREAT like all the reviews seem to gush.

i had been meaning to check this place out for quite some time and finally got to recently.  

it does a lot of things right, and i did enjoy the experience, but it's not even *close* to being one of the best places in phoenix.  

i would describe it as on a par with the fox restaurants (ie, north, bloom, etc) with a couple gimmicky things thrown in which seem to get all the other reviewers all jazzed up...like the poorly delivered amuse bouches between courses, or the cotton candy at the end of the meal.  

i really don't mean to sound like i'm being negative about noca...i'd certainly go back there again whenever i want an "upper quartile" solid meal...but next time i feel like having a very special dinner out, with outstanding service, ambiance, and food that goes way above, noca won't be on that list.
