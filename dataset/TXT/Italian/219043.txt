s7Pj1mNYqRTGNOXLOiBafw Figo is on a popular intersection in the entertainment centre just around the corner from the TIFF Lightbox. The floor to ceiling glass walls make it a good space to people watch and the decor is stylish and clean. Service was accommodating and more than happy to make recommendations when we were torn between choices.

Food wise, I was disappointed. I had the gnocchi and shared a beet & strawberry salad.  The gnocchi was unfortunately over done, which made it really gummy. Also, the flavor was bland so overall the dish was not to my taste. The beet and strawberry salad was much better, with bright vinegar and sweet notes from the fruit. The food was sub-par but the service was very good.
