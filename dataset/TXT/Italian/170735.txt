MWYJl-bIxhtQ-4Kg3ENUxA Thank you, iPhone!  You took us to Rosati's, and we were delighted with everything:  the waitress, the coziness, the friendly customers there with us; and, of, course, the deep dish Chicago pan pizza. The slightly sweet, crisp crust; the savory sausage; the nutty warm cheese; that wonderful sauce!  We will be back!
