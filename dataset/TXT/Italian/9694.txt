The market salad was amazing and unlike anything I've ever had before. The house made tomato, basil and mozzarella past was also amazing.  Honestly, the real star may have actually been the bread basket though. There were four kinds, and they were all delicious.  We also had the veal, but compared to the other things we ordered, it was the least exciting part of the meal.
