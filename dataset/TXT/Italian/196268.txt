PmwKGY3HLpcnC_-g0NCIvQ Very Good Greek food with a nice family atmosphere.  I get a sense this place is family owned by the hospitality and time they take to explain the menu.  Diner like atmosphere, outdoor seating and very clean.  
This very well may be the best restaurant (not just Greek) in Goodyear.
