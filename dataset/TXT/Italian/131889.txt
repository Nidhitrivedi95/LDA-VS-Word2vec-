ii9kqE9s4456Jn9asz-BPQ Casual dressy place in Old Port offering steak, pasta, pizza. Mostly a pizza/pasta place and their pizzas are usually recommended but I was not feeling pizza that day so went for Veal shank plate with tomato sauce and risotto. It was so good. I am a sucker for tangy tomato flavours in general so this was a win anyway. But for optimum experience, I used their chili sauce (usually meant for pizza) to complement the subtlety of tomato. The meat was tender and risotto was perfect. The portion did justice to its price, I was over filled. I would actually suggest charging less and reducing the portion size because an overwhelming serving can reduce the enjoyment from flavours. I also tried my friend's pizza which was mind blowing; going to try the pizza there next time.
