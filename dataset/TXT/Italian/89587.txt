E0YuuRpK_4RpaUF7JK3mhg I just dined here for the second time and am officially in love! This restaurant has a wonderfully quaint atmosphere and a truly authentic Italian menu! The Fritto di calamari & zucchini and the Penne alla vodka are definite favorites, along with the profiteroles and the tirimisu:) I will be back again and again!
