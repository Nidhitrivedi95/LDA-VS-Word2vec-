kacZeom987POja3RwNUJpA Having gone to the Goodyear location multiple times, I assumed that this location would be very close to the real deal. sadly I was mistaken.
I ordered two Italian subs and was extremely irritated that I sat in there and waited for over 20 minutes when the only other person inside there was a couple sitting at the bar. The individual behind the counter was paying more attention to the bartender and some other employees that were also doing absolutely nothing then he was about making my sandwiches.
First of all I had about three tomatoes on my sandwich they were cut so thick!  The owner is seriously losing money if he continues to allow his employees to make those kinds of sandwiches, such a waste. My kid could make a better sandwich. Definitely not the same care and attention as the Goodyear location. This place is more like a bar and getting bar food. I won't be visiting this location again I'll stick to the Goodyear place.
