kyp6dmpiexaEhTBg7YpsSQ Stopped in here for some all day breakfast. When I first walked in I was a little skeptical because of the typical old fashioned diner decor but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the super 8 with chocolate chip pancakes, a coffee and a chocolate milkshake. Pancakes were perfect and the coffee was very good. Great value - only $5.50 for 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon slices and 2 sausages. The staff and even the other patrons were very friendly. I would definitely go back again but this time would order only a huge stack of pancakes.
