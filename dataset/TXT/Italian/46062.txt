8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA I was born and raised in Chicago, moved to Vegas in 99' and Amore is the best Chicago Style pizza in the city. I love their thin crust & signature deep dish pizza. AND, if you haven't tried their Ribs, you're missing out because they're so tender that the meat falls right off the bone. You will not be disappointment, trust me! Also, the servers are so sweet and always have a smile on their face. Enjoy!
