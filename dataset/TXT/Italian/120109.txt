H3cMcV9KK3g2pi68lDNsng I went here after being hungover for most of the day, so I was super hungry and had a hankering for some delicious food. In terms of the food, Luxe did not disappoint. The arancini was delicious. Perfectly crispy balls of risotto with mozzarella cheese inside, topped with a delectable tomato sauce.

For entrees, we got their veggie burgers with a fried egg. The burgers were good, but slightly on the bland side. It was a three been burger, with black beans, kidney beans, and one other type. I bit into a few kidney beans that were still a bit raw, so that wasn't very pleasant. The fries that came with the burger were good. Everyone at the table enjoyed their entrees. Their pizzas looked delicious! Definitely getting those next time. They had a good dessert selection, but we decided to skip on them this time and instead head across the street to Sweet Moses for some ice cream and root beer floats.

One thing though is the price. Luxe is a little on the expensive side ($10 for three arancini balls?!). Next time I'll make sure to hit it up during happy hour to get some better deals. Luxe also puts these weird towels as table runners on each table. While its a nifty idea instead of a tablecloth, the towels were all course, stained, and had holes in them. Made me feel like I was eating at a diner instead of at a decent restaurant.
