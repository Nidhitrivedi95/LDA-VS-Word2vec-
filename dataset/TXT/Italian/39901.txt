7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Let me start by saying that I don't typically write bad reviews, so the fact I'm doing so should speak volumes. I'm a Vegas local who frequents the upscale steakhouses in town. CarneVino was far and away the worst of the many I've been to. This bothers me more than usual only because the Palazzo is my favorite property in Vegas.

I ordered the $144 ribeye and it was incredibly tough. I could barely cut through the meat and obviously had an even harder time chewing. When we brought this to the attention of the server he told us he'd let the chef know. You'd think that if you're dishing out that kind of money on a cut of meat SOMETHING would be done. The resolution was the server saying "Sorry the meat was a little tough for you, hope we'll be able to see you again." Nothing was done or even offered for that matter. I know everyone has an off night, but the fact that nothing was done about my $144 steak makes me not want to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Furthermore, for a restaurant of this magnitude you'd expect the service to be outstanding. I will say that the man who refilled the water and carved our steak, Carl, was fantastic. However, our main server straight down to the hostess was rude and rarely came by the table to check on us.

There are far better places in Vegas to spend your money on a nice meal - including in the Palazzo and Venetian (CUT by Wolfgang Puck is in the same hotel and far better). Save your money and skip this place.
