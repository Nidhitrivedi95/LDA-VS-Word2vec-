TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag This was our first night in LV after 20 hours of travelling and wanted somewhere within easy reach of our hotel for dinner. Buca di Beppo is inside the Excalibur Hotel complex and offers 'family sized' Italian meals - that means for us Brits that the portions are big. We had the large Pepperoni which was too big for three of us with a few slices remaining on the board. The pizza was thin crust and the pepperoni was quite tasty but the tomato sauce was a bit insipid.

Drinks are on permanent happy hour so we could get a Light Beer for just $3 a glass. 

There was a little issue with initially getting served but this was due to the bar area only being covered by one person at 8:30pm. When we were served though the guy was great and looked after us really well, making recommendations to save money.

Bearing in mind it's inside a hotel it's a good bargain and acceptable for a quick snack.
