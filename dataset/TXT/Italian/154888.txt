l0aaLW6ZdDXWjUegUECSxg Haven't been to an Olive Garden in quite some time and decided to stop by with my girlfriend. This was the closest location coming back down from up North, so decided to give it a shot. We were promptly seated, but it took about 10 minutes to get water and be seen by our waiter. He immediately seemed rushed and asked if we wanted anything else bedsides water. When we decided on just water, he seemed really put-off and upon returning with our water, asked again if we wanted wine, or another beverage. We both looked over the menu again and I ordered the beef and tortellini and specifically asked for the meat to be cooked medium-rare. When the plate was presented, the beef was cooked well and was not tender at all. The flavour of both our dishes were good, but it was really obvious that my girlfriend's pasta had been sitting under a heat-lamp for quite some time. When it was time for the check, the waiter said thank you and practically threw the check on the table before walking away. I usually tip around, 30%, but that was certainly not the case today. Blech!
