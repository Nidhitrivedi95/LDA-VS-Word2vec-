First, we just heard that they lost their chef, he walked out, so that might explain a few things. 
They put as at a 2 top right next to the door, a sliding door, my wife's chair was half way into the entrance, hindering anyone entering the restaurant, and my neck was within 2 inches of a heater, We complained and were told that we would have to wait 1 hour or more. Thankfully a couple in a 4 top next to us asked us to join them.
a 12 course dinner tasting menu, was placed in front of us, with no price!. We were ignored for quite a while, had to ask for a regular menu. We had the Bucatini which was like paste, undercooked. They did realize this and brought us a plate of tagliatelle with black truffle, cooked to perfection. We than had the lamb shoulder, more that 1/2 of it was fat and not cooked properly. The waitress, whom seemed clueless placed, with my wife's permission, her purse on the wet floor! 

I would wait till they get another competent chef before trying the place again.
