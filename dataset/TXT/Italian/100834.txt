faTB5Lg-blm8MG-y6KUOrg I highly recommend coming to the Verona Village Inn. the food is delicious and there isn't an item on the menu not worth ordering! Plus the soup and fresh garlic bread brought to your table is just magnificent!!! The dishes are well priced for the portions and taste incredible. I had the Blackened Chicken Alfredo and it was AMAZING! Noodles cooked just right the sauce was perfect and the chicken was fantastic.
