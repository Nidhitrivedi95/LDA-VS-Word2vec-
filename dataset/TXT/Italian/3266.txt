_4noxz6NM0gBeVhZ58Emtg Dropped by today and bought some pastries and lasagna, the cakes are sooooooo good! Especially the strawberry tart and fruit Napoleon (I'm not sure what exactly the name is), but they do make the BEST custard in scarborough! And also cannoli and lobster tail are both very nice. However, the lasagna is very disappointed since it become too soft and can't taste the layers. 
I think the price is very fair as well, at least affordable for everyone.

This is a 4.5 and definitely will return.
