Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw We were staying at the Linq and I had a huge craving for Italian food! We decided to try this place in the venetian. My husband and I shared the chicken Parmesan and he also had a salad on the side. Holy portions! We still had leftovers when we were done eating!!

The chicken parm was fantastic! The sauce was amazing. The chicken was moist and had just the right amount of breading. We were a little worried when we got there because the place had very few customers but don't let that deter you from visiting!
