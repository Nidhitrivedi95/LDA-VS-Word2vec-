roz-ed8kvBF6fwKBPeJ49Q I just had the BEST ravioli that I have ever had, and with an Italian mother-in law, I have had some incredible ravioli. I was traveling for work, and really hate eating alone at nice resturants, but a co-worker had taken me here for dinner on my last trip to Phoenix, so I knew that the food was awesome, so I decided to skip room service and headed to the restaurant alone. I was greeted warmly as I entered the cozy bar area. Andreas made me an awesome grey goose martini, which was perfectly chilled with ice slivers floating on the top. Robbie, the owner, was very welcoming, and I no longer felt uncomfortable eating a "real dinner" alone. 
I want to thank Andreas for the suggestion the ravioli, and I would like to thank him, Robbie, and the other staff members for making me feel like a family member. I look forward to my next business trip in October to see my new friends again. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves homemade pasta, fresh salads, and perfect martinis.
