FmraE2CWt65VRnEqCAqNEg Went to Harvey's when it first opened, and you could tell they had some work to do to iron out the kinks of a new restaurant.  Wasn't initially impressed, except that the team was friendly and open to feedback.  

Just left there tonight, and man is that the place to be in the San Tan area.  The open air bar area was packed with people and the drinks were flowing.  The team was on their A game with refills of drinks before you could ask.  I think they added a few TVs as you could watch the Cardinals game all over the place.

Wife and I ordered the Strawberry Salad, and it's often hard to find a place that uses dark greens as generous as Harvey's does.  No wilted greens here, it was if they had picked it fresh out of the garden out back. Fresh bleu cheese and candied walnuts with other dried fruits all added to the richness of the salad.  

I gotta say tonight's experience has me looking at the calendar slotting the next visit.  Bravo team Harvey, bravo.
