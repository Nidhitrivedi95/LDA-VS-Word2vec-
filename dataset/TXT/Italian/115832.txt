GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA My wife and I stopped in here on a whim while walking back from the Palazzo to the Venetian for a glass of wine and the bartender there Saturday night was really on point.  Jason was very well versed in wine and recommended a fantastic white:  Bastianich Vespa Bianco.  I probably would have tried something else if he had not asked me what my preferences were in whites and he absolutely nailed it.  I can't speak for the food but the wine experience at the bar was worthy of a return visit next time.
