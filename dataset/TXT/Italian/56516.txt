AKUvebt0zJ0ilx0U0ZGfug I used to love California Sandwiches - soft bread, melty cheese, lots of tomato sauce and crispy fried eggplant fillings. What's not to love?! 

I found out today that their tomato sauce is cooked with a veal shank in it. So, no sauce for me. The standard sandwich came with eggplant, sauce and a sprinkle of parmesan. Cheese was an extra 1.25$. 

So, I had a crispy eggplant sandwich with cheese and no sauce. It was fine, albeit boring and dry. Without the sauce, it was lacking in flavour and not worth it. I don't think that I will be back.
