2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg Sometimes when I'm not feeling making breakfast, I say to my boyfriend - "I feel like fancy breakfast today," and off we go to Leone Cafe. I like this place better than Sambalatte - it's much more a restaurant than a coffee shop. 

I LOVE that they have a dog-friendly shaded patio area. I take my dog there and people are always super friendly. The food is solid - with large portion sizes as well. AND it's not just a big serving of mediocre food - the menu is well thought out and it's good quality.  Everything I've had here has been great. 

Also, the juices are delicious and the coffee drinks are great.  The prices are a little higher than I'd like on the drinks (I'd say the food is on target, it's a little pricey but because the portions are big and the ambience is great, I'd say on point). 

There's no question I'll be back.
