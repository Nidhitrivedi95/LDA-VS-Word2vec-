kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ BEWARE! The restaurant you are reading wonderful reviews for is NOT the restaurant you will be visiting, should you choose to dine here. Be prepared to pay twice as much for completely different food that is shown on the menu here on Yelp. I honestly felt scammed, having been here several months ago and enjoying everything about the restaurant, only to return to the same restaurant under the same name, and find that everything has changed. Perhaps the new owner should reopen the restaurant with a new name. That would be the honest thing to do. The new menu is fine if you're expecting limited options of items you may not be able to pronounce, and are willing to ask plenty of questions about what is offered, and then receive a tiny portion of food for a large chunk of change. We dropped $45 for a small entree, a side, and a minuscule salad? The food we received was mediocre overall, with poor value for the price paid. The service we received was mediocre as well. Needless to say, we won't be going back. The new owner should make an ethical decision to be open with the public about the complete changes that have been made. The previous reviews and menus should really be removed from Yelp.
