Ya9FMj-MWMkeMcog06N5bQ I came here with friends on the recommendation that some of them had tried the one in Columbus and liked it. We came in the afternoon. Our server was terrible, she seemed very distracted and in spite of the place being relatively empty, she kept disappearing. It was a long time in between when she'd check on us. By the end of the meal we actually had to get up and search for her to get our check only to find she was outside!! Secondly, the restaurant itself was pretty filthy, the floors and tables were sticky with stuff allover them, as well as the bathrooms. Anyway, the food was the only good thing, which is why I gave two stars. I had the street tacos, they were delicious. None of us had any complaints about our food, however we will probably not return or recommend.
