pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Okie doke, I've ate here twice, had the Lasagna and Chicken Parm. Both times I wasn't impressed. Lemme start by saying in my opinion, great Italian food starts with the sauce. If the sauce is plain or has nothing memorable about it then fahgettaboutit.

So steps in boring Lasagna and (non breaded?) Chicken Parm so bland that I'm pretty sure I could make it myself. My GF and her mom had the clam pasta dish and neither raved about it, finished half or asked for a to-go box. Afterwards me and my gf went for drinks and then... secret pizza; if that says anything. This wasn't the worst meal ever, especially with the lemon thyme drink, but I wouldn't go back here with so many other options in Vegas.

0/2
-service
-prices (expensive)
-atmosphere
-food quality 
+the "Lemon Thyme" drink was good
+proximity to the Palms (lol)

Ok had to say at the end that this place stays packed and theres alot of great reviews. But I seriously tried twice people! Twice!!! 

Maybe its just me
