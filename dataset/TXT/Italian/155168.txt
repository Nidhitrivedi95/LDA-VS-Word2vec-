l0WauZ92kRg9bu2oxHj4TQ This rating is strictly for the pizza. (Haven't had anything else). Love the pizza! I'm from the east coast and the regular cheese pizza here is pretty close to the good ole Italian pizza I'm used to from NY.  $20 for a pie. Wished they still had their liquor license. Nothing like a beer and a great slice of pizza. : )
