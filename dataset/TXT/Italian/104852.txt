fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ Unfortunately I have to drop my review down a star. I stopped in for lunch on 12/23 and they have done away w/gluten free options which is such a terrible idea being that many people suffer from celiac or gluten allergies.  The waitress said they also removed the wheat pasta for those who are health conscious. I won't be returning for that reason alone and hope that corporate will rethink their choice for removing such items.
