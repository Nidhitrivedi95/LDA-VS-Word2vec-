vExvdgUbU377-Fry2uuv_w We had supper at the Banknote Bar this evening.

Gord and Shawna both ordered Southern Fried Chicken.  They said it was delicious and would get it again.  Maybe I'll get it next time!

I had Prime Rib (with no veggies and extra mashed potatoes).  It was good ... definitely a Sunday meal.  The potatoes were just like I'd make at home.  Yum!

Mackenzie was our server and she took good care of us.
