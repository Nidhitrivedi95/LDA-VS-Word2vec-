N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg Just moved from chicago to phoenix two weeks ago. So needless to say i miss chicago food. My boyfriend took me there as a suprise yesterday after work. 


We had the thin crust cheese pizza and it was pretty close to the pizza back home. 

The only thing i didnt like was the decorm it wasnf like the orginal locations back home. I went to depaul and the one near depaul in cbicago is completely different.


Good nevertheless
