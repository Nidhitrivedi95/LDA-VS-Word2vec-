NxZIySJr3DjROJBkl_KaEg This location is amazing. I have never had firehouse subs before and I thought I would give it a try. Danny R. helped me and was so patient when I couldn't decide what I wanted. He suggested all of his favorites and the most popular sandwiches in America and specifically Phoenix. I went with a meatball sandwich with sweet and spicy meatballs and would highly recommend it to anyone. Danny even checked on my half way through my meal to make sure it was good. Thanks for your service.
