BMR_AsSBzTQHqW-SQabI4w The pizza is always yummy! I'm a stickler for good pizza and I always look forward to the various options on their menu. The Pear and Gorgonzola is delicious along with the California Club. I've tried the gluten-free crust option as well and it is so good you can't taste a difference.

Unfortunately this time the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer was fairly cold when we got it... and it even came out pretty quickly. The taste was also nothing special. 

The service is usually good... sometimes it's mediocre depending on who is working. If you are going to come here, come for the pizza... that's the main thing that will dazzle you.
