HrR_2-HUE6cqnoz1zMN9AQ Terrific Italian style pizza. Great staff, fresh atmosphere. There are a lot of pizza places in CLT--but we haven't found pizza like this--true Italian style--anywhere else in the city. We had the classic Margherita and the Omaggio Special--both were delicious and so were the leftovers- one pizza is enough for two people. Easily worth a stop when shopping around Metropolitan.
