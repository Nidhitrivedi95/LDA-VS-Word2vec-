qVQGfHphxolps16v6g5X-g Gotta love this place. I discovered it about four weeks ago based on a recommendation from a co-worker. I was in the mood for a "good" deli, somewhere that treated the art of sandwich making seriously. 

I found it. 

Since my first visit, rest assured, I've eaten there about 18 times. Tried a few different things, but their calzones, pizza, sandwiches, pastries, pasta salads, and breads are all amazing. 

Unfortunately, they could really use some help on the customer service side. They've had a sign on the door since my first visit looking for help, but as you can imagine, good help is hard to find. Plus, you can't just hire anyone that could possibly treat the food as well as they do. It's obviously more than business at Belfiore's, it's passion..
