S5Q8AMyU9Jf7G7Pq2Y2HNQ Really great new panini bar in Erin Mills. Prices are reasonable and the Paninis are great. Pasta dishes are a bit lackluster but that's not their signature dish. Wines are all around $20/bottle, and there are daily specials on drinks and food items. Very happy to have them in the neighborhood. My only criticism is that the food service is too quick - appetizers and main course often arrive almost at the same time. Take your time ordering to prevent this.
