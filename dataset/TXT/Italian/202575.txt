q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ This place was awesome! I feel like I found a hidden gem in Las Vegas. We will definitely be back with friends. My fiancé enjoyed it as well, from the entertainment (magic and a singer) to the locals sitting at the bar. The food was good too! Prices weren't too outrageous. I loved the atmosphere, whoever decorated did very well. I enjoyed the entrance in the back especially. I literally have no complaints. If I were to really search for one, it would be the urgency of receiving my drink from the bar. But seriously ignore the lady on here complaining of salty food and making you feel like you should have reservations. You will enjoy it here I promise!! :')
