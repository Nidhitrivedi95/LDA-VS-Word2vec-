65kCKrnO3SulNYEen0itGg Isa's came highly recommended from a friend who knows how high my expectations when it comes to pizza have become. For as many New York implants as there are in the valley, and for as many of those many who have opened up a pie joint, Isa's gets it right, hands down. The atmosphere was classic no frills pizzeria, and made me forget I was in Phoenix for a minute, and almost swear I could hear the taxis honking like crazy outside the front door. Sam and the guys behind the counter were very personable and friendly, and helpful with a suggestion for an eggplant and ricotta slice. I also picked up a slice of cheese, as a measuring stick for Isa's versus the other places in town I have tried, and both slices were a cut above the rest (no pun intended!). I washed both slices down with a glass of orange soda (grape soda would have been the only thing better honestly), and was in heaven. This might have been my first time at Isa's, but it will definitely not be my last. I found a little slice of home far away from it, and some new friends too. Thanks Isa's, we will be seeing each other again very soon:-)...
