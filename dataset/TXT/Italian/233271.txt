This restaurant is opposite the Delta Chelsea hotel and is way more impressive on the inside than it appears on the outside.

The pasta and pizza is made fresh every morning and it shows. They have a charity bread that sounds delicious (wasn't hungry enough to try everything) where they donate the proceeds to charity! 

There were candles lit everywhere and paper on the table to play games if you chose. Be warned that the charcoal pencils get ALL OVER your hands!

The soup was delicious and the pizza dough was perfect however the toppings on the Pomodor were rather lacking. It was rather dry.

The service was great though not very focused. We asked for the soup to arrive with the pizza though it was delivered first. No big deal but then my partners beer did not arrive until after we had finished the soup AND the pizza. They had to change the barrel and then forgot him. As the pizza was a little dry the beer was really wanted.

All in all I would return to this restaurant as the ambience and scent was marvellous. I just wouldn't chose the same pizza or beer.
