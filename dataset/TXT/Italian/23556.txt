3w22LbUT5fwHLT9-ytIXhw I really love coming into Queen Creek Olive Mill because of their variety and helpful staff/owners. Actually, it's fun to get lost here. 

When I worked nearby, I was in here all the time, and our pantry closet in the past, attested to my many purchases. But Queen Creek Olive Mills isn't a one trick pony. 

Besides olive oils and balsamic vinegars(photos), they have a bunch of fresh pastas and sauces (or gravy, if UR from the east coast). If UR into kitchen novelties, aprons, utensils; they have a large selection at better prices than found next door at Sur. 

Enjoy!
