oYCx5gO4KkkgYPnglSkk5g Went to Prop a for a second time last week (first time was a year ago).  I live in the hood so I really do pray for local restaurants to hit the mark and be successful but Prop just misses the mark.  My wife  and I eat out locally at least once per week so I wold imagine I am just the kind of customer Prop would like to see come back as a regular.

My first time up to the plate at Prop, expectations were high so it was only natural that it was difficult for them to be met, let alone exceeded.  With lowered expectations for my second at bat here, I thought for sure they could rise to the occasion and I was looking forward to being pleasantly surprised.  Sadly, the food was mediocre once again (especially considering the price)...not bad but not great.  Service was better this time around but then again, it was quieter than the first time which surprised me for a Friday evening at 7pm.   

Come on Prop!  You can do better I know you can!  I am rooting for you.  See you next year for my third time to the plate (pun intended).
