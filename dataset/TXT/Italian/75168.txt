CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA My last few visits to Venezias have been enjoyable. I have always been a fan of their pizza. Awhile back I noted some of the cashiers having a snotty attitude but that seems to have cleared up. I imagine with it being seemingly mostly college kids running the front, it's like a revolving door. Regardless, no complaints as of late, just great pizza.
