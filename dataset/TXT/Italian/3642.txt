The service, ambiance and location were all perfect for what we were looking for. We didn't realize how much the Italian cuisine dominates in Montreal. So pleased with our dishes! I had the manicotti special which was amazing. The bread and butter at the table was also so warm and a perfect accompaniment to the pasta dishes. The menu was huge and offered a lot of options.
