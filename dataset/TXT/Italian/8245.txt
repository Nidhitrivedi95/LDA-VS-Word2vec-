0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw Customer service here has been crappy lately. Food comes out incorrectly, employees have no clue what is going on and no manners. Today I called to place a to go order and they apparently just stopped doing those because they were too busy-- aka they can't keep up with their job. It's disappointing because the food is good.
