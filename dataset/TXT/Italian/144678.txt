k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ Just home from what was supposed to be a celebratory birthday lunch for my husband. The service was painfully slow and I am disappointed that neither one of us had a very enjoyable time. We arrived after the typical lunch rush. We ordered cocktails and an appetizer to start. The food and drinks were slow to arrive and our entree orders were slow also. I had hoped for a better experience.
