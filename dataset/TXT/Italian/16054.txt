1VDP92FU2p8AqJw9vU11sw I had a much better experience this time at Lakeside! The food is typical bar-themed food. I had the Philly cheesesteak and my hubby had a burger - both tasty, fries well cooked. Service was excellent!!! The waiter was attentive and friendly, he checked in often. Service was fast and courteous! Highly recommend!
