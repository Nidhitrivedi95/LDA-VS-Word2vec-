nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Asked for side salad with dressing on the side. Got a side salad with dressing mixed in. 
Ordered a meatball sub, the bread was so stale that I wasn't able to bite through it. I told the waitress she gave me a sad look but didn't respond, didn't offer to replace or partial refund. 
Disappointing. 
Atmosphere was decent thats why this place gets 2/5 stars.
