Q1L_Nb1QsD0S9pbng5-kMQ I think it's time for an update on my review on Portofino's.  I actually do return here and I've just learned to stay away from the daily specials.  Everything else is usually good here from the sandwiches to the regular lasana to the Chicken gorgonzola which is one of my favorites.  

They also make their own house salad dressing which is a tomato-based creamy italian.  It's great on salads and also it's good for dipping your bread into. 

The pizza is very good here as well, probably one of my favorite pizza places in Charlotte because they still make it in a regular pizza oven and not one of those conveyer belts.
