When we did this, we were a little earlier than our specified order time so we did have to wait a little. If we had arrived on time, we wouldn't have had to wait. 

In regards to the food, I ordered a small pesto pasta and had low expectations. It actually was better than I thought it was going to be. The pasta and tomatoes with it were very fresh. There were supposed to be mushrooms but I think I had one in my entire dish. 

The portion size was so generous I actually thought they had given me a large instead of a small. I was eating with a friend and she ordered the peanut saute which looked very small. 

I would recommend not eating at this location. There aren't many tables and since the dine-in area is encased in glass, it's very loud. 

I would probably return.
