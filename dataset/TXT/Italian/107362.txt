Service 4/5
The gentleman that waited our table was very accommodating, answered questions, and very polite. They aat us right on front of the station/computer where they put in the orders and it was very distracting and distributive. I even looked back a couple of times to kinda givea friendly gesture they were talking and fussing extremely loud. They looked at me and kepted on. 

Overall Restaurant 4/5
The food was good, the restaurant was decorated very nicely, and the waiter that helped us was nice.
