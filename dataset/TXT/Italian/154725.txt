L_thK7r3K_h5M4tV7amEKQ We came here for breakfast with friends.  It was ok.  The Eggs Benedict was pretty good, but a bit sparse.  I like the fruit cup - fresh fruit.  One of the eggs in my Bennie is significantly smaller than the other.  I feel that this dish is lacking something.  But the price is very cheap - so I suppose that is a trade-off.  The service was very good.  Location is not far from the 401.
