Pp93J9-VPxgEyMBB-NhUog The pizza is pretty good....a little difficult to cut after you've had some wine maybe, but that was a personal decision. Yes, like others have mentioned the service isn't great - in fact it may be non-existent. I know it's a BYOB but is it hard to ask if a table would like their bottle opened? Offer more glasses? Check if there are condiments on the table and how the food is? The QPR suffers here: the prosciutto, arugula, and other toppings on my Toscana pizza were good. However, I'm not sure if it merits a $18 price tag. Maybe that is the issue, the pizza was good...but not great. Maybe it would have seemed great if there was more attention paid to the customer's experience. In the end all I can say is that it was slightly disappointing. Would I come back again? I'm undecided.
Pro-tip: Do not order a pizza with greens on top if you've been drinking on an empty stomach. They will go everywhere.
