VeRHiEbUe_vHprYn8mnezA The newspaper gave a great write up about a local chef who came back to open a new Italian Restaurant. It doesn't feel like a traditional Italian restaurant since no lasagna, eggplant , or parmesan are on the menu. The menu is like going thru  gauntlets since they don't talk about the sides (or the prices), so it is up to your imagination as to what you get with your entree and what the price is. 
Bottom like - VERY MEDIOCRE and no where near the hype....

We can do much better at the Italian Grotto
