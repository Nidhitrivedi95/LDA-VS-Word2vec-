My husband and I had dinner here for the first time a few days ago and I am so glad we did! From the moment you walk in the door you feel as though you've walked out from Las Vegas and into a quant yet classy restaurant somewhere in Italy. The staff was also very professional and quick to fulfill every need. 

Right away our server brought out fresh, hot sliced bread with olive oil, garlic and balsamic... Wow! Great start to our meal.. I ordered the pasta with garlic and olive oil which included a salad with their house made ranch(which was creamy and delicious). My husband had the lasagna which came out piping hot.. still boiling in the pan.. I can definitely say that the lasagna was the best I've tasted.. the presentation being a plus. His dinner also included a salad which he upgraded to a caesar salad. To top our meal off, we had Chef Joel's signature bread pudding for dessert. WOW!!!! I would come back specifically for this dish. It was served hot with an addicting rum sauce as well as freshly made whipped cream that had been frozen to deliciousness. 
 
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone. We cant wait to return.
