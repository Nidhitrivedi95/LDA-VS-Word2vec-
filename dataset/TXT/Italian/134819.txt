IsN0qEzgAXBjbT3qn6lokA Live in Ohio (10 years of bad pizza) visiting Scottsdale.  Native of Connecticut; home of American pizza: Pepe's and Sally's in New Haven, proximity to Lombardi's in Lower Manhattan. The tribunal epicenter of amazing pizza in the US.  Humble Pie in the blistering desert of southwest America: pizza worthy of a 5 star rating from an admitted pizza snob. House-made mozzarella, wood-fired ovens: pizza perfection.
