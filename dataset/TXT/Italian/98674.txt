ewEDv_q-K0fV0FepkHB8sA In Madison for the weekend visiting family and friends. One of our friends birthday and our anniversary. Our friends that are Madison residents raved about The Tornado and added that it is their favorite steak house. Well, nice atmosphere and feel when you walk in. All down hill from there. Had a reservation for 8pm, we were seated right at 8. Got menus, ordered drinks and then the wait began. Took quite a while to get drinks, ordered our entrees and waited even longer to get our appetizers and salads. It was around 9:45 when our meal was served. Almost everything was just warm at best. Several of us sent the food back and then it was hot but over cooked. For a high end restaurant it was very disappointing. We did not pay for our meal, our server apologized. What could and should have been a spectacular dinner was awful. The young man that filled our water glasses did an excellent job. Better luck next time.
