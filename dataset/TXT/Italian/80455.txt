D6RDpCS1lfgZdPuLHlpsHA Remodeled and new chef. Food is quite good. I think it's better than Rigatoni's just down the street. 

I had a short rib ravioli with a mushroom sauce that was exceptional. My wife had a pork osobucco that just fell off the bone. Tender, moist and delicious. Their prices are a bit high but not extravagant and the food is great.
