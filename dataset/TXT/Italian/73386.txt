We went on a Friday night, however, and the lounge across the hall had a cover band blaring 70s and 80s music, which I like, but completely ruined the ambiance. The food was alright, but seemed over-priced considering it seemed like we were eating mostly garlic. Now, don't get me wrong, I love me some garlic, but this was stunningly heavy. The olive oil sauce for dipping bread, the Caesar dressing, the Italian vinegarette dressing, the fresco tomato sauce, and the Marsala sauce were so heavy with garlic it burned our throats and made our eyes water. However, the desserts were lovely: Seth had lemon sorbet and Fernet-Branca liqueur while I had the cannoli. We probably won't eat here again, unless we're trying to weed out vampires.
