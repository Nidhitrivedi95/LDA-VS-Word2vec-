nebRKfau_9iTxRDR6WGj9A It was our first time eating here. We're from the bay area, where there are a lot of great Pinoy restaurants. We ordered bulalo. The soup tasted more like vietnamese or chinese. It was overly seasoned. The fishballs were nothing special as well. I'm only giving it 2 stars because of the grilled squid. The taste was nothing fancy, the way I want my grilled squid to be, just stuffed with onions and tomatoes and seasoned with salt and pepper. We were the only party from 7-8:30 pm on a Tuesday. By far, Filipino restaurants in the bay area are far more superior. To be fair, it was the only pinoy resto we tried on our 6-day stay. Will definitely try the others when we get back.
