Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A This place definitely earned 3 stars but I rounded up for ambiance, decent service, and the fact that other items were good. 

A group of 6 went on a Saturday night with a reservation. We were seated outside, which was a-ok with the heat lamps nearby. We first ordered a pitcher of the red sangria. They start you off with bread and pesto/oil. The bread is brought around and served to you. We got our bread kinda late, but it was okay since we were chatting it up and enjoying our red sangria. We started off by sharing the Daily Pulled Mozzarella, which was good.

As far as our meals, I (along with 2 others) had the mezzaluna pasta, which I wasn't so fond of. It's like little dumplings in a bowl of broth of some sort. I wasn't so impressed, but it tasted okay. My friend got the Spezzatini of Pork which consisted of cauliflower ravioli and some other vegetables. Pretty good. Another friend got the Tajarin which was a scallop pasta in a cream sauce and that was yummy! Larger in portion and taste. Lastly, a friend got the steak. It was humongous and kinda undercooked in my opinion, but he seemed to enjoy every bite. Lastly we ordered a few desserts to share. We had the tiramisu (soo good), a flourless hazelnut chocolate cake (pretty good), and the bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream (also very good!). Soo overall, our desserts were great! I kind of wish I picked a different entree. But I gave it 4 stars because I enjoyed the desserts, had great company, and would definitely try it again if I were in town...
