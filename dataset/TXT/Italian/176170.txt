NfYA4ntbt1CeqmzrSipVpg it is a AAA 4 diamond star rated restaurant

We had our first anniversary here. We did the First seating menu which included 3 courses for 25 dollars. it was the best we have had in Cleveland. First we had wagyu beef and duck prosciutto which was rich yet fatty and savory, followed by a hearty perfectly done potato soup filled with bacon. the ceasar salad was what it should be. for mains the pork milanese was filled with a rich juice under a crispy skin while my steak had a deep mustard sauce dispered within the meat, the bone marrow was buttery, the casata cake was spongey and light and perfect while the peach gelato was simply creamy rich and amazing. everything was high quality, and thought the dishes were not original they were made to perfect as it should be. There is a reason it 4 diamond stars. easily the best food in ohio. the owener even made me home made hot chocolate out of fresh melted chocolate, and the complimentary sweet garlicy bread was plentiful,
