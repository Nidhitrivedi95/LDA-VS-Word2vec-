J5puhDnVL9WetWnWWDMhQw Good authentic Italian pastas with a hint of localization (in a good way)...

Cozy place hidden in a side alley of a residential building...

Family run with good service...

Definitely the best hidden gem in Mississauga.

Only drawbacks are its short opening hours and the fact that you can't book online via open-table...
