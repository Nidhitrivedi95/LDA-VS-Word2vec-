31acLzszeCCpeXmyAnoTdg Three of us tried to go here last night for a birthday celebration. I made reservations via phone earlier in the week. My friend arrived early to check-in. They denied our reservation, and the hostess was extremely rude. Another friend that was with us said a similar thing happened to her a few weeks earlier when she tried to go with a group of 5 for another bday party.  This type of behavior is completely unacceptable especially for a restaurant/restaurant group of this caliber. If you don't want to take reservations, then fine, but it's poor business to allow patrons to plan a night to fail at your expense.  If you do mess up a reservation, then try to accommodate the customer rather than treating them like they are at fault.  Needless to say, none of my friends will ever be trying this restaurant.  There are too many good restaurants with good customer service to deal with this treatment.
