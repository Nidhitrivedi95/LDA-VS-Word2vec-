S-mdSI4dMr-KeF28L5CMyA Good solid food around a 4. I am not grading the extremely poor wait time on the food ... if I was this would be a 2. Hoping that Buddyz Corp will  read this and adjust as this is a relative new place. Either need larger kitchen or more cooks. this is not the wait staff faults. Adjust quickly or lose our business.
