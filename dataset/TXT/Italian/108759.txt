G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q This was definitely in my top five for best service.  We were a party of 4 and were sat in the back area at a spacious round table.  Our server was AMAZING.  He was a gentleman from Italy.  By the end of our dinner we were showing our server photos of our dogs and he was telling us about his.  He was so genuine and is a true asset to Giada.  He presented us with an ipad that had the drink menu.  Off of this we ordered wine which was good.  We ordered two types of cured meat before our entree's.  I had the beef wagyu which was good!  For my entree I had the crab and scallop rissotto.  While the plate overall was small, the scallops had absolutely outstanding flavor.  We had the molton chocolate cake for dessert which is made from scratch and takes 20 minutes to prepare.  I also had a espresso alcoholic dessert drink which was quite delcious.  My bill alone was $90.  The price is a bit high for what you get as the portions are small but the dining experience is one that I definitely won't forget.  The photobooth was so much fun after dinner as well!  A nice souvenir!
