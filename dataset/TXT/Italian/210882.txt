qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ Born and raised in BROOKLYN NY. Used to authentic ITALIAN everything. All our restaurants cooked like this gem in Arizona. Live in MARICOPA ARIZONA SINCE 11/2012. Tried many many very nice restaurants. The oLD saying fits Tony's restaurant. We will feed you LIKE YOUR FAMILY. Or to put it bluntly . If you tried the rest try the best. Great guy great service great food. Fresh high quality food. Squeaky clean restaurant. Best pizza in Arizona if you are into real old fashioned cooking. Meatball parm heroes. As good as it gets old school or new eggplant parm garlic knots, Tony's hospitality. Smells great tastes fantastic. Worth the trip from anywhere in Arizona. Bring your guests and family. If you give anything but 5 stars you don't know nothing about ITALIAN . Enjoy!
