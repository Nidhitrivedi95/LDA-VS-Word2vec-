bR9ssXGyndYiggzyU0l_0A Wish I could give this place 0 stars, as I didn't actually get to eat anything! It was about 10:30 at night and the place was open for several more hours when we walked in. We were hoping to just get some drinks and dessert before heading home. We tried to order, and the waitress said "No, you need to order something to eat:. We said "we'd like 2 banana splits". She said "sorry, that's not enough, you need to order more". So were said "so you refuse to serve us then?" Without apology she just said "yes" and walked away.

Now, the restaurant was not crowded...there were at least 4 or 5 empty tables. It was late at night, and what we were ordering would have been over 18 quid, more than a single meal there. So what is the big deal? Below I see another person left a review saying that they were refused service for not ordering enough.

NEVER visit this restaurant if you actually want to eat something.
