TLMysu1mWiLEslCBon5W1g One of the best restaurants in town for drinks and dinner. Both times I was there I had the risotto, amazing creamy risotto. A few of us ordered that and when it was all said and done there wasn't a spec of risotto left on our plates. The drinks are strong and flavourful. My favourite is their Jerry sour. Amazing service from the wait staff. On my list of restaurants I would take my out-of-town friends to. I wish it was in my neck of the woods, I would go there every week.
