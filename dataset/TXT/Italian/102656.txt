FIr6iGroJz6OP1m9vo3f9w Sausage pizza was amazing. So delicious!!! Plenty of cheese and sauce and perfectly cooked. Mozerella is the perfect appetizer. The marinara to dip is great. The shrimp Alfredo was a big let down. Warm milk and noodles and fishy shrimp. Didn't eat it at all. Ordered take out or I would have sent back. Otherwise though it was delicious.
