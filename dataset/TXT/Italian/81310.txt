Dropping F-Bombs in every sentence and just weren't feeling the food as well, eating beside them wasn't making my experience any better.  

The pasta tasting trio was pretty good.  It's essentially a sampling of their signature pasta dishes.

TRADITIONAL POTATO GNOCCHI - Maine Lobster, Cremini Mushroom, Black Truffle Crema

AGNOLOTTI -Beef, Veal, and Pork Ravioli, Wild Mushroom, Veal Demi

ORECCHIETTE - Spiced Sausage, Broccoli Rabe, Hot Pepper Flakes, Sun Dried Tomatoes

I'm not sure if I would order the trio again though since my favorite of the three, the lobster gnocchi was the best tasting of the three and the only one I really enjoyed.

Service was kind of iffy though since my server would vanish on me at certain times when I needed him.  It did give me some time to just sit back and people watch from my table.  But in Vegas, time is definitely short and I was really ready to leave once I had finished my pasta.

If I were to come back to Fiamma, I would definitely go for another round of their Lobster Gnocchi.  But with a vast multitude of Italian restaurants on the Strip, it may not be for a while.
