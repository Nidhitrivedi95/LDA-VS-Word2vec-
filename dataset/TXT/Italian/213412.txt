r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w YUM! We were hesitant for a while to come here because it's attached to a gas station and can walk through to it from the restaurant. But I was craving pizza for a while and hoping to find some good and closer to home. Happy I gave this a shot because the food is awesome! It was pretty packed when we came, kinda reminded me of a sports bar but with Italian food. They have several TVs with sports on to watch. Definitely not the traditional Italian feel and the tables weren't cleaned off very well, fingerprints and little grease marks here and there shined on almost all the tables. You walk up to the counter here to order, and they'll bring the food to your table. 
We ended up getting a couple pizzas and some small jalapeño poppers. Warning that both come out BOILING hot! And I only got to finish a couple slices of the pie because it was still hot halfway through. However the food is DELICIOUS! We customized a veggie pizza and they actually load the pizza up with veggies unlike most other places who barely sprinkle them on. The crust was my favorite part, not too thick not too thin, perfectly crunchy. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now!
We saw several people with pasta dishes that looked really good, we'll have to try some next time!
Just docked the star for the cleanliness of the tables, floor, and the bathrooms were also a little gross with dirty toilet seats, pretty old. Food however was really fresh, excellent through and through, and they deliver!
