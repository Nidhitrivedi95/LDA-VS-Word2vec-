TrCiLMGy_bxbeAQcuSSUeQ Larry & Carol Pizza
Just had a rude yelling from your delivery man just now 
He was mad because he couldn't find my college campus and took it out on the 
customer. I came outside to get a pizza he gave me from his car. Unprofessional!  
Please give GPS to your employees and teach them kindness to the customers.   
I am a college student at Point Park University from Seattle I put down the address the school gave me  
 I will never order anything from you again!
I warn others not to go through this over some pizza.
