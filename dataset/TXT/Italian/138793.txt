jcasci3gjbsSuTEVzvDQKg I have not had the pleasure of eating at Mama Ricotta's in a long long time until the night before a half marathon came and we were looking through options of where to "carb load" before the race.

We made reservations as our group of 7 was fairly large, they accommodated us and even called about 3 times to make sure we were still coming.  With a small dining space I guess they need to ensure their bookings so that they don't end up holding a table when they can really seat customers waiting for a table.

Fresh rolls with olive oil and red pepper flakes were a nice surprise... usually it's just the generic bread with oil and balsamic.  I found it to be a nice twist to an old favorite.

The restaurant itself has an old neighborhood-familiarity to it and everyone working makes you feel welcome and happy that you are there sharing a meal with them.

Its Italian, I don't know about authentic, but the portions are ginormous and the favors are comforting.

I'd say the only crazy thing about the place is the wait since it's so popular, but there are ways around it, reservations... eating an "early" dinner.  I'd say the earlier the better since it will give you more time to burn off all the yummy calories consumed.
