5p60nXyjQruKvEZix6ahVQ Great restaurant right near market square. The entrecôte appetizer is unbelievable. It comes out with 6-8 pieces of thinly sliced and tender beef. You cook it on a hot salted Himalayan rock. It comes with dipping sauce and hard crunchy bread. It's worth the trip just to eat it. The gnocchi was very soft and the meat sauce was very tasty. The Caesar salad was incredible and comes out with a soft cooked egg on top. So yummy. The pasta carbonara was also very tasty. The prices were very reasonable. I would recommend trying it if you haven't. You can also valet your car in market square so you don't have to drive around looking for a spot in a garage.
