Turns out it was actually pretty good for the price. I paid $5 for a medium cheese pizza which was a little smaller than most places but I'm not complaining since it was so cheap and it tasted pretty good so I was happy. Service was average, I ordered at the store and it took about ten minutes which was fine. I would say it's better than other pizzas in the price range so I'd definitely give it a try if you want a good pizza for a cheap price instead of going to little caesars. I will be going back and probably trying some other items to see if they're any good or maybe as bad as everyone else seems to think.
