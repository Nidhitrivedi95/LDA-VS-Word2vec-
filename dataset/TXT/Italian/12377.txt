0VOh4VIq13oFburRU9gddw I am struggling to give this four stars.  Really solid 3+ and I'm feeling generous. 

Had a Blue Burger.  It was good. They certainly didn't skimp on the meat, the blue or the fixins.  The hamburger was a bit dry however and I wasn't blown away by the service or the food.  I may go back, but I'm in no big hurry.

Not really noteworthy.
