wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q First time here in YEARS!!  Our service was great, Cassidy was very patient & accommodating since we kept adding to our party!!  
Food was good, except for the fettuccini alfredo (hard, cold noodles with curdling sauce). They did take it back and replace it with obvious fresh!!  
Serving sizes were bigger than the places we've been recently.  We'll be back
