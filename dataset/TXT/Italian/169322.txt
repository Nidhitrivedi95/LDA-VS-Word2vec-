Mqsb3Tzabaq95yQIWTuQtg I've had a good experience with this restaurant 2 years ago so I decided to go there again for dinner. As a Thai cuisine lover I have to say that the quality has changed. I have had a main course, a fried egg rice and a beer and paid almost £20 for a tough dry meat with onions, mushrooms and an undefinable sauce. The course was served 5 minutes after I placed my order, which isn't a particularly good sign

The friendly staff saved the second star.
