TLbx_MR2dyFztoyR5d9H2A Salarnos neighborhood pizza and wings is one of the best in town! Worth the drive to try this Chicago style pizza . Both the thin crust and reg are great lots of cheese and sauce is so tasty! Wings are breaded and super crispy," we get sauce on the side" it's always consistent. Lil hard to get extra ranch but it's a small price to pay for great food!
