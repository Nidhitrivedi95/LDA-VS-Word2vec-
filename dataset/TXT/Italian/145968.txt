K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ Very nice lounge with outdoor space. Service was good, even when it got crowded. Was there for an industry event, and the bar area was packed, but you couldn't use your drink tickets with the servers. Very loud space, as others have mentioned. A bit tricky to move around the space, there are lots of one step up / one step down places to trip, but plenty of seating, which I appreciated.

Best for having a nice drink with a few friends or a new relationship, watching the dancing fountains, then going somewhere else.
