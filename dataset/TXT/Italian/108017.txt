FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A I always drive past this place whenever I'm in the Summerlin area and I finally decided to try it out. The place reminds me of Panera Bread, but a pasta-only version. 

I ordered the Crazy Alfredo because I that's what I saw people rave the most about on Yelp. It was $10 and some change and I thought the portion size was more than enough. It had A LOT in it and I wasn't able to finish the whole bowl. 

My boyfriend did the "create your own pasta" option, which is a starting price of $7.99 but 1.25 for extra add ons. He's a plain Jane so he basically ordered a fettuccine shrimp Alfredo, but he liked it, so whatever lol.

We used the "free order of garlic bread" offer which was an order of 2 garlic breads. They were pretty good. Nothing to rave about but nothing to complain about either.

I'd recommend going during the times they have lunch specials. It's $7.99 for your choice of pasta, garlic bread, and a drink. All in all, really good place to go for a filling, inexpensive lunch.
