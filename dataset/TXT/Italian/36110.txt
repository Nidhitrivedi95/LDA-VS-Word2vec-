6PQve0oFCLPSh4wnIzvJtg Had the sausage and mushroom rigatoni. Have been going there for a long time - but this was my first visit in about a year. Kind of not the same taste- the sauce was a little too much tomato taste. The sauce was the reason I would go here for this dish. Maybe a bad day? I'll return again but I hope they are not skimping on the quality. The ownership did change a while back. See you soon for another shot.
