JogUSDKa1xyG3lLEmD4Xjg Finally had the please of checking out this place last night.  First thing is to not be too put off by the fact this is located in what would otherwise be considered a strip mall.  The outward appearance is misleading in my opinion based on the greatness that lies within.  

The decor was a mix somewhere between high end and mediocre.  Acoustical ceiling tiles that remind you of the office is something they should reconsider.  take the ceilings down, paint everything black and probably would actually improve and open up the space.  All other parts of the decor was fine.  One thing I'll note is I love booths and this place is lacking in that department.

The food was just simply fantastic.  Probably top 5 Italian food I've had.  The dishes are very unique and the chef specials seem to be thoughtful and original.  I had the stuffed veal chop and it came out with a great presentation and cooked to perfection.  Another great thing about this place is they don't leave you hanging when it comes to serving sizes.  You will likely have a leftover dish for lunch!

The service here was great as well, very personable and pleasant all around.  In short Fiamma is Fantastic.
