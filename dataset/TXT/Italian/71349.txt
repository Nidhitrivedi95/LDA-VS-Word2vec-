C63sF-wG4f1doMIMv2qvOg I won a giftcard to Cafe Porta Alba so I decided to make my work-wife chow down on pizza with me. We ordered a carafe of the red table wine, a margherita pizza, and a antipasti platter.

The pizza and accompanying sauce were fantastic. The sauce had the perfect blend of salt, spices and just that hint of sweetness. The thin crust was cooked perfectly..soft but with the perfect amount of "bite" to it. The table wine was table wine (my thoughts on the wine are neutral.... I am a beer-girl by nature, so I know crap about wine. I drank it. Acquired a pleasant buzz. Great success). The antipasti was delicious as well...I believe we had the Antipasto de Casa. The amount of food was just right for two women. We ate the pizza and the antipasti and were pleasantly full. 

Our waitress was a little pushy. We went at 8 pm on a Friday night. All the tables were full, but there were no patrons waiting to be seated. I have not seen this friend of mine in a few weeks so we needed some time to catch up before we placed our dinner order. I appreciate prompt service, and I can understand our servers desire to place a beverage order for us, but I felt as if she was really rushing us out of there. We ordered our wine, and she kept coming back to see if we were ready to place our dinner order. We hardly had time to chat OR finally get around to looking at the menu between her coming and going from our table. 

Persistent waitress aside, I will be back. This is the best pizza I have found thus far in Madison. While I am not a NY pizza snob, I am a Chicago pizza snob. For now, this will suffice.
