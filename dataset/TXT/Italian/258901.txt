wCRc6E9XcyPnN1WwJhaGtA Pretty decent food here. I would come here again over any national Italian chain restaurant. Don't come here expediting a '98 Caymus Cab & a fresh veal scallopine. Come here for drinkable wine, family atmosphere, low key Italian American classics. 
Pizza was better than most but not mind blowing. Pasta carbonara was good.very large portion w/ a salad but for $20 I'd skip it. Side of meatballs were good and homemade. 
Slightly above average food. I will be back because the wife & kid were happy, Krystal the server was great & it's a low key kinda place.
