B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw So I finally get to try that experience of eating in the dark that I hear all about. It's suppose to enhance the flavour experience. Wait, this isn't that place?! Then why in the world were the lights almost nonexistent?

Staff: I was with a large party of 11 and it was very difficult getting a reservation on a Sunday 4 weeks in advance. They said they were booked full for Christmas. After giving it one more shot a week before we got a reservation. When we got there I was surprised that the place wasn't full. There were two floors so space was definitely not an issue. Maybe they had cancellations? The waiter during our dinner was nice and took our orders in a timely manner. We didn't see much of him the rest of the night but we also didn't need anything else. They have a Nonna Menu for large parties but they were very accommodating and let us order a la carte so I appreciated that.

Ambience: It was very dimly lit. Many of us needed to pull out our phones for light while reading the menu. The seating and decor were nice. Remind me of industrial hard lofts I like.

Food: I had fries to start and it came with this aioli that I was not a fan of. I thought maybe it was just me so I asked my friends what they thought and the concensus was not good. It reminded me of wasabi and celery root but someone else said it tasted like olives. The fries were nice and soft. For my main I had the Polpette Pizza which was essentially a meatball pizza. The meatballs were good, but they were slightly dry which I've come to expect when I see meatballs on pizza. I liked the crust and it had a perfect thin layer of sauce so it wasn't too overwhelming.

I think I would've given it a slightly lower score but they were willing to let us order a la carte plus we had to change out number of guests a couple of times too and they were very helpful with that. They need to turn up the lights a little!
