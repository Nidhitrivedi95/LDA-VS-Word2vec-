eHhBGqQbDpCcSpz7SZPTbA I'm from nj/nyc so I'm already a snot when it comes to pizza and anything Italian.. We just moved to Glendale from ca.. Which CA has shitty pizza lol.. And we have a restaurant by our old home called NYPD(looks just like the one here)..
Anyway we came here for dinner ordered the mozzarella. the kids a small half cheese/pepperoni. we got a small Wall Street.
Have to say it's petty tasty I wasn't disappointed... We will be back to try other foods on the menu 
Might be our new spot for some yummy pizza
