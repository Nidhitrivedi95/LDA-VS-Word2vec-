8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA My husband and I went to the restaurant to get a Chicago style hotdog and an Italian beef sandwich, however as soon as we entered we knew we could not leave this place without ordering a pizza...the aroma of authentic Italian was lingering in the air.  After looking at the menu and inquiring I learned they no longer offered hotdogs (the pics are still posted on yelp). We ended up ordering a small pepperoni & sausage pizza and the Italian beef sandwich ...OMG!   This was the best pizza we have had in a very long time...and we're no stranger to pizza; the ingredients were fresh and plentiful, the sauce was sweet yet tangy and coated the crust just enough, the thin crust just thin enough ( i typically don't eat thin crust)...and of course the pizza was bubbling hot, it was delicious!

The Italian beef sandwich was tasty too, it was flavorful, full of meat and I appreciated a generous portion of really hot (temp) juice for dipping...I did think the gardinar peppers could have been chopped a bit more...not as chunky.  We spent less than $20.

As we were leaving I assume he was the owner Mike introduced himself to us and was telling us about other menu items...it was a good feeling to know we were valued as customers (this is becoming rare).

We live right around the corner and will definitely be returning!
