Perfect. I ordered from the comfort of my home, and promptly (within 1 minute) received confirmation of my order, which said 45 minutes. I showed up after 35 because I like to get my pizza hot, and sometimes those wait times are sandbagged. 

The place was hopping, and I don't just mean the restaurant. Even their take-out side was packed. I was still greeted warmly when I entered, and waited upon promptly. It wasn't ready yet, but she went back tithe kitchen and told me it would be no longer than 9 minutes. Pretty specific, but it was absolutely correct. The nice girl helping me even opened the pizza box to double check everything was in order. They did this for everyone. I appreciate that, because I hate getting home to find a mistaken pizza. So do they. 

The place was immaculate. They just opened a month ago, sure, but the place was looking pristine. The goodies in their bakery display looked pretty delicious as well. 

I'll be ordering from them again.
