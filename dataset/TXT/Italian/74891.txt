Cr5CLpmVrmzFyz_RfQ6rmA It is my first time being at a Scaddabush restaurant and we were greeted nicely by the hostess. She got us seated and our dinner experience began. 

For our Appetizer we ordered Naked Mozzarella which had Crostini, Freshly made Mozzarella, San Marzo Tomato sauce and Maldon salt. We also ordered 3 Cheese bread which had Asiago and two other cheeses that I do not remember. 

For our main course we got the Baked Penne Carbonara, Zucca Ravioli and the swirly pasta that was on the top of the pasta list with the long Italian name. 
The Carbonara and the unknown pasta came but our waiter didn't get my order which was the Ravioli and rushed the order for me. 

The Mozzarella was the best part of the dinner experience. But sadly the 3 Cheese Bread, Carbonara, Ravioli and the other pasta was a bit mehhhh. After taking a few bites of the Ravioli, I just got completely sick of it. But I finished it anyways not because I liked it, but because I do not want to waste the food. 

In conclusion this chain fine dining restaurant is 'aight'. Service 'aight'. Food 'meh' and I wasn't even full after dinner. 
Sadly will not come again. 

If the PR person is reading this. Please get your Corporate Executive Chef to revise this menu and make sure that the least favourite foods are revised in order to get better reviews both in person and online. Go ask your staff to eat the whole menu and ask them what they loved and what they hated. Make the waiters ask customers for their legit and honest opinion on the ambience, the food and the service. Make the executives eat three courses on the menu everyday and ask them what they loved and what they hated. 

This sadly is my first restaurant that I absolutely disliked. Even bad chinese take out restaurants seem a bit better than what I was served. Presentation is nice but food lacks in taste.
