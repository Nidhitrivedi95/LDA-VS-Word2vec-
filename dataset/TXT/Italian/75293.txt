Night and day from my first order. After posting my last review ownership and management reached out to me to give Venezia's another shot. I was happy to accept. 

I placed the same order as last time but this time over phone instead of online. I experienced extremely polite staff and a quick and easy ordering process. The food was delivered in 30 minutes. 

See attached photos. The pizza was hot and delicious and the crust truly reminds you of a good NY slice. This time there was plenty of toppings and they were evenly spread so every slice was covered. 

The wings were the main reason for my poor review last time, this time they won me over. Ownership recommended that I order the wings with the sauce on the side so they remain crispy during delivery. Well I took is advice and sure enough, they came crispy. They were pretty damn good too. Word to wise - Order your wings with the sauce on the side - especially during peek busy hours. 

Venezia's won us back as customers. Way better than the PH and PJ chains. Check them out and let me know how it goes!
