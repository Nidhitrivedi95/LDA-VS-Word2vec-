6I27BTuHI5PMvOBG4WS8NQ I had the pleasure of visiting this Mercatto location last month for my birthday. We were a party of 7 and had the beautiful table in the open wine room. 

Our server was very polite and helpful with the menu and wine list. We ordered a couple charcuterie boards for the table and they were delicious! As my main I ordered the lobster pasta which had plenty lobster meat and the pasta was cooked perfectly (not too keen on the fact they put a claw on top of the plate for decoration, It was a tease since it was empty!). Another guest ordered the prosciutto pizza, great size and flavor. The mushroom ravioli was by far my favorite (I secretly wished I had ordered it), the pasta just melted in your mouth and could taste how fresh it was.

Overall Mercatto is a true restaurant that is all about fresh and seasonal ingredients with a laid back attitude and beautiful decor. 

I will defiantly be returning!
