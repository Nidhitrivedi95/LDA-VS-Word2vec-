Ih0f0UyhFufm3C7kR72DSQ 4 friends out to celebrate a birthday at Dante's last night.  The place was packed, and we were seated promptly  Our server, Candace, was outsanding.  She was the icing on the cake to a very festive evening!

We started off with an exceptional drink with vodka, cranberry and cinammon spices.  I can't remember the name of the drink, but it's on their list of specialty drinks, and worth a taste.

Apps:  Calamari- delicious and Foie Gras- delicious

All the food served to us was presented beautifully.

We ordered a side of 3 cheese polenta, which was highly recommended on Yelp, but it was really pasty.. consistency of oatmeal.

Duck cassoulet, surf and turf, pork tenderloin, and chicken were cooked well.  All the food served to us was presented beautifully.

Candace bought us a complimentary birthday dessert to share.  Beautiful, delicious layers of nuts, whipped cream, brownie pieces, and other yummy bits of goodness.  

Plan on spending around $75/person.

The staff, atmosphere, and food will bring me back!
