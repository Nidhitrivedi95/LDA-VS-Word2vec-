qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA Love this place! It's fantastic for group events/birthdays/a night out with the girls. The Monday and Tuesday bottle of wine + bruschetta is an amazing deal! The service is fast, and they're always really nice and cater to what we want. The bruschetta's are all really amazing but I love the roasted pepper bruschetta, it's the best!! They're also able to cork your wine so you can take it home if you don't finish. Absolutely great, I recommend it!
