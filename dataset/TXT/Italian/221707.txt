SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg First off, the food here was SO good. It's Italian tapas style so all dishes are small and meant for sharing. Everything was fresh, and the flavors went very very well together.  The gnocchi with lobster knuckles was AMAZING as was the canneloni. The service was also impeccable.  Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing and took notice of the fact that I was OBSESSED with the Bellagio fountains - he offered to walk me to their outside tables and take my picture while the fountains were going. so sweet!

The only thing I would change was (1) we ordered a bottle of champagne that came out after almost all of our tapas were out (5 dishes).  That was a little late for the champagne for me... I think they could have brought out a few dishes and held off on the others while they waited for the champagne to chill. just IMO.  (2) the red wine risotto we had was heavy on the wine and low on the other flavors. since we ended with this dish, it left a sort of sour taste but we let it go since everything else was SO good.
