iFGC7CIcVKWdIKjIO7w6Tw This place is my absolute favorite place in Tempe! Ramen is amazing, the new sushi menu is spectacular!! Our waiter Spencer was outstanding! He was so on top of our large party of 10. Splitting our checks and not forgetting 1 item we ordered!! We will all be coming back. We had a wonderful experience here. Thank you Spencer and thank you shady park for being so amazing to us!
