The waiter was very polite and friendly and made an effort to make my first visit a memorable one. I also tried an appetizer called "fruiti di mare" if I spelled that right, which is a cucumber/onion salad with an assortment of calamari and squid with olive oil and lemon juice. I had never tried this anywhere else and I'm glad I tried it out. It was very tasty. The wine menu is big. The atmosphere upstairs is lively, but not too loud. I'd definitely come here again
