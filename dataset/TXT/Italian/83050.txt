dHgbL5EAEawIcqk6aXe2Ow Remarkable! It is absolutely remarkable that an entree that would be perfectly average at $8 should cost four times as much. The $32 sea bass consisted of two dreary rectangles of poorly filleted, bland white fish adorned with parsley. College cafeterias do this dish better. It was by far the most disappointing restaurant meal I have ever had.
