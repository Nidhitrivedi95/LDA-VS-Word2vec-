kfqWU3dpvG385moeAhnAhw This is like a smaller, less frenzied version of Panera, except instead of bread being their main attraction, it's tomaydohs. Er, tomatoes.

There is plenty to choose from on the menu, including salads that were actually delicious (I had the Seattle Walnut), sandwiches, soups (two choices - their "signature" tomato basil and a soup of the day), and flatbread pizzas.

Of course, they have one of those "choose two" options. Duh. Who doesnt?

They have Dr. Pepper AND Diet Dr. Pepper on tap. Shout out to Amy T!
