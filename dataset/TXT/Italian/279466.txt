yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w In anywhere but Las Vegas it would get 1 star, however given Las Vegas is so ridiculously overpriced and overrated (nope, NOT a fan, won't be going back ugh) this place gets an extra star simply as it was less ridiculous than most of its neighbours. And as the service was great.

Aside from that the menu was annoying (set menus only so you're forced to buy all sorts of stuff you may not want). The food was pretty awful, except the steak was really good for the price. The garlic bread was weird and lukewarm, we had no idea what the lump of fried carb stuff even was on the plate, and the wine was basically undrinkable. Seriously could they just give you one glass of drinkable wine rather than a carafe of awful wine cordial?! Ick.

The staff were nice.
