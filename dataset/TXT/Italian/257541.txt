w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A I just don't get why people think this pizza is so great! The crust is never done enough and bread is always raw-doughy inside. We have been to Metro more than once and it always seems the same. It is just below average to average pizza that is way overpriced!

I would much rather have Champion Pizza off of Gibson.
