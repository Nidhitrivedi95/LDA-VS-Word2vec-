KcIalceIg6PSPONvLlI4-w 4.5 stars! LOVE THIS PLACE. Wow, so happy this opened up! I was walking around and dropped in to see what all the hype was about on an regular week day. Wasn't as busy as the weekend. Run an Italian family business. Great, professional, upbeat service! So much selection! I love their modern, cozy, rustic feeling inside (lots of exposed brick and dark walls).

Tasted their cannoli (over $2 each) and tiramisu (over $4 each) and bombolones.

Cannoli: EXQUISITE! Their cannoli filling was rich, creamy, thick, slightly tangy, and had dreamy texture. I loved that they added candied orange on one side and pistachios on the other for amazing crunch and complimenting textures. The shell was hard and crunchy, dabbled with powdered sugar. So delicious!

Tiramisu: Fantastic! A bit pricey for the size I got, but wow! The filling was dispersed in between 3 very thin layers of cake and topped with a very rich, dark chocolate powder. I cherished every single bite!

Bombolones: TO DIE FOR! Crema or nutella, but I prefer the crema!

Verdict: Bit pricey. Absolutely a fan of this Italian bakery, looking forward to coming back for more (pizza, sandwiches, freshly baked bread, gelato, and bombolones)!
