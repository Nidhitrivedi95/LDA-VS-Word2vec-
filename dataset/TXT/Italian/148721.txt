kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg This new version of what was is......AWFUL!!!
None of the charm of the original location, which is now GRAPE VINE and not only still fabulous, better. Grape Street is like a 45 yr old trying to be a 25 yr old. Yuck! Music too loud, s l o w service, no warmth and a big yawn! Great location for sure and the wannabes of Summerlin will gather there. However not me, I'll never cheat on GRAPE VINE again.....
