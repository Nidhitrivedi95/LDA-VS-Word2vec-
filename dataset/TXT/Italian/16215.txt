1WBVqmo7tgF0z0eGf4fPhQ Absolutely delicious! At first I was disappointed because they were out of gnocchi, but I ended up getting the five cheese baked butternut squash ravioli and it was spectacular! It came as a large portion with a creamy, sweet, and rich sauce. The sauce has mushrooms and speck, and the ravioli were tender and filled with creamy butternut squash. My boyfriend got the chicken parmigiana. It was huge and came with a side of spaghetti and marinara. It had a great coating and was topped with bubbling cheese. It was a little pricey, but absolutely wonderful. I will be back for the gnocchi!
