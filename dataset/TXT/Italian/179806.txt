nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Where to begin??? This was our third trip to Buddy V's and the food will keep us coming back. We love the flavors, rich sauces, perfectly cooked meats, and quick, tasty appetizers, almost everything we have ordered here is amazing. 

The Service is good and friendly and realized last night what my biggest issue with this restaurant is. The appetizers come out fast, which is awesome, but the wait time between your apps and your entree is excruciatingly long. We ordered plenty of apps to keep us busy but 45 minutes elapsed between apps and entree. This was way too long. I think I blamed the server on my second trip when the same thing happened but I realized the kitchen is just slow to get out entrees and the servers lose attentiveness when they have nothing to bring you. I hate having to ask for more water or a refill. 

That being said, I highly recommend Buddy V's, the food is amazing Italian food, the desserts are delicious and the live music was a nice touch last night.
