M_v9BN9QHosc8kohmUj-cg I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice Italian restaurant that is reasonably priced and serves delicious food.The decor is nice and service is very welcoming. Sitting accommodation for small groups available. There is a wood burning oven inside the restaurant. They also have a decent dessert collection with cakes from La Rocca, they are a treat!
