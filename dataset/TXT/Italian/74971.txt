Cr5CLpmVrmzFyz_RfQ6rmA Really good Italian food! Normally I tend to stay away from chain restaurants when it comes to stuff other than burgers and pizza but I have to say I was very impressed with this place!

I had chicken parm which was very tasty and crispy, it came with a side of pasta which was really good as well. Overall the portions are great considering the price and I will definitely return in the future.
