VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Brunch and mimosas...probably one of the best brunch experiences i have had. The  service is perfect. The whole staff is wonderful, attentive and friendly. So far  the best service in Las Vegas. They have several mimosas and bloody mary options so you wont be thristy.  The food was delicious. Go all out and get the lobster benedict and blueberry pancakes.  You may lose at the casino but this place is a win!
