NILiO6pq_0vLnCUn7KuU0Q MEATBALLS!
Bring your radio flyer into the store to load up on all the delicous treats to bring home.  
Olives, Feta, BALLS, sausages, cured meats, pickled veggies, baguettes, hoagie sandwiches, do you want me to go on? 
Lasagna, tortelinni, cheeses soft and hard, crackers from Italy, sauces for your refrigerator, frozen meals for the freezer.
If you can't find a meal here to please everyone, good luck to you.  Friends coming over in an hour?  Pick up some antipasta here, bottle of wine, or two and a loaf of fresh bread.
Boom.  Done. Balls.
