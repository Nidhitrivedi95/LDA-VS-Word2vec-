mUUTJY9_BqmAYxypHiqWrw OK, while I have used the Big Cannoli as my standard, I have to give these guys their just "desert". On par in terms of cannoli shells with The Big Cannoli, they too stuff theirs only when sold. You end up with the total "crunchatation" of the freshest possible cannoli imaginable. The ricotta filling is the smoothest I have had and their chocolate filling is just ah-mazing!

What sets them apart is their selection of amazing pastries. From Créme Brûlée to Rhum Balls, the flavours are all so fresh. It does not stop there. The hot table looks pretty good too. I would have loved to try a hot veal sandwich but they were sold out of veal when we got there. This is always a good sign. There was also a large selection of various breads.

Definitely a keeper. Worth the drive from Richmond Hill. We are going back Often! Waistline, watch out LOL.
