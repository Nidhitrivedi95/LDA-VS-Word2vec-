sR8AnN3Exc3VJ6Ax3MNT5Q It's your typical Italian restaurant ... The food was good I ordered pizza, a glass of wine and some lemon dessert... They were all well in taste... what made it 4 stars was the service .... the waiter was AMAZING ... he made sure our food was what we wanted, was on top of getting my wine, he was also good about making sure our water glasses were refilled and etc..
