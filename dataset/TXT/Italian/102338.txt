FhVYpbvE8IQeUHAcwPPIXg One of the worst experiences I've had at an Italian restaurant here in Vegas. The service was terrible and the food was below average. We got chicken on one of our pizzas and it looked/tasted like it came from a can. My fiancé had one slice then had to stop eating. The one good thing I can say is the happy hour is decent. $2.75 for a beer is a good deal. Other than that, this place is useless and I do not plan on a return
