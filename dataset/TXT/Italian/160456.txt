LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw The sweet potato fries here are my absolute favorite. I got the sausage and peppers, and thought it tasted good, but didn't have very many peppers or onions. The servers weren't very attentive, though. Our server did an okay job, but there was a group of three of them standing right by our table talking about how they don't like their job and making plans for the night, which was a little awkward. Overall, I would return, but I might try a different location.
