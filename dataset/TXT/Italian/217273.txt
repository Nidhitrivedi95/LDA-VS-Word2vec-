RXyM7VrCiEFthJxQ4bGmBg Came here for winterlicious with my friends, and I had a great time. The food was good, had the PI mussels, stuffed chicken breast with vegetables, and creme brûlée. The drink I ordered the Jolly Rancher; it was average. The mussels were really delicious especially in a creamy sauce, the chicken breast was gigantic and seasoned well, however the vegetables, especially the beets were not that tasty. The creme brûlée was below average, not garnished at all, and tasted very plain. 

The service was good, a bit slow when the restaurant got busy; it seems a bit understaffed. The staff themselves were friendly, and our server was nice enough to change our desserts from the winterlicious menu to the regular menu. The restaurant itself could use some interior decorating as the chairs and tables make you feel like you're at a diner.  

I would definitely come back here as the menu has a variety of options and portions are big. Would like to try the steak next time.
