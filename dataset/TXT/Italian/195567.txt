PJVjfGtVc71M0XlUr83teQ If you want a made to order pizza, without the wait, there is no better place to come than My Pie.  The food is fantastic, and lightning fast.

The array of options is awesome.  Every time I go there I end up getting something new and I'm never disappointed.  The atmosphere is kinda kitschy -- it looks like it used to be a Pennzoil station with the roll-up garage doors, but all in all it adds to the charm.

And you really can't beat the prices.  You get to watch them make your order right in front of you, and you can customize it in basically any way.  I recommend at least giving the gluten-free pizza a try, especially if you have never had anything gluten-free before.  It will not let you down.

Friendly staff completes the four-star review.
