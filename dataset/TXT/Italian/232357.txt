tKi4OvAlckcVzeP92InsOQ Took my eldest here for his birthday. The facility is pretty clean given its clientele (what kid doesn't make a mess?), the couche at the bowling alley were comfy and clean. Having the food delivered direct to your lane was a nice touch. Glow golf was fun, wish the course was larger! Arcade games were overpriced, but the kids enjoyed them. Should make the grabber games a little less rigged for you to lose. Pretty evident those things are wedged so tight it's a waste of money to even try. Overall a good time. Food was better than expected for a bowling alley.
