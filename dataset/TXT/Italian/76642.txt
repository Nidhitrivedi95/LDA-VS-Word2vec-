cVlW0omVTRaVJqnT-OBBsQ I experienced the worst service of my life at this restaurant.  My mom and I got a salad with old, rotten lettuce and when we (very politely) informed the waiter we were told (verbatim)  "Uh, you're wrong. Ok? You need to know that. This lettuce is fresh."  He basically told my 65 yr old mother she was lying, got visibly angry at us, and then sent the "chef" out to humiliate us some more, before finally coming back to say, "So you didn't like the dressing on your salad.  Are you trying to get a free dessert?" We were speechless.  Never, ever, going back.
