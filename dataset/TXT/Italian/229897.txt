TAoN9nsibXOxsOnnG7Kd_g One of my favorite hidden treasures in Tempe.  If you have been in the Tempe area you probably have driven past this family establishment, it doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you enter it's like being in someone's home.  

The ambiance here is very intimate and comforting, as if you're in the family's personal dining room enjoying their recipes passed down from generation to generation.  The service is exceptional, always bringing you more bread, filling your glass before it empties, and asking if you need anything.  

The food is tradtional italian fare, they offer you bread as soon as you sit down and nearly everything meal comes with your choice of garden salad or soup, unlike a lot of restaurants today where it's an additional cost.  They have a wide vareity to choose from and everything I've had there has been great.  

I highly reccomend Riazzi's during the holiday's, the decorate the interior beautifully and really put you in the spirit of things.  Would reccommend for a Christmas eve dinner out or what not.  

My favorite dishes:  the calamari appetizer, the calamari linguini, and the sausage and bell peppers!  Yum!
