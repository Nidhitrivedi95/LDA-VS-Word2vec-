GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ It's hard to rate this burger joint with an unbiased mind because my favorite burger place of all time is also on the Vegas strip: Gordon Ramsey's BURGR at Planet Hollywood.

But that burger aside, this place was OK. Lots of great signature burgers to chose from with various unique toppings and condiments. Despite the choices, I went with the "build your own" option: burger, pretzel bun, avocado, bacon, lettuce, garlic aioli. You can't go wrong with that combination, but on this occasion it lacked some flavor; I ended up having to ask for more aioli. The pretzel bun was also not pretzel consistency; it really was more like a regular bun. It was good overall, but not amazing.

The fries were thin the way I like, but one of our two orders were overcooked and seemed like the stragglers at the end of a batch. Also, I absolutely hate when restaurants don't automatically give you fries (or a side) with your burger make you order them separate. This is especially ridiculous when the burgers are priced at $15 and higher.

The beer selection is great. I went with a Moscow mule and it was really good, served complete in a copper mug. My friend thought it was "too gingery" but I don't think he knew that's what ginger beer tastes like. Drinks were also unnecessarily pricey.

Our waiter was great: friendly, patient, helpful, gave suggestions, attentive.
