u9R0_pvEkl7QGPJYH3j1sg One of our favorite restaurants.  We have been going there for several years, and sometimes several times a week.  We know most of the staff by name.  They are great people serving great food.  When my Father passed away last year, some of the staff even came to the service.  They make you feel like family.

BREAKFAST-

Order anything on the menu, it's all been good.  My favorite is either "K", Chorizo & Eggs (weekends only), breakfast burrito (weekdays only), or steak & eggs.  Everything is cooked the way you want it, and they give you a nice sized portion.  The Chorizo & Eggs is served w/ whole pinto beans which I feel is a nice touch.  Their homemade salsa is also very good.

LUNCH/DINNER-

Pizza has been very good.  They have both neapolitan and sicilian.  I have had the "pizza by the slice", and that has been hit & miss, but the whole pies have been great.

The Ossobuco at Times Square is my favorite meal there.  If I were "going to the chair", it would be my choice for my last meal!  I have had it in other restaurants w/ risotto, and also w/ polenta.  Times Square serves theirs over fettuccine pasta w/ a very nice sauce.

The "Linguine Spinach" & "Pollo Limon" (not on the menu, but always available) are also very, very good.


One of my favorite things about Times Square is their consistency and quality.  I like going into a restaurant and seeing the same faces.  The turnover there is very low, and the staff & servers get to know you and your likes.  It's not uncommon to see the owner there, working the register, bar, seating, even serving when busy to help out.  It's also not uncommon to get a wave and a hello from the head Chef.  

Truly, one of my favorite restaurants...
