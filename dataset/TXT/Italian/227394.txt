SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ We had a GREAT dinner here! Service was impeccable and it was just an all around nice experience. I was in the mood for some Italian and we checked out this place because we were shopping around in the Forum.  We chose to be seated at the bar, we usually prefer to sit at the bar, it makes for more of a fun experience. 

We split the calamari, ceasar salad and stuffed eggplant. Even though we split everything, it was A LOT of food. We looked around and we saw that the rest of the dishes that everyone else had were decent sized as well. The calamari was breaded perfectly and the dipping sauce was tasty. The ceasar was yummy but a little messy because the croutons were HUGE. 
The stuffed eggplant was pretty good, the past inside was yummy but the eggplant was overcooked a bit, it didn't bother me too much because by that time I was too full to eat any of it. 

It was a good meal for the price. I just decided to drink $20 worth of wine, which is very easy to do in an italian joint and in Vegas. I would go back again especially to try some of that gelato to go.
