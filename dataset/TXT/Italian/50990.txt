9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg Visited here twice. Once on a lunch run and second time for a dinner with friends. I really. The first visit I ordered and shared one of the pizzas (forgot which one but it had porschiutto) and the bolognese with lemon ricotta. The pizza was ok, but nothing to write home about. It is a hefty portion though so definitely can be shared with a friend for a light lunch. The bolognese though was the highlight in my mind. I thought the lemon ricotta complemented the bolognese really well and offset the heavy/greasy feeling one often gets from eating a bolognese. 

Since I enjoyed my lunch, I returned for dinner and ordered a stuffed meatball and spaghetti and ate off some of my friend's fresh mozarella which I am told is made in house. The mozarella was fantastic in my limited cheese knowledge, because I can actually taste the strong flavour of the milk that the cheese was made from. That plus toast and the tomato jelly was a great combo. 

The stuffed meatball and spaghetti was ok. The meatball on it's own was great, but I think their bolognese just set a really high standard for me in terms of the pasta. It was probably the ricotta that made the difference for me. My friend also got a chicken parm. It was pretty ordinary, I recommend sticking to their specialties (ie. pasta + pizza) instead.

Price wise, standard downtown price. For those on a student budget may be save up to reward yourself after exam seasons. Or come during winter/summerlicious.
