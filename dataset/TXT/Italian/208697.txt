QReGruZEFxovIm9FJVa1kw The place was rather crowded when we got there, especially for a Monday night, and they were understaffed, so rather than wait twenty minutes for a table, we sat at the bar, which was an excellent choice.  The bartender was GREAT, there were lots of open seats, and there was a baseball game on the flatscreen in the corner.

There's bread to start with a choice of butter or red pepper pesto, which tasted like marinara to me.  We both ordered salads and pasta dishes.  My companion cleaned both his plates and said the lasagna was very good.  I ordered a avocado, tomato, and mozarella salad special which was DELICIOUS.  I also got the baked ziti, which was nicely seasoned and huge enough that I ate it for dinner the two nights afterwards too.  The food was moderately priced for the quality.

Another shout out to the bartender is well deserved.  He was attentive without being overbearing and was great to chat about baseball with.  He also deftly handled the bar customers and all the take-out orders.  I didn't catch his name, but I get the feeling he's there a lot and his long ponytail makes him pretty identifiable.

Long story short: go to Zio!  Tasty food and friendly staff.
