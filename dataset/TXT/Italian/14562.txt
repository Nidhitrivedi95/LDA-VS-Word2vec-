1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag Dal Toro is located inside of the Palazzo and has a different vibe about it. This place is based off of Lamborghini, and even has a showroom of the cars. The food was pretty good, I got the Shrimp omelet, which contained shrimp, feta cheese and smoked salmon! My girlfriend got the breakfast special which came with 3 eggs, toast, and potatoes. I really enjoyed my omelet, my girlfriend, as ok with her meal. 

The downside to this place and the reason for the low stars is due to the service being really bad! I had a hard time trying to flag down a waiter to get some hot sauce, finally I just got up and went and grabbed it myself. It took about 10-minutes to cash out our check, and the staff just didn't seem happy to be there. This is not somewhere I would return for food.
