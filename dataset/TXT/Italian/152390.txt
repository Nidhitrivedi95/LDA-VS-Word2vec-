KsNZgnE0tFblW4Rfu72mZg This was my first time. I had been craving a real Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. The Famous Philly was deliciously cheesy (gotta love Cheese Wiz). I also got the Zucchini Sticks. They were really good. I will definitely come here again. I want to try the pizza next time. 
The staff was also very welcoming.
