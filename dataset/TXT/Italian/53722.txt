a6SqJZTFMpSOR6Qb0STyFA My husband and I live in Ahwatukee and have been going to Arrivederci since it opened.  The restaurant started out with a bang - great food and terrific service - and has gone downhill ever since.  For the last several times my husband and I went there, it has consistently disappointed. A shame because it has so much potential.  My husband and I started at the bar on Friday night, then decided to move to a table.  No offer to help move placemats, silverware.  My husband spilled his drink on the move & asked the waitress for help.  She shoved a dirty, smelly rag at him.  We asked for napkins twice to no avail.  Sat at a table with an unlit candle - as most of them in the place were - and stared at a big, 1970's looking screen with nothing at all playing on it.  Little things - but as a former restaurant owner myself - these things add up to a lackluster expereince.  The gnocchi had its usual good flavor but the sauce was drippy & watered down.  Our waitress actually took her shoes off and changed to flats in full view of all customers - while rubbing her bare feet followed by no hand washing - then proceeded to serve food..yeeech.   Mind you, we are regulars - and BIG TIPPERS - yet the bartender couldn't change the tv station to the Arizona game????  Bored wait staff, no ambience.  Max the owner used to at least be there - servce lemoncellis with your bill, liven up the place, make sure customers are taken care of...no more.  It's the food and it's the service - they need to go together to make repeat customers.  Sad that we can't just seem to get that in Ahwatukee...
