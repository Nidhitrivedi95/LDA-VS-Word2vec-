zzmIMvqiBJ_-wVKg_OnGpw Just finished our 35th anniversary dinner. Food was good. Not exceptional, just good. The ambiance was terrible. While trying to enjoy our antipasto, we had to listen to the loud chef/owner having a Q & A with a bunch of women that had to do with everything from opening a restaurant to cooking the pasta. I also sat with an empty water glass while eating the antipasto and salad. After our meal, we were offered the choice of looking at the dessert menu. We sat at an empty table for 15 minutes before the dessert menu showed up. Only to find out most of the desserts listed weren't available. 3 stars because food was good. The entire experience was not. Probably won't go back.
