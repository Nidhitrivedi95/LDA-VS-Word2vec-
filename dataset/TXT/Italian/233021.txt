TLMysu1mWiLEslCBon5W1g Disclaimer: I had the prix fixe...it was decent, but I'd love to go and order from the regular menu.

+++PROS+++
1. Simple reservation system through Open Table (online)
2. Good value.  Can't beat a $24 prix fixe (afterall, Asians are cheap, aren't we?).
3. Excellent service, I didn't find them to be too attentive
4. Clean bathrooms, definitely 'deuceable'
5. The sidecar is quite a fantastic drink, even for quasi non-drinkers like me.  I assume their other cocktails are equally as impressive.
6. Good place to bring a date
7. Decent portion sizes.

---CONS---
1. Cramped seating
2. Food was only so-so.  I had the steak frites, which was a sirloin.  Even cooked rare, it was pretty chewy.  Well, I guess it was a sirloin afterall.  Fries were nice.
3. Chef's choice of dessert I wasn't feeling too much.  They called it 'cake', but it was more like a couple of uber-rich pieces of fudge.
4. It is busy, even on a Wednesday night at 8pm.

That's all I got.  Would definitely go back.  Brap brap!
