pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ First time at Nora's this past Saturday evening and have to say it was all I expected. Generous pours on the drinks, knowledgable servers and excellent food. Was surprised by the number of large groups including one of 20 in the main dining room. Not sure if that's the norm. A lot noisier than I expected, including multiple renditions of "Happy Birthday". If you're looking for an Italian experience that's a little more on the intimate side this place may not be for you. Otherwise, all was good except that our request for a table in the bar area which was made at the time of reservation two weeks prior was not honored. Hence, we were forced to dine among the groups.
