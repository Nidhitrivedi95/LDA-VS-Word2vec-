yY9XOQ1Baozl8HGK4mN76w Stumbled onto this awesome little pizza place when the wine bar next door wasn't open. It has a funky east coast vibe and it is a small place with some booths and a bar. Our server was very genuine and friendly. Started with some garlic bread and had a 14" pizza with sausage and olives. It was more than enough for 2 people and everything tasted great. Can't wait to go back and try the clam pizza the server recommended.
