esnvHQxunLTAckQpntqbCg First time I ordered the simple meat sauce pasta and was blown away. Since they make northern style pasta I found it a good change of pace to most Italian restaurants. I visited another time and was very disappointed. The pasta and risotto tasted undercooked and personally I was not a fan of the style of risotto. It seemed bland and the texture was similar to baby food while the rice was hard in the middle. I'm pretty split on this place, not sure if others had a similar experience with inconsistency but it's not something I'd look for in a recommendation.
