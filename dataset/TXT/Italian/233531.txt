Toux3q1WwY2vNV5AhbR6wQ Food was outstanding.  Service was a little distracted but maybe they are still working out the kinks since this is a new venue in a higher level of dining as opposed to D's Six Pack and Dogs.

We had the Salmon (great!) and the Pasta Vodka (also great).  

The Italian bread was cold and dry ... they should consider being a little innovative with the bread (quick way into most people's heart  is warm bread)

Lovely addition to Regent Square.  A little pricey but they have to be since it is BYOB.
