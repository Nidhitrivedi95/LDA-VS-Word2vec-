nsw3tlB-hwz4KbPYcuaSww I asked for mozzarella substitute in the my salad instead of blue cheese and they gladly fulfilled the request. I kept seeing folks walk in and out with pizzas so perhaps I should have ordered one. Overall happy with my food the friendly and casual service and atmosphere.
I would come back on my next visit 
The mozzarella was delicious!!! Like they were never refrigerated. I could probably just eat that with a little balsamic vinaigrette all day long
