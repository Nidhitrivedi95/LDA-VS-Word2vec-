BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg I love setebello, great pizza. Unfortunately this place has a problem, that white girl, her attitude is disgusting, i never received not a " hi, how are you" or a " ill be there with you in a minute" she never even offered me a menu after sitting at the bar for almost 10 minutes when a couple sat next right next to me they got the menu and service right away. Again, i love this place and their pizzas but the service was a big turn off. I hope Mgmt takes proper action on her and stop her pretencious, arrogant attitude.
