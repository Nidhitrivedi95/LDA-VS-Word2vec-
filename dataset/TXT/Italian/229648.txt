T7yKffTuhiIZclsgjfgowA really not exceptional. 
pizza is thin but with huge massive crust crown border. topping is ok but lacks fresh tomatoes (stop it with sundried tomatoes everywhere, they are good for antipasto and in pasta, but not on dry pizzas).

clearly overpriced, on top of that. not sure i'll try again.

why the h... do these pizza places not accept any customization of their pizzas, such as less cheese or... 2 slices of fresh tomato!? of course we would pay for the add! 1 dollar for 2 slices of tomato on top, they'd become richer and would made customers much happier!
