IQVka-wzJmN3jw2W70aCzw We had: excellent artichoke salad, superb oysters Michelina and veal piccata. As for the saltinbocca I was quite disappointed not to find at least one leave of sage in the preparation. I have been eating Saltinbocca from Brussels through Paris, Milano, Bologna, New York and Chicago as it is my favourite veal recipe but without sage it is not a saltinbocca. We'll definitely will return to this restaurant but I will insist on getting the saltinbocca as it should be.
