4LB4xtFAwfvJRachr6Eaxw I ordered one of their pastas. I came with two other people. Each of them ordered a different type of pasta than I did. All three of us felt pretty, "eh" at the end. Like it filled our stomachs but totally didnt hit the spot for anyone. I actually stopped eating halfway through my pasta because I looked up the calories. Now I disclaim that If it had been delicious, or even good, I would have probably kept eating. But I make better pasta out of a box at home and I wasnt about to eat a zillion calories and not even feel like it was worth it in the end. It was really bland, unimpressive, unidimensional, incredibly calorie dense for how tasteless it was, and if youre looking for a place to splurge on calories that are actually WORTH the splurge, this is not it.
