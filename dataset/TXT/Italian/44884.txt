We went for the lunch special on a recommendation of a friend, and I have to say I was pretty impressed by their pizzas. Service was ok, considering they had just one person taking the orders and serving the food, bar style, but it was better than I expected, although the prices were slightly more than I thought, which is why we went for the lunch special. If you want the pizza cut in traditional pie slices, make sure you mention it. Apparently you need to, or you will be served in those tiny squared slices "chicago style" (even though we did not even order a deep dish pizza...)
