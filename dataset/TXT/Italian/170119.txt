MtvN8vMiKcLkkz_tCvBx3g We had plans for dinner and a Broadway show and originally wanted to stop by Coco Osteria. Unfortunately, they were booked so I made reservations for Aria. While not one to try new restaurants with too much optimism, we decided to give Aria a try. 

Consistent with most previous reviews, Aria's broad menu of contemporary Tuscan fare was spot on. For starters, we ordered steamed mussels which was amazingly fresh. The portion was just right... generous but not too much. This was a good thing as we then had the main course, which was papparadelle pasta with braised duck ragu for me and grilled salmon for her. Both dishes were competently prepared, well portioned and really good. 

To finish our meal, we split two desserts a chocolate hazelnut cake and mascarpone cheesecake. While both were delicious, the chocolate hazelnut cake won our vote hands down (and I'm not even a chocolate lover). 

Definitely coming back here and with more success could become one of our regular restaurants.
