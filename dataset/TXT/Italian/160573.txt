LhWwwDJ2l79a1tHrpcdK6A Get there early for dinner on a weekend because they are busy and don't take reservations.  I ordered the chicken avocado BLT with soup.  I was served a grilled vegetable sandwich with soup by mistake.  The tomato soup was very oily.  In fact, the oil could be seen floating in the small bowl of soup.  I bit into the sandwich and a big rubbery piece of eggplant fell out.  It was inedible and not what I ordered.  I pointed out the error to the server.  By the time I got the correct sandwich my friend had almost finished eating.  

To the restaurant's credit, the manager came to our table and told me I would not be charged for my meal.  I didn't even ask to speak to the manager or suggest I get any discount.

The decor and ambience were very nice.  But don't order the tomato soup or anything with eggplant!
