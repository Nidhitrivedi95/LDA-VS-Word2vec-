DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw Italian restaurant has gr8 menu w/good service and nice ambiance.  My veal picatta was so so as the lemon sauce drowned the veal flavor.  Salads are good and you can get half portions.  Gr8 wine selection.  Fiance had gr8 Italian fish dish.  Pasta is traditionally done very well.  Gr8 desserts and deli.  Prices are reasonable.  Ample parking.
