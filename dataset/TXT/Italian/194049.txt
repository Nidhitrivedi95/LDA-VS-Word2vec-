pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg Carmine's just catered a fantastic meal to the Veteran's Village in Las Vegas. Really, truly delicious hot Italian food brought to us as very very kind gesture to make the holidays better. Not only was the dinner great, but employees took time out to bring it to us. Fantastic treat and a super gesture. If you're dining out, go see them. They really care and go above and beyond!
