1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ We went to dinner for the first time on Sunday night and had a great experience. The food and the service were both exceptional. Rachel was our server and when Dan stopped by our table he was very pleasant. We live in Ahwatukee and don't often get to Scottsdale for dinner but we will definitely be back again. We are looking forward to trying brunch on a weekend. That menu looked very good.
