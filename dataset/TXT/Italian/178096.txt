nOkSC1GtMUJ_I70sb0SaeQ Me and my boyfriend live super close to this fine establishment and LOVE it. We found a groupon deal and decided to give it a shot. It's by far my favorite pizza place in town. I always tell my clients who are in from out of town like Chicago looking for authentic good pizza to go there.  The owner is amazing and and usually always there when we are. I hope they last considering a lot of places in the past there have came and gone fast.
