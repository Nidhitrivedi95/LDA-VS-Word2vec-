FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q I dined here a couple years ago and happy to know that the quality has not skipped a beat over time.  The atmosphere inside is elegant and gives the feel of an old school Italian restaurant without the cheesiness of some of the restaurants in town that try to be too old Italian family or mobsterish.  The service was excellent.  We were promptly seated and our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu.  The waitress made some excellent recommendations.  The service was very old school, professional and refined.

I had the Portofino with an assortment of seafood and red sauce.  This dish was delicious.  The portioning of the seafood was a pleasant surprise.  My wife had the fettucini with shrimp, mushroom and pink sauce (a mix of red and white).  This dish was amazing and the sauce really made the dish.

A lot of restaurants in Las Vegas claim to have great Italian food and don't deliver.  Italian food is a tough market for Las Vegas restaurants to set themselves apart.  Your mom's New Jersey kitchen Italian food is not as great as you remember and doesn't hold a candle to Italy.  At that end of the day anything our mom made is an imitation of an imitation of what was made in the home country.  This restaurant is the closest thing to the quality and attention to detail I've had in Italy.
