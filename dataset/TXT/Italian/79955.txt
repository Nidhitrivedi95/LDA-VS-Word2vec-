d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew DO NOT ORDER FOR DELIVERY! It took an hour for my food, which was understood since it was a Friday night at dinner time. We ordered 2 sandwhiches a #7 and a chicken Parmesan , 2 salads, and canolis. $50
When we finally had the food delivered, we only were given the salads and canoli. We were so excited and so hungry I was so irritated that we had to call and wait another 20 minutes for my food to come back. When i opened my sandwich, the chicken Parmesan, the chicken was obviously old, and was too hard to enjoy. The bread was hard as a rock, and it was literally inedible. The #7 was ok. The bread was super hard as well. I barely touched my salad. There was too much brown lettuce and it was soggy before I even put dressing on it. 

The canoli was not good either. It was just covered in nasty hershey syrup. My 8 year old who eats anything wold not eat more than a bite. I would NOT recommend ordering from this place. It was a huge waste of $50. I could have paid less, and had better food from dominos (which I don't enjoy ordering from) If you live in this area and want a good sandwich or pizza, go to rosattis. Its around the same price range, but I have never been disappointed.
