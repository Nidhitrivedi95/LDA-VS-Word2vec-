hh-N1r9O1JpvzGw1mp0bKw What a pleasant lunch experience, really good food, excellent and creative menu options, feel-good decor. Thanks Yelp for the reviews. I had the Sweet Home Alabama, half portion, and the portion was generous. Sweet, tasty and just the right amount of richness. My husband had the special called Scarborough Fair with chicken, asparagus, capers and linguine in a sage butter sauce. Both were cooked to order.  We ended with a freshly baked lemon bar, yumm. I did not give 5 bars due to parking limitations.
