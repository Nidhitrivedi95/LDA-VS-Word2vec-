3-6biVwm7VwPZ-k67jml-Q Not a fan. Today Vermont Sandwich Company was packed, so my girlfriend and I thought we would walk over and give this place a try. Big BIG Mistake. Now I've been to Italy, hell ...I grew up in Nice, France. Not 'old world' enough for me, I ordered the Maresciallo Italian antipasto with their meats & cheese which took forever to get and charged me over $10 (big rip off) and my friend ordered a Bastard baguette (dis-appointing). This place is too over-priced in their offerings.
The main reason for this yelp is the rudeness of the staff here, the woman behind the counter had a chip on her shoulder and treated not only us but others in line with arrogance. Also the old man, possibly the owner had the same air about him.
Granted there were many off duty scottsdale police hanging around, but the whole scenario reminded me of a mafia 'front', just like back home. I guess this is a hit or miss from reading all the reviews, maybe its just from others low standards?
