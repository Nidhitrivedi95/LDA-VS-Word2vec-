2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg 1 star for the Yelp reviews on here and -1 star for the name cafe shoved in the name. This place is NOT a cafe where you can sit with your pc to surf the net. It IS a cafe for eating and socializing with people, not one to do work. It's more of a restaurant at most. Just leaving this review out there to warn people that may want to hop on by here thinking that. To save you the trouble it's a normal looking cafe inside, with the seating that looks like restaurant and the outside seating that looks like a restaurant at the strip. With restaurant food.
