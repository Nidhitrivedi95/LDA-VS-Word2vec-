uwT7CppiYkek-Z-661sndQ Where to begin...

First time going was actually for my engagement dinner, it was hosted by the lovely server Louisa and the manager Vince and ever since that time myself, my fiancé and my family have been hooked!

The food is incredible truly authentic Neapolitan style pizza, excellent pasta, impressive selection of Italian wine- and they know their stuff! And of course for the sweet tooth a delicious slice of cheesecake or a piece of tiramisu served with a cappuccino for good measure.

Hopefully you get served by Louisa with her pleasant smile and cheerful welcoming attitude and get welcomed in by Vince who makes you feel as if your at a relatives.

You can truly not go wrong with Sip!

We'll be back many more times in the future!
