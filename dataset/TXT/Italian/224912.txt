sN4x4DszRsD4LkV3HEm44g So disappointing.  The waiter brought my meal to the table but didn't bring my friends meal at the same time.  By the time her meal arrived, mine was cold.  We said something to him about it and his response was, "It's not my fault."  Really?!  What waiter responds with that?  The manager came to our table and we told her about it and she didn't seem to care.  Definitely won't be dining there again.  So unprofessional.
