JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A 7 West is such a great little spot. My favorite is the upstairs, with it's church pews, dim lights, patio and great wine selection. I used to come here all the time for casual dinners with friends, date night drinks, and after hours quiet conversation. It is a must for anyone wanting to explore real Toronto. And it's where I always go when I'm home to catch up with friends, usually over a bottle of wine and their yummy hummus plate.
