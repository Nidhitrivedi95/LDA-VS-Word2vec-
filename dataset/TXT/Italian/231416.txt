Tgc2dTcE1xOey2OUt_PvXA I am giving Oreganos a 4/5 only because I wish their restaurant was bigger and their wait times were shorter. Sometimes we have to pass on this amazing restaurant because we simply can't wait 2 hours to eat. However, the prices are really reasonable. I get the big rig pasta almost every time! I can't resist it. The atmosphere is really great and friendly for family get togethers or a date night. Their service is always wonderful and they always get your order right! It is my favorite restaurant on the west side of Phoenix!
