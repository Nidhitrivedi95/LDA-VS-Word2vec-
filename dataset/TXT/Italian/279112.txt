yNp0ybYo07JQWlmdz1K4Cw Everything about our experience was so great. We came in on a Friday right at 5 and we were celebrating a special occasion with about 16 people. We planned on just doing the happy hour (which is fabulous) so didn't really make a reservation. They extended the happy hour menu to their patio so they set up a nice corner spot for us with no wait/problem at all. Our waiter was so wonderful and attentive to everyone coming in at different times and keeping track of separate checks and everything. Their happy hour menu is so legit and delicious! We got pretty much every small plate you could get which was about 10ish items and they had drink specials as well. Everything I tried was so good and for $6 the portions were larger as well. Their patio is so cute too. The inside is very nice as well and I definitely will be back for more! I was having such a great time I forgot to snap pics but believe me check it out.
