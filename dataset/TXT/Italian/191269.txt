PebX-Sf_h4FJGgsRAA5Fng After convincing my wife and kids to go out to dinner on Mother's Day, the question became "where?"  After reading reviews on Yelp, we decided to try La Calabria Ristorante.  I am not allowed to pick restaurants anymore.

The food was mediocre and bland. 

Salads were a 1/4 cup of iceberg lettuce with paper thin slices of carrots and radishes. 

The fillet wrapped in puff pastry crust was tender, but overpowered by the mushroom sauce/gravy.  The broccoli was mush and very bland.  My wife had the seafood linguine which was simply "ok." the same for my daughter's ricotta stuffed gnocchi, just "ok."  

Desserts were decent with the exception of the tiramisu and cheesecake, both lackluster.  The cheesecake was not creamy or smooth, just grainy.  The flourless cake was good, wish we all ordered that.  

Service was fair considering it was Mother's Day, but another server or two could not have hurt.  They do serve alcohol, but there is not a bartender on staff.  If it comes out of a bottle, you are good, otherwise, think "flask"  :)  So much for a lemon-drop martini.

Perhaps being from Chicago and growing up in northern Italy, I am too critical, but not our "go-to" choice for Italian.
