NFHlMOEyVsbqY_VQNJFafQ Don't bother trying this place. For starters, we were greeted by a rude server who clearly didn't care we were there. She quickly informed us they only had bar or outside seating. We chose outside, but the 1 heater for the entire patio was out of propane so we moved ourselves inside. There were dirty dishes everywhere, clearly they had no bussers, or a bar tender, or hostess. Our server got away with the bare minimum and made no suggestions on what to order. This new place won't be around long. At least the food was ok, after waiting about 45 minutes to get it.
