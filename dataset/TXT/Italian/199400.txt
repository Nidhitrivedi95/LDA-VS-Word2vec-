pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw It's all been said before, but I'll give it my shot. But first: Get this straight: I was drug down here against my will. I had no desire to wait 2+ hours for ANY pizza, never mind one that's served with a side of attitude (that was what I expected after reading all the reviews).

Here's what I learned. 

The place next door (also owned by the Bianco's) has a good selection of wine, beer, bottled waters and soda. None of the "Big 3" breweries either, to my relief. Nice micro stuff. It's small. It's much cooler than standing outside. It's easy to spend a bunch of money while you wait for the restaurant to call over and let you know your table is ready. Note that you still have to stand in line initially to get "on the list" for Pizza seating, but you can send someone in to get beverages and tables while someone stands in line next door.

Pizzeria itself is small (obvious from the other reviews n'est pas?). Our wait staff was quick and friendly - no troubles with the hostess either. 

Food is awesome, although I don't think the mozzarella is "all that" like some would have you believe. After all -fresh mozzarella is pretty easy to make yourself. Google it, if you don't believe me. 

Anyway, we all 4 had different pizzas. I went Margherita with garlic because I didn't want my thin crust all weighed down with stuff - I wanted to see what the place really had as far as sauce and crust, so that's really the best way to go. Others loaded up. All were extremely satisifed. 

Was it worth 2 hours and $150+ between pizza, apps and drinks? That's a hard call, and the reason I gave this 4 stars...which I really wanted to be 3.75 but Yelp doesn't do fractions. Now, to check out Grimaldi's and see if their simulated NY water machine makes any difference to AZ water and its inclusion in a dough.
