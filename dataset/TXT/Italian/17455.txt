2bK1ng2mnRdtTh_BDNGmIg I am always hesitant to try pizza places that claim to be just like those that I miss from back in Boston. I have passed North End Pizza many times and thought to myself "yeah right". Then I tried it. I could tell by the smell when I walked in it was going to be good. Service was great, decor was great...and the food was AMAZING, right down to the fried dough! If you miss New England pizza...PLEASE try this place, you won't be sorry!!!
