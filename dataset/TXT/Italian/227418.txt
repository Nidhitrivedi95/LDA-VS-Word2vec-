SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ My wife and I enjoyed such a treat for lunch.The chefs special was so delicious my mouth fell in love with his plate. Scallops, shrimp, muscles,lobster and Linguine was spectacular. We were very deleted to eat next to Pegasus in the water fountain. Can't wait to go back. Thank you for that special lunch
