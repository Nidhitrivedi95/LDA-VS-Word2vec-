dCgWmN4DuGBSDG4liWH3OQ I can't recommend you going there.  The server was nice and seemed happy, but service was pretty poor.  Got our order wrong and then we had to wait while one dinner was corrected.  Forgot to give us butter with the bread, etc..  Food really wasn't warm when served and it didn't taste very good.  Had to ask for everything or you didn't get it.  For the prices charged here, you can do much better trying somewhere else.  The amount of food included doesn't measure up to prices charged.
