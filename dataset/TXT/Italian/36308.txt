6rjqU2x9A6BErUxh6THz6A My husband and I located Vinny-Boy's by our local Entertainment Book, which had a $7.00 off coupon inside.
As we walked in the front door Vinny the owner was talking with some "regulars" it seemed. He was very friendly and showed us some of his specialty items he carried in his store. He was then called away when a delivery truck arrived.
My husband and I both decided on the Itialian beef sub. They were average in taste.  We had to ask the server (hispanic lady) for our soda's and we never did recieve our fries.
Over all it's a nice local place, but will only return if we get another coupon.
