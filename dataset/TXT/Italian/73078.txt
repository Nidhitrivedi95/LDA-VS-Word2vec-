CJvN2k3gjR7JspTx21icTQ Still one of my very favorite places on the planet. Their pies are so, so very delicious. If you don't like their pizza, I'm not sure I can trust you. I just... I can't. 

I haven't tried too much else on their menu, but after reading through some of these reviews, I think we're going to have to try some sandwiches--and gnocchi. No more excuses.

But please, understand it's not easy to steer away from a pepperoni and mushroom pie from these guys... Topped with freshly grated cheese and chopped basil? Holy. 

I love this place so much that I'll put up with the lack of seating. The lack of parking. I do not care. You shouldn't care. Just eat this pie and enjoy your life. 

Oh, and try and dang salad! Those mothers are packed with stuff and delicious!
