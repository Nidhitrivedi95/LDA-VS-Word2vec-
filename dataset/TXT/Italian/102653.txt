FIr6iGroJz6OP1m9vo3f9w Can't believe this place is still in business. We recently moved to the area and were were trying out all the restaurants. We ended up here on our anniversary.  The place was empty (that should have been our first clue).  All I remember is it was pretty expensive and it wasn't even good.  

If you want Italian food in the Deer Valley area, go to Time Square on 27th Ave & Deer Valley.
