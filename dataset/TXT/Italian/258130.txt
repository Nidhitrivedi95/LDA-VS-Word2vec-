w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg we had dinner at OG on sunday, our waiter, Jeremy, was GREAT! he was attentive, personable and did such a great job!  the table we sat at was by a very noisy group of 4 women...as soon as the left the atmosphere great improved...Olive Garden's food is always the same, I enjoy the fresh salad and the soups...
