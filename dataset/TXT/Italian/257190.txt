w2b0ve7xpuCQkwYICFIUOg I went here with my two friends.  Collectively, we tried the following:

Artichoke with Parmesan and balsamic vinegar
Shrimp scampi
Ravioli with white sauce
Rigatoni with diced meatballs in a spicy red sauce
Squid Ink Pasta with shrimp in a saffron cream sauce

Both the appetizers (the artichoke and shrimp scampi) were quite good.  Using the scrumptious cheese bread they give you to mop up the scampi sauce is a recommended tactic.  

For entrees, I was anticipating the Squid ink pasta the most.  Unfortunately, this dish was a letdown.  The pasta was overcooked, so it lacked that al dente texture that you hope for when you visit to a place like this.  The saffron cream sauce was also lacking in flavor.  The clear winner was the rigatoni in a meat sauce.  Very hearty dish with a flavorful sauce and just enough spice.  

I'd give the meal itself 3.5 stars, but with the exceptional service (and the fact that Yelp won't let you give partial stars), this place gets a 4/5.
