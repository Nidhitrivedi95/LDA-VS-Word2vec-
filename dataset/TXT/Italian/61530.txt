AYLxEeVq8NKG2UhcBiggrA I was pretty stoked when I heard we were coming here for a dinner party. However, I was totally unsatisfied. The pizza in my opinion is overrated. I guess I had higher expectations. And I did try 3 different pizzas from others at the table. One was cold too. I was going to complain but didn't want to make a big fuss in front of gfs family. Anyways, customer service was excellent, but I thought they were trying too hard, especially for what it was. I definitely wouldn't be coming here again, but that's just me. Because I don't recommend this place for myself, doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend this place for someone else.
