The salmon pizza was different than I've ever had before, but it truly hit the spot and complimented the special pizza of the night. The veal was cooked perfectly and was so tender! The veggies and potatoes were seasoned well and those alone were amazing. If you're looking for an intimate setting and fine Italian dining, this is the place to go!
