USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Great dining experience. I can see this place, with its outdoor patio seating, being a  very romantic dining spot. I however was with 4 other coworkers and had a great dinner. 

The octopus and cheese appetizer platters were delicious with a local NC cheese being featured. 
They did have an extensive wine selection - we ended up with a Pinot Noir (not my choice) to pair our main courses. 

The soup of the day was cauliflower and blue cheese, which was very yummy to the last drop. 

I ordered the lamb chops and it ended up being the only reason I gave this place 4 out of 5 stars. It was over cooked!

The wait staff was excellent. Definitely a place to hit in Charlotte. 

Make sure to bring a date though ;)
