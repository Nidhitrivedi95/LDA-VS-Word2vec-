x-ZnHkRIhpGwZ_7VwiKlRg This place is nice and seems like a place families like to come for simple fresh pizzas.  It's pretty good.  The arancini was delicious.  The pizzas were cooked perfectly with fresh ingredients...true italian style pizza.  Though the margherita pizza was great, the prosciutto e arugula wasn't that great; I wish the prosciutto was cut up a little rather than placing huge pieces of the meat with some arugula.  Plus, the service was pretty slow and the place wasn't that busy.  But overall, I think the food is worth coming and trying.

Also, if you like nutella, they sell a huge tub of nutella for like $60 or something like that....my girlfriend and I did think about it.
