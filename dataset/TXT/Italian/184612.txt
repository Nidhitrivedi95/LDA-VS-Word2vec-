OIdOJaNS8M624F58XGV3PQ We arrived for lunch and ordered the supposedly famous pizza. It was the lunch special for $15 wtih salad. The pizza arrived and it was slighly burnt on the bottom. not so tasty..but we were in a hurry..Ordered two glasses of red valapolicella wine nothing fancy and it came in small glass quarter full. The cost $22.00 for the wine Ouch! our bill was $100.00!!
Too much for pizza and lunch
Good luck 
Don't think at those prices with the great greek food around you will last
