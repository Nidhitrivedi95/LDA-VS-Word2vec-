u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg How do you not love Postinos?  The $20 wine and bruschetta deal is fantastic. The bruschetta is always sinfully delicious and I have had EVERY type they offer.  My favs are the white bean, the apple/brie, and the fig. $5 glasses of wine from 11-5 pm.  Say whaaat?   Yup.  However, today I branched out and *didn't* get bruschetta. Say it isn't so.... I got the Tuscan Tuna panini.  I don't know how you make tuna taste sinful, but they did.  This is fresh, high quality tuna on either a ciabatta or foccacia. I opted for the ciabatta.  Delish!!  Seriously though... what the heck do they DO to that tuna?  I never get this jazzed about tuna. ;)
You get a choice of chips or salad and I opted for the salad. Simple, light, with a touch of goat cheese. I actually had to take half my sandwich home because it was so big. Yay for branching out!  Did I mention I loved the tuna?
