G2hTYYzvlg75BisWSHarLQ Has potential but needs to step it up a bit. Great to have a sit down restaurant in the area. 
Inside was loud- could use something to soften the noise. Patio is a nice addition although the small lawn allowed patrons to let their kids run and shout- not conducive to a grown up quiet dinner.
Server was friendly and attentive and knew the menu.
Bread could have been served with a plate for dipping. Both olive oil and salad dressing were served in cheap plastic tubs- it would be classier and more environmentally friendly to use a nicer reusable bowl.
Shrimp pasta special was amazing!
Veal Saltimbocca was less so. Prosciutto was more like thick Canadian bacon, and the whole thing was covered in a huge gooey wad of bland mozzarella and spinach. Put on a large bed of spaghetti- the whole dish seemed thrown together, and like a tacky version of what could be a tasty Italian favorite.
We will go back for sure, but might stick with local favorites like pizza and pasta. I don't think I would risk disappointment by trying the more traditional Italian trattoria fare.
With some work this can be a real gem!
