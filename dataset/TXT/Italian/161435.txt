LkRSDF7gTNXg1OlNNBSVAA Really just an OK experience, nothing spectacular as far as the food goes. 
I went there with my parents and my partner. She is vegetarian, and an Italian restaurant usually has many options for her - and they did not disappoint in this department. The place was packed and the one waitress was very efficient, however although she did her best, it took some time to get to taking our orders, and overall service was just OK. I started with their antipasti Eduardo appetiser - a fantastic choice of salad, with olives, pickled mushrooms, choice of sausages, a piece of hard cheese, melon and prosciutto, artichoke and probably something else I'm leaving out :). This was great. My mom got the Cesar salad and said it wasn't great - she didn't like the dried bacon bits and the sauce wasn't the best she has had. My dad got the eggplant starter and was happy with it though he thought that it could use more pepper. For my main dish I got the spaghetti carbonara which was just ok - again these bacon dried bits that my mom disliked in her salad reappeared in my spaghetti. I didn't feel an egg yolk in there either. My dad was pleased with his surf n'turf dish, but complained that not all the prowns were peeled (just one was). My partner had the pasta primavera and my mom had the cheese tortellini  with cream sauce, and both were happy with their dishes. We were too stuffed for dessert. The bill came to 110$ including tax and tip (we brought our own wine), which isn't too bad for such a meal.
