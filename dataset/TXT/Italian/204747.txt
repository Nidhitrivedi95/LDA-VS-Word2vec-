qd7KHsn4B4q3CqNw-yxOWQ We had doughboys for The first time tonight. And I sincerely hope that they thrive in Cottage grove. The sausage and pepperoni cheese pizza we had for dinner was amazing.  I ate way too much-especially when coupled with the delicious bread sticks.  The dipping sauce was just ok-but believe me you won't need it. Looking forward to the next pizza night!
