VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w This place has fantastic food and the service was also great! In my mind that is the determining factor on why I give it a five star rating. I must admit my boyfriend had to literally drag me there because I was unsure about trying out a restaurant located right next to a convenience store...so don't let the location deter you! We ordered mussels for an appetizer, and had the gnocchi (homemade) and the linguine carbonara for entrees. They also serve complimentary bread and dip; I call it Italian chips and salsa. The description doesn't do it justice though; it was really fantastic and the two of us ate the entire serving. The mussels were cooked perfectly; the entrees were wonderful. I can't wait to go back and try the pizza!
