M8jzd1hpwI8p0JqcBCINZw What to do with Alice?  One aggressively-thrown beer bottle away from ClubLand, this is a restaurant trying to be many things at the same time and doing so satisfactorily.  It's kind of a restaurant, kind of a lounge, and kind of okay.

The restaurant area is a decent eatery space, ample seating with knowledgeable staff that will take you through a fairly unchallenging Italian restaurant.  You can take parents, aunts, and uncles here without any concern of overwhelming them.  The food is straight-forward, simple, and tasty enough, but nothing that you couldn't find elsewhere in a smaller family-run restaurant elsewhere in the city.  Proximity to the clubs has its consequences I guess.

There's also a lounge area at the side, darkly lit, with a DJ spinning if you get there at the right night at the right time.  The attempts to be chic and hip are apparent, with the same menu available as in the restaurant, but with a stronger drink focus on martinis.  Would you expect anything less?  It's a decent eatery, and okay lounge, but nothing to make you pick up a pen, get out a sheet of paper, and write "Dear Mom and Dad, I hope this letter finds you well.  I was at the most amazing place last night..."
