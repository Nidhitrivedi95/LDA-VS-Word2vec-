829Kv1uZJj5q8sr2G0mnvA We had a very large part of it out on the patio of this awesome little pizza joint. It's situated right in the bucolic downtown area and the building is got a great view of this little one street light town. We had a large party of about 20 people and our server, Ashley, happens to be one of the owners. We lucked out because she was an awesome server. Well I can't go into detail about the multitude and different pizzas that we ordered I can assure you that every Pizza that we got was different, tasty, the toppings were fresh and the pieces were unique. We learned that Jason, one of the other owners, just came back from Italy and won a worldwide Pizza competition of some sort. There's plenty of parking on site the restaurant is clean and well lit. They also have a salad bar where those of us who are trying but failing to watch our weight can justify eating a piece of pizza or two but I know I'm down on the side with salad bar. If you're ever in this area of town please give this Homestyle Pizza Joint a try as you won't be disappointed.
