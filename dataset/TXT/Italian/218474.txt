S1zlGFu9fi5-QmVpGqsKsA Me and my girlfriend enjoyed a great evening here. We had reservations but ended up eating in the bar. It has a great fireplace and more of a chill feel. The beat salad was amazing and for the main course she  enjoyed the Sacchetti al tartufo which I highly recommend and I had the scallops which were very good as well. Definitely would go back
