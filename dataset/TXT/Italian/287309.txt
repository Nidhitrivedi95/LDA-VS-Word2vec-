zKwzMHiufpQ3bRAA7R7f8w Had the most amazing meal here last night. Everything from start to finish was delicious. The overall atmosphere is great, and the service was friendly and attentive. But the food is what was really worth writing about. We started with the arancini which was seasoned perfectly and had a great balance of crispy and creamy. The bolognese sauce served with the arancini was unbelievable and full of flavor. We were literally eating the sauce with spoons after the arancini was gone. Next we shared the shrimp scampi pasta and the Mambo pizza. The pasta was packed with large sautéed shrimp and covered in a light, buttery garlic sauce. The pizza was everything pizza should be-- crispy, chewy and cheesy with a fresh tomato sauce, salty prosciutto and peppery arugula. We finished our meal with coffee and the tiramisu which did not disappoint. Light and creamy, a perfect end to an amazing meal. We will definitely be back and can't wait to try more items on the menu!
