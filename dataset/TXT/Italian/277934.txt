YJS7cXGLAvWw9DUDXpw84Q Honestly, I think Babbo's deserves 3 1/2 stars for the food, but a solid 4 stars for their Monday-Tuesday night $5.99 spaghetti dinner!  Not that the spaghetti is great, it is good, and the 2 large meatballs are very good.  The stars are for an affordable, filling, relatively heathy meal that the entire family can enjoy.  The breadsticks and olive oil/balsamic vinegar are very good and we have had excellent service every time we have gone.  It has nice ambiance inside the restaurant and additional, comfortable seating outside.
