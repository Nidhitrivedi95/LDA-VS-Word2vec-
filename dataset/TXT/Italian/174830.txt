ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw Great location, nice atmosphere in the middle of all the action.  Awesome service.  Food was average. I ordered a calzone which was burnt on the top and more so on the bottom which left a taste in my mouth.  A friend also ordered a calzone and theirs was perfect... Luck of the draw I guess.  The Manager was kind enough to comp my calzone.  Other friends had chicken pasta dishes which they said chicken was dry and pasta was bland.  It was a very busy night and our food took almost 45 minutes and not hot when when did get it.  Perhaps on a slower night we may have had a better experience.
