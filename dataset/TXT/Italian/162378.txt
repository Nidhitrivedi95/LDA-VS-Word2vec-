They make a good Martini - from their martini list and that's no easy trick, if you ask me! We are trying to choose something new every visit. Being a creature of habit, I do want to get that angel hair pizza again soon... light and tasty!! MUSIC - LIVE MUSIC - each time we've been there there is live music and I love that this local place makes that available. I'd recommend Danny Boy's as a great choice for a group... just the two of us enjoy it often!
