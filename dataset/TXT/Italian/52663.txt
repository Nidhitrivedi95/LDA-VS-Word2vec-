9xdVIIzHp12Zrox5aFaaHA This pizzeria is warm and inviting the moment you walk in. We were greeted immediately and asked where we would like to be seated. We opted for the back and my boyfriend and I were seated in front of the area where the pizza is prepared. I watched in awe how the pizza was made in from scratch and cooked to perfection in a matter of minutes in the wood burning oven.

I ordered the "The 504" which had tomato sauce, basil, fior de latte, soppresata, red onions and mushrooms and grand padano. On the first bite it was so flavourfull and you can taste all the ingredients. The thin crust was just perfect (you have the option to select different flours for your pizza). It was delicious. What sets this place apart from all the other established pizzerias is how fresh the ingredients are and how fast a simple yey delicious pizza is made and brought to your table. If you like pizza, this place is a must try!!!
