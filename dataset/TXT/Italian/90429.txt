eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA Nice atmosphere. Reasonable service on a very busy night. The roasted veggies were good. The lemon chicken was hard and dry, not at all warm and they were stingy with the butter. We had to ask several times for more bread and butter. This was not my typical experience here, the lunch experience was much better.
