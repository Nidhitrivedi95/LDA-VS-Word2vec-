PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ I've been going to Off The Strip since it opened several years ago, as I live here in Southern Highlands.

I have never had a complaint about their food or service! The food always has great flavor. I take my business meetings, family, dates, etc, to Off the Strip and everyone has always been impressed.

Maybe I am not as picky as some of the negative reviewers here, but who cares if they have a single paint on a plain beige wall? Are we HGTV judges now? What I care is about the food! You don't like garlic? Oh well. I love it :) Everyone's taste is different; it doesn't mean the food is bad.

And by the way, that wall is gone :) They expanded recently, added a full lounge, and now the place gets so busy sometimes, I've had to make reservations.

The staff is super friendly. They know me by name, they recognize my voice on the phone and they are always smiling. :)

Is it expensive? Yes. It's worth it. Their bacon wrapped filet mignon and their softball-sized meatballs are my favorites. Their house salad has great flavor.

Overall, one of my favorite places.
