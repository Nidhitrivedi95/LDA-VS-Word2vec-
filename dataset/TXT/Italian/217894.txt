RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q Hands down the best pizza we've had in years! Just moved here from CA and we will definitely be regulars here! Service by Diana was GREAT! The food was timely & correct despite our complicated order and tasted AMAZING from garlic bread appetizer, through pizza and all the way to dessert! Icing on the cake- they have a military discount! So glad we decided to try it out on a whim!
