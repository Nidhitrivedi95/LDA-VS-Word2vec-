SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog My mom just got back from a month in Ireland so we came in tonight to catch up. I had the ravioli and spaghetti and meat sauce combo. The ravs were great but I didn't care for the meat sauce. It was very bell pepper forward and just not my thing. Oh, and we had the zucchini appetizer and it was a huge portion but I didn't care for the dill ranch that came with it. The dill just took over. Mom had the special which was a shrimp, penne, roasted red pepper, artichoke hearts and feta dish. She loved it. This would be a 3 star review because the food was decent enough but our server Pippa was so great! We really enjoyed her service and she listened to mom rant on about Ireland even though she was a bit busy. My mom left her a coin from Scotland and she was so thankful and sweet. Next time, we'd definitely ask for her. For dessert, mom had the spumoni and I had the apple bread pudding. Both were very good.
