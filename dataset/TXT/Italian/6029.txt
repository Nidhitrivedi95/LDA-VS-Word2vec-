_VHU9KZUHRLp2Hc2JOKlYg We went here a month ago with my family and boyfriend.  While their food was good but pricey (they had the special of the day swordfish and the scallops) my dish, the signature Cioppino, was horrific.  The brown slimy sauce was poured over my dish for show in front of the whole table.  An entire prawn isn't necessary, for goodness sakes.  My dish clearly had seafood from the weekend (it was Tuesday).  We won't return because the stench of cigar smoke is thick within the restaurant, even though we sat as far away from the cigar bar as is physically possible.  Sorry guys, it's just okay.  

Also, I shouldn't have to pay for valet parking when it's literally ten steps from the curb.  I can park it myself since it doesn't require moving three cars.  Sheesh.
