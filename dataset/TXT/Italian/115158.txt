GQAvKHDfuBws7312iIqX6Q I used to love their white pizza but it started to come out tasting old and stale a few months back. I only eat it when I order a whole pie because then it's fresh and as delicious as ever. Their wings are pretty good and the zeppolis (sp?) are amazing. Food comes up relatively quickly and the employees are nice.
