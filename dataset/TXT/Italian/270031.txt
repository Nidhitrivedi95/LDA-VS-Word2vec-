XlvpNPAZnzm-DJmKYmK2nQ nice unique concept.  Simple menu, Pizza is not bad but wow was everything way too salty.  

the crostini was covered with some sort of oil herb seasoning that was SOO SALTY i was not able to finish it.   i dont mean normal salty.. i mean unbearable and inedible salty, almost like the salt shaker cap fell off and it was covered with a mountain of salt which they tried to brush off... 

the prosciutto on the pizza was also very salty.  That one was expected, but i had to pull some of it off because it was just too much.  

I would give them a shot again only because i like the ambiance and i may have experienced a bad batch.   I will have to go back to confirm if that is true.

but for now.. if you have heart problems or osteoporosis... this place is not for you.
