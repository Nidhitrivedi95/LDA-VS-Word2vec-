It's better to walk on the street to get to the entrance than trying to go through the casino to get between the two. We went here for a New Years Eve party and I have to say I had a great time. The food they had was standard bar fare, but delicious. The tempura shrimp was the best part. Honestly, everyone was more interested in the drinks anyway. Luckily, they had multiple bars set up all over the downstairs and the upstairs part of the club so the line wasn't too long. the bartender mixed us some pretty amazing LITs all night long. 

I think this place would be really nice as a regular restaurant during the day as well, but by 12 on New Years Eve it was just trashed. They really needed to have a better clean up staff. There were empty cups and half eaten food everywhere. Having a hallways filled with sinks with running water is a nice decorative touch, but to drunken guests on NYE, its just another place to vomit. Also, after midnight, people started to leave to the sister club, Tao, for Snoopdog's New Year party so the place cleared out pretty quickly. The patio was a nice place to watch the fireworks, but obviously way too crowded to be pleasant. Also, you can't really see the fireworks on the rest of the strip from there. We had a good time, for the time that we were there, but clearly, this was just a place to start the night for some people.
