527O5H26A0lFtCHO6zEh8w Big Ragu is very close to my heart as this was the first joint where I had my dinner when I arrived in Canada.Most importantly food is always fresh. We are a regular..and we go there to celebrate, to think, to eat, to look back, to relax and just to have a good time. 
Quantity is good and quality is excellent. Price is reasonable.
I just love Big Ragu! specially there pasta and simple salad ...it will always be special. I make sure all our friends and family members visit there once during their trip.
