G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q We were able to get a table without a reservation! Pretty awesome! Our original plan was to sit at the bar but we decided to see if a table was available and it was. We were seated in the way back, which didn't bother me as it was a little quieter and mellow however it was super hot back there. I asked the server for some air and he said they were working on it. Was still hot throughout the meal...that's why I have it 4 stars. 
The food is fantastic!!!! I love the tapas menu! We ordered several items from the tapas side as well as homemade pasta. It was so delish!!! The fresh olives are literally the best I've ever had. So fresh the marinade was fantastic! The service was 5 star! If I needed anything someone was there to assist. I loved it. Next time I'd like to sit in the main dining room as the view is fantastic!!!
