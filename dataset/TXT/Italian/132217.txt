iJpTpE9A8WDWvUlvUcFZuA Being in the Southpark area, this is a great place to grab lunch!  Every day they have really good lunch specials and also have a lunch menu which gets you smaller portions of their dinner menu at a discounted price.  Still plenty of food as well!

One of my favorite items on the menu is the Wood Grilled Salmon Salad!  The fish is always cooked to perfection and the vegetables in the salad are so fresh!

I've also had their panini and the Lobster Bisque!  Can you say decadent?  It is so creamy and rich, you could have a bowl of bisque with a small side salad and it would fill you up!  Plus, you get a yummy basket of bread and crispy flat bread when you are seated and its yummy!
