KDF3qxIYv1OkqtSUl4PwGQ I feel like this restaurant is where people go to be seen. It was very loud in there. The staff all look like models ... I swear it must be a requirement or something. I went after work on a Thursday and later in the evening there was a dj and the outside terrace was happening! As far as food goes I honestly was not impressed. I had the Angus Pride beef with foie gras, fresh truffle, Yukon Gold mash and seasonal vegetables. For $56 it was not worth the price. I honestly would rather go to Gibbys or the Keg. I honestly don't think I would come back here... Not even for drinks because the bloody caesar was not that good and the crowd is much older.
