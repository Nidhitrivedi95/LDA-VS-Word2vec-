Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag I was reeled in by all the good reviews of this place, so while I was in Vegas I dropped by for a bite.  While the service at the bar wasn't that great (we weren't drinking, so that may have had something to do with it), the food was excellent.  I went with the gnocchi, which I read rave reviews about, and it was delicious.  The bread, of course, was great, too.  The prices, for Wolfgang Puck's name at Crystals in Vegas, are actually quite reasonable.  This place has my vote.  I will definitely drop by again next time.
