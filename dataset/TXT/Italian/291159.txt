Staff inside were pleasant. The pizza price was comparable. $17.29 for a large with extra cheese and half sausage. The pizza looked okay but it wasn't any thing special. I've had better in Vegas. The sausage was good but the plain cheese was kind of bland. The crust doesn't have that crunch with the chewy, airy bite that you're looking for in good crust. It was more a crackery crisp.
I doubt I'll ever go back, it isn't worth it.
