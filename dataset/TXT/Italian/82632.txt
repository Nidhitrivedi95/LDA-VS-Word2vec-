DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw Again - another place in town that I don't understand the hype.  

This was my first meal after doing the Buffet of Buffets Yelp event - and I was really hating food, so this review might be a little biased somewhat.  I am unsure however if I would go back and try it again.

My husband and I had a friend in town, and choose this place to take him to because we were armed with a $50 off certificate from restaurant.com.  We figured for that much, we'd get a lot of food and wine between three people.  Instead, I felt that he prices were really inflated for what we ate and even with the discount, it was one of the most expensive meals I've had in town.  I don't mind paying a ton if the quality is there (see my gushing review for Carnevino), this wasn't really worth it.

This was a few months ago so I don't remember everything we ordered, admittedly.  My husband ordered a simple spaghetti and meatballs, I ordered the Dover Sole, and we had one more entree that escapes me.  But between the three entrees, two salads, and a glass of wine, and with our discount the bill was about $250 dollars which I felt was not real reasonable when I remember all of the meals where I have paid that much.  The quality, while certainly somewhat tasty, it was not remarkable enough to warrant those prices.  

I can think of many other Italian restaurants in town that are equal or surpasses the quality here and is priced much more reasonably.  Don Vito's in South Point, Pasta Shop Ristorante, is another.  And I hate to say it - but Bucca de Beppo and Olive Garden was more preferential to me than eating here.

This might be a good place if you are a tourist, but for the money I would stay on the strip and try some of the high-end Italian places like Bartolotta, Sinatra's, Rao's, or Nove.  You'll pay in the same range as Ferraro's but have a much more satisfying experience.
