XVDR44P_74FmA0ANanm4CQ Pizza is great here, so is the service.  The place is owned by Italian natives who really know how to cook up a pizza pie!  Dan and I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was hopping, but we didn't have to wait.  Our server was a young Italian woman who made us feel very at home.  We never had to wait for her to refill our drinks and the pizza was made within ten minutes.  I am a vegetarian and Dan isn't, but there was no problem splitting two toppings on each side with no extra charge.  The cheese was scruptous and fresh, and we didn't leave a slice behind.  

Pictures of Italy decked the walls and the waitresses talked amongst one another in a sultry Italian tongue.  It really was an authentic Italian dining experience!
