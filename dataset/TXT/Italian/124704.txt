Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ Place is small and cozy. Old school jars are used for lemonades and tea. The menu was my favorite. Everything is done exactly as the menu says it "old school". Nothing in their menu is fried. 
We started with the Gio salad which was served on top of sourdough bread. Very different and very tasty. We ordered chicken wings. 1 order has two large wings. They are stuffed with sausage. These were delicious. I would definitely order more next time. Last but not least the pizza was to die for. We created our own however they have a selection of specialty pizzas. Definitely worth the price!!
