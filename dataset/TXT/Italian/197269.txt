ppT0Rbx0-_W0W8DqY2fPiA Had the spinach and cheese calzone. 
It was good except for the drop that fell on my shirt.
The pizza looked very good.
The garlic knots looked awesome all bathing in the garlic and butter. 
Someone had a cheese steak and he said he always gets them here. Looked very good. 
I will return if in the area.
