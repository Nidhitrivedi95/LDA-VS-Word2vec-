GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ We had the fried pickles as a appetizer, split the bottom burner and an order of onion rings. While everything tasted good, the pickles were by far the best thing. Fried in what tasted like a tempura batter, the pickles did not have that strong dill taste I get in most fried pickles. We didn't care for the sauce it came with (I'm sure it was an aioli, but it tasted like plain mayo) so we ordered a side of hot sauce and added it to the mayo, which made it yummy. The onion rings seemed to be fried with the same tempura batter, and they looked way better than their french fries. I heard someone at the table next to us (who ordered both fries and onion rings) raving about the rings but did not mention the fries. The burger was cooked a perfect med-rare, taste was good but not great. Draft beers were very tasty.
We sat outside where the view is incredible. Recommend.
