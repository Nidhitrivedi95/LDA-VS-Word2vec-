0uwQIGlKICIYuRtayVnh7g I ate here for the first time and it was pretty good. I kind of reminds me of chipotle. You get noodles and meat and add whatever toppings you want. I had the basil pesto pasta with chicken. It's a lot of food for the money. Even the bread stick with pepperoni in it was good. I'll definitely eat here again.
