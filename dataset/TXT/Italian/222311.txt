sH9aI3xg-POBMp8R-kSQZg I've eaten here probably 5 times at this point, maybe more. The people here are very friendly and the food is good. I've had pasta and pizza dishes. All very good! Today I ordered the baked ziti. As usual it was very good. My only complaint, and it's minor, is that the red sauce is sweet. I wish they'd temper it a little more. Always worth a visit.
