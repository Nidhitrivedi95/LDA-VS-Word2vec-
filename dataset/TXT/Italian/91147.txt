EdPpsG0GujcVefs3ANGEGA I had heard good things about this place for awhile now. So, the hubby and I decided to give it a try, glad we did!
We ordered a 16" Pizza and sat down to wait for it, both the husband (cook) and wife were very friendly and made sure we were comfortable. 
Got the pizza home, and was impressed with the freshness of of the toppings and the sauce was very very tasty!
We will definitely be going back there again!
