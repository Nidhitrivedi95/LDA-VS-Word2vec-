qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA Pros: excellent location, great atmosphere right on college campus with students walking by, received friendly and prompt service, good amount of drink options, and menu items are unique
Cons: pretty small portions for the price, fairly small food menu, pretty loud with street noise, likely you are going to wait for a table, and can be difficult to find parking nearby

Went at 7pm on a Tuesday and just missed the rush. There were a good number of people waiting to get in after we were seated and really...I don't see why. I think it's a sub-par restaurant that is capitalizing on some very good real estate. I left hungry and dissatisfied with the food and don't see myself coming back anytime soon to eat. I would however come back to have drinks on the patio which I think is what most people have in mind. I think they are better suited as a bar than a restaurant.
