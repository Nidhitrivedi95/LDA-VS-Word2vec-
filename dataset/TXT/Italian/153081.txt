KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg "All pizza is good pizza, not all pizza is certified pizza", this is according to executive chef Rocco Agostino. I agree with Chef Agostino, except I have to add to his assessment: not all pizza is Pizza Libretto pizza. We've had meals in Italy, the south of France, Spain, and the pizza here is just as good, if not better because of how it's made and the creations that are developed here with local produce, locally-sourced. 

The staff here are fantastic - patient, willing to educate and share in the culinary experience without being overly present at the table. 

Pizza Libretto is definitely a must to visit if you're in the area. Reservations are not taken, but the park is nearby and very pleasant to walk through until they call your mobile to let you know a table is ready. 

Be sure to leave room for dessert - the gelato is excellent, and the espresso is a perfect compliment after a good meal.
