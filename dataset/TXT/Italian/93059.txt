Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag Happy hour all day everyday at the bar...now that's what I'm talking about! Thanks to Misti Y's fantastic review we bellied up to the bar and were very happy! $5 pints/$14 pitchers of assorted beers including Negroni and Hoegaarden!!! There is also a nice selection of not-so-small plates...we had the Insalata Mista ($5) which they so very nicely split into two plates for us without our even asking. We also had the artichoke hearts which were lovely. Our bartender was amazing. The bar was packed but she never missed a beat, she even kept our pitcher of beer in the fridge so it didn't get warm. Great experience and I will definitely be back.
