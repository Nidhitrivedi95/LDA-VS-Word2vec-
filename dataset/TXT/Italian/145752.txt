K67pkQljTFTW_P-7xUQrFw We ended up at L'academie kind of randomly, and while the food was alright it wasn't really memorable either.

We did a fondue Parmesan to start, which was apparently a fancy fried cheese stick, then a pasta and tuna dish for mains. Both were good, but very straightforward preparations with nothing really standing out. On a street packed with such excellent restaurants, I think it's tough to recommend this one.
