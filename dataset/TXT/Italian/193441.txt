pHpOuNf02eMyhdCnvMQGhg Great city place! 

Salad and bread are fresh - great creamy italian dressing.

I had the lobster ravioli and a bowl of shrimp bisque. The lobster ravioli was ehh but the shrimp bisque was excellent.

My wife enjoyed ravioli with meat sauce. Sauce tasted homemade - I found myself wanting what she ordered :)

We were promptly greeted and seated new years eve without a reservation. I think we got the only open table - lucky!

Diner for 2 with wine, soup, salad and main dish approx $45-$50

Decor: classic italian
