Dlp6bJU71-iNI_TCrVzHJw Last night got the munchies and searched on yelp to find something local to me for some good food. 

Stumbled upon Saucy Kitchen. Small little place you wouldn't even notice this place. In fact I have driven past it over the last 5 years and had no idea it was there. Its just after Cawthra rd on the lakeshore. Younger owners who were amazing and nice. The girl taking my money was nice on the eyes too  

I ordered 2 chicken on a bun sandwiches with cheese. I got mushrooms peppers and onions. 

 Sandwiches were large and the sauce was great. 
The chicken was off a bit. Had a frozen deep fried kinda feel. The mushrooms were from a can. 

Despite the not so fresh ingredients the sandwiches were great. I will come back.
