Yeah, so now that I said that.... 


This was a random last minute early lunch choice and dang... just....dang.

So first of all the owner is super friendly with his customers. This dude obviously has a sense of humor and likes his job. 

I got a Gold Dragon and it was amazing. 

I went to Italy and I feel like a crust snob. It needs to be crunchy and chewy at the same time for me to really love it. 

Dragon Fire Pizza nailed it. (Yeah for you!)  

The pizza size is just enough to look like you can't eat it all, but then somehow you magically can. Boom! It's just gone. So needless to say, I ate the whole thing myself. 

It was hot, it was fresh, it was flavorful and it was pizza. Do I really need to say more? 

Like the owner said "What American doesn't like pizza"


Just go. And don't plan to share.
