Hello Jamaar, 

I wanted to let you know about the wonderful experience my friends and I received at your restaurant the other weekend.  We chose Napa for my birthday dinner and it was such a delight.  

We had reservations and naturally, there were several members of the party that were running a few minutes late.  We early arrivers decided to wait and have a drink at the bar while the others were arriving. While there, John was a gracious bartender and so attentive.  He brought out a lovely cheese plate. I mentioned that we had not ordered the cheese plate and he stated that it was complimentary.  Minutes later, he brought out an oyster plate.  I asked him if he knew that we were dining because of my birthday and he replied, "No." I told him how appreciative and thankful we were even without knowing it was my special night.      

What great service!  I simply want to applaud your staff for a fantastic evening.  The dinner after our bar experience went just as well.
