pEFO_hU3DNA61XnIpVGkJQ So great to see the occasional NY style pizzeria pop up amid all these chi-town "pizza" impersonators... Sorry, but if you think pizza is cut in squares, or it's crust should taste like a stale saltine cracker, perhaps this isn't for you.

A great street style joint with friendly staff and always a great selection ready to go, and conveniently located right next to AMC 24. Bring a messenger bag or purse and get some Vincents to go, and avoid the concession stand. Just sayin...
