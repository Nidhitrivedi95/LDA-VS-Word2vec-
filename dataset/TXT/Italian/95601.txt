epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ For anyone visiting Cleveland, the Little Italy neighborhood is a must see. The parking is a challenge but they will valet if you don't want to brave the narrow one-way streets and park on a sidewalk in front of someone's house. There are some classic institutions here but Mia Bella is newer. We were seated on a busy Saturday night without a wait. The space is cozy and bustling. Our server was prompt and friendly but I thought it was funny after she described something she kept saying, "You know what I mean?" and waving her hands. Wine and beer selection was okay. Warm fresh bread, but you have to ask for it. We started with the calamari appetizer. Sauce was nice and it included zucchini but I found the calamari a bit tough. They did not skimp on the portion though. I ordered the veal piccata, which was alright. It looked a bit sloppy and maybe a bit too much lemon? Came with cavatelli and the sauce was good but not seasoned, pretty plain. My wife ordered the lobster ravioli and that was very good. Nice amount of filling and the bianca sauce was very tasty. I saw the lamb and wish I'd ordered that.  Anyway, it was worth a try but for the money, we'll stick with Osteria in the Warehouse District.
