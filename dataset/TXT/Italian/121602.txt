hcHaWzM5wfdAbCWs4zmmqg First time here. The room was quiet when we arrived but grew progressively noisier, too much so. A very good waitress was helpful on the menu, and the apps were ample. Two of us had a lovely shrimp risotto--full of shrimp--and we split a chocolate torte. Wine was reasonably priced, and decaf coffee actually tasted like coffee. This was a very good meal in a lovely room.
