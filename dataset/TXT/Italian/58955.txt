aqrTv6QiU0J9Sxm_T--c5g Being from the East Coast, it is very difficult to find good authentic Italian food in Arizona. My family moved here in 2001 and have been to every restaurant you could imagine. Five years ago we had  the fortunate opportunity to have dinner at La Torretta Italian Restaurant and Steak House, which was highly recommended by a friend, and I have to say the food was excellent and the service was outstanding. Since then, we have had several birthday parties as well as Christmas office parties and often will go there for lunch. This restaurant is as good if not better than any Italian restaurant in New York or Jersey.
