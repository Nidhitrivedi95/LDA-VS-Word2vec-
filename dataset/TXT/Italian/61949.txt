azE1DNVQFBU8boVbaJhj7w I was really looking forward to eating here, and it was right next door to our hotel. I booked a table for 3 at 7pm. We showed up at 7pm and the place was mostly empty. Our table was not ready, so they left us standing at the door with others to wait. It took about 15 minutes to ready the table.

I saw a great beer, Victory Golden Monkey on the menu, but alas it had been replaced with some beer called "White lightning"....ummm no thanks.

We got some starters to share. The burrata was pretty small, we each got just more than one decent bite of it...tough to share. $12 seems high for about 4 bites. We also got the Fritto Misto. It was a decent size serving, but it had 3 tiny shrimp and 3 pieces of calamari. The rest was all veg.

For entrees, our son got the gnocci with duck. It looked like the best entree of all, and he was pleased with it. My wife had the Friday special Cacciatore. The chicken was a bit over done, but the strange thing was that it came with a giant serving of polenta. Each piece of chicken was on a large square of it. It was way too much to eat on that plate. Seemed strange. I got the heritage pork chop. The server said it would be medium. It was actually med-well, and a bit past done making it a little dry. The pork was flavorful, but it showed a lack of care in the preparation. 140F is right for good pork, this was probably 150F. We got a side of zucchini and corn, and that was really good.

We finished with sorbets and ice cream.

The service is decent here, not too pushy or fake. I liked that. One last note is that this restaurant had an odd, unclean smell to it. I noted elsewhere that folks commented about flies, and sure enough, there were flies buzzing around during our meal. These all seem like they should be simple to fix, but again point to a lack of focus, which one should expect from a famous chef.
