The smell of coffee filled my senses as I paced towards the cafe, carefully savoring every detail of Tivoli Village. You can't go wrong with its exquisite European touch and sophisticated vibe but I can't help but question the quality of their fruit smoothies.

$3.75 (tax included) for a small fruit smoothie isn't bad. Plus, you can add up to 3 flavors (including mango, strawberry, blueberry, banana, pineapple etc.) with either orange juice, apple juice or regular as its base.  I opted for mango-banana with a milk base and despite it sounding really healthy, not to mention, being made at a really classy location, it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi. There was just no wow factor to it. In fact, I believe I tasted way too much banana and almost no mango. My friend had a medium strawberry-banana smoothie and she didn't seem so enthusiastic about it as well. There's hope though because our other galpal couldn't stop raving about their yogurt (with fruits and granola). I don't exactly know how much it was and I tell ya, she had nothing but good things to say about it so you might want to try that out instead. 

Nonetheless, the smoothie pulled down the rating a notch. Perhaps it could redeem itself next time I try another item on the menu. We'll see!
