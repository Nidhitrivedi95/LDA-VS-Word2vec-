     Chef, author and television personality gorgeous Giada De Laurentiis opened her very first restaurant at The Cromwell, the first standalone boutique resort on the Las Vegas Strip by Caesar Palace Group.  

     Located on the second floor of The Cromwell, overlooking one of the busiest intersections in Las Vegas, with the space's incomparable views, this is the only restaurant at The Cromwell.

     Breathtaking Views- The terrace  showcases priceless views of the Bellagio fountains, Caesars Palace and Bally's Las Vegas through seven giant remote-controlled windows wrapping around  the restaurant, allowing for a uniquely al fresco dining experience.  

     Hand-selected by Giada - GIADA is completely inspired by Chef Giada' personality and style, with its modern, yet sleek design featuring clean lines and pops of color.  Chef Giada has even included design elements such as Italian tile she has encountered throughout her worldly travels.

    The first feature guests experience and smell as they enter the bar/lounge space is a custom antipasti bar which encompasses separate pizza and bread ovens and a pasta stand where chefs will be rolling homemade pasta. Chef Giada wants the guests to experience as they were coming home from work/school and smell the aroma of food, welcoming home.  The open kitchen and bar, let you view the work from the dining area, really cool. Check out the floor tiles, those are hand picked by here and her husband from Italy. 

    Giada them is Rose Gold-Chef Giada loves rose gold. You can see it through out the kitchen and tableware, as well as the food cart. 

    Family Touches- GIADA features framed family portraits and a selection of movie posters from Chef Giada's grandfather, Dino De Laurentiis' career. Chef Giada even paid tribute to her late grandfather by naming many specialty cocktails after movies he produced, such as the Jane Fonda classic Barbarella. 

    As her 1st ever restaurant, you can see feel that it's all about her. This is her baby, and she hands on every single little detail, amazing work by this little beautiful petite chef.
