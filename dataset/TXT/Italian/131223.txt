iFZpyiDUgwldTWuW-5YW6A Yes, Osso, I will add another 3-star review to keep you firmly entrenched in 3-star review land. 

Osso is actually a good little surprise in the least organic & possibly most obnoxious area of Charlotte: The NC Music Factory/Complex/Facility.

There is solid variety on the menu. Osso has some standard Italian fare, but most of the dishes have a slight twist. I had the pumpkin tortellini. A combination of  cheese stuffed tortellini and ground sausage in a garlic & olive oil sauce. The pumpkin flavor was very slight. This was actually a light meal and the portion size didn't leave me with the desire to loosen my belt & go into a coma at the table. 

My dining companion had the tagliatelle pasta with roasted chicken. This is actually the dish I wanted to order, but I didn't want to be THAT guy, getting the same exact meal like some sort of pathetic half man incapable of adapting to the situation. However, it looked great and I did try some. Wide, flat noodles in a thick creamy tomato sauce is cold weather carb country at its best. Reasonable for the most part, the prices do skew high. 

Personally, I find the interior design to be like that of a Las Vegas hotel lobby, but that's probably due to the unfortunate location of the restaurant. Although the location is probably fortunate economically, it's near Label & other douche magnet venues. Red alligator leather benches, silk streamers, dim lighting, cowhide ceiling fans. It's like an Italian joint owned by Soulja Boy. At least there's not perfume coming out of the ventilation system.

If you happen to be meeting someone in this god-forsaken artificial construct of an area, Osso is a solid bet. In fact, it may be the best thing about the NC Music Factory.
