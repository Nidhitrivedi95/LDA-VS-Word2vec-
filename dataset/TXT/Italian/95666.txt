epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ Excellent food and great service.  We bounced in here shortly before they closed the kitchen and they stayed open for us.  I only tasted the Caesar salad and it was very good.  Friends ordered the Frutti di Mari and said it was outstanding.  I walked past the place last night on the way to Mama Santa's and it was packed.  I definitely want to go back when I am really hungry!
