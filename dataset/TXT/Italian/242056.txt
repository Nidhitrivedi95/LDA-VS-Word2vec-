uloYxyRAMesZzI99mfNInA Motorino Enoteca does have a modern and youth decoration. Loud, high energy and quite chic. I just wish the food and the services can be as high energy as the vibe!

Dropping by for a late lunch and the services was just indifferent and slow.

My Rigatoni alla Norma (Fried eggplant, light tomato sauce and Imported riotta salata) for $16 is not bad in taste but definitely overpriced. 

No bread was ever offered... wish I have that to dip it in the tomato sauce.

Maybe it just me, if I ordered rounds and rounds of drinks, my services maybe a lot better?

There are so many options of good Italian food in the area, I think I am going to skip Motorino!
