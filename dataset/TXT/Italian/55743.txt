akbZVFQzejlCJtBGZTU4dA I went here for my boyfriend and I's anniversary and we loved it for that very reason!
The prices didn't really bother us and we were celebrating.
We got a pitcher of sangria which was gorgeous.
The best tapas dishes were any involving chorizo, what a treat. And the desserts were amazing.
The decor was great, all the paintings and candles really helped add to the romantic feel. As did the dim lighting.
I really liked how the waiters left us to it, only coming to the table at appropriate times.
I don't think it is the kind of place I would go regularly, due to the prices and I feel there are too many restaurants in Edinburgh I've not tried yet!
