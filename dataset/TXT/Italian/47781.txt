8yoe08nCUpjDQ56Y9qVPKg Vienna dogs with everything on them - 3 stars - nothing to write home about. In fact too small for their $3 price.  French fries were better than most. - 4 stars. However. The owner's angry berating foul mouth cursing of a person who sat at one of the three tables who had not yet purchased a hot dog really soured the experience. This was done as he yelled past me, over my shoulder while I am at the window to order - priceless. No amount of great food or great former reputation can make up for their inhospitable unbelievably terrible bungling of this situation. Turned out others in the shack new the guy. That guy and my guests and myself will never be back to Hamburger HELL,
