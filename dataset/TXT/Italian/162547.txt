LqO_983CEmi1_X1En4mZow When we heard this restaurant was opening in downtown Glendale we were excited for a new restaurant in our side of town. Sadly I'm worried that the restaurant may not last to a 1 year anniversary if it continues this way.  

We went on a Saturday night around 7 and were promptly seated. After maybe 10 minutes a waitress came to take our drink and appetizer order. Another  waiter then introduced himself and asked for our drink orders again. We ordered drinks, appetizers and pizza and settled in to watch people playing the backyard games on the extended patio. After 45 minutes we still didn't have our appetizer.

Finally the Gm came out to tell us that the kitchen was incredible backed up and our food wouldn't be out anytime soon. At that point we opted to leave and find another place to eat. We may come try again when this restaurant has some of their problems fixed but I don't have high expectations.
