KpgPSQmQDgx3tJ6RlKVCBA Just can't say enough about what amazing service we receive at this Streets Of New York location.  The food is always amazing!  Best thin crust pizza in the valley ... hands down.  Salads are delicious and the chicken is always juicy and tasty!!  Great food is why we come, but the service is just incredible.  Caroline the General Manager is running a top notch place, and clearly sets the example for her team ... and blows it out of the water with an amazing experience EVERYTIME!!!
