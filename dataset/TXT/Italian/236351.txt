Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA Sat at the bar on a busy Monday night and ordered the balsamic vinegar roasted Carrots and Broccolini.  Good not wow!  Nicely roasted but rather simple which is nice too.  Didn't get much of the balsamic but still enjoyable.  Then the Meatball Pizza. Please keep in mind that I have been incredibly spoiled when it comes to pizza being from NY and having traveled throughout Italy.  Overall, very good and a premium product. Sauce could have a bit more Pop however the understated tomato sauce let the very delicious meatball and caramelized onion flavor sing!  Crust/dough, also very well done but not the best I have had either.  

Overall, very enjoyable and great service from Josh at the bar!  Well done guys.
