220Z1EQZwj9IsUhT9SdLiQ Great place! Servers were classy and accommodating and food came out quickly. We started with the calamari, which was amazing and fresh - but a little too small to share. We had the risotto and pizza (can't remember which one - it had artichokes on it) and both were great. House wines were a little sour. Overall a good experience... I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
