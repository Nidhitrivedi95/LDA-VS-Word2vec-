0qet57CmMA5qUm6gPFUTpg This is one of the best pizza joints in Vegas besides Dom's and you know what's even better? It closes really late. The original place is of coarse the
" Creme de la Creme" in Brooklynn. So, when I'm in either location I buy more than one. Trust me and get yourself one or maybe two? Don't waste your money on getting the just a slice. Don't be cheap and spend the dough because you're going to wish you did. It's a little expensive, there will be a wait and consider yourself lucky because if you were in Brooklynn right now you'd have to wait 2hrs. Yeah, that's what I said but that's the OG, man!!!

I'm writing this review from Los Angeles, I'm not getting the deal that they've got running right now if you yelp. If you're reading this right now get on it and ask them what that deal is all about.

"Sending pizza kisses to the creator Mr. DeMarco back in Brooklynn. They'll never make it as good as you ( always made by him personally) but it will have to do for Vegas trips.

I'll love you and your pizza till the day I die, you are the "GODFATHER of PIZZA" of all TIME! Please continue the tradition!!!
