xkiYAerQQXL25legNhVsSw Hidden behind the street-view shops in the back corner of Phillips Place, WP has graced CLT with a new concept that seems to be hitting all the right notes.

The concept: a casual Napa Valley-inspired pizza bistro and bar with Wolfgang Puck's meticulous attention to detail. Cloaked in dark, raw wood and plenty of wrought iron, it feels like a piece of Cali right here in the QC. The expansive bar greets you at the door, and the patio is very low-key and intimate. The staff is very welcoming and professional, in a casual and non-pretentious way, making for a great experience. Even as walk-ins on a Saturday night, we were seated in under 5 minutes.

Being "Pizza Bar", that's clearly the star of the menu. Deliciously crispy brick-oven creations with a gourmet touch. We started with the garlic rolls (baked in the cast iron pan they are served in...I'm starting to get into pot-baked breads, so this made my day) with chunks of roasted garlic. All pizzas are personal sized, and incredibly priced for a Puck experience. We ordered the chicken and broccoli and pepperoni pomodoro, the true test of a pizza place. We were wow-ed by the flavor and quality.

For those not as interested in pizza, there are also salads, sandwiches, and a few heavier plates (ie - steak). 

A welcome addition to the Charlotte restaurant scene that I'm sure I will be patronizing again (and again).
