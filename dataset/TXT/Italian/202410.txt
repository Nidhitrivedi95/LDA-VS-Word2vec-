q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ I really enjoy the mob inspired menu descriptions and of course the back door where they let you in. It's a fun place to go once for the novelty of it. The food is ok and so is the service. A little price forthw quality of the food but fun when they play the old movies in the background and have the great singer in the tuxedo walking around. Good place to go on a date if you are looking for a different kind of experience :-)
