E_4qAaFMthmlF4hjLjtolg I was quite pleased with this restaurant. It has undergone a massive reno since the last set up and boy are the improvements easy to see.
The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating for our rather larger group of 20. They gave us a semi-private area to host a friend's birthday and even allowed us to come in earlier and decorate-plus points for that!

Food was acceptable with me opting for the rigatoni al verde. Nothing over the top.
Others were satisfied with their meals, so no bad reports either.
All in all a good experience here.
