G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Two years ago I left a 5 star review, now it's down to a 2! Sigh. Server was gracious, if not a tad absent. Back waiter was awesome at keeping my water filled- which is why review is not a 1 star. Food...huge decline!!! Started with calamari, which includes shrimp. Lemon aioli was delish, shrimp was incredibly overlooked! No one checked on us while we ate, so didn't get a chance to tell anyone before plates were cleared away. Main entrees- risotto with scallops. Super excited as told by others this was a specialty. Had to send scallops back to kitchen, WAY undercooked. Raw and gummy. As in make you sick rAw! Server brought out new ones after meal was finished, very oily in preparation, but at least cooked. Date had spaghetti with shrimp. Same issue as app, shrimp WAY over cooked. Again, we were hungry and ate them, but not pleased. Didn't really want to express displeasure as already "complained" about one thing... But with all the options in this city, Giada's left a lot to be desired. Not sure how or why it went down hill so badly! Oh yea, when making reservation, asked for a window and said was a birthday dinner, when checked in....told Windows only for guests spending 100 or more per person even tho one window table sat empty our whole visit...and no mention of birthday either. Sigh.
