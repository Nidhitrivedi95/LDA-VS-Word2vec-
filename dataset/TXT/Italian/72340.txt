CElwRv4CtK56NljAuCwepw Thank you to all the staff at Babbo Italian Eatery!  The catered meal on Thursday, March 7 was a HIT!!!   On time and just as we ordered.  Both the Mushroom Asparagus pasta and the Pasta Rustico were scraped from the bottom of the pan.  The Spring Mix salad (my personal favorite) and Chopped Chicken salad were enjoyed by my group, and then shared with those who were lucky enough to find a little left. And add it fit into our restricted budget.  I have already been asked to put you on our list of "keepers" for future functions.
