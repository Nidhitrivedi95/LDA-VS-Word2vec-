JsUprRhyzQyukZmAhcOg0A Another great afternoon at Brio. Had friends visiting from California and we all left the table smiling. 

As soon as we entered we were greeted by the GM, got friendly hellos from the bar staff and were greeted by a server in less than a minute after finding a seat

Everyone ordered something different (food and drinks) and there were smiles all round.

CONSISTENTLY good time after time and that's why it's our favorite "go to" place.
