uuaH1UNcqcV-alT6nh42WA So disappointed! I can't believe how below par this pizza was. I ordered Spinach Pizza with added chicken for $20 and it was absolutely hands down the cheapest ingredients, most tasteless pizza experience of my life. We also had the Greek Pizza which was dry, tasteless, uninspired and absolutely nothing Greek about it! Another wasted $20 for a Large. I would also advise against the roasted chicken as it is crap. You can grab better chicken from Albertsons grab and go. The ingredients for this pizza chain are cheap, flavorlessly prepared and no signs of "love" on my pizzas! Will never order again!  It's not often I give zero stars, but my entire family was truly let down by these pizzas.
