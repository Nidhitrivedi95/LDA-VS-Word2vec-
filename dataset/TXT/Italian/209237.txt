qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg The first time I tried this place, I was looking for greek food.  My husband loves greek food and I had never tried it.  I saw the reviews, it was close to work so I figured let's give it a go!  I ordered the spanakopita entree.  His favorite dish is the "spinach pie" so I wanted to surprise him.  I decided to buy us both the entree, which came with the spanakopita, greek salad, basmati rice, and pita bread and hummis.  First, let me tell you...I LOVE IT and I am an extremely picky eater.  The spanakopita was delicious, just the right amount of flavors.  The greek salad had an amazing dressing that didn't over power the salad and brought out all of the natural flavors.  The basmati rice was to die for - the rice literally melted in my mouth and so flavorful.  The hummis was hands down the best hummis I've ever had.  Hummis was the only greek thing I've ever had and only tried store bought.  The hummis here was so yummy.  My husband said this was the best "spinach pie" he's ever had.  I talked about this place so much at work that a gal who travels frequently and who is greek stated she never had been there.  Well, she went the next night after I talked it up so much.  Her comment the next day, "I had the Lamb Gyro and it was the best Gyro I've ever had."  Kudos to the Market Grille - you guys have become my favorite food spot in Vegas.  It is a bonus that the place is clean, inviting, and the staff is beyond nice.
