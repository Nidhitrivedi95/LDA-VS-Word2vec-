vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw Couldn't wait to try the place since my kids claim it is so good . I have taken them to very good ,very pricey spots all over the U.S.   so I value their judgment since they have never steered me wrong . IDK maybe it is just this location but that is the worst representation of Italian food I have ever had the misfortune to consume . The toasted ravioli tasted like something you would get off a roller in a gas station , the calamari comes out looking like fish sticks and tasting like frozen Mrs Pauls . The bruschetta should be more than toast and chopped tomatoes,and the pizza - if this is their standard , boy , I guess people will buy anything. If the rest of the chain is the same , I just don't understand how they stay in business.
