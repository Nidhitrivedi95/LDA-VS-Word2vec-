wo6Z6VLOJejln04CsoX1WQ Prior to dropping by about a month ago, I hadn't had Il Paesano in many a year, even though I'm only about a ten minute drive away! But I was dropping someone off in Long Branch, had the house to myself that night and with a hankering for pizza and fond memories of Il Paesano from days gone by, what could go wrong? Well, the classic case of the place that you once loved not being so great anymore for one. 

I ordered my favourite pie (sundried tomato, onions and artichokes) and it was ready double-quick, which was nice...I was pretty hungry! However I must say that if it weren't for the fact that the 'za came with my own peculiar and none too common topping combination, I would swear that the thing had been sitting around for a couple of days. That's exactly how it tasted. Dry, stale and with that unfortunate cardboard-like consistency. Seriously, not too good. I don't get the raves at all. Not from Yelp, not from the guy I dropped off (I mentioned it to him later on and he said it was great).

So who knows, maybe I caught them on an off night but it was pretty dreadful. Bad enough that I'm not willing to give it another go and bad enough that I wish I hadn't gone and was left with the pleasant memories I had. They say that they've been serving since 1959 which means they must be doing something right but to me it just tasted like that's how long my pizza had been sitting for. Huge disappointment.
