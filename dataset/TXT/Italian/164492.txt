LymQXYNAomFUGOA-4llkhQ A much needed addition to the exit 23 dining options. My husband had the buffalo wing chicken. I had the side salad and penne a la vodka. All the items were great. The staff is super friendly and helpful. This new location is clean and charming. I sat at the bar while I waited for my take out order. This is a new location, so I could tell they are still getting the hang of things. But that would not deter from eating here again. PS - It didn't hurt that the young men at the take out station thought I looked young for a mom/stepmom to 5 kids. :)
