y769FA7VJOW4QQYdYlR62A Damn! Hands down one of the best Italian meals I have had in Toronto.

Known for their homemade pizza and pasta, this place is amazing. When I go to a restaurant, I tend to order meals I can't make at home. Pizza and pasta are one of those things that I tend to avoid when I go to a restaurant. Not that I don't like it, I just think I can make it better at home, but Levetto? Wow. 

I had their salsicca pizza, it was topped with sausage, roasted red pepper, black olives and fennel. It was pretty amazing. The dough had a great texture, it tasted fresh and the toppings were full. Delicious. My fiancé ordered the spaghetti carbonara and it was the most amazing thing I have ever eaten. I cried as I forked mouthfuls into my mouth. It was heavy, flavourful, and just delicious. 

If you want excellent Italian food, stop at Levetto. I can't vouch for other locations, but this one is so worth the trip. Stop scouring Yelp for another Italian place and just GO!
