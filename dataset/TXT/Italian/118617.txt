GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ Decided to stop in to satisfy my burger craving while walking the strip. Was excited to try B&B as I am a big fan of Batali & Bastianich.

Food - was mediocre 

Interior design - lack luster

Service - slow took 30 plus minutes for 2 burgers and fries.

Expected more from these 2 culinary powerhouses.
