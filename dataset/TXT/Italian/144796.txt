k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ I have eaten here a few times.  The ambiance is wonderful for a pizza place and the restaurant has become a staple of Biltmore residents.  Calamari is good...not a fan of the tiny shrimp included in the basket I would rather pay double and be served larger shrimp...but the preparation is solid.  Fungi pizza with truffle oil is very good...I wish they would offer actual truffle shavings...just a suggestion.
