6PQve0oFCLPSh4wnIzvJtg After the great bread and incredible home made salad dressings, I started thinking that I had finally found a Henderson version of Chicago Joe's (5+ star IMHO).  Well, they were about 80% of the way there.  The Mushroom Sausage Rigatoni was good...not great.  Other dish was ordered with shrimp and showed up with chicken...we complained a little but ate it...and it too was simply okay.  In short, I'm sure well go again, any place can have an off moment/day.  One other note, prices were a little high for the dishes not to be excellent.
