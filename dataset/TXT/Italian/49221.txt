When I called I asked if they do anything special for birthdays and they said they could bring out a dessert for him. I also asked if we could reserve a table outside, and they said no problem. 

I called an hour before our reservation and was told everything was good to go. When we arrived, the waiter almost said "everyone is seated back here" and I kind of had to shush him, being that it was a big surprise for my bf... So he walked us to our table, which was inside even though we reserved an outside table. 

Everything went well, the food was okay but no dessert was ever brought out. I wasn't too impressed with my first visit but I think I'd return for a casual dinner date or something.
