vxadNrpTY7OHNmWsrEpNnA Checked this place out due to seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network. Menu had a lot of choices. Food was  ahhh....okay. Desserts were worth the trip. Dessert case was overwhelming. Food came out lukewarm as if it was sitting in the back for a while which made the trip a bit disappointing and the waitress was very very slow. I would go back during a time when not so busy and maybe have a different experience. Overall, I've had better Greek food. Worth a try though.
