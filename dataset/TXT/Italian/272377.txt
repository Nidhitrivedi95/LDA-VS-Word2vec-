XVDR44P_74FmA0ANanm4CQ Not sure why ppl like this place so much. The minute my wife and I walked in we were stared at like we just cussed out the whole restaurant. Keep in mind this was our first time there. The waitress was young and hated her job. I ordered eggplant parm. The wife had a small veggie pizza. Both if us got salads. This was quite possibly the most underwhelming meal I have ever had. The price was overwhelming. Over 36.00 is what they wanted for 10.00 worth of food. As George Bush said "fool me once shame on you, you'll never fool me again."
