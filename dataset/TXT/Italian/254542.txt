VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ My sister and I stumbled on Bernard's  as we were trying to find the Ethel M's chocolate tour.   What a find!  At the time of our visit (1/29/14) they had only been open a week or so.  It wasn't very busy at all.  The food was fabulous.  I had a grilled chicken salad that had an asian flair to it.  The flavors were blended perfectly and I ate every bit!  My sister had the quiche and simply raved about it.  A true french quiche, creamy and fluffy!   We enjoyed a nice french sauvignon blanc with our meal.  My sister, who is staying in Vegas longer than we were, was able to show off her fluent french w/ the chef and make a date for her and her husband the following week when there will be sweet breads!
