L9qDnDHSnINNjePwrJz-uQ Had this place delivered on DoorDash. DD was great, but Miele's food was disgusting! Homemade sauce was a lie, both the red and Toscana. Full of corn starch, cold canned artichokes and olives, dessert not homemade. We just threw out the side pasta, even the kids wouldn't touch it. $55 for two entrees, a kiddie pasta and dessert. What a rip-off! Tasted like microwave dinners from the freezer. An insult to Italy.
