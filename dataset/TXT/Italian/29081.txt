5aRyuqJZSGp1fNXHQHMLjg Horrible Service.  I have grown to like Mama Mia's ever since my office started ordering it for our meetings.  The pizza has always been good.  Today, however, I ordered a pizza and it was delivered late (and cold).  I called the manager to inform him, and instead of simply apologizing (he never did), he blamed me for living too far away!  I can't believe it.  I haven't livved "too far away" the last 5 times I ordered.  And if I do live too far away, they shouldn't take my order and my money.  Too bad, I really did like this pizza.  Unfortunately, bad management typically precedes a drop in quality.  I have had my last slice of Mama Mia's.
