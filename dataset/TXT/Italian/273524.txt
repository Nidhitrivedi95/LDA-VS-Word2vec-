Y-hmtitiRfg7vmc3N-lTww I've been on a quest to find real pizza in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area after relocating from Chicago where there are real Italians making real pizza (mostly Naples-style - Nella, Eataly, Spaca Napoli). After visiting 10-15 pizzerie in Arizona, purporting to make Italian-style pizza, I began to think that nobody understands that more ingredients does not mean a better pizza. Finally, I stumble upon Sapori D'Italia.  I ordered the margherita (the standard by which I rate all pizza), and it was made correctly (not slices of tomato or multiple cheeses).  Everything is made fresh in house. The tomato sauce was simple, not sugary.  The dough was simple and fresh. Likewise, the mozzarella was fresh (I was told it's made in house). I can't count the number of places I've gone that insist they use fresh mozzarella, only to see shredded goo appear on my pizza.  Sapori d'Italia makes a solid pizza.

The wine list is simple, but will do the job.  Service is great - everyone was very kind and appropriately attentive.  If you sit outside, there's a gorgeous view.  The location is not convenient unless you live in Fountain Hills, but if you care about pizza and quality ingredients, this is well worth the trek. To top it off, the prices are very reasonable.  I'm really happy to have found Sapori d'Italia.  I highly recommend it!
