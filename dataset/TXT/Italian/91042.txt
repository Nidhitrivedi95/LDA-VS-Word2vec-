EDa7_YfEB2HDOyxDMbipQA Once again I call to place an order and the phone is busy. Kept trying several times and still busy. Happens EVERY SINGLE time! So we end up ordering from the Litchfield location but they don't deliver to us, so we have to pick it up. How does any business still have a busy signal????
