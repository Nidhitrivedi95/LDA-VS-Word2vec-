86W-L1l70wL-7n0lSfoY-Q Rush hour is a nice little gem in the neighborhood. My party and I all got different mains and they were all fantastic! The owner here is super friendly and attentive. The rest of the staff also offered great service. I highly recommend this place if you want to impress your date. I will be coming here often.
