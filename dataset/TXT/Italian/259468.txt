wkZ6P5fDw0G_iFRU-hzBhQ The server (who was also the bartender) was great, which is why I am giving 2 stars instead of 1. I ordered a salad that was supposed to come with dried cranberries, but there were none on it. I asked the server if it was supposed to have cranberries on it and she said it was, so she got some from the kitchen. I ordered the one veggie pizza, which I have gotten every time I've been there because it's usually really tasty. It was completely soggy except for the crust, and it disintegrated when I tried to pick it up to eat it. It also did not have a good flavor and was very bland. I ate 3/4 a piece and couldn't stomach the rest. I told the server it was too soggy and just not good at all. She had the cook make me another one and boxed it up for me. It looked better, but when I got home, (sorry to be graphic), I had the worst case of the runs and still have not recovered (over an hour later)! Definitely not going to eat the pizza they made for me to take home! Ugh! What a disappointment! I'm wondering what the sanitation grade is there.
