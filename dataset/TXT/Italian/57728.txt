aNYunG3j5zNJ4F0dQcZMyQ Excellent service & amazing food! I contacted Tomaso's a few months ago when I was searching for restaurants to host a surprise birthday dinner at. They have a few private dining rooms which is what I was looking for. Out of all of the 15+ places I contacted, this was the only one that did not have a minimum amount to reserve the room! I was shocked! Especially considering how nice this restaurant is & that smaller places were requiring $800 - $1500 minimum amounts. I worked with a lovely lady named, Vincenza, who responded to me quickly, stayed in touch throughout the weeks leading up to the party & made sure it was everything I wanted & more! All of the staff here are incredibly friendly & personable. Making all the guests laugh & feel comfortable! & of course I have to talk about the food! Amazing, homemade Italian dishes that are to die for! Thank you, Tomaso's & Vincenza for making the night so special & one that we will never forget! I will recommend you to everyone!
