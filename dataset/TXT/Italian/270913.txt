XPgurhZwZgNAwHcrpoe3Zg This place has been here for as long as I can remember.
Plus, for as long as I can remember it has been the Best!
The absolute place to go. Even my parents buy food items here.
Just like the old country. Hehee

Everything is fresh and it all tastes wonderful. Living a bit far away from it these days, but it is so worth the drive. My girlfriend bought Christmas gifts of food to ship here last year.
 Just thinking about it makes me want to go back .
It is a great place with a lot of good food. Family owned and run,which makes it even nicer.
