pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I had really high hopes for this place because I have heard so much about it. Went there for lunch and I have to say with some regret, that I was a little disappointed.  The service was great!!! We got a table within 15 min. and our food came out shortly after ordering. We ordered 3 different pizzas to get a good sampling. The food was not horrible, but after all the raving I had heard, everything was a bit average. I will definitely give them another shot, hopefully I just caught them on a bad day.
