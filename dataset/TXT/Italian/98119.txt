Ev142kLmV_ASI9iAl-KfKA While visiting Madison for a few days we decided to order pizza. This was tricky because most all the pizza places near us had bad reviews. So we picked PPE...we only had interaction with one of the employees and he was nice. The actual restaurant and dining area itself clearly needs an update/overhaul. 
Okay, now let's talk pizza....
We ordered the special which consisted of 2 medium pizzas with 2 toppings great deal but for what we saved in costs the Pizza Pit did not make up for in flavor and quality. 
The overuse of the oil made the pizza super greasy and therefor the crust was soggy and limp. I like to be able to taste the crust otherwise I should just put pizza toppings on bread. 
We also ordered a side of garlic breadsticks and were pleased that those weren't too greasy. 
I don't mind the use of oil when making pizza crust but I do mind spending money on something that I could have made myself that won't clog my arteries (note to self). 


Actual order date 8/15/14
