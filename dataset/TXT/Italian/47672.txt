It was enjoyable to watch the banter between the regulars and the workers. Yes, that's right, you get lunch and a show.

I am surprised that the guest were not as fiesty, because you either have to stand at the counter or sit at one of the two metal picnic tables outside IN THE HEAT. 

Today's order was the all beef hot dog with the works ($3.02). It is fundamentally a Chicago dog containing mustard, neon green relish, hot peppers, tomato slices, and a pickle spear. They used Vienna Hot Dogs which is a plus, but I was not completely impressed.
