1kVicFRGjgUrB6IezlTTdw Came here for lunch with a friend and a groupon. 

The place is a cute little restaurant near construction (what isn't near construction in Toronto). I wasn't expecting too much from this place considering it was from a groupon.  I was blown away.

Caprese Salad. was my starter salad. It was tasty with lots of flavor from the cheese and dressing. 

 For the main, I forgot the menu item, but it was a calamari pasta. It was creamy and it was a good portion just for lunch.

The server was also really nice and attentive. The ambiance could of been better, it is a bit empty in the restaurant. I still think this place deserves a 5/5 for their effort though. 

I would definitely come back for lunch if I'm around the area!
