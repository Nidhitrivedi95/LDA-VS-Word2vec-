UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ To not bore you with my evening too much. 
The Chandler NYPD Pizza is one of our favorite going out to eat spots.
The service is excellent,  the servers treat you very well.  The food is always top notch.
The owner even stops by to say hi.  Which is amazing because most companies couldn't care less if they're doing a good job as long as they have your  $$.  
I definitely recommend this eatery.
