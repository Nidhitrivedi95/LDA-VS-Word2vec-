Avf-PGE8lkDY1jkRSUZErw This is one of the best spots in Charlotte to get a PIE.  I am a NY transplant in charlotte and have worked in the restaurant industry my entire life with a focus on pizza and pasta.  Hawthorne's does pizza just the way it should be.  Thin, fold-able crust, flavorful sauce with a good bite of basil and just enough mozzarella.  Friday night is usually pizza night at the house and we always go to Hawthorne's.  They are consistant and have a friendly staff.

The pizza is not only the great items, the wife swears they have the best salads in town, including the balsamic vinaigrette.  

On a side note we have tried Due Amici numerous times and found them to be inconsistent and rude.   Even the Italians I knew up north had more hospitality than these guys.
