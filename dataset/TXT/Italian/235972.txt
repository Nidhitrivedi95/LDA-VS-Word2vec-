Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA We have been waiting for Federal Pizza to open. We tried it today and had the Casanova pizza, the Big Star pizza, and the wedge salad.  It was very good. Our waiter was arrogant and not much help.  We did like Zack and he told us about the restaurant and answered our questions. We will definitely go back but hope some of the wait staff are a little nicer to neighborhood folks.
