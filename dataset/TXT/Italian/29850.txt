5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g I ate here Saturday 7/28 at and feel the two star ranking of "Meh. I've experienced batter" is accurate.  I really wanted to like this place but it wasnt possible.  First the menu, I understand it is Tapas, was extremely complicated, did not flow well and was very unclear.  This was the worst menu I have ever seen.

Second, the food was below average, especially the Flank steak which had a chemically after taste.  Also the ceasear salad was almost unedible. 

However, the goodnews.  The Au gratin potatoes were simply perfect, covered in melted cheese.  Seriously the best potatoes ever.  CongratS!

Definantly not a place I will be back at, over priced for the quality of food you received, sorry Rooster.
