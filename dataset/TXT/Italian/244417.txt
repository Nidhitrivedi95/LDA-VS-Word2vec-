uTBm1BXwhdUcLJy2-IIQTA I would give Angela's 5 stars but the paper towels in the bathroom needed replacing and the caesar salad wasn't my favorite. However, the salad did grow on me (I'm not used to so many croutons- but I think that's what most people like about salads- yes?) The portions were generous and the food was delicious. I had a green pepper pizza pie (small- and it was plenty with the larger size salad- I have half the pizza left for a snack before bed!). My husband had the sausage linguine- THREE good-sized sausages! We were impressed.

Bobby was our server. He was attentive, professional and willing to laugh. Our beverages were kept full. The restaurant is entirely smoke-free (YAY!!!) AND still has a small bar. The lighting and music were perfect. Next time I may prefer sitting toward the middle instead of off to the side only because when the dessert case is opened a bright light is released (I saw many people go toward the light and they seemed to enjoy it). But nevertheless, our experience was overwhelmingly pleasant and we will be back... soon!
