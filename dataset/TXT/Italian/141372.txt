jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg I've been coming to Buca di Beppo for many years and I've always enjoyed their food.  Although I stopped coming after they removed one of my all-time favorite dishes (the tortellini).  It's hard to find any Italian restaurants that serve tortellini (especially good tortellini), so I'm still disappointed that they have not added it back to their menu since Planet Hollywood took over ownership.  However they still offer ravioli's, which are extremely good.  I also ordered the baked ziti & spaghetti.  I've had much better baked ziti, so I won't order that from here again, and I also made the mistake of ordering the plain Marmara spaghetti instead of the spaghetti with meat sauce.  Their marinara spaghetti is very bland but the spaghetti with meat sauce is much better.  
So in summary:
Ravioli- Excellent
Spaghetti with meat sauce- Great
Spaghetti with marinara- Bland, flavorless
Baked Ziti- I've had much better
Tortellini- Excellent (Please bring this dish back to the menu, PLEASE)
