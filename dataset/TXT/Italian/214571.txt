rIcEm0o8Xk413HWD4-f2QA CAFEPINO is becoming one of my favorite restaurants.

You can come here for any full sit-down meal, a quick lunch, or just enjoy a coffee and pastry. Both the indoor and outdoor seating areas are lovely. 

Everything I have tried here is great: creme brulee, the drinks (both alcoholic and non), and the pizza. The salmon topped pizza has fresh salmon on it; none of that canned business. Service is top notch; people are quick to refill drinks, check on how we're doing, and make great suggestions from the menu. 

As Victoria mentioned, there are gluten-free options, and the staff was very accommodating to any variations to the meals.
