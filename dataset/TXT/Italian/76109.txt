CS2oAjAiFrJiG2HUtKJUHQ I ordered this pizza because I wanted something that wasn't a big chain. You know try something new. And since I hadn't eaten since 1230pm I thought pizza would be the way to go. I order pizza they say 45 min. My pizza arrives an hour fifteen min later.  No call nothing. I asked for plates and napkins got nothing. The pizza lacked sauce and cheese and overall taste. The crust was so soggy I could hardly eat it. The highlight the cheesey breadsticks. $25 wasted luckily its a business expense or they'd have to refund my money
