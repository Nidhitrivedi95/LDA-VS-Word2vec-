aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA Late last I wandered into Ian's hoping to find a vegan slice. I had grabbed one there on Monday (spinach, tomatoes, roasted red pepper, penne, & cheeze on top-- deelish) but unfortunately they didn't have any available on Wednesday. I opted for a salad 'cuz I'd seen a couple good reviews and, well, why the hell not. Damn, they know how to build a salad bar. I felt a little like "that person" sitting by myself eating salad in a pizza place but it was hearty and hit the spot so whatevahhh!

Ian's does salads like this: choose small (2.50) or large (3.50) with a base of romaine, spring mix, or spinach. Add mix-ins for $.50 or 1.00 including (but not limited to): artichokes, bell peppers, candied pecans, broccoli, garbanzo beans, kalamata olives,  roasted red pepper, sunflower seeds, tomatoes, walnuts, a whole bunch of different cheeses, bacon... I got a nice lookin' pile of greens and proteins for $4.50. Pas mal.

Sometimes you're just in the mood for some good greens and, for a pizza place, Ian's really delivers (pun intended).
