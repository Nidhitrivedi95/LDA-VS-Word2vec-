iLLzOJLU4tPAN9UUHlyZiQ We have heard about this restaurant opening up last week so my husband and I decided to try it on our date night. We are so glad we did!
This beautiful restaurant is located between the ice cream shop and Chicken & Waffle, seriously, who would have thought that a restaurant like Nico Heirloom Kitchen would be located between two basic places. 
You can tell that they must have spend quite a budget on the decor, the building is beautiful. I love the colors they used and the mirrors on the right wall are just breathtaking.
We started by ordering a bottle of Rose from Spain, it was very good, more on the dry side, the way the hubby likes it! We talked, talked, talked and talked. We were sitting on the patio, the weather was just perfect that night. 
We then decided to try an appetizer, the Wood Fired Octopus. It was delicious and the portion was quite nice! The octopus was so tender, it was almost melting in your mouth. It came with a little chipotle butter, just perfect! 
We weren't too hungry so we decided to skip the main courses and go straight for the desert. We took the pistachio dessert with the honey mousse and fresh peaches. Once again, it was amazingly good.
Next time we come, we need to try some main courses. But other than that, we are glad that a nice restaurant opened up on Gilbert road, what a change !
