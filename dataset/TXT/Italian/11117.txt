0PMKMyfX1j7Nc4esk1RaMg I really didn't think this place was great at all. The pizza, which I assumed was the main attraction, wasn't even up to par with a digorno frozen pizza. The whole brick oven thing is great, and has a good effect on the crust, but my pepperoni pizza was a big letdown. I've never seen so much grease pooling on a pizza before.   

Two stars because I didn't have to pay, which was lucky for me.
