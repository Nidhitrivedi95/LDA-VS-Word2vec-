Tomato soup - taste like pasta sauce ...
House salad - no taste, barely anything  in it other than lettuce, grape tomatoes and one olive.
Italian wedding soup - it's alright

Linguine Mussle Alfredo - watery sauce, no dynamic just basil
Chicken parmigiano - it's OK

Service here is alright, servers are OK but there is a manager (guy with long black hair) who has no emotions or service skills. He doest not greet customers nor does he introduce the item he puts down.

It's a good deal if you eat a lot of soup, bread and salad. But don't expect much.

Also, the AC apparently is on but it's so hot I'm  sweating sitting waiting for my bill ....
