WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw When I walked in I was greeted by an employee who was across the large building. Employee tried to ask if I was carrying out but expected me to yell across the building. When I walked up to the register he asked if I wanted a slice. I noticed two pizzas in the window one had a very clearly used pizza holder sitting on top of the pizza. He told me that was the only pizza to order from and it had what could have been a dirty pizza pan holder on top of it which the bottom touches the tables and so on which forced me to order a small pizza instead of a slice so I didn't get a dirty pizza. Employee seemed unhappy when I pointed out the pan never should have been on top of pizza.... That is a health risk for customers placing dirty stuff on top of a pizza. I could see the pan had been used from the residue on it
