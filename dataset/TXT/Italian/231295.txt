TFftsYkRIUtdo6ZhRwJ2lQ I do love Terroni.  I love the Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo starter - delicious and perfect for sharing.  The pig that became the prosciutto was clearly massage and played Mozart every day of its life.  The Caprese salad is divine.  My favourite pasta dishes are the Spaghetti in Canna a Mare (beautiful seafood) and the Pappardelle alla Iosa (with ground sausage, button mushrooms, and peas...yum).  The C't Mang pizza is fantastic.  But this really does irk me:

"While alterations may seem easily accommodated, such requests compromise the unique characteristics of our food and the efficiency of our service.  Please respect our menu." 

This makes me want to say "fuck you - I'm the customer".  I'd like to think if I had an allergy, they'd risk their "efficiency" for me.  And god help me when I asked for some balsamic vinegar for my Caprese salad.  I'm not *allowed* to have it, nor ask for cheese if I order seafood.

I feel badly for the servers who are clearly trained to deny the customers what they want.

Growing up with a English-Canadian father and a Japanese mother born and raised in Tokyo, I watched their silly dinner custom, over and over: my dad would pour soy sauce over his bowl of white rice, and my mother would tell him "you're NOT supposed to DO that."  My dad didn't care the rice is supposed to remain pure (unless it's fried rice - *then* you can add soy), and act as a palate cleanser.  He just liked it that way.  

So I sympathise with the purist/snob when it comes to food prep, but people are bound to want food their own way.  And an establishment that understands this will respect the CUSTOMER and not the "integrity" of their own menu.

Service is sometimes good, sometimes friendly, sometimes indifferent.  Avoid peak hours; they don't take reservations.

The food is good, though.  And it's photogenic.
