Ava9H-t4scVmP7u_onh7pg The focus at Napa is quality food and California wine. Can't get a whole lot better than that. I've been for lunch and dinner. At lunch I go with either the chicken or steak salad. I love the pickled onions on the steak salad and fried onions on the chicken so it depends on what protein, and yes, what onion I'm in the mood for. 

Lots of great options at dinner and I feel the food is always fresh and the menu changes seasonally which I appreciate. You can't get bored going back time and again.
