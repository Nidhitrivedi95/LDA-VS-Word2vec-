Y9kXVlU4xPfSZvkZH6C_2Q We tried this new neighborhood place a couple nights ago. It's very plain inside & there was no one to greet us or acknowledge us.  We sat at a table in a nearly empty place for about 5 mins. Still no one came over.  I got up, found the waiter & this was a sit anywhere. He said yes. Sat back down, when he came over we told him we lived in the neighborhood & it was our first time there. Ordered the pizza  it was good, had nice thick crust, the pepperoni was small round spicy pieces, cheese good. We got 1/2 square & it had 12 squares. Way too much for 2 people. 
We will go back one more time because they serve a Buffalo classic, beef on weck. I hope it will be a little more welcoming next time!
