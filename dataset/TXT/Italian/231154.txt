TFftsYkRIUtdo6ZhRwJ2lQ I thoroughly enjoyed eating here. We went on a Friday night and the restaurant was packed. After waiting in line (and squeezed tightly against the shelves of pasta and sauces for sale) for about twenty minutes, we got  a table. I wouldn't say this was the best table in the house but at least it was a table and it wasn't right next to the door. The service was fairly fast despite how busy it was. 

The ingredients used are simple and fresh. I had the gnocchi with a simple tomato sauce. My one criticism is that I always find that every time I order this dish, it usually comes with just one fresh basil leaf. It tastes so good with basil! Give me more! I try to cut the single leaf into little pieces just so that I can enjoy the taste with several bites, rather than with just two bites. Though the gnocchi was good, I think I would have been more excited about the ravioli. My main was a standard meal. My boyfriend got the fettucine and loved it. He was also immensely pleased by the fact that her ordered a negroni to drink and it came perfectly mixed. 

Definitely a place I would go back to when I get the craving for Italian food. The prices are also fairly reasonable, considering the popularity of this spot and the quality of the food.
