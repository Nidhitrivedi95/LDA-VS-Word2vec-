5GAXZ7gJ81TSR0-Q6AMp_A Whilst running errands near the Interchange 30 plaza today (Hwy 7 and 400) I got a hunger on and following my last stop a block or to East I found myself parked near the Walmart staring at several options for lunch. After a quick scan through Yelp reviews I avoided the near by Mexican spot (thanks to Faye for the tip) and decided on some Italian comfort food compliments of Via Panini!

As my earlier Mobile tip stated, there is nothing but older Italian ladies working here, so you know whatever is to come is fantastic! Most of the crowd here (and there was a crowd) takes orders to go, but a few of us who know better, stayed and enjoyed our food hot and unwrapped.

I decided on testing the Veal sandwich waters here. As many of you know when it comes to Italian food I am fiercely loyal to those who do things great and it would take a lot for me to turn my back on my main veal squeeze - California Sandwiches. The verdict: 

Hot Peppers: Barely there
Veal: Thinner pieces but packed
Bun: Held together well
Cheese: FREE
Rapini: Slightly overcooked for my tastes

Now, I should clarify, when it comes to Veal on a bun, I am a snob so to the average person this is a fantastic sandwich, even better than many I've had at sister locations of California Sandwiches BUT by my standards it is a 3 star which is A-OK!!! 

No because gluttony loves company I followed this up with a Rice ball. I was impressed because it was formed, cooked and served to order. Nothing pre-made about this. The sauce was very tasty, albeit a touch watery. And the filling was ooy gooey and yummy! This portion of the meal gets a 4 star in my books, definitely a superior Rice Ball (oh ya and it was the size of a softball)!

This spot has a ton of lunch specials, so for now I'll leave this review at a 3 star and see how other menus items will improve their overall rating. In my honest opinion, definitely a place to come check out!

Eatcrest Out!
