OPctv7y27uf5cRvChC2sKw I'm happy to say, I enjoyed this visit to La Cucina Italiana. My first two visits were not so good. We didn't really plan on coming back, but I purchased a coupon on Restaurants.com, so we tried it again. I'm glad we did. The ambiance was so much better - music was playing, lights were toned down and our waitress was friendly. The food was much improved since the last time we came here. 

We didn't want fried calamari, so the chef sauteed it for us with a touch of garlic, lemon and pepper. The pesto sauce on my pasta had great flavor. One thing I did find odd, especially for an Italian restaurant, was that their red wine selection is very small. They only have 4 or 5 labels listed. The waitress said the had some that was not on the menu but when it came down to ordering a glass, they only had ONE selection. Everything else was sold out. At least it tasted pretty good. They do have a bigger selection of white wine and a good selection of beer.

Overall, I am really happy to see they have made some changes, and for the better. I want to support local business owners instead of the big chain restaurants. We don't have a lot to chose from in this area and I really want to see those who have taken the risk to go out on their own succeed.
