Os1NdWfFCpz9FWa4gDOLRw Been there twice. The first time I was alone so I opted to sit at the bar. Bar tender was excellent. He was pretty busy but attentive. He kept my drinks full and was helpful when ordering. I got the sausage sandwich and it was delicious. Recommend it if you like that sort of thing. 
Second visit was a Friday evening with my wife. Wait time was about 30 minutes, so not too bad. Our server wasn't the best. It took him a while to get to us and my drink was empty most of the time. He didn't know they offered Diet DP (I knew they did from my first visit). I finally had to walk to the bar to get my drink filled. Our food took a long time to get there. My wife ordered a pasta dish that we thought wasn't quite saucy enough so we asked for a bit more (which he charged us for). I got a pizza and it was amazing. We saw people who were sat after us that got their food before we did. 
So why 4 stars? We liked the food that much. We hate lowering the rating that much for one incompetent server. Next time we will sit at the bar. Almost forgot, portion sizes are quite big. Especially the salads. Highly recommended.
