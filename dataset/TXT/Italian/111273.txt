G099MT9cwtwgdsR71JLp6w This is hands down my absolute favorite restaurant in Madison. 

It is a small/cozy/romantic space and they do not accept reservations, so if you have to wait, grab a seat at the bar and have a glass of wine, trust me it's worth it. Surprisingly I've never had to wait more than about 20 or 30 minutes and that was with a larger group. 

The food is just fantastic. They change their menu up pretty frequently but they also have a few main stays. I've had a variety of their pasta dishes as well as some their meat and fish entrees and I have never been disappointed. The ingredients are always very fresh, the pasta is freshly homemade, I really can't say enough good things about it. 

I've been quite a few times and the wait staff is always superb. They all know the menu very well and have a good knowledge of wines as well and are always prepared with recommendations based on what you are looking for. 

This is as good as it gets when it comes to Italian food in Madison.
