OzRGWW5R05kC0pQyUHX3lg One of my favorite places in Little Italy. The owner is very friendly and the staff makes you feel like you're part of the family. High-quality food. Recommend that tricolor pasta, the veal Saltinboca, and quite frankly, you cannot go wrong with anything. Check it out and let me know what you think!
