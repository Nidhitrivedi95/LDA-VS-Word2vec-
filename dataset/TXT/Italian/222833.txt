SKpg4zgr83YPZ14uzhmn9g I went their with my bestie during their happy hour. The happy hour wine offerings were very good, and only $5. They also had a very good selection of wines. Kevin at the bar made a great recommendation of the Petite Syrah. 
It was beautiful yesterday,  so we sat outside and enjoyed the sunset on the patio. 
We had a delightful waitress Brigitte, who recommended the Insulate Veneziana. We both ordered it with chicken and it was outstanding. I wish I knew what is in their balsamic dressing, it was truly divine. 
This restaurant has wonderful ambiance, food, staff, and wine. I look forward to my next visit.
