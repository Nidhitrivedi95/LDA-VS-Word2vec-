GxfgOFgUhv2rfr3FXVWfCg I was a little skeptical with this place at first, it's hidden away, but once I tried their pizza, I was hooked! I keep coming back to this place time after time! 

First I just ordered a pepperoni pizza, but the manager Aaron told me to branch out and try different menu items. I tried The Godfather and it was heavenly! I ordered a side of wings, the garlic cheesy bread and also a lasagna as well. I was not disappointed! The wings were tender inside and crispy inside. The garlic bread was the right consistency and the marinara sauce that I got with it was delicious as well. The lasagna tasted familiar, but homemade. I will be back to try more types of pizza and can't wait!

The service is great, the food is great... I say if you're looking for something different (extra points because its a mom and pop owned restaurant) from your usual Pizza Hut or Papa Johns, Pizza my Dear is the way to go! Give it a try!!
