Ell98LV4Yuc0DqZwGE8gWQ Note: Rating refers to their thin crust pizza -  but I couldn't care less about anything else about the place!

I live in Chicago and have eaten pretty much all of the "brands" here and I still love, love, love LOVE Monical's thin crust pizza the most.  I would do anything for them to open one here (why not?!).  When I go home to visit, a Monical's trip is 100% part of the plan and when my P's visit me they bring it...and it's just as amazing after a 2.5 hour drive.

Maybe as Joselyn H. says, it's because I was indoctrinated into loving this pizza from the mintue I could eat solids.  Actually, no.

Perfectly cooked, super thin crust (may want to ask for them to cook it like 1 mintue longer than normal to ensure perfection).  Awesome sauce and topping of seasonings.  Love the sausage - fresh, not too big, not too spicy and definitely not manufactured looking (like Dominos or something).  Their breadsticks - while relatively plain as far as seasoning goes (just sea salt YUM) - are awesome and a staple to my order.  They also have the best "red" (French) dressing that is their own recipe...but I am a "both"er and think it's at it's best mixed with the ranch.  It's not the fanciest salad in the world, but like the simplistic breadsticks, it just works.  

Oooh and a pitcher of fountain root beer is the perfect bev.

Fast service, be ready to start eating the salad/breadsticks within minutes of ordering.  My parents say their prices have raised quite a bit, so that may be one downfall.

Gimme some Family Pleaser now!!!  Mouth watering.
