kz7O0_o6WrDQk1Kl8dKeHQ Stopped by for a business dinner , atmosphere was very nice and service was great. 
Had the NY strip , casesar salad and egg rolls 
The steak and egg rolls were amazing ! the caesar is more of a wedge salad with 3-4 big pieces of salad , needed more dressing and wasn't a typical caesar. I would say this wasn't up to par with the rest of the food. Will definitely come back to try other items on the menu.
