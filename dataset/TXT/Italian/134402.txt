IQVka-wzJmN3jw2W70aCzw I ate at this cozy little restaurant during a visit to Scottsdale.  While the place isn't glamorous from the outside the inside has a nice traditional atmosphere that provided a nice dining experience.  The food was worth while as well. I had a fettuccini dish that was pretty good and my company had the "special" that got good reviews.  All in all this restaurant provides a nice dining option for Scottsdale.
