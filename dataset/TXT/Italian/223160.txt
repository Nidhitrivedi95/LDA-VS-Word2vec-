sKrt4CMGyG8YAjxVkk4hPQ Came by yesterday for a date and it was just perfect. Although the store was not really that busy, the pastas that we ordered came at a great portion and it's quality..... Was definitely something I could not recreate at home. There was a great balance of herbs and flavour on my chicken penne and our waiter was quick to serve us water and made sure everything was amazing. 

I asked for some hot sauce for the pasta and instead we got some nice chili oil that went very well with the meal :) would definitely come back again

Price: around 15-20 per dish
