aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA Hour and a half delivery time was my option.  Offered $100 tip for something faster.   They thought I was joking.  I literally had a hundred ready to go but they wouldn't do it and thought I was joking.  They even hung up on me. I get that since it seems over the top but I was serious.  Sad face :(
