9WIn1fMJoDPqkc5HOQdybw We've been there 3 times.  The last time we were there it was packed and ended up waiting 45 minutes even with my reservation.  Everyone seemed a little over their head with the number of people.

The food is good, don't have a problem with that.  What I do have a problem with, is when I'm told by the waiter that the chef accepts NO substitutes.  Kind of "Soup nazi" like.  "I would like risotto instead of potatoes---NO! How about green beans instead of asparagus---NO!"  The waiter was apologetic, but give me a break, any other decent restaurant would be happy to make substitutions like that.  Kind of an attitude thing that the chef needs to work on.
