RynlRSJ7cXHe1ckIuxbMag Sopressata  has  great food, not the most exciting decore. Ive had their food dine in , take out and their catering. The panini are great , good sized sandwich ample portions. Good bang for your buck. The pasta is typical pasta with a good sauce. 

They have good catering . They help you put a good menu together for your event. Used their food for several family events and everyone has enjoyed. They also deliver  which is a bonus.

I would defiantly recommend you give them a try , either for the hot table or a good panini worth the visit.
