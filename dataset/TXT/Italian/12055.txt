0URIvKxCNT-AVgtdYFAX8w Since I have a number of friends who live near the Melrose district, and with my eventual moving to to an area not far from it, I've dined here several times through the years. The food has always been good - comforting, filling Italian food that is complemented nicely by the wines they offer.  Speaking of which, watch out for the wine specials - an excellent deal especially if you're dining with a group. Service can be a bit slow, especially during peak dinner hours.
