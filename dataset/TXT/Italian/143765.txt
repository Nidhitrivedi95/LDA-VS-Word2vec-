JTKzGJvIK9yuoUf-erV2qQ We just ate here with a group of six. We're from out of town and had no idea that the restaurant was closing in 20 minutes.  We we're seated on the sidewalk tables. And our waitress (her name was Amanda) didn't tell us about a last call then was very rude when our party asked to order more drinks. Amanda even went as far as lying to us saying that she told us there was a last call. She neglected to stop by our table often enough for refills and brought us our 2 pizzas but didn't show up with plates for us to eat off of for 5+ minutes. Amanda might be better off working as a greeter at Walmart. 

The margarita pizza was a bit soggy, but the barbecue pizza was pretty good. They also serve lemonade in flimsy plastic cups...
