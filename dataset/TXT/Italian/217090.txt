rWvn5iE53sHqRXPyzWc0TQ Just had Uncle Tony's for the first time & we love it!! 
Fantastic pizza! The sauce is delicious-great Italian flavor. 
The crust is the great combination of a little chewy 
yet crisp.  The veggies are fresh. Super friendly guys too. 
So happy to have a great new restaurant in our neighborhood!
