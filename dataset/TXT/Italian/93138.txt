Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag Happy Hour all day, everyday at the bar! This is the most important thing you need to know. Don't be fooled by the malicious tables calling your name. Plant your bootay at the bar and gobble up some deliciously priced pizzas, salads, appetizers and booze. ($5 Hoegaarden on tap!)

There is more than enough for a meal on the menu. We had two individual size pizzas, a salad, calamari and a glass of beer for around $30, and the only thing that slightly disappointed was the insalata mista. The dressing was pretty much oil without zing, but the greens were fresh and beautiful. The pizza dough was thin and soft. We had the veggie selection, and it did not have sauce, which my husband missed, but I didn't mind. I still thought the pizza was flavorful with Ricotta cheese. The calamari was tender and came with bonus fried shrimp and little veggies. The batter flavor was spiced nicely. An amazing value for on the Strip, especially at Crystals!

We came in about 30-minutes before closing, and we experienced no attitude. Arriving close to closing time is always a good test of service, as bad servers will glare at you or try to convince you the kitchen is closed. The bartender, who was our server, was friendly and not pushy even after the place had officially closed.

If you happen to have blown all your cash at Miu Miu or Fendi or Kiki or... wherever, sidle up to the bar and enjoy quality happy hour treats!
