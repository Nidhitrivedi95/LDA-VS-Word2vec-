cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ Chef Marc's is a great new place with a great staff, amazing food and a chef that is very passionate about what he does. It shows in every bite how much thought he puts into every dish. The prices are more than reasonable for how great the food is. Don't miss the rum cake either. As well as the special pasta with pancetta and mushrooms is delicious.
