6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA Where to start where to start? this place is AMAZING! Walking in I felt extremely welcomed by our server Tomo! she sat us down and I just knew the food was going to be amazing!

we started off with the bread and HOLY CRAP! that bread was the best bread ive ever had for real! it was nonetheless uncomparable to any other bread! it was hot out of the oven, had butter on the side! aww man i can eat that all day. We also ordered the Uni Tomato Cream pasta, Fettuccine Salmon and Ikura and the Kobe Beef Carpaccio! Everything was sooo good! I will definitely come here again and again!

Tomo was our server and she was awesome!! Her hospitality was spot on and she was always helpful and there when we needed her! I wasnt able to get the other servers name who was helping us out as well! she was awesome herself :) Thank you nakamura! Ill be back soon!
