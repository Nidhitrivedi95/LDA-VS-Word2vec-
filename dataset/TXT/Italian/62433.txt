B5hl4fV8ZmwN2bLDgdr0Fw I've had a few salads and pizzas at Bado's, and the food was very tasty every time. I'm more drawn to their wide variety of beers on draft. Also like that the alcohol content is specified. The drawbacks are that the service can be slow, even during non-busy times, and it seems a bit pricey to me. I usually get pizza delivered from down the street with similar quality but for less money, so even though I live right behind Bado's, it's not my first choice unless I want to walk somewhere and have a couple of drinks with my pizza. Last time I was there with a friend the server brought us our second round without us saying we wanted the same thing as before, which was kind of unusual and we didn't get to try something else from the extensive draft/bottle list.
