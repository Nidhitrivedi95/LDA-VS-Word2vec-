IkLAUX7lZIWqE9_YC66SRw This was one of the most unique and exceptional meals I have had in some time. 
Great service on a busy Saturday night during the phx open. 
My wife said to me and I quote " I think we just found our new favorite Italian restaurant "

I asked for some extra bread as I didn't want a drop of the sauce in my pasta dish to escape it's destiny. 

Can't wait to go back.
