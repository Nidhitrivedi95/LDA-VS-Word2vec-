vQq_sX0kSAUdT3yLW06q5A Very few local spots have impressed us like the Blind Pig. Excellent quality of food and outstanding service for a hard to beat price. Where else can you go and have dinner for 2 and a few cocktails for under $20 each. Like Cheers, "they always know your name". We have tried almost everything on the menu and it never disappoints. Our favorites are the stuffed burger charred to order stuffed with bacon and cheese. BEST burger in town.....hands down! Try the chicken taquitos or pork mole. Holy moly, to die for. Don't leave without trying the homemade keylime pie.
