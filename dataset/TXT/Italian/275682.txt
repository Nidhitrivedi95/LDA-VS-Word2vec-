Ya9FMj-MWMkeMcog06N5bQ This place sucks for so many reasons;  Slow service, even though there's barely anyone there, over priced beers, glasses that short you on the amount of beer you get, food that tastes like an average Applebee's,  but took longer to serve and add $5 to however much they would charge . The refills on soda aren't even free.  

Ive eaten  here 3 times, and everytime I've over paid. Did I mention that it takes forever even if they're not  busy?
