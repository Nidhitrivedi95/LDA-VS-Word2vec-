JI88Hdn6TM6rpYIUEk_xwA We are from the West Coast and here visiting friends who suggested the restaurant.  It was excellent; my wife had calamari & shrimp,  friends had veal & ravioli and I had lasagna.   Minestrone soup excellent,  just like Nona makes it.   We trade tastes,  as good as I have had in Italy or little Italy in New York!  Wine was great. I would recommend the restaurant to anyone who loves great, authentic Italian food. Ron 8/27/2014.
