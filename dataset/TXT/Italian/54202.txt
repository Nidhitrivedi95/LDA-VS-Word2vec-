a8OWfQTA1TqoMEu8Qk9owA We ordered 3 pizzas and one of them was so undercooked that it was inedible.  The mushrooms were canned and there was no flavor. The manager first hung up on me when I called and when I called back he had a major attitude problem and took no responsibility for the lack of quality control from his employees.  This place was a waste of money, do not waste your time, appetite, or money here. We will never order from here again.
