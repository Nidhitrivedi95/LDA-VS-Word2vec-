YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg I've been here a couple of times and really enjoy it. The short rib risotto is a must try. I also had the smoked salmon fettuccini (with homemade pasta). Very good. Had a caprice salad (special) that was outstanding - 3 different colored heirloom tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, balsamic vinegar and fresh basil. The fresh focaccia and artisan bread (puffy hollow bread) before the meal are nice too. Great atmosphere.  Excellent option to get off the Strip.
