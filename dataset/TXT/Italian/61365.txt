aYjZc-3aVbPIPaJgGiUK_A The girlfriend and I came here for a drink on St. Patrick's Day on a whim and loved the place.  Our bartender was friendly, helpful, and a very good mixologist.  He made a delicious interpretation of a gin press that made me regret my Hopalicious!  I'd like to come back some time for a full meal.
