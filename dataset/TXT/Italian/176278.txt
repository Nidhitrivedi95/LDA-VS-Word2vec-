NhMEvtG8TA6AnCLFC63v_A I don't understand all the bad reviews.  The food was delicious and the staff was very attentive.  Our waiter, Steve was very personable and attentive.  Annie came out and stopped by every table to say hello and ask how everyone was doing.   There appeared to be some regulars in there because the staff recognized them. 
 
We almost didn't go because of the reviews but several people we know told us they liked it a lot and the RJ's food critic gave it an "A" review so we took a chance and I'm sure glad we did!  It's our new favorite restaurant.  

My husband had the fettuccini and said it was very good.  I had the chicken marsala and it was good also.  The rice ball was great, the salad very good and the cannoli I had was one of the best that I have had in Vegas.   My husband said the tiramisu was very good.  I loved their red sauce because it was similar to my family's recipe.  

The restaurant is very quaint (about 12 tables) and almost  1/2 were occupied.  Everyone was seated promptly and no one waited long to be served as some of the reviewers complained about.  

She allows dogs out on the patio and has events to help them which is another reason I would patronize her restaurant.  I am an animal lover and like the fact she does that.  I also want to bring my dog when it warms up.  The patio does have a fireplace.  

I would definitely recommend Annies.  Take a chance and go, you will be glad you did.  We were!
