pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Been there many times. I love the bread and the crust of the pizza. The flavor and the unique topping wins my heart every time. 
Dislike the wait time though. The longest record I ever waited was 3 hours. Thank goodness for the Bar Bianco next door to be my waiting shelter. 
Will go again when the weather is not too warm and I don't mind waiting outside.
