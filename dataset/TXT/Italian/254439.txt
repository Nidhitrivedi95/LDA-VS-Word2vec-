vWnCZVeggUGMd_cXlBohwQ Family owned, perfectly baked authentic Chicago style pizza. Crust was perfect, Italian sausage absolutely some of the best I've eaten anywhere on a pizza. When you walk in there's a very good chance you'll be served by the Rosati family personally. Look for the sign stating original valley owners as there are franchise restaurants with the family name but aren't family owned. This review is for the McQueen X Ray Rd location.
