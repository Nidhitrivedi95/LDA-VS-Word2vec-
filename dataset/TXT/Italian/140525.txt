JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw Great atmosphere on fourth street. Have been wanting to try it out but could never get in. Did it on open table and was very happy with the service. They sat us 15 minutes early the drinks came fast after the order. The place was very busy because of the browns gladiator and indians game downtown at once. Food was very well prepared and hot. I should have only did the half order on my pasta there was plenty of leftovers. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because my wife's pasta was just good not amazing like my veal sausage pasta. I will be back again.
