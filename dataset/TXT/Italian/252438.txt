VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Went to celebrate a birthday with a group of 13 last night and when we arrived with 3 bottles of wine to share - we found out there was no cork fee and we couldn't. We asked to speak with a manager and got told by our waiter that he asked and the manager said no. Again we said for this quality of a place, you've got to be kidding! My husband asked for him to speak to us directly. He came out and spoke to us an offer a cork fee of $50 a bottle. It was nice he eventually came to. Then the meals came - food was extremely salty matter of fact I ordered filet mignon and didn't eat half of it! Not worth the price of $48 when outback is better. One plate got sent back for food being cold. Very disappointing.
