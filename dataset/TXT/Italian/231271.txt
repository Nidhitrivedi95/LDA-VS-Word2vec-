My boyfriend took me here for my birthday, and the food was absolutely amazing! I ordered the wild boar pappardelle and my tongue and mouth were singing. Oh my god it was so good, and the portions were so awesome.

Heck yeah I'd come back!

The only thing is we went on a Monday night, and this place was packed. The tables were super scrunched together, but they did make it work. The only thing is that due to the large crowd, it wasn't as romantic as I would have liked for a birthday dinner, but you know, you can't have it all!

Oh, I almost forgot! Their tea was extremely weak. The menu made it sound like it would be very flavorful, but I didn't like it at all. They should definitely add more tea leaves to the bag or something. Also, the tea pot was horribly designed. You couldn't even pour the tea into the cup because the handle was scalding hot. I had to take my napkin to pour it, and even then it was still hot. Also, the tea was on the back of the dessert menu. I didn't even realize there was a back except by chance. Also, if we didn't ask to see the dessert menu, we wouldn't have even seen that there was tea available. My personal suggestion is that they should improve their tea, and if the customers say they don't want dessert, the waiter should offer tea. There's huge potential here!
