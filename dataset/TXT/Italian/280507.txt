YOD9dXrnpu8HTRILpF0onw I was in the mood for something savory so I decided to check out Times Square.
 
I went with the $10 cheese ravioli and although it was good, it was really nothing special. It was fresh and tasted so, but I've definitely had better Italian food. It came with garlic bread that was a tad too garlic-y for my taste, but the bread was soft and fresh.

I was definitely underwhelmed, but I would dine there again if I ever get the itch for Italian since it's right down the street.
