UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ I love Floridinos. Food is good and service is great every time we go. To the reviewer talking about fake reviews.. sorry but they aren't! I have had QT pizza and as far as gas stations go it's the best but it isn't better than Floridinos. Besides pizza though this place has some other great dishes like the baked spaghetti and pizza muffins. Also, the bread that comes with the pasta is always delicious!
