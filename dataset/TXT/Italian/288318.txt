ZPAnqqAKLjg9uCN6Rk1lfg Stopped into this new place last night. Wow. I had been sad noticing quality slipping at my previous favorite place in market square and then this magical place appeared. I had these insane tasty little potato fritters with just the right amount of cheese inside. They were great. Not sure what they were called but I'm glad I tried them. Then I had Margarita pizza that was way better than I had even hoped. My friend with me had a Marinara Pizza ( no cheese ) which I thought was crazy until I tried it and then saw the wisdom there. It was made with sauce and garlic and was phenomenal. They are brand new but the food seems already perfect and they seem to know what they are doing really well. High recommend for anyone who loves the oven fired pizza.
