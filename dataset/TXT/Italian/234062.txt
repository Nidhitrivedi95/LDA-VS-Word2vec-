tpGr6-jVv_dFSnDGcVL3rw So I ordered a very large order about a month ago which was completely screwed up. I called and talked to the manager who promised to make up for it. So I ordered last night and talked with Alexis who was very kind and professional. Done took my order down accurately and repeated it back. About 5 min later Mike the GM called me back to dig further into what happened. I explained the situation and he was very professional and sincere and got my order ready for me AND had my order delivered. With Alexis and Mike my order showed up 100% accurate and 100% delicious! My family and I were VERY happy! Thank you to the 2 kind, sincere and professional hospitality professionals that helped me!!
