Da0c8BkSx0gxk5HwoZJiYQ What can I say?  This was delicious!  I had an early dinner of Penna alla Vodka with some chicken thrown in. Everything was fabulous from the salad to the main dish. And the bread and dipping sauce....oh heaven shall be filled with that mixture!  Malory was my server, and she was as delightful as the meal!  She was genuinely giddy over how much I enjoyed the food. It was like we celebrated together. I'd come back here in a heartbeat!
