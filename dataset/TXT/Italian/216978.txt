RwJGNFavhB1u0zzCDqRxGw Just ordered from here for the first time and very pleased with our meal. Fast friendly service, fresh ingredients and delicious thin crust. We ordered a couple of meat lovers pizzas but will try other combinations in the future. Definitely will try dining in as well - the menu looks inviting .
