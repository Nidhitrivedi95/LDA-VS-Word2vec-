6xHAfmlqlpjm9retP20woQ Ordered Jimmy John's for lunch. Man! They are not "freaky fast" like they used to be. 

So, I sign for my food 35 minutes after placing my order, which is substantially longer than normal. I pick up the bag and can immediately tell my bag of chips is not in the sandwich bag.

Me: "There are supposed to be chips."
Delivery guy: "They should be in there."

*I open the bag and show him*

Me: "Nope, not in there."
DG: "Do you want me to bring them back?"
Me: "Well, yeah."
DG: "Okay, but it's gonna be a while."

An entire additional hour and the chips are finally delivered. Sadly this is not unusual and that's why I rarely order from JJ's. Oh, and it was a good thing I had my own straw because that was missing too.

I quit ordering from them because this happens so frequently to myself as well as my co-workers. Makes me wonder if the owner of this particular JJ's has them do this on purpose because they always ask if you want them to come back with chips. Of course you do, you paid for them.

And the fact that it took an additional hour is ridiculous. If you mess up an order it should be a priority to fix it quickly. This JJ's is 1 mile from my work. That shouldn't take an hour, especially on a Sunday when traffic is lighter.

For those that might wonder why I ordered from them again when I clearly have not been happy with service, it is only because it is a Sunday, I was working alone so I couldn't leave to pick up food and all the places I normally order lunch from are closed on Sundays.  Best believe I will be ordering pizza or making sure I bring a lunch with me in the future.  I will not be ordering or entering any Jimmy Johns establishment again.
