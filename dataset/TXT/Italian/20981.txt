366FaRQ1MWEHBhaEKTcriQ Ech!  Why do so many people rave about this place?!  It's just OK.  Not horrible, but slightly above average.  if you like very sweet tomato sauce on your pizza then you may like Spinatos.  I wanted to like this pizza, in fact I've ordered it twice just to be sure I wasn't crazy.  

I love Chicago style pizza, but I also love any thin crust pizza, including NY style... basically I just love pizza, so I'm not biased in anyway.  I just think the sauce is very strange tasting!  

I've heard the meatball sub is good, but I'm just not diggin' the tomato sauce.  The first piece may be OK, but the sauce and it's odd sweetness really loses me.
