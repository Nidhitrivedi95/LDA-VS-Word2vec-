oH6QAuoTLFaX97oqqpLTMg My boyfriend and I discovered this place only a few months ago, and have been getting it delivered at least once a week (which is terrible for my diet. Whoops.) They are a little curt on the phone at times, but efficient, quick, and remember to ask for all the information. I lived in NY for a while, and this is the only place I've found in Southern California or Vegas that's pizza truly tastes like NY style pizza. I recommend getting just cheese. 

I get the Baked Ravioli dinner pretty much every time now. It's delicious, has plenty of pasta, and has more cheese on the top then I know what to do with. I also recommend the mozzarella sticks and wings (medium and BBQ are delicious!). The pizghetti had a strange texture, and was a little too bizarre for me. 

The reason I'm actually going through the trouble of writing a review is because last time they came, they forgot to bring me the side salad with the ravioli. It wasn't a big deal, so I didn't call them up about it. They had delivered everything perfectly every other time, so I was going to let it slide with no hard feelings. 

While my boyfriend and I were finishing up the meal, there was a knock at the door. The same delivery guy had come back with the salad and an apology. Most places would have either 1) not noticed 2) noticed but not done anything in the hopes that we would let it slide or 3) sent another salad, but with a different guy because the original one felt awkward about it. 

It was the perfect solution, and really showed us that they care about customer service and satisfaction. We will absolutely continue our once a week "diet."
