YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg Amazing experience! It is now one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Atmosphere was fantastic, elegant and dark. Great music selection as well. The service was also spectacular especially from the GM of the restaurant. We were given a very special and genuine dining experience especially since we are Vegans. The GM personally put his ideas and his heart into our unbelievably delicious meal. I'm very pleased and will be back soon. I'm already making plans for my next visit. Thanks Panevino!
