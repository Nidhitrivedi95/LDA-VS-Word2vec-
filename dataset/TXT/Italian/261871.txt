wSpUTl9Bho2WRo9C5p_-Pg Cool spot in a still developing complex. Eclectic playlist including Peter Murphy's 'Cuts You Up' - which I don't think I've ever heard in a restaurant, friendly staff and great flavors atop a crispy thin crust pie - ready in just a few minutes on this Monday night at 7pm. Nice little Caprese skewer app to start and the Supreme pie washed down with a bottle of Sierra Nevada. Great place for a quick, flavorful pizza across from the new Home2 by Hilton on Queen Creek and Dobson.
