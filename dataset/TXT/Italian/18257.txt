2NiBvT5zL272IRcxru_x9A We had high hopes to have a nice dinner here before a movie. We had a reservation, but our table was not ready.  We eventually sat down and our waitress was very nice, but the service was terrible. We ordered olives right away, plus a salad and entrees. We had to ask about our olives and then everything came out all at once. Also, we ordered a glass of wine with our meal and it arrived as we were finishing.
