Tl9h-Qev_OymQ7XB1kbKnw So it looks like this company removed itself from yelp and re-added itself to remove the negative reviews from others. 

Wow, what a crappy tactic!

So I'll summarize: For four of us (two adults, two children) the bill came to $84! For pizza! Wayyyy overpriced, the "home-made" meatballs, which we were told the owner's grandmother makes by hand, had 3 small bones in them. Our calzones were around $25 each! No way, never again. The pizza sauce was bland and the dough/crust not flavorful. Very disappointing, and more so considering this behavior! At least the reviews are archived.
