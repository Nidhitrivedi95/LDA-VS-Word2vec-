pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I know that everyone raves about Pizzeria Bianco...  so I waited my 2-hour wait to get a table with friends and try the pizza.  To be honest - NOT worth the wait.  The pizza was fine, nothing wrong with it at all - but not worth a 2 hour wait.  Everything about this place was "fine" in my book, but absolutely not exceptional or worth the long wait, loud space and slow order time for the pizza to arrive at the table.
