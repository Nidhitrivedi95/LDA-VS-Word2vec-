fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I was amazed by this place! I went with a large group and everyone loved their dish. I could not believe that one restaurant could rock both Asia and Italian cuisine. They have homemade desserts too. The prices were amazingly low, for what was served. I have been telling everyone about this place! Make reservations - it gets filled up. It is Phoenix' best secret eatery!
