JBrBsKpw0bbXK5nlrXVOYQ I've been coming to this place since I was a little girl. You can't beat the lunch specials here!! The only thing they are missing is a patio and happy hour! 

Try the lasagna and the manicotti! This lasagna is seriously one of the best I've ever had!!! I don't know what it is about the simple garden salad here but it's amazing!! I also love the antipasti salad!! The garlic parmesan bread that they give out with the meals is mouthwatering and worth going in just for that alone!  The menu is pretty large so you have several options to feed your craving. The portions are great for sharing but also great for one person who's decently hungry. 

The building has a small bar that can seat about 7 but the dining area is split in two which is great if you want to have a large party. They have both booths and tables which are both very comfortable. You can always count on seeing off duty officers or local firefighters enjoying a meal here (always makes me feel safe).

The staff here is always friendly and I always have a enjoyable visit.
