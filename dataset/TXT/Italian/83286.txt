DIdvV0HZUMZWiYg4OXyGJg GREAT pizza and hoagies.  You know the food is good when it takes a while to get through to order  - our favorites are traditional pizza with pepp/mush/banana peppers and the yinzer eye-talian hoagie.  I remember getting pizza here when I was a kid... the quality hasn't changed a bit.  We usually order take out and have rarely had trouble with the timing -  I do wish they'd update the dining room a bit, but it's clean and comfortable as it is.  
It is a little pricey, but I'd rather support this local business than a chain. I do appreciate that he hires local kids... you can tell they have fun working there and are learning a bit about a good work ethic.  
Well done, Nick!  Keep up the good work!
