wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw The cucumber lemonade should get 5 stars on their own. I love lemonade and I love cucumbers. Amazingness in my mouth! 
We had come for breakfast and now there wasn't much on their breakfast menu it's more of a place to come for obviously wine and bruschetta which is fine but good god I love the cucumber lemonade so much more than any other lemonade I've tried elsewhere next to hot dog on a stick(I know definitely now what you expected me to say right? Lol) anyhow i have yet to try the rest of the stuff here so we will add more next time we go!
