H9QvGwjFPnUULD0y8i7FkQ There aren't too many good local places in the Charlotte area but this place is the bomb! As a Patriots fan I loved the decor but the food was the real MVP. On Monday's and Tuesday's they have 10 wings for $5 and you sure do get your money's worth, the wings are HUGE and better quality than any "wing place". Since they were only $5 for 10 we got 2 orders so we could try 2 flavors(can't split flavors on special night, not sure about other nights), we tried the Thai chili and the house. The house was so different from anything I've ever tried, they're combo of 4 different flavors and they were spectacular. I'm not a huge wing person and it's not often I'm impressed with wings, so that says something. However, my fiancé on the other hand is a damn wing connoisseur and he said the house were the best wings he's ever had. Also they make all their dressings and the ranch is top notch. We also got a small house pizza (don't judge us, we didn't finish it or the wings). It has an olive oil base with feta, mozzarella, and of course prosciutto. Needless to say we will definitely be retuning and have cut ties with other wing places lol! Great food, awesome prices and lots of left overs for tomorrow, what's not to like about this place!
