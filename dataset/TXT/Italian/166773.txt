Mg2woU0AFrHGlp7qmlIHXA I went there with family and ordered fettucini alfredo. It was the best fettucini alfredo I've ever tasted! The staff was nice, the food was good (tasted a bit of pizza too!) and the atmosphere was romantic. The only downside was that the restaurant was a bit small, but it's perfect for the small romantic atmosphere.
