3qrfY-XCUKVyrO5T6GskqA Ordered the Korean beef noodle dish to go ($9.30). 

-Literally waited for 20 minutes to get the food.
-When I opened the bowl back in the office, it filled less than half of the bowl (Looks like they only used the equivalent of 1 ramen instant noodle pack).
-There was no beef. The image of the dish clearly depicts pieces of beef in the bowl, same as the written description.

Will not ever go there again, don't want to get swindled again.
