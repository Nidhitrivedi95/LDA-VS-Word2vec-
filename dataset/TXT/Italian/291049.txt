zY6f_cFY8HTI3hLlJj3SOg Who knew that this tiny place would serve up some yummy pizzas?  So happy we found this neighborhood pizzeria.  

Thanks to the yelper pics I ordered the Fresca pizza. I loved the fresh basil and giant mozzarella moons and tomatoes which laid perfectly on top of a light thin tasty crust. I would however request easy-sauce next time.

Spaghetti was tasty-ask for some Parm cheese if you get it To-Go otherwise they may forget to include it-like they did mine. Calamari fell short of flavor and I wouldn't order it again-presentation was lacking-no golden color looked like it wasn't cooked enough maybe? Caesar salad was okay.  Overall, not bad for a quick family meal if you don't have time to cook.
