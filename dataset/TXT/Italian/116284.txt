GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA man, i'm suprised at all these low ratings by the yelpers. i really enjoyed my meal here at b&b. having never been to new york, i knew this is the closest i can get to batali's flagship restaurant, babbo. i went to b&b probably 4 months after it opened, so i am assuming mario batali frequented the kitchen to check on the food. (funny thing is i met mario batali the week before the restaurant opened inside bouchon, i thought he hated all things french)

anyways, when i opened up the menu, i thought i was reading the babbo cookbook i have at home. mint love letters, francobolli, duck liver ravioli, lifeguard calamari, brasato barolo, and lamb's tongue were some of the familiar dishes i saw on the menu. 

we went with:

mint love letters - the lamb and mint went very well together, classic
beef cheek and duck liver ravioli- heavy, but i love things that a rich and fatty like this
sicilian calamari lifeguard style- the calamari was the most tender calamari i have ever eaten. (it says in the cookbook you cook it for 2 minutes or for an hour to ge that tenderness)

i have to say i love mario batali's style of cooking. bold and unrestrained. he really likes to season his food until it hits that border line of too salty, spicy, etc. i love it. 

music that was playing in the background was queen and some other rockbands. i'm guessing these are his favorite bands, because i can't imagine a fine dining restaurant with this kind of music.
