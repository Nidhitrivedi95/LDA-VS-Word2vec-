tIiiq23utFKTs1At2bVD6w This is a neat little Italian restaurant that my boyfriend's parents frequent all the time.  It seems like the must have dish is the homemade crab raviolis with lobster cream sauce. My boyfriend had this dish and he literally licked the plate off.  He hugely enjoyed it and didn't share with anyone.  I had the chicken marsala with pasta which was quite good.  However, the dessert was a disappointment. We ordered the tiramisu for dessert and thought it looked a little sad on the plate.  It seemed like it was the last scoop of whatever they had left for the night and the chef placed tons of cream on top to make it look decent to serve. Yikes!  They should have told us that they were out of it and offer us other dessert options.  

Our server was such a great Southern gentleman with a good sense a humor who kept us entertained with his sparkly personality. Gold star for him.
