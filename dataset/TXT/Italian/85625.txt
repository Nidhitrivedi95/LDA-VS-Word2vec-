dQ4pxV6AxBaD3X4gssg5zg Came in for happy hour. Wow, this place is amazing! We had calamari (my fave),  wings, procuitto, mozzarella salad, and eggplant parmigiana. The food was fresh, well prepared and very tasty, and the portions were a good size. There were 2 of us and we couldn't even come close to finishing it all! It's a family owned and operated place and the service was exceptional, and very friendly. They had a really great looking menu with some $10 dinners but we couldn't get past the apps! We will be back soon and this place will be on our regular rotation now.
