7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ The ahi tuna sandwich I wrote about in my last review is no longer offered here.  
However, I still really enjoy this place even if they're so busy. 

I recently tried 3 of their cupcakes and were surprised that they were so good. Their cupcakes look like the cupcakes that just look good but don't necessarily taste good. I was wrong. They were DELICIOUS. I also tried their key lime pie, which had a little too much whipped topping for my taste but still good. Lastly, I had a bite of the chocolate hazelnut silk pie, and oh my is it rich and satisfying!
