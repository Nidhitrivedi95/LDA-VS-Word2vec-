BX4HheOcR7sdGLvFrBXy2A I like Tony's. I've had authentic pizza (straight from Italy) and this didn't seem to be too far off. I usually opt for a tomato and spinach combination (gotta get the greens in there somewhere), and I've never been disappointed. The service is also pretty good--the guys (I've never seen a female employee) are usually friendly and the orders are made in a timely manner. It's minutes from my job and the only reason I don't frequent here more often is because I can't eat pizza everyday. But you're alright in my book Tony. You're alright.
