pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ I love the food at lombardi's...so yummy!..both the brunch and lunch menu are wonderful..risotto is so creamy and the gnocchi is to die for...they also offer bottomless mimosas with the brunch menu...they offered it before with the lunch menu..but i guess they're not doing that anymore..which really sucks..but anyways, i would give 5 stars if it weren't for the disgustingly rude host..i'm not sure if he's the manager or the host..but right when you walk in, it seems like he doesn't even want to help you..i love the waiters though, everyone else is so sweet and they offer great service...but the dude in the front has a stick up his ass...he's always there whenever we've gone, so he might be the manager...kinda sucks..but definitely go for the food...and just try to avoid the dude in the front..
