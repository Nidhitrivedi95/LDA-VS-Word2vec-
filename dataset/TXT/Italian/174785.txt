ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw Ok I want to give it 3-star, but will give it 4 because its a local chain. 

Nice big booths, which can fit large parties that normally would have to get split up or wait for a table to free up.

Their thin crust pizza is cracker thin - I couldn't decide if I liked the crust that thin...

We tried their: salad, pasta, pizza, and pazooki. 

Pizza: numero uno..meh. their sproccoli was a bit more interesting.
Can't remember which salad we got, but it was nicely dressed and had a lot going on.
Their pasta (think we got the alfredo) - was also pretty tasty. 

their drinks are the size of your head - if NYC's major saw the size of these glasses, him and his soda tax would have a field day.

Staff is young, probably all local college students, but all very friendly.

would i come back? yes - but there are just so many other restaurants to try first though in the area.
