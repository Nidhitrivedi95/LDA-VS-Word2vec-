PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ Jack was an awesome host and all servers were friendly and attentive.  The beer selection was very good.  I ordered off the daily special board and was served an exceptional 20oz. Bone in rib eye.   I very much enjoyed the entire experience.  Thank you State Farm Agent Cody Clark for the recommendation!  We came from our hotel on the strip and loved it!
