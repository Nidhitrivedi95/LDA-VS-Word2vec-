MhZvKpYKGsKuz-n7Bc7aEw My boyfriend and I stumbled across Ferri's by accident when all the other nearby restaurants were busy, but it was actually a really good find!
The food is Italian, and theres lots of choice for nice pastas and pizza toppings. The gnocchi (potato dumplings) are fantastic and the starter of asparagus and egg was to die for! 
Although from the outside Ferri's doesnt look very impressive, inside it's cute and homely, with very chatty waiters and enough wee corners to sit in if you are looking for a romantic meal. The menu is pretty much as you would expect from an italian restaurant but it's really tasty and the atmosphere is really nice. 
I recommend giving Ferri's a try. I think it gets lost in among the bigger restaurants at the top of Leith Walk but it's definitly a wee hidden gem. It's more suited to those wanting a quiet romantic meal, or a good chat as there is no loud music playing, and the waiters fall over themselves to make sure you have a good dining experience. Lovely!
