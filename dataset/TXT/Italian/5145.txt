_OAtYMzu_oOf2-HGVhrHVQ Easily one of my go-to restaurants nearby! I come here on Fridays for my family of boys and stick with the large pizza and 20 wings special... despite it being busy the employees always make it a point to greet me as soon as I come to the counter. The pizza is great!! Awesome wings and I always come in and get a smile. During the week they have $2.00 mugs of beer... can you believe that?!?! Have to try more of their pastas, i tried the chicken parmesan once and it was to die for and at a great price. :-)
