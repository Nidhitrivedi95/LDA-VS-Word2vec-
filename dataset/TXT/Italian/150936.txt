klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw OMG their burgers.... ARE TO DIE FOR. It's hands down the best burger I've ever had. They're weird about reservations and stuff but it's because it gets busy at night. I LOVE THE FOOD HERE. It's right in the encore hotel so it's super convenient. Try this place. it's SOOO GOOD. I recommend it. The seats are couches and they have a nice bar. I really enjoyed my dining experience here. I am going back every time I come to Vegas.
