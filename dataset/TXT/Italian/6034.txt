_VHU9KZUHRLp2Hc2JOKlYg Dinner last night was great! Our first time to Cioppino and we will be back. Very good atmosphere and attention to detail by the wait staff. We had read previous reviews and decided to start our meal with the lobster risotto and a Caesar salad. My wife loves the risotto as did I but I could have used a pinch of salt to make the lobster pop. The Caesar was excellent and was dressed perfectly. My wife had the pork chop with Brussels sprouts and I had the lamb for our entrees and once again we both came away impressed. The pork chop was seasoned and cooked perfectly and was very juicy, the lamb was excellent as well and I would order it again. I enjoyed the presentation but didn't feel the lentils added to the dish, and would have preferred a more traditional starch. Pumpkin cheesecake was good but the star of the dish for me was the cranberry compote, great contrast to the sweet of the cheesecake. 

Updates cocktail menu was perfect for the season and my wife highly suggests the jack-o-tini
