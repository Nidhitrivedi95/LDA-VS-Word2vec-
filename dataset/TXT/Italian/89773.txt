e2jGy1NTv4mOms4wquE_lg To be honest we were looking for a specific type of pizza and this restaurant had it! We ordered the Mélanzane Pizza  (Sauce<U+200B> tomate, fromage, aubergines grillées, ail, ricotta et piments rouges piquants) and requested only ricotta cheese to keep it light.  Sandhu kindly accommodated the modification and the delivery was fast. 
The banana peppers gave the flavors a nice heat. The dough is very good and probably to most people's taste though we'd prefer thinner crust if we had that option. 
Oh, and fantastic tiramisu !
