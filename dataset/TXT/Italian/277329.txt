YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw Joined my family this morning for brunch over at Bottiglia ... the hostess were very kind and ready to seat our big party right away. At first sight the decor was beautiful , it was very bright and welcoming ! The place was calm and quiet the whole time we were there. Alicia was our server and she was very kind and friendly to us and the children in our group. She made sure we had everything we needed. The food, was amazing. I had a panini and I enjoyed it very much. It was very filling. I tried some of the hash browns as well, which were so good! Our whole table ordered them and let's just say that they were great! I had a wonderful overall time here and I would recommend it to anyone .
