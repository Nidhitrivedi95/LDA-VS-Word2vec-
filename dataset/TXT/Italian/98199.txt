eVv6cnwhabK8ig5Di2hXQQ My son loves this place because the food is good and the servers are the cutest young ladies working in Ahwatukee. 
The pizza and salads are very good and the wine list is nice.  I love the greek pizza.
It has a community feel to it and is clean and friendly. 
The parking is very good and if you just want to hang out at the small bar, it is a good place to casually visit with others there.
