v3AS5LGeV2Si4nOHZ7lgxQ Nickel used to be amazing.  I don't know if its new management, new cooks, or who is to blame, but the pizza quality has seriously fallen off.  Gave it my last go after a few mediocre pies.  The prices no longer justify the ends.  The wings, shrimp po boy (although not authentic), and fried cod sandwich are pretty darn good.  Nothing to rave about but good enough for a late night order.  The menu is very diverse although I am not sure about the quality of the other items.
