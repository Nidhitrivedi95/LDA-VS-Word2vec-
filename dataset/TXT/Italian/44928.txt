8dSIAoz_UphMGpZr_uMing Great neighborhood Chicago pizza pub. Conveniently located within walking distance of several major 300+ unit apartment villages in the southwest neighborhood of Enterprise. Most Mountain's Edgies can count on the Chicago pie being better than the coupon stuffing national chain delivery places, but hey if you want Heatza-Phut, Little Pizza! Pizza!, or that Papa more power to you. This restaurant offers dine-in, pickup, and delivery. 

The pub has several great beers on tap and a selection of drinkable wines and huge televisions playing all manner of popular sporting events. Seating is limited because of the immense popularity of the business from surrounding renters looking for a chill sports bar with good food. This location is conveniently located within Smith's Shopping Center at the corner of Rainbow and Windmill and is a big draw for the hugely popular neighborhood.

The pizza comes in several delicious varieties: thin, double-dough, pan, and Chicago style deep dish and even calzone. Pastas, wings, and salads available.

Stable, friendly crew with charisma and charm. Only minor drawbacks: wayyyyy busy , nicely crowded because of popularity ( brainstorm: buy out the comic book store next door and expand!! #dreamingon ) , no hard alcohol (#drats), not open 24 hours, no gaming. Aw, heck... these all sound like advantages instead of disadvantages.

Give these cool peeps a try when you are around the neighborhood. You might like 'em!
