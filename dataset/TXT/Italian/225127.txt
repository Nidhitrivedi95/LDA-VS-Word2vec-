SNJi8rgm_YUX2_iOcfDycw I had never previously been here before but with a subtitle of "pizza wine and spirits" my mom thought it would be a good place for us to go and have a nice adult dinner and so she got a Groupon and we went. Butttt the second we get there the place is loud and absolutely full of kids. We walk in the door and we can barely squeeze in next to two couples with kids and another lady who were apparently all waiting to be seated. Eventually the poor girl who appears to be acting both as hostess and waitress finally gets to us and we opt to sit outside in the heat rather than stay inside and try to talk over all the noise and kids.

So we go outside and wait for her to wipe pizza sauce off our table and then sit down and at first it's cool because it's quiet, and they have fans and misting but then not five minutes later they seat a family with 3 kids right behind me who start walking around and talking and screaming. So we order a salad but despite sounding delicious, it did not taste very good at all, it was such a let down. And then to make it even better it started raining and they had to rush us all inside and because they didn't have enough tables we had to eat the rest of the meal at the bar. So we get the BBQ pizza and it's pretty good. The only complaint I could make is that the chicken was a bit tough and obviously not fresh but the sauce was good. The biggest problem i had with my night though was getting sick afterwards. Very soon after we left I started not feeling well until we got home and it got to a point that I couldn't move without upsetting my stomach and then I threw up 3 times until I felt better. I'm not sure what happened because my mother shared the same food and only had a little stomach ache later that night but in any case I'm never coming here again.
