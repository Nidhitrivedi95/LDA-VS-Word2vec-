yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Thankfully a co-worker clued me in on this little gem.  What a great find!  Our cab driver even said it's the best place near the strip, the best bang for your buck.  The food is basic Italian, but in a good way, nothing fancy but full of flavor.  Faves from the table were the sausage cacciatore and shrimp with a tasty alfredo sauce.  But the real draw is the all you can drink house wine (both red and white) that they provide for the table.  There's a little man that goes around playing the accordion and the environment is lively and friendly.  The wait staff was fabulous as well.
