SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ I was seated at the bar and had the margherita pizza and spaghetti ice. The bartender was pleasant and attentive, and the ambience was fine. 

The pizza was not very good and is the primary motivator of the rating. The crust was neither crispy nor floppy, but was just kind of chewy and doughy in a way that didn't really fit the style. The tomatoes and basil weren't well-integrated into the pizza, either. The spaghetti ice, however, had good presentation and was tasty.
