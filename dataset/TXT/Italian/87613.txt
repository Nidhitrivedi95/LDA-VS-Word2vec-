DWPAFq8HdzGzo2vhKixDJA Tried this place for the first time on a windy November night. JBs felt like a cozy getaway from Wisonsin and offered great food and service. JB is a host among hosts and will make sure you feel at home. Definitely try the okra; it's a savory delight.  JB offered several samples before we ordered and everything we tried was excellent (okra, candied yams, and red beans and rice). He even ran my cornbread muffin out to the car for me after it was almost forgotten! Great place; will definitely be back.
