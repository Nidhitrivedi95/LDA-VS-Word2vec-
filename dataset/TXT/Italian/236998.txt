tYbK94fl50os3h_RjpY4gw We didn't try the pizza but we had the 3 meat Stromboli with Mozzarella cheese, a roasted  beef sandwich and 6 hot bbq wings. They were all good - not necessarily on the healthy side but not too bad either. The girl who worked there was super friendly. The place is small but clean. Perfect for a quick bite. Will be back to try their pizza.
