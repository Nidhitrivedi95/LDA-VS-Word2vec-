r6Mou-9qFKMXMMQRxIPx1Q Ok let's start.

The decor is trendy/industrial chick and very well designed.
The fried calamar tastes like nothing, wasn't oily, but has no taste, not enough dip, and presented poorly. The pizza was great, crusty dough and fresh ingredients. The manager was nice and very welcoming though the staff don't smile and you are afraid to ask them something. Overall I give this place 3 out of 5, hopefully it gets better since it is still new and there is always a learning curve for every new restaurant opening.
