38-sjGYYVcQEKrZe5Nu47A This is one of my "regular" eating spots.  It is a small bar/restaurant that serves some great food.  I have eaten just about everthing on the menu and all have been great. My favorite is the sausage and pasta, but very often Ill have to get the wing/pizza combo with friends.  here is a little hint, they make a thin crust pizza too, i just found this out.  Its my favorite pizza in henderson. Get the wings extra crispy there good too. They always have a good number of staff there always keep your drink full. Also the owner is from Buffalo so the wing sauce is real buffalo sauce.
