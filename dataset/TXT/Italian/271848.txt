xsFeeqZS6PoVvwseEefzEw I could sit here and talk about the fantastic food that Wade and his crew produce on a nightly basis at Pasta Bar, but I'm not. The quality of the food is all too obvious from the littany of reviews already posted on Yelp! in the one week that this new restaurant is open. 

Pasta Bar is more than a restaurant. With chefs in Phoenix like Chris Bianco and Wade Moises, I feel like the Valley of the Sun is finally transforming into a foodie force to be reckoned with. For so long Phoenix has been nothing but a commuter city with tasteless slop served up by corporate restaurant chains. 

With the opening of the first leg of the light rail, there has been an increased interest in Downtown. More people are venturing from their safe little homes in the burbs to check out the unique variety of restaurants, cafes and bars popping up. Pasta Bar, like many of the new spots downtown, demands a different kind of consumer. You may not always be right, and you must have an open mind to new and exciting fare (no alfredo sauces or gut busting portions at this place). You probably shouldn't even ask for butter with your crisp breadsticks. This restaurant is so good that modifications aren't necessary-and are generally unwelcomed. This restaurant needs you to appreciate it for what it is-not what you want it to be. That is why Pasta Bar (and all of my other fave downtown comforts) is going to be a success. It's quality and simplicity demand respect. 

I am proud of Wade and his crew for opening such a fantastic new place, and I am already and avid fan of his delicious gnocchi. :)
