KY8J9dIOKD2vL0jdzUiuhg Stopped in at Adolpho's for lunch. The place was pretty quiet and we had no trouble getting a seat on the patio.  The staff was very friendly and attentive (more on that later). The menu boasts Italian and Venezuelan cuisine. Now this was just lunch so not sure how it is for dinner but definitely more Italian options. 

I did decide to go Venezuelan and got the Arepas which was a grilled cornmeal cake stuffed with a filling. They were out of the shredded beef so I went with the ham and cheese. The filling was pretty work a day but the cornmeal cake was really good. It was grilled crispy on the outside so you could hold it and got that crispy texture, but then had a grits like consistency inside. Id be willing to try this again but with a different filling. It was served with a verde hot sauce and garlic aioli which were both good. 

As for the service, my lunch guest also asked for shredded beef which was unavailable. The chef felt bad and doubled the size of our Fried Yucca appetizer which I thought was a really nice thing to do. The Yucca itself was very good and was a great replacement to fries, just could have been seasoned a bit more. 

All in all a nice little restaurant worth trying out. I'm sure I'll be trying it again.
