n8fGqb4CCheGyWtr9KM6qw This place was so great - perfect date spot.  Family-owned & operated with super friendly, prompt service; very knowledgeable about the items on menu / wine list.  The food was wicked delicious!  Yes, its in a strip mall... No it doesn't feel that way when you're inside.  I hope this place sticks around.  Plus its in the same plaza as the Dub, so you can have a great dinner then go around the corner and get sauced.  Bonus.
