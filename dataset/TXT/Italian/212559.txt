r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA Finally, my first chance to try DeFalco's.  Not gonna add much that hasn't already been said, but yes its awesome.  Super authentic Italian deli and grocery store.  The interior is a maze, the food is incredible and the prices are just right.  Tonight for my first visit I got a full Il Purista sandwich, a traditional cannoli, and a glass of Italian red wine to boot.  Total cost was about $20.  Came out in just over 5 minutes.  

I'm not quite ready to say the sandwich was up to the level of one that I had at San Francisco's Molinari deli, but its pretty damn close.  The sandwich has tons of prosciutto and mozzarella, plus basil, tomato, red peppers, EVOO, and a balsamic vinaigrette.  I got mine in an italian baguette per their recommendation.  The sandwich was huge and the ingredients were fantastic.  The cannoli was also excellent with a rich creamy filling and sweet shell with just the right amount of crunch.

So yes, the Yelp reviews are accurate and the accolades are well deserved.  Anthony DeFalco and his family have done an excellent job carving their own niche in a valley restaurant scene saturated with Italian establishments.  Here it's not just about the pizza or the pasta, its about the whole Italian culinary experience from the restaurant, to the grocery store, to the butcher, and so on.  Truly a valley landmark in every sense of the word.
