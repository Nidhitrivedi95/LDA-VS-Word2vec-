cYVG7yZaDQb5t_bqzCFSnQ Really terrible food. We had a wonderful server, but the quality of this food (at dinner time at least) was not acceptable. 

We are staying at the hotel and found breakfast to be quite nice, but the dinner was just awful. 

The endive salad was bizarre. We couldn't identify some of the ingredients. I've had better pasta from Chef Boyardee. And the tiramisu consisted only of store bought lady fingers, cocoa powder, whipped cream and amaretto.

Our server was wonderful and apologetic. We didn't complain but he comped out pasta when we didn't finish. He could tell we weren't happy.
