qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA An older, grey haired waiter with a name tag that read Sergio, ruined my birthday celebration!! My husband and I are a middle aged, well groomed couple. There was no obvious reason why this waiter should decide he did not wish to wait on us or be civil in any way.
He took our order after waiting on tables that arrived after we did. Then he said to me, I am not making this up, "What do you want?" He did not ask if I wanted a beverage. HE was equally rude to my husband. He did not check on us after our meals arrived but spent much time doting on the couples who were seated on both sides of us. He refused to make eye contact with me.
He did not clear our tables nor ask if we wished to have desert. I was in tears, utterly confused, angry and very upset.
We will never return to this restaurant.
