SLCz2CaXXHJefrB942486w 3hours later, we were finally able to complete our dinner. As explained by the owner at the end of our meal, it was their first week opening and had some technical issues, but the wait time was ridiculously long. We were told at the beginning that there is a circulating 7 tapa dishes served every 10mins and that we can eat as many rounds as possible, however, "no one has ever went to round 2." And now I can see why! The wait time ranged from 15-35mins per item, and each dish took about 2 mins to eat. Thus, lasting us 3 hours before the first round was even served.

I wish I could say that the food was worth the wait, but it really wasn't. From stale bread, to soggy lasagne, and bland soup, only the desserts were the best part of the meal, but overall the quality of the food wasn't that impressive. It reminded me of mediocre banquet hall food that was luke-warm and lacked quality. 

I give this place 2 stars only because the servers were working very hard to please the restless customers and the table was offered a free Ferraro rocher drink to sample and tie over the wait time. The environment was very clean and classy - they still kept some of the decor, large panoramic photos and their drink options from the previous Sheesha Lounge.

Maybe with time, they will work out the kinks and improve their menu and we will try it out once again.
