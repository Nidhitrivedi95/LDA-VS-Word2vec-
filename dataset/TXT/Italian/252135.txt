VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w This was the first place we went to once we got to Vegas, our 9 pm dinner reservation meant we were starving.

Our table wasn't ready when we got there so we opted to get some cocktails, we were just going to go to the bar and get drinks (that's what we do in New Orleans), but a cocktail waitress took our order.it took 30 minutes for her to take our order, deliver the drinks, deliver the bills, and to never pick up the receipts. The hostess didn't want to sit us until our bills were picked up, but it was already 930 and they were threatening to give up our reservation. 

We ended up walking over to our table with your drinks and checks in hand.

The bread and sauce appetizer that is given to the table was delicious (first is free, second was round is charged.)

I opted for the chicken parmigiana with a side of pasta (the portion is so big you do not need the pasta).

The chicken was thinly pounded and THE SIZE OF MY FACE! Seriously, iced never seen such a large chicken! I was able to eat about half (my cousin ate the second half later) and took a few bites from my cousins meatballs and spaghetti and Brussels sprouts. Everything was delicious and the portions were huge - I wish we would have tried the meatball.
