f_R4-FMtQ2Dj6m8LNuse1w Came in to get food to go and a drink while I waited. I wasn't sure if I was coming in too late to get food but the bartender, Ashley, assured me they would be glad to take my order. 

We got Chicken Parm with spaghetti, bruscette, meatball, sausage and peppers hero, and garlic cheese bread. Everything was prepared perfectly and absolutely delicious. 

The service was inviting and genuine throughout my experience and overall I know I will be back. 

By the way, I came here by chance due to a different biz not being able to perform. I wouldn't have had it any other way.
