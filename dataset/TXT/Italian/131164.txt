iFZpyiDUgwldTWuW-5YW6A I appreciate the attention to detail that Osso put into the decorations at the restaurant. It's absolutely beautiful inside. 

However, the food and service here just didn't do it for me. 

My friend was visiting from out of town and we stopped here for dinner and drinks. We arrived pretty early and there were plenty of open tables but apparently you need a reservation to get a table...no problem so we just sat at the bar. 

The drink menu is not extensive but they have a full bar and a decent selection of martinis. I ordered the Bikini Martini. It was good, not great. It's a mix of pineapple, coconut and grenadine...sounds super yummy. But it was not...(that's just my opinion) I finished it but I would not order it again. 

For the meal, I went with the chicken, spinach and mascarpone ravioli. I ordered the small portion thinking it would be more than enough but I was mistaken. The plate came out with three pieces of ravioli in the parmesan cream sauce sauce. I didn't enjoy it. And I was really underwhelmed with the presentation and after a few bites it was back to Yelp to search for another spot to eat because I was still really hungry. 

Also the service was lacking. It wasn't that busy but after we ordered there were a few other guest that came in and ordered and got their food before we did...what's up with that?!? 

As we were wrapping up we felt rushed along...apparently there was an event there later that evening that they were setting up for...So it just seemed like we were in the way. Ugh. 

All in all, for the price and location I expected better. I'm not sure I'd go back.
