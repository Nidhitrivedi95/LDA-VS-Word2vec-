yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w I liked this place a lot. Decent Italian food and for the price, a pretty good deal. The group I was with has the chicken parmesan, spaghetti and meatballs off the kids menu and beef cannelloni. All were good. The inclusive dinner menu includes various pasta and meat dishes, salad or soup, good bread, after dinner coffee and even all you can drink wine. The ambiance was kitchy, casual and fun - looks like this place has a lot of history. This would be a good spot for families and groups. If you're ready for a break from the high prices of the Strip's restaurants (remember when casino eateries tried NOT to be expensive?!), try Battista's out.
