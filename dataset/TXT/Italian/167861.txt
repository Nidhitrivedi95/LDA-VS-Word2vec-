MIwZFWqm8jytQ0Or01EWkQ Ordered food from this place - they messed up our order after it got here an hour and a half after we ordered. The owner said we live too far (it is a 15 minute drive from the restaurant). They offered to make it right by offering a credit on our next order. When we called back and asked for the credit, we were denied. The staff is extremely impolite and rude - especially the woman who answers the phone. The food is not worth the trouble. Go somewhere else where the management actually cares about its customers.
