mhQ6Q-__szGwaaZ-FXCe0g Athena D said it all! And beat me to the punch! How I love getting those first to review badges...

Unionville Mainstreet is a great place to go, winter or summer, to browse the shops, grab a bite and drink in some of that old Unionville charm! The Med House is a great place because it offers something a little different than most of the places on the main drag!

GREAT food, exceptional service, and all super fresh. I love me some fresh bread, and man did they deliver! Even for the picky eater, I had a tasty (and not everwhelming) chicken kebab and yummy greek salad. They have TONS to order from, and one of the best parts is the cozy family feel of the decor.
