TLMysu1mWiLEslCBon5W1g 2 years of visiting my wife in toronto & trying to find the perfect spot & this place hit the ball out of the park on every level. this review basically rates both sidecar & the upstairs "private" bar, the toronto temperance society. robin, the bartender, is likely the greatest mixologist i've ever met, & hey, i work in the service industry in new york city, so that's saying something. every drink was well thought out, creative, delicious, wonderfully balanced, & tailored directly to the individual's tastes (we went 3 times, first time with a party of 4). along with his artistry in drinks, he was helpful, informative, accommodating, & friendly. the perfect bartender.

even aside from my bar snobbery, the food was terrific. we sampled most of the appetizers in our handful of visits, each one refreshing, piquing our taste buds for the main event yet leaving plenty of room for what was to come. i found myself returning to the beautifully seasoned & cooked steak frites. decor & atmosphere were on par with the quality of the service & food / drinks. low-key but tasteful, & they had a pretty killer soul music playlist going the last time i was there.

overall, a real treasure. a sparkling gem of toronto night life.
