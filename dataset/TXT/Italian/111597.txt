g6AFW-zY0wDvBl9U82g4zg Cute cafe in a medical building.  Cafeteria style seating area.  This is the type of place you would never be able to find or think of stopping by without the help of Yelp!  

SERVICE - was on point.  The staff was very tentative.  Tables were cleaned right away. 

FOOD:
Ginger Latte = AMAZING!  The best I've ever had!  Loved the extra thought with the design.
Lasagna = Great taste with generous portion.
Alfredo = Was disappointed.  It had a weird aftertaste.  We were later told it was made with blue cheese and that maybe the flavor we are not a fan of.  Next time we may ask for them to put less blue cheese.

Overall, great experience at this cute little cafe.  Will definitely returning for a quick cheap eats.
