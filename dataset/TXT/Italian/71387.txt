C63sF-wG4f1doMIMv2qvOg Cafe Porta Alba re-opened in Hilldale a few weeks ago!   I've gone a couple times already and am happy to report it's back in full swing, and the new location seems to be getting a lot more traffic than the old spot.  If anything, the pizza is more consistently delicious than it used to be.  Maybe something to do with their brand new oven?   Also they now have pasta as regular menu items rather than specials.  The dishes aren't quite as elaborate as the old specials since they have to turn them out every night, but still tasty.  

Don't take my word for it, just go!!! They tend to be kind of busy on Friday & Saturday night but they'll take your cell phone # and call you while you find something in Hilldale to keep yourself occupied.
