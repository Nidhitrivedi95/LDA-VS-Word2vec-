Went with friends last night, and have discovered a gem. A girlfriend and I split the Salumi (aka charcuterie) serving for two - she said it was the best Parma ham she's ever had, I completely agree. Then we split a gluten-free Margarita pizza, it was excellent. Still feeling hungry, we split the Bucatini pasta with a simple tomato sauce and Parmesan. It was to die for, perfectly al dente, with a fresh tomato sauce. The ingredients seemed fresh, everything had a rustic, no-fuss style to it. 

Wine menu had a good variety of Italian wines at reasonable prices. 

Decor is minimalist, they have seating for all different combinations - we sat at the long big table in the middle of restaurant which was flanked by smaller tables for two people, and more tables along the perimeter. Next time, I want to sit at the counter to watch the chefs in action. 

Highly recommend this place, can't wait to go back!
