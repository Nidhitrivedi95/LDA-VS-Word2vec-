Xra1TtWtf069Am5hHWs3Ug Its a shame about this place. The food is without a doubt amazing. I have had multiple orders messed up. I don't understand why they just can't get it right. Three times I've had screwed up orders. It's a shame. I will still go back but it's with a heavy heart. We waited 40 mins for the original order and then placed a new order but then we got annoyed because we waited so long already. Cancelled the second order and left empty handed. At least as a sign of good faith I would've given the original order to us. Instead of wasting it. So weird
