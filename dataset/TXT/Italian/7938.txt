0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw We stopped by thinking it would be good as it is always busy.  It was a big disappointment.  Unfriendly cashier to begin with.  My husband's burger tasted funny and he did not ask for a refund.  They kept arguing that their food is fresh.  It was not!  Very pricey and we will never go back or recommend it to anyone.  Very bad customer service.  I guess they don't care.  Please avoid this place.
