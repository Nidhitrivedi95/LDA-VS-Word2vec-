nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g Definitely my favourite Italian restaurant in the city!!

My go to dish- the spaghetti in canna mare (seafood pasta), with mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops in a tomato sauce.

Appetizer- you can never go wrong with calamari, or the Carpaccio di Manzo (trade beef tenderloin, arugula and parmigian).
