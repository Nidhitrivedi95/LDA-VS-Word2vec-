HiCNLB9cCWVHnbzHeN2daA I've been to Aurelio's before and had the buffet. For the price, it was decent. However, I brought my husband here and the owner hardly acknowledged us at the door and told us to "Give him a minute." There was one table occupied in the restaurant and we stood there with no acknowledgement for at least 5 minutes. We have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant and if it were busy, I would understand. We saw there was one pizza on the buffet line and asked if they would be making more to put out. The owner said he didn't know. After being ignored for a few more minutes, we left and will not return. I will not be treated like an inconvenience for average pizza.
