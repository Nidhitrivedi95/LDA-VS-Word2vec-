YJS7cXGLAvWw9DUDXpw84Q The new Babbo on Ray & Rural is very clean and a little on the swanky side. Very nice ambiance. Service was excellent. Our waitress was awesome. The bread was tasty. But our food was just ok. Not sure if I will go back since both meals were just mediocre. And, I don't understand why Babbo puts the salad on such a small plate that it spills over the side. If you aren't too picky & you love all Italiain food this might be worth a try.
