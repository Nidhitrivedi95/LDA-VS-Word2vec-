xkiYAerQQXL25legNhVsSw Four of us came in to eat dinner and we were told there was a 40 minute wait to eat. After 40 minutes of standing, we asked when we were going to sit. The hostess looked very annoyed and told us she didn't really know but she might be able to seat us in 20-25 minutes. At this point, we are all starving and didn't want to hear in 20 more minutes there may still be 10 minutes to wait. This is ridiculous - if you are booked, tell us. Then we wouldn't have wasted almost an hour of our time.
