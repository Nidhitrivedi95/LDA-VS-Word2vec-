I ordered a pizza over the phone for pick up and was told 20 minutes.  I got there in 25 minutes and waited another 10, so 35 total, 15 minutes late.  I can live with that for a brand new place.  The funny part was when it was ready one of the staff brought it to me on a pan like I was dinning in.  Eventually I got a box and my pizza 40 minutes later.

The good.  The pizza was very good.  I will try again.  I can't imagine opening a new place is easy.
