_Kp1IPTi17wBywYOd30raA Don't bother!!! We were seated immediately after another table (party of 4). They were given drinks and ordered. Not one person offered even drinks to us (party of 2). We were the only 2 tables occupied. Employees standing around doing nothing. After 15 minutes we left. Nobody even seemed to care that we were leaving. Will never be back to this location.
