93FVxoipAIYG07gisMOQhw We stopped by because we had just checked into our hotel and wanted a quick lunch and it was nearby. We are in Phoenix often to visit our son but we almost always eat near Scottsdale.  This place is in an unlikely location  in a newly developing part of the East Valley.  What a find! We have traveled widely in Italy, where you can't get a bad meal. The food here is equally terrific. We had the mussels, the arugula salad with shaved fennel, the prosciutto flatbread, and a simple pasta dish. All wonderful. Perfect tomato sauce....just like in Rome and environs. A lovely young couple run the place. They have live music some nights. Last night they served the Feast of the Seven Fishes. Dang...we missed it!  But we are retuning tomorrow for dinner for sure.
