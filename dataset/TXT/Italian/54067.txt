A7waf6G3cvnLfAqKeLL8DA Buca is one for those restaurants you have to book a week in advance if you plan on eating dinner at a reasonable time (i.e. no one likes a hangry date at 9:30pm).

Reasons why I keep booking reservations: 
The space has soaring ceilings and exposed brick walls. The wine list is extensive and the cocktail list (priced similarly to what to you can expect on King W.) is not offensive by any means. The pork blood pasta is one of my favourite dishes ever - for real. The basil gelato is amazing. The service is attentive (if not bordering on overly so, at times). Your coworkers will be like "Oh, you were at Buca? Sick."

Reasons why I roll my eyes at the restaurant:
The nodoni are literally bread knots covered in some spice and olive oil - I don't get the hype, but maybe I've been conditioned by the media to hate gluten. Also, the waiter told us the tiramisu was the best in the whole city... I'm not saying this was necessarily fraudulent, but I wasn't convinced.

Reasons why I hate myself a little when I come:
Some of these dishes: (i) are definitely meant to be shared by more than 2 people ... Eating half of a burrata pizza was one of the most gluttonous things I have ever done, and (ii) are insanely priced ... To add "preserves" (literally like 3 pieces of pickled artichoke, a couple dabs of a savoury jam and a paint brush stroke of sauce) to your charcuterie, it cost $8. Never again. 

Bottom line: try the pork blood pasta. It is spicy, and you will cry - not because of the heat though. Because it is literally that good.
