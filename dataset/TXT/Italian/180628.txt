NvG2KYObJujUeswSDmww_w At first glance I found it to be an interesting concept to combine a wine bar with a sports bar. Soon it became evident this was only a sports bar that wanted to expand its clientele base to include wine and food. Albeit, the wine selection good and the food recommended, we're hoping the new management fixes the inconsistent quality in the kitchen. The staff? We'll they're nothing short of awesome; which keeps us coming back for more!

In the end, all I can say is be sure you come with the expectation to enjoy some wine while sitting in a loud sports bar. Yes fun at times, but not what I think most wine lovers are seeking...a quieter setting enjoying personal conversation with their guest(s) and a good foodie experience. Wishing great success to Deandra and team!
