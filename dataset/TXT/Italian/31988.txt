5sTFevXhGx01eLT4wF7Urg I visited Tanzy recently on a double date before checking out a movie at iPic

Drinks:
-Attentive/knowledgeable bartender
-Wide variety of fresh ingredients
-Great custom cocktails

Food:
-High quality ingredients
-Tremendous seafood 
-Excellent sauces and sides

Recommendations:
-Crispy brussel sprouts
-Calamari: very large and very fresh
-Short ribs: amazing quality beef, perfectly braised, side of goat cheese gnocchi was inventive and terrific
-Sea bass: As someone who normally does not enjoy fish, it was incredibly tender and prepared in a sauce that added a lot, without overwhelming the fish

Long story short: I loved the food, the decor was incredible, and well executed cocktails were a great addition... GO HERE SOON
