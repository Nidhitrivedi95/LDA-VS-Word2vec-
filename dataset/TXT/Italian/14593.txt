We were given cheap laminated menus and as we sat there, three staff members were all arguing at the bar. We kept waiting for the waiter to come around and the arguing by STAFF kept getting louder to the point the bar tender finally came over and told them to quiet down. They quieted a bit and then we finally go some water, but no waiter yet. Then, the arguing erupted again and after a couple "F" bombs we got up and left. Thank God we did, we went right upstairs to LEVO and had the best Italian food I've ever had.
