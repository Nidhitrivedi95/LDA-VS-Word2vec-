PhIkXAFZ8UMvrt_bPwjzIw I have been going here for over 15 years and I always love it.
The beef tenderloin is incredible, it comes with red wine jus that I love.
My wife get's the pasta which she always loves and the freshly baked bread is a nice touch.
The services is excellent, the owner who is usually there is really nice and welcoming.
Highly recommend!!!!
