DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw Great service and good food!  The menu is somewhat limited but the food was very good.  The ambiance is nice and quiet enough for you to have a conversation with your party members.  I enjoyed my entree very much.

The price is fair to a bit on the high side for the portions given.  Complimentary bread didn't taste fresh and being a bread guy, I would've liked freshly baked bread.
