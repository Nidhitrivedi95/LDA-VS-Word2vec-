0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg Scarpetta features a very good ambiance with a fantastic view of the  Bellagio Fountains. To get a great view, make sure you ask to be seated by the window upon reservation. Ambience is dark, sexy and romantic, but different tables set different moods. They also have a booth section that is very secluded from the rest. 

Starting with the notable wine list, I decided to pair my dinner with a glass of Malbec.
Shortly after, our server brought us the bread basket. The bread basket consisted of foccacia, strombolli with warm meat and cheese, bread with herb, basic rolls and sourdough. Delicious!  They were served with mascarpone butter spread, citrus olive oil and eggplant spread.

Our server told us that they were best known for their spaghetti. Hmmm, must try that next time. For appetizer, we started with the raw yellowtail. 
For our entrees, we ordered the duck foie gras ravioli  and prime NY steak.
The yellowtail was very tender and refreshing. Used of rock salt gave it a unique after taste. I only wish there was more of it since it only came with 4 pieces. 
The duck and foie gras ravioli was alright.   I absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but I could barely taste the foie gras. The marsala reduction was a delightful contrast to the ravioli. 
The steak was cooked to perfection. Medium rare, the way I like it. However, I can't say that it was the best I've ever had. Not even on my top three list.  It was served with seasonal vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes, roasted potatoes, wild mushrooms and parmigiano. We were told the  mushrooms were shitake , trumpet royale, beech, and pecorino mushroom. 

Since we were sharing everything, they were very accommodating by splitting everything for us.  The food timing was excellent! I wish I had more room for dessert but I was too full by the end of my meal.
Overall, i enjoyed my dining experience at Scarpetta.
