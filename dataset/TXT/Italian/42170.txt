7qo6rqDjlHds8ObxzxBD4A Just another pizza claiming to be New York's finest.  Ordered the 3v's pizza and if you closed your eyes it was meat and cheese. Zero flavor to have pepperoni, sausage and meatball all taste the same. Sure it had cheese and sauce, but no flavor. Very disappointing, why do restaurants cut corners by not using herbs and spices.  Really too bad, just average.
