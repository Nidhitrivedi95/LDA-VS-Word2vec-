iqntlaqSCB4hkzTzlPlEmQ Excellent! I am so happy that this place came to the Galleria Mall here in Henderson! It is a classy little restaurant with beautiful indoor or outdoor seating! The food is all so fresh and healthy! My kids, who are generally very picky and steer clear of anything "healthy, even loved the food here! 
It is a perfect place to relax after a day of shopping!
