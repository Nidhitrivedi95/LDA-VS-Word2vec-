FmraE2CWt65VRnEqCAqNEg The food was decent but the service makes me never want to go again. It was so slow first of all and our waitress was visibly not busy. We had a group of 8 and it took WAY too long to get our (cold) food, get our empty cups refilled and get out checks. The server looked kind of annoyed the whole time (we're not a loud or rude group), and she never once smiled. I understand people can have a bad day, but the icing on the cake is when we FINALLY got the checks they had 20% gratuity added on! I know with groups most places add gratuity and that's fine, but there is no way I would have voluntarily tipped more than 15% for that service. I will definitely not be back.
