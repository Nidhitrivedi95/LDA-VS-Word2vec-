v3AS5LGeV2Si4nOHZ7lgxQ Glass Nickel Pizza has the ambiance that we typically look for in a Pizza/Pub joint.  The place is dark (cozy, not creepy), warm, comfortable, and quiet.  They have friendly and professional waiters that serve frosty adult beverages and good pies.  

We ordered their Deluxe (Supreme), because the staple pies make comparisons much easier.  The pizza is good, but not amazing.  It is a hand tossed, New York style dough.  The dough was a little bit blander than we like and there wasn't much rise in it (no yeast or too cold for it), but the toppings/cheese were really good and deserve a solid 4 star rating.

Something that we didn't see mentioned in other reviews are their Hot Wings.  They serve really good wings here that deserve more recognition.  Our waiter was awesome enough to bring out two sauces for us to try (we couldn't make up our minds) and we liked both the buffalo (needs a little bit more spice though) and jerk (great smokey flavor).

You can never go wrong with $4 Bloody Marys w/ chasers or $5 Nitro Milk Stouts.  Don't make the mistake of drinking the beers too quickly or you'll miss out on the designs drawn in the foam.
