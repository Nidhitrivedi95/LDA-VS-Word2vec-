QBN_TcWQ1mZrzekFM4p0LA Very disappointed with my experience here. Although, the server was sweet and helpful, the food unfortunately was a joke. We ordered a sausage pasta dish, and a stuffed chicken plate that were both bland, overlooked, and not worth the somewhat steep price we paid for it. The place is not visually appealing either, the vintage cluttered look only brought out the large amount of dust scattered on the decorations.
