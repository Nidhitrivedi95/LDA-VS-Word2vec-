5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g First-timer, will definitely be back. Bar service was a bit touch and go at the beginning but the guy I ended with was legit. The calamari was mehhh-ish, had to do a lot of dipping w whatever the side sauce was to get it down. Wasn't a "push away & wait for the main dish" event, but I only kept going because I was hongry (no typo). Main dish was flounder, small portion but perfect for my appetite. I don't mind smaller portions with the a $20+ price tag as long as it's good and filling, which this was both. Great wine pairing recommendation - so all good there. The butterscotch brownie... yeah man. Like that dish is on my list of "fiend-dom". The only reason I told them to package it up in a mini-to go box is because I wanted to draw out the experience another day. Yeah man.... that's all I have to say about that (channeling Forest G.)
