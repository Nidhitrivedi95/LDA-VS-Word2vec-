72_6srKAdZPSHCGNwK2Hfg I used to go to this place quite often. Great food, unique location, amazing patio. But the last two times I've been there, the quality of service has dropped significantly. One of the owners used to be there all the time, always very courteous and looking after the details. But now that guy is no longer there, and another dude replaced him. The new guy is, how do I put this, quite douchy. And I think that his attitude transpires to the waitresses mood. Therefore the bad service. The place used to be cheery and kind, now it's douchy.
May not go back. I'll miss my piece of Eden in Toronto.
