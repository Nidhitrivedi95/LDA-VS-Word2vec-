_k3PJI3mSS3eIpV8FZ6Tqg Delicious good food and service! Our party had the braised short ribs, kungpao chicken, and beef noodle soup! Man oh man were those short ribs a hit! At only 6.99 for a salad, ribs, and a helping of rice, it was a stellar deal! I'm so hungry thinking about it!!!! 

The water service was definitely top 3. Our server, a very friendly and genuine college junior, was so on top of serving us refreshing h20. Every time we looked at our cup, it was never empty as she came ever so often to pour water after even leaving the pitcher on the table. We were either spoiled or I love water so much and drink so much liquid that I appreciate the splendid service. 

My order was the best decision out of the three as my friend kept picking on my food! It was irresistible and I didn't mind sharing because it was that good!

I would love to come back here for heart affordable food and service! 

They were also quick, clean, and surprisingly not so busy. We did come on lunch hour on a Saturday so students were probably away from their weekday routine. It was a nice relaxing weekend lunch for us!
