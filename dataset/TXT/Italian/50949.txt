9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg This was my first time in Canada and I was looking for a new place to try. My friend and I came across this restaurant on Yelp and thought we would give it a shot. When we walked up there, the DJ had the music going and everybody looked as if they were having a great time! 90s R&B and hip hop were on the playlist outside and there was a different playlist for the inside. I couldn't help but dance as I was walking in the door. 

Though they appeared to be crowded, we were immediately seated and greeted by our waitress. She took no time to bring us water and provided us with cocktail recommendations. Her recommendations were amazing btw. Our drinks came very quickly and our waitress gave us a complete rundown of the menu complete with recommendations and a descriptions of the foods and the flavor. I highly recommend their mozzarella and bruschetta. Both of them were AMAZING. Our food came out very fast and our server made sure that she checked on us frequently despite how busy she appeared to be.
