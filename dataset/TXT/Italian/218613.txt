s2hzc_rFWYY9_-4TfrFGng Ate there last month.  Waiter sneezed into his hand and then wiped his hand on his apron.  I refused to accept the serving plate that he then brought out and asked him to wash his hands and bring new plates.  After the meal I complained to the manager.  The manager said that the waiter had told him about my asking him to wash his hands after sneezing and that he never sneezed.  The manager then told me "to get over it".  I will never go back even though I had been going there for over 10 years.
