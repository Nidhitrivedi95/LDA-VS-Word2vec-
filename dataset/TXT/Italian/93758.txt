eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ I'm giving this 5 just for the sheer consistency - I've been eating here since it opened and have never not once had a bad meal or service. That says a lot in this town, where the transient nature means great fluctuations in both. I love the ambience - exposed brick walls, NO machines, optional patio dining. Adding in some live music on Fri & Sat nights might be great. 
Love the chocolate fondue!!!
