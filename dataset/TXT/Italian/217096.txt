rWvn5iE53sHqRXPyzWc0TQ I took another trip down to see Uncle Tony again! It's been far too long since my last visit and I couldn't wait any longer. Once again, Uncle Tony does not let down.  WOW!! DID I MISS IT!! I just got some slices today but holy cannoli this is the BEST NY pizza around! He's closed up his pizza shop in Brooklyn in exchange for the warmer climate of the Phoenix area and THANK HEAVEN for that because this place is a hidden gem in the desert! I'm so thankful he is here in Phoenix so I can still have delicious pizza and food!

As soon as I walked in Uncle Tony's today I can smell ALL the delicious food being made fresh! I brings me back to Sunday's at home with my family. Everything smelled soooo good I wanted to order slices, pasta, meatballs, wings.. I mean I wanted everything! But it's been a while I need my NY pizza fix. All of his food is cooked fresh right there.

I know I always say this but it's important, I was born and raised in NY for the first 35 years of my life. Lived in the Bronx and Yonkers and Uncle Tony's pizza out here in Phoenix is better than a lot of pizza places in NY!!! Uncle Tony won't let you down and I recommend this to anyone!
