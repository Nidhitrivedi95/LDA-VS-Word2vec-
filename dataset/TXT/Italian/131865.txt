ii9kqE9s4456Jn9asz-BPQ In town for a few days and a colleague suggested Bevo as i said I wanted good Italian...didn't disappoint. 

I was able to make a nice little evening first going to the Basilica and then walking to Bevo. The service was friendly and prompt.

There were so many good looking appetizers but I decided to just get an entree. I settled on the mushroom risotto - yum! I am a bit of a risotto snob and this one was delightful. 

I was also advised to order the Nutella pizza however I was just too full. But it looked wonderful. 

The only real downside was that they don't have wifi and when dining alone it would be nice to have!
