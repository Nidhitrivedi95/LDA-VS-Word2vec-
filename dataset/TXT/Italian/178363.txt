Nqs4_gT6nKyeTOJ_rgu1mg Listen, I take people to lunch/dinner almost every day for my job and I have eaten at virtually every restaurant in the greater Cleveland area, not to mention I'm Italian, and I can say with 100% certainty that this is the worst Italian food I have ever eaten. We actually considered asking for our money back. All six of us agreed that the food was beyond terrible. The good reviews on here absolutely baffle me. Some of these people must have never eaten at another Italian restaurant in their life. I could go on and on, but I won't. TRUST ME on this one and do not eat here unless you enjoy wasting your money.
