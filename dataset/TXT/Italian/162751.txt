ltQ-ilKwrlBtub7b_7gKww Rinaldi's Italian Deli is a very good place for lunch if your in this area and looking for something a little lighter than a burger and fries.  They are conveniently located near the corner on Deer Valley and 19th ave, next to Dunkin Donuts.  They are open for breakfast, lunch and an early dinner.  

I recommend going during breakfast or lunch if your interested in their "Specials of the Day" that are on their hot plates. These items don't look too appetizing if you go by in the late afternoon or evening. 

They offer homemade soups and fresh cut salads loaded with just about anything you could imagine.  They have a small selection of homemade pasta salads as well.  

I had their pastrami on rye with their spicey, nazzle opening, and horse radishy dressing.  The pastrami was very good but had to be heated in a micro-wave. My sandwich was assembled very well so props to the girl behind the counter!  Their Italian pasta salad was excellent. Their Cob salad was also very good, nothing fancy but a good balance of veggies, bacon, egg, tomato, blue cheese, avocado with grilled chicken.

Not one of the better deli's in Phoenix but loads better than any chain deli!  It's a nice alternative to burgers and fries.
