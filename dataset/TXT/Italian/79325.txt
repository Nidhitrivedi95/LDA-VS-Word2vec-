D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg I was staying at the Palms, and decided to head upstairs to Nove. You are treated with five star service from the beginning to the end of your meal starting with their hostess. The restaurant has an incredible view!

I sat at the bar and the bartenders started me off with their delicious complimentary bread. I ordered the half order of the Nove spaghetti. It was nothing less than incredible! It is a spaghetti dish with red sauce filled with lobster, calamari, shrimp, and scallops. One of the best pasta dishes I've ever had.  

The bartenders at the restaurant gave great service as well. The restaurant was extremely busy, but the bartenders all worked well together and made sure all of their guests were taken care of. Although I don't like to repeat restaurants more than once while I'm traveling, I would definitely go back to Nove JUST to order their Nove spaghetti.
