v43qggsvaezDlZSC_IGJIg We just moved to Troy Hill and when asking people about the local food scene, Frank's was typically the answer. I'm all about local mom and pop pizza shops so naturally I was super pumped to try them (especially since we're just two blocks away!). 

As for food, their pizza is pretty average. We just had basic plain and I thought it could have been cooked a little longer. However, I did like how big their pizza is. Crust is one of my favorite parts of the pizza and they definitely do a good job in that aspect. I hear their buffalo chicken pizza is very famous, so maybe next time we decide to order I'll get that. 

Now while their pizza is just okay, their chicken is AWESOME. We got chicken bites and you can tell they make everything right there in the kitchen-- breading, etc. They were so good that you really didn't even have to dip it in hot sauce or ranch! 

There is one or two tables in the small lobby area, so I wouldn't recommend eating there. Definitely a take-out kind of place. 

For being our first introduction to Troy Hill, the staff was super nice. Made a great welcome! They were friendly and definitely made me feel like they wanted me to return.
