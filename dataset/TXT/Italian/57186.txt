It was lightly breaded, fried and served with a marinara sauce.  I ordered the spinach salad, which turned out to be one of the best I'd ever had!  It was full of spinach, goat cheese, bacon and a tasty dressing.  Very hearty size too!  If I'm ever back in Phoenix, I'd definitely go back for that salad!
If you want soda, just know that it's served in cans.
