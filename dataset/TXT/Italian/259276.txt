WKlMFUCGI7dCysGkFLWvaQ I returned as promised and still love Stagioni!  I was concerned about some recent reviews, but can tell you that dinner for 5 last night was fantastic.  The food and the service was flawless.  The other 4 dinners called me today to go over the dinner second by second and tell me how much they liked it.  (one is a chef....the  other 2 are grandmothers with a heavy 50's/60's food sensibility!)

We had the mozzarella and terrine.  Beet, spinach and brussel sprout salads, and beans and greens.   All were delisious and perfectly made.  The mozzarella plate was fantastic!

We had gnocchi and agniolotti as pasta courses...It was nice to have the option for 1/2 size portions!

MAins were Strip Steak, Boar, and sausage meetballs.  Each was great!

I would have given a 5 star, but I was baffled by the lack of a chicken and shell fish main course on the menu.  The decor is very nice in the restaraunt, but felt dinging because the light were too bright.  Very soft music would have been nice too.

Yes, I will be going back!
