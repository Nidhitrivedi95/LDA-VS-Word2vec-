They add peppers and onions to it which is not my preference. Why mess with a good thing? The salad was ok, bread was excellent. The Chicken Bryan was very flavorful. We had creme brûlée for dessert which was also very good although we would've preferred to have had the top a bit more brûlée. Service was excellent, even the chef came by to check how the meal was. I also enjoyed my leftovers fir lunch today. We will be back!
