PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ Great food and great service.  Enjoyed the pasta dish I had while my wife downed "the M.O.A.B." (the mother of all burgers). Both dishes were delicious and the bruschetta along with artichoke appetizers were just the right size and were amazing.

It was busy and very loud but we were sitting in the bar area so that's understandable.

There was a small mixup on my wife's order but our waitress generously and unsolicited comped us a piece of cheesecake.  It was worth the trip to the restaurant by itself.

Overall a great dining experience and we'll be going back.
