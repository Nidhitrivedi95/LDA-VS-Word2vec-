aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ Easily my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  I've dined at Noca three times, it's tricky because I work at another restaurant in the valley.  I love these newer places that are building up Phoenix as a dining destination, and I think that Noca is at the forefront with Binkley's, Quiessence, Kai, and more and more that are coming along.  The wine list is fantastic; you would be very hard-pressed to find more tightly allocated wines on a list.  Kosta Browne in abundance, Leonetti wines, Seasmoke Pinot Noir; great Spanish selections, and 2nd growth Bordeaux at less than $100; don't even get me started on the Bond and the Harland.  Okay, leaving the wine alone... best, freshest seafood and fish offerings I've eaten since I left Florida.  Cobia makes it onto the menu, and I don't see that much outside the Gulf Coast; plus it's one of the best fish you will ever eat.  

My only letdowns:  an extremely drunk guest in a large party who put a Macdonalds cheeseburger on my table during my wife's birthday dinner.  He was from a big table who clearly had too much wine over the course of the evening, and got into some altercation with the management there.  Guess it takes all kinds.  My only other letdown with Noca is the occasional over-seasoning of my vegetables.  Salt is good, but too much is too much.  

I will be there to dine as often as I can.
