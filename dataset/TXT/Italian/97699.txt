eU_713ec6fTGNO4BegRaww This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh... and possibly in the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania! Each time I've been there I have tried a different dish and swear that each one is superior to the last. During my last visit to eat at Joe and Carmella's place I had the Chicken Romana, which for now is my favorite thing I've ever ordered there. I've tried Chicken Romana at other places since having theirs in January 2012, but just cannot match the deliciousness. If you're anywhere near Pittsburgh you should get in your car, pick up a bunch of your friends, pick up your enemies (because they won't be your enemies for long after you take 'em there), and head to Mount Worshington/Washington. You won't be disappointed.
