CnzzfFzVB4us-NHY-NhmsA Nolana's an absolutely wonderful place for authentic Italian brick oven pizza in the Quartier international. I actually stumbled upon Nolana after having dinner across the way at Brit & Chips (https://www.yelp.com/biz/brit-and-chips-montr%C3%A9al-2?hrid=YJHASTuftSgO21kV2XYEcQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct) ), the restaurant having quite an enticing look, long and narrow, with a certain appeal that just draws you in - and, once I got a closer look, I immediately knew where I was going to be dining the next day.

I had the pizza salsiccia, featuring a very nice Italian sausage, nduja (which I admit having to look up on Wikipedia - it's a "spicy, spreadable pork salume" that's quite tasty), a perfectly balanced tomato sauce, and a good amount of ricotta. Into the brick oven all of that goes, and out comes a wonderful pizza with a crust that's nicely puffed around the sides. A knife and fork won't do here, where kitchen shears are the implement of choice, and it's a cool way to make your way into a really nice pizza. Pair it with a nice Italian beer and you've got the makings of a really nice lunch or dinner.
