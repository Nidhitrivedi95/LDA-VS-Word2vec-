mJYzopHZZEXVJJrsue34aQ While visiting Phoenix, a group of six of us decided to go out for dinner one night and chose Tommy V's - gourmet pizza, casual atmosphere is what the website promised us and we were not disappointed!

A friend and I agreed to split meals so we could have different tastes of different things and everything was really good. My favorite salad was the Beet Goat Cheese, amazingly well done. We also had a really nice Caprese salad. I simply cannot get enough tomatoes with mozzarella.

We decided to stick to pizza because well, we felt like pizza. We had the Braised Short Rib pizza and the Pancetta, Gorgonzola & Artichokes pizza. Both were amazingly delicious. I think I may have liked the short rib pizza just a little more, actually, but I would easily order either one on a return trip.

Our companions had other pizzas, spaghetti and fish. Everyone raved.

The staff were very friendly, when we arrived, we immediately felt right at home, I was kinda looking for a sofa in the corner to kick my shoes off and take a nap afterward! If anything, the staff may have been a little too attentive. Several times they stopped in to see if everything was okay. It was nice, but we could have gone a little longer. Maybe it was just because we were all immersed in our food and conversation. Not a bad problem to have I suppose! We did have a small mistake when they forgot to leave the nuts on the side of a dish, they immediate took it away and were back in just a few short moments with the corrected plate, I was surprised that there was not an additional wait while they redid the salad, but it's obvious they went that extra mile.

I only wish I had had another day to stay in Phoenix, to try out Tomoso's next door.
