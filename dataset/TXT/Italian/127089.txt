Dishwasher drops a towel on the floor mat and unknowingly steps on it. A server notices the towel which has been there for a couple of minutes, and picked it up, placing it on the counter of the wait station. Another server unwittingly begins to clean the wait station with said towel. Once finished the server places said towel near the silverware tubs. Moments later the server proceeds to polish all of the silverware with said towel. All this took place while the owner was completely oblivious and engrossed in whatever was occurring on his smartphone at the time. Really sad because the food is always good here; the chef is very focused and turns out great quality. Think I'll have to wait until this cycle of silverware is done, before returning
