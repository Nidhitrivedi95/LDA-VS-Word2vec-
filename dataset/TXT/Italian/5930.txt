_tp3EVUdGPBsHdzQgKaS0A Molisana bakery. Not too shabby. Came in here for a pastry and an espresso... Couldn't find the pastry but the espresso was decent. $2 per shot. It was long and hot and delicious. Did the trick. Probably won't be back to be honest. It's a bit out of the way for me and the parking lot is a little crazy, but the price is right and the flavour is on point. Just personal preferences. 

I did see they had a hot table which was happenin' during lunch hour. Check it out!
