72s7cTvPgI_meydNhX-JMA So I was staying at the Holiday Inn in Green Tree PA to watch the Steelers game. On 8-11-16 I wanted to try the local pizza spot so I walked to Vincent's of Green Tree to try out their pizza. Not being familiar with Vincent's I walked into the bar area to see if I could place an order. The bartender I believe her name was Katey placed the order. 

While I was waiting Katey asked if I wanted anything to drink and I just wanted some water because of the walk from the hotel. We had some friendly banter and she asked why I was in town. I told her I was here to watch the football game and she said she had been to the football stadium before and that I was going to have fun. During that time she refilled my water. When I payed for the bill I gave her a tip for the friendly service, and for making me feel comfortable while I was sitting there waiting for my pizza order. 

Took the pizza back to my room. The crust and the flavor of the cheese with the sauce and the toppings made me say "Yeah...this is good, I like this".

Thank you Katey and Vincent's Pizza I'll see you next year for the next Steeler game.
