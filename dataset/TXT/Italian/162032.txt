LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g Stayed at Stratosphere for the weekend and ended up eating here twice. The food is delicious. The prices are great for the pasta dishes and reasonable for the meat dishes, and wine by the glass prices are excellent, too.

We received excellent, friendly service both nights. I also appreciated that there are many healthier options on the menu, which is a pleasant change from the usual Las Vegas buffet. I LOVED the pasta primavera and highly recommend it if you are a vegetarian or just looking for a fresh and light-tasting meal.
