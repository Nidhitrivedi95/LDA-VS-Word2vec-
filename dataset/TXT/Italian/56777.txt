We renewed our vows for our fifth anniversary and had dinner afterward at Circo.  We went there again to celebrate another anniversary and.....had dinner at Circo!

I love the atmosphere - so classy, but with a playful twist.  Views of the fountain are wonderful.

This time we shared a calamari appetizer, which was seriously some of the best calamari I've ever had in my life.  So tender and perfect flavours.  We decided to skip salad since we wanted to dessert, so for our entrees the husband had the ravioli and I had the lamb, with a side of spaghetti for the two of us.  Oh, so good.  Their lamb is always perfection and the husband was really impressed with the ravioli.  The spaghetti was the perfect side.

For dessert, their souffle of the day was a Grand Marnier, which we split.  It was sublime.

The service, as always, was impeccable.

We've heard rumours that Circo will be closing as the family that owns that and La Cirque is losing their lease.  I truly hope not, as that would be so sad.
