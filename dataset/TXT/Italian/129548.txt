Thin crust, light sauce, hot hot hot, delicious, pizza. This was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. We started with an antipasto salad. It was piled high with meat and cheese and it was served on mixed greens. Tossed lightly with a vinagrette. We ordered two pizzas. One vegetarian and one stuffed pizza. We also shared a plate of cheese raviolis with alfredo sauce. The stuffed pizza was great too. Much different than pizzas I have had in the past. But the thin crust vegetarian was better. Much better. And the ravioli? Excellent. You can tell that all the ingredients are quality and fresh. The alfredo sauce had little pieces of garlic in it and it was full of flavor. 

This place is family owned and I am very happy supporting the local community. 

We will absolutely be back.
