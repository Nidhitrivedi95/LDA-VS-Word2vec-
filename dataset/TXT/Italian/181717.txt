O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ My wife and I were married at Sassi one year ago today, and had the most amazing dinner there tonight to celebrate. 

The food and service were amazing. Tom and Richie were over the top with their service. We brought our three children ages 3, 6, and 8 with us and they somehow were able to keep them happy through a 2 hour dinner!  The kids had as much fun as we did and we greatly appreciated their help. Richie was the man with the bottomless chocolate milks and Tom was spot on with his food recommendations and wine pairings. 

We loved our experience.
