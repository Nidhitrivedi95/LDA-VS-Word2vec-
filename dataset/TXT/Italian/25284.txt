4HEF6BuO_BBsTmvcMCbhhg Met a few friends for a quick happy hour.  I love the ambiance at Sorso.  I'm not a wine person, so I ordered a beer on tap.  I asked the server to bring me whichever wheat they had.  I don't recall the name, but I was very happy.  It was only $3 at happy hour.  Can't really complain.
