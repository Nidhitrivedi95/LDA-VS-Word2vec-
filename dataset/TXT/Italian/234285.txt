TQqhfjlPVEz41K_wAogQSQ I really want this place to be awesome. We have been here 4 times, and each time it has declined. The crust is really really bad, which is unfortunate, because I think the toppings are good. Fancy salad is very good, but the large vs the small was mostly noticeable in price. The manager was extremely nice and helpful, every time, but everyone else acted as if they wanted to be elsewhere. Like I said before, I really want this place to be awesome. Unfortunately, it isn't even good. And I am hoping desperately for improvement, because it is very close to home and I would frequent it!
