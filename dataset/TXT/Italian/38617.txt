On my last night in Scottzy, I decided to hit this place up with my crew. First - servings are enough to feed a small village in the Amazon basin. Second - more seasoning and deliciousness than in the entire British cuisine from the past 500 years.

They did have a bit of a mix up on our order, but I gotta give 5 stars because not only did my main man Manny be super courteous, but the manager came over personally and let us get that part of our meal on the house. Aka - they dope.

So ladies and gentleman, get your rear down there and enjoy the fine Italian cuisine in a dope setting with kind peeps.
