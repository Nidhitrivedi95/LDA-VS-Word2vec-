_GKMtL4zFOlNc0U3gljT0w My husband I were excited to try a new pizza place. We're from Chicago and have pretty high standards. Needless to say it was terrible. We could have gotten the same level of taste quality from a pizza place at the mall food court. I'd only recommend this place to people I didn't like. Definitely pass but enjoy ZoYo or Coffee Beam on either side. They're both fabulous and a better bang for your buck!
