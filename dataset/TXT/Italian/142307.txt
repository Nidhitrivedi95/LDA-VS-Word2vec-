jOseCpGmgbQWEfX2Wn_TGQ Our reservation was set for 7:30pm on a Saturday, we arrived to a nearly empty establishment with outdated décor and senior citizen to match. That should've been red flag number one. We waited at the entrance for a few moments before we were greeted by whom I guess was the owner. He said he had been expecting us, sat us at our table and disappeared for the remainder of the evening.  Our waiter was odd; he seemed to be in a rush and irritated even though the place was empty. For starters we ordered the pasta trio sampler and the Oyster Rockefeller.  The only thing memorable about the sampler was the gnocchi which was as good as most yelpers mentioned. The Rockefeller may have been the worse I've ever had; the oysters were so tiny I could barely discern them in the heavily creamed spinach. I'm not sure how something so creamy can be so utterly bland and flat. For the entrée I had the Salmon which again was drowned in a weird sauce that covered the entire plate. The salmon was moist but the sauce was putrid. It tasted at least 3 days old. The sides were cold oven roasted potatoes which again were covered in that odd sauce. For the finale, I tried the Crème Brulee, again that was a mistake. It was ice cold and had chunks of pineapples in it which is not normal nor was it ever mentioned. The top of the brulee was not properly browned and didn't crack when my spoon hit it. I look forward to cracking my Crème Brulee, darn! Needless to say I will never be back here again.
