gIVjdDWRnS1yDVpPF3oUeg Been going to this location for years, especially if raptors finally score over 100 pts and we get to claim a free slice of pizza. I come back because of the customer service, location as well as the pizza. You must be wondering why? They serve the same stuff. True. But at this location of Pizza Pizza, the crust is always crunchy and I won't feel like throwing the crust away. Service is always nice and they always serve everything hot.
