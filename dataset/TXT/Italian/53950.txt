A7waf6G3cvnLfAqKeLL8DA our first night in toronto was our best as far as dinners go. dining al fresco with great classical music being piped through the speakers, a solid negroni in my hand, excellent menu, and an adorable italian server fresh off the boat... 

we started with a stacked and fried eggplant dish that was not memorable, a dandelion and fermented ricotta salad, carpaccio, and then the lamb brains - my favorite of the four, wrapped in prosciutto. all good, but no huge standout. i believe the lamb brains would have really benefited from a different choice of salumi. they have so many there, and i would've gone more earthy. the sharp salt bite of the prosciutto detracted from the dish, which is a brilliant use of brains. i'd have loved to try it with coppa or even guanciale. wow.

i had the orecchiette with whelks and P had a ravioli stuffed with ricotta. both were near flawless. really wonderful pasta. they won me over right there and then. 

because god bless a good plate of pasta...
