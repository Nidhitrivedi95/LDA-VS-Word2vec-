Y-hmtitiRfg7vmc3N-lTww I feel that Sapori D'Italia offers a very authentic  "Taste of Italy"...food that you would experience at a trattoria in Italy.
The menu is very simple, the food is uncomplicated and of very high quality.
Portions of very ample size and I would highly recommend to all.
Wood-fired pizzas are the mainstay of the menu, but they also offer several daily specials, with an emphasis on seafood on Fridays.
The restaurant seemed to be a bit over-capacity during the opening weeks, but I think they have a winner here!
