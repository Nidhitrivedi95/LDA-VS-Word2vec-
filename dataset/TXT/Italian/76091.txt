cs1qJvnWUg_f8g020z_3PQ Visited Italian Restaurant tonight, their third night open. Overall, I was very pleased with the food. I had an order of gnocchi and lamb ragu which tasted like something I had in Italy. The flavors were right on. Would have been even better with a shave of Parmesan over the top. My dinner partner had the meatballs and polenta. The meatballs were super moist and tender. Tasted like a wonderful Italian grandmother would have made them. We also shared an order of the bread which was served with a tiny dish of olive oil, which was definitely not enough oil for 4 large slices of bread. 

My only complaint was the service....our waiter was fabulous, but I felt like we were rushed through our meal. As soon as we had just started into our bread appetizer, our main courses came. And I had three waiters try to clear my plate before I was finished. I am going to chalk it up to opening week jitters. But please, if we are going to stick with a theme of fresh, seasonal Italian cooking and getting back to Italian dining basics, let us eat like we would in Italy. Give me some time to finish my food and enjoy it without rushing me to finish. 

Now that I have that off my chest, I will most definitely be back. I am excited to see what kind of dishes end up on the permanent menu.
