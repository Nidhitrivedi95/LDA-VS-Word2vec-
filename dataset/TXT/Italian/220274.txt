I work in the hospitality industry and understand the importance of my customer/clients and have previously referred family and friend to Herbs and Rye but ad the WORST customer service experience there recently!  Waitress(and hostess) were rude and self-occupied so much so that having THREE tables(and the the restaurant was virtually empty that night)was too much for the her.  She never asked us for drinks, we ordered steak and she never even asked how we wanted it cooked...perhaps her shallow little mind could read ours?!  It was ridiculous.  We walked out and called the manager/owner who was apologetic and groveling, asking us to give them another chance, took our number promising to call back but never did.  This is a manager/owner out of touch with his customers.  Prior to this experience, we have enjoyed this restaurant numerous times, but will simply take our business elsewhere where customer service is a priority.
