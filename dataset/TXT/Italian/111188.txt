g_x5lM7itVvWA9n34QVlFA I see this place every time I drive past work so I decided to try it with my boyfriend after church. We ordered an appetizer of garlic knots, I ordered a slice of cheese pizza, and he got Tony R's favorite calzone. The garlic knots were warm and fluffy, definitely homemade and delicious. They brought out the pizza and calzone at the same time after we ate the garlic knots and they were better than expectations! The calzone was loaded and it was perfectly golden. The pizza had a perfect cheese and sauce ratio and was the perfect temperature. They have cute memorabilia and a small but comfy eating area. Definitely would recommend to anyone who wants pizza and definitely coming again, maybe even for take out on a lazy date night.
