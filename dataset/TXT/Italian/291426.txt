zYb4kj2R54R2YPeNm829BA I had driven by this place for a while and finally noticed it had opened. About a week ago my wife, kids and I decided to try it.
We were sat right away but waited at a table for about 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. The restaurant was not very busy but the service staff seemed to be very disorganized. The waitress, while very personable kept forgetting things and along with the rest of the staff seemed a little lost in what they were doing. 

The food was pretty good though. My kids got a pizza that surpassed expectations. I grew up in an Italian family and have a friend who owns a popular pizza place in town, so I'm kind of picky if not a little spoiled by good pizza. The crust was by far the best part. 
If I had one gripe about the food it would be that my penne pasta in the pesto cream sauce was more like a soup there was so much sauce. Just because the name on the sign says sauce, you don't need to drown the poor pasta. Although I did appreciate that they had a few unique sauce choices like the pesto cream. 

I would go back here again because the food was good, though I hope the service is able to improve. Also in the men's room one toilet and both paper towel dispensers were broke. I had made a passing comment to the host at the front about the paper towels and he just sort of blew it off. It seems as if the owners and staff are somewhat struggling getting a new venture up and running. Hopefully they are able to.
