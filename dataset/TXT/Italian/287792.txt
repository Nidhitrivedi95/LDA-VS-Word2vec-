Zmp2_b2gpSloz4Dv2VsVNg Was at GVR and wanted a sit down meal that was not the buffet and went to Terra Verde for dinner (6:00 on a Saturday). Got right in and that's when the experience went down hill. We were put at a table off the bar area but not in the dinning area. It was no mans land. We had to flag down servers to order, refill drinks, get bill, etc.
We would of had a better time in the food court. 
The food was OK at best. It might of tasted better if we had better service or any service.
I would never go back again!
