duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ This review is based on the brunch only. I feel that a 3.5 would be more accurate, but hey, they have a Bloody Mary bar and a donut station. That alone is worth the overpriced buffet! And let's be honest, we are at Four Seasons here. Did you not expect overpriced? The service was also stellar, which made it easy to go with the 4 versus the 3 star rating. 
My boyfriend and I went here randomly because we have heard many good things. They offer an a-la-carte menu as well as the buffet. The menu had pretty tempting options like chicken and waffles, and lemon ricotta pancakes, but who passes up the above mentioned in an AYCE setting?! Not me! The buffet was $39, or $51 if you want unlimited mimosas or marys. Also, I must mention their OJ is totally fresh squeezed, or at least tasted so. The buffet included many hot items, meats, eggs, potatoes. But the real winner here was the omelette station and/or the donut station. Chef on hand to whip you up an egg dish of your choice. Love it. I also like all the yogurt, granola, and cheeses. You could taste the quality. 
We ended up ordering the pancakes, and they were fluffy, moist, and yummy. But not worth $20. I will stick to the buffet next time. 
Also, I would avoid this place during conventions, I could imagine the tourist taking advantage of a classy buffet such as this.
