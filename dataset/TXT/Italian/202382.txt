q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Capo's.  We came on a late rainy day and weren't sure if the restaurant was open on approach.  The windows were dimly lit but we proceeded to the door.  As other newbies, we were surprised by the entrance.  

We started out with a bruschetta and salad each.  The bread was really tasty.  I had the stuffed chicken Anastatia.  That dish was delicious and was a very huge portion.  It makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  I forgot what my partner had it was so good.
