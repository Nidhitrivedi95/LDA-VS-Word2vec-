bz69msmKwRjWQzN-XwyV6Q I felt like my friend and I were ignored.  we waited over 20 min for food. The ppl next to us that came after us got their food before we did.  And the order they got was the same as ours.  
The only reason i'd go back is because the environment there was cool.  The food was good (once we got it).  Maybe next time it'll be better.
