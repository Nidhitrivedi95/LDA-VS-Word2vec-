By pass the grocery store next door if you are looking for nice Italian take out. You have to be pretty picky to not like this food. 

In case anyone missed this...Palma Pasta is not a restaurant. It has typical Italian hot table and home made pasta and sauces in oven ready containers. Frozen too. When I was there they were giving a free garlic bread.
