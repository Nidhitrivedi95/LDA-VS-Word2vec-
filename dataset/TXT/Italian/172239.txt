N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ Great pizza for the price. You can tell owners take great pride in their business. 

They had gluten free options however no dairy free cheese options and that is what we came looking for based on a Google search. However they offered to cook us a pizza if we brought the cheese; that was a first and makes us want to come back!
