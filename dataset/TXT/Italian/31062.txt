5nZVVPO_cYH9aQeClTP9zA Not a place you'd go for a night out but a really great meal.  Piazza was excellent and I've never had better mac 'n cheese.  Served the wine in a juice type glass which gave it nice authentic Italian cafe touch.  Cheesecake and tiramisu were excellent.  If you're looking for a quick no frills lunch or dinner you won't be disappointed.
