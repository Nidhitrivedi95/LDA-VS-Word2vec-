9uyPRXK7NGVXpMKpbOhw0A Walk into this very special Streets restaurant and immediately feel that warm, friendly ambiance. Owner, Robert, takes a personal interest in all the guests, from families with kids, to Rotary members, to local sports team sponsorships.
If you visit while Robert is there, he will very likely give your kids a complimentary chocolate chip cookie desert. The cookie is warmed up, chips melting in your mouth, paired with vanilla ice cream--this desert is unforgettable!
But back to the Italian food. Robert uses the highest quality cheeses which makes all the difference to what would otherwise be ordinary Italian fare. Being a gluten-free person, I especially like the eggplant rollatini, and the Greek salad is a great compliment.
The restaurant is well decorated, kept clean, and the staff goes the extra mile to make sure you are having a good experience. This is no ordinary franchise--your tastebuds will draw you back for a great meal at a reasonable price, with a warm, relaxed environment, tended to by an owner who really cares.
