ivugOYd-QcXVEfnm1OyqZA Much has been written on that of the mythical Beto's pizza, so I will keep it brief.

A local favorite; the dough and sauce are baked in the oven, and THEN the mountain of fresh mozzarella and toppings are thrown on afterward, right before it's served to you. Resulting in a multi-temperature slab of pizza goodness that is actively melting together as you eat it.

Extremely inexpensive. Quick service. Down-to-earth staff. A very 'family-run' feel. Bring your buddies or your S.O. or your family, eat some delicious pizza, and then disappear into the night toward your next destination. You will be satisfied.
