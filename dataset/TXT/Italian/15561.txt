1Ru2OnRjvUCMiZtYE9z8JQ Food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. 
This restaurant is family owned which was apparent when it came to service and food preparation. 
Inside seating had a great appearance while the outside patio and bar were also well kept. 
Food was properly priced. You are not going to walk out of there disappointed with the value. 
I would highly recommend checking this new restaurant if you are in the area.
