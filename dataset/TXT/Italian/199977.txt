PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA Unfortunately I am very behind in writing this review so I can't remember exactly what we all had.  Overall though I remember there being a couple of amazing things, a couple really good and a couple that were good but we nothing special.  I do remember the asparagus being not as great as the reviews.  The gnocchi was So amazingly perfectly done.  The items that came with the cheese plate were really good.
What really made the experience great was our waitress.  She was great.  Wish I remember her name.  She perfectly timed everything.  She came at all the right times to check up on us without being annoying.  The food was timed to come out in increments so you don't get too much at the same time.
Overall I'd def. be back.
