u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg I came here for lunch with a girlfriend last week and I have one thing to say:

Errmahgerd, the bruschetta.

I can be pretty picky when it comes to quality of food while I'm dining out. If I'm paying for it... I want it to be good. Anytime I visit Postino it never disappoints! Great atmosphere and delicious wine. Plus friendly service and fresh food. What more could you ask for?
