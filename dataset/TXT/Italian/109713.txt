G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Just finishing up at Giadas at Cromwell Las Vegas and I'm very sad to say Very Very Very Average and Very Very Very pricey!! Totally disappointed from service to taste. This place has nothing going for it other than the name. I would go so far as to say "Emperors got new clothes"
