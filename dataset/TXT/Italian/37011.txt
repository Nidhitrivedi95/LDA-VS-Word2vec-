72_6srKAdZPSHCGNwK2Hfg I can't imagine why this place is busy in the evenings. Probably because people with no life seem to think it's the place to be seen.
I've been to Eden twice thinking if my first experience was not a positive one, then perhaps a return visit might change my thoughts about this restaurant. Nope.
Came here for the first time back in December for a work place team lunch, seven of us. We made reservations a week prior with no issues over the phone. Arrived the day of (for lunch) and the welcome committee greeted us with "... I have no reso under that name...". Reso? As in reservation? Act a little more professional! Again back to the beginning of my review about the type of people who come here. 
Regardless, they were able to seat us so not even sure why the comment about no reservation, a.k.a reso. 
The food was ok but again, I've had better. Had a Caprese Tower starter and the Seafood Risotto. The risotto at Rocco's up the street is much better.

My second visit here was for breakfast. After navigating through a mound of cigarette butts right in front of the restaurant, most probably left over from the night before, we had an ok breakfast. Nothing you can't make at home.
I'd recommend that any one of the 3 wait staff who were standing around chatting and gossiping, pick up a broom a sweep up the outside walkway prior to opening in the morning. Service was ok but nothing to rave about.
Will not be coming back here even though it's quite close to where I live. There are much better options!
