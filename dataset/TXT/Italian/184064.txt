oH6QAuoTLFaX97oqqpLTMg I have had the pizza in the past and it has been really great - the cheese doesn't taste like processed and the sauce they use is not too sweet but not too plain. I tried the wings the other day and wasn't impressed - They are breaded wings wich I do like but the wings tasted kind of dry and were a little hard to chew. The hot sauce they use is pretty good however. 

I think I will stick with the pizza next time I come back.
