Cioppino is well worth a trip off the beaten path in the Strip District.

The longer version:

I have eaten here several times now, both in the bar and in the dinning room.  The Chef here is top notch as demonstrated by his outstanding specials that never cease to inspire.  He really has a way with fish/seafood that i have not seen many other places.  From the sinfully rich sea scallops and lobster risotto to the delicate taste of the swordfish special i've had, its all impressive.   Since it is a seafood and chophouse, the steaks are also a highlight.  The fillet comes with a Gruyere & onion bread pudding sidedish that is just a perfect compliment. 

The bar has a smaller menu with a great burger and other munchies.  They have a great selection of draft beers and an entertaining live band thursdays and fridays.  You can also get the full menu in the bar.

the wait staff are great, my wife and i are regulars pretty much and always recognized and greeted warmly.  The Chef himself will often stop by and chat about the meal and say hi, again the personal touch that makes this place well worth the visit.  Advice, make a reservation.

Also the desserts by Meaghen are too good, i have been stalking the guiness cake for a month now, i hope it comes back soon.
