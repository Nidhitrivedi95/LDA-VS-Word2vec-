The tables were tight, difficult to get out of some seats.the waitress was a bit overwhelmed, there should have been extra help to remove dirty dishes, and to check on refills( which were not included in price).           About the food, it was wonderful! Fresh plates of 2 different salads, the new full plates came out before old ones were empty. They were so fresh! Wedding soup, was good, the fish was so good, not overlooked. Nice thick pieces, no fishy smell at all. Ravioli was just a little overdone, but it is difficult to keep hot at buffet. That just happens. They also had ham, different pastas and sauces. The buffet was constantly being being wiped clean. Have been going to Stancatos for many years. Have never had a bad meal! They are consistently good. We don't live in Parma anymore, but this place is so worth the trip.
