Zps5RW0brl-s43OvlCgZAQ Perhaps this place has a lot of family, friends, and employees that are willing to lie on Yelp for them, or maybe there is actually a small group of New Yorkers that only know super crappy pizza, but I absolutely cannot understand the good reviews for this place. Perhaps the local Jewish community is keeping them alive, but we were thoroughly disappointed after giving this place a try for local pizza delivery. The crust is not New York at all! It might be thin but the flavor is worse than most frozen or franchise. The cheese was low quality and the sauce was bland. Yuck! I would have been happier eating a $5 frozen pizza. It was hard to believe too after reading the reviews on here and seeing the pictures. Don't order! The negative reviews on here speak truth. Don't be a victim of false Yelp advertisement; SAVE YOUR MONEY! This place is double than what other places are in the area and you'll be pissed at first bite! I have never been inside but this pizza was so sub-par I wouldn't given anything there another chance. It kinda freaks me out to read they sell sushi there too. Just weird.
