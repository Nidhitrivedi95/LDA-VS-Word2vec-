Q8qsbFqIE7lwA-zkv07fxA Went to get takeout last night, we live very close so was shocked to find food cold, not lukewarm but COLD and garlic knots were old stale and hard, salad was hardly worth it, not happy at all, for something that a business like this should be able to do very easy, they failed.

We have eaten there a few times, I can honestly say, NEVER AGAIN!
