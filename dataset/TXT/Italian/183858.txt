oglIZt5mg2nErhpTH_AakQ My parents have been raving about this place for the last few weeks.  A friend of theirs had taken them there about two or three times.

My parents chose Cafe La Bellitalia for their anniversary dinner.  So now it is my time to explore.  The building is old but functional.  The decor is dated but cute.  The only people in the restaurant were over 60 years of age (with exception of my brother and I, and the wait staff).   As we were leaving, a younger crowd was coming in.  My impression is the place doesn't have to be fancy if it serves good food and has a following.

You don't get frills.  Cans for soda, plastic pepsi glasses for water.  But the food was good.  My parents didn't have as good as an experience as they have had in the past.  Different cook maybe? 

 I enjoyed my spagetti carbonara with a side salad to start.  I thought it was cooked well.   I tried my father's spagetti with meat balls.  It was good but a little too sweet for me.  My dad thought his plate was not as full as on the past visit.   My mother had pasta dish with shrimp.  Her complaint was there were too many green peppers in the dish.  My brother had a calzone with a dish for the same marinara used on the spagetti.
  My side salad was a pretty good size so I ended up taking half my pasta home with me.

To sum up, I would be happy to try this place again or try carry out.
