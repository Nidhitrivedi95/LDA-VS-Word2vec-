YSUcHqlKMPHHJ_cTrqtNrA My girlfriend and I were craving Italian Friday night, but we also knew we didn't want to venture too far from our apartment. We had been to Vagabondo once before and remembered liking it so we figured since it was just up the street we'd head there.

It was even better the second time!

I had their rigatoni vodka which was one of the best "a la vodka" sauces I've had in some time. My girlfriend did their prix fixe menu, which for $35 got you two starters, a main, and a dessert. She said everything was incredible.

Our waiter was incredibly attentive, without being annoying. Granted the restaurant was practically dead, something I couldn't really understand given the quality of the food. There was also a live DJ there who was spinning some great tunes. 

We both enjoyed ourselves so much we decided we'd definitely be coming back more often. And the fact that they do delivery means we'll likely be ordering on those nights when we just can't be bothered to go out but want a delicious meal.
