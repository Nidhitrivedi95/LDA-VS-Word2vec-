vE4WR05o_c0pL_l4Aq2BlQ We've been looking for a new "Place" for pizza since ours closed and I think we've found it.  Only been once, but will go back for sure.  We had the Margharita and the Pomo pizzas and they were both wonderful. The Mango Salad was very good and big enough for three small servings (just enough if you're having something else).  Loved the thin, but not overly crispy crust on the pizzas and the seasoning was right on.  Pizza was big enough for two peeps to have three very generous pieces apiece.  Would love to go back and try something off the regular menu, but I'm not sure I could stay away from the pizza. Our server was wonderful.  Very helpful, there when we needed her, but not hovering.  Down side?  True, it was Saturday night, but really, really noisy.  Regular conversation was difficult.
