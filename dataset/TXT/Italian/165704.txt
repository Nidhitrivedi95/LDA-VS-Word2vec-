M8d0GmlQyOjzkvoWFo0exA Very good breakfast,  great service,  good portion.  They got my smoothie wrong,  ordered watermelon got strawberry...  Assumed when they figured it out and said sorry that they would credit it from the bill,  but they didn't...  Ask for hot chocolate instead of the included coffee and they charged a 3$ extra... 
So turned out being an expensive Breakfast but very good.  It kinda smells funny from we get in,  at first I thought it was cigarettes but then I notice it might be the wood stove...  Very good food overall...
