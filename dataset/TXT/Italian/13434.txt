17Q4bVyFLxAJiht0lHdj-Q I had a business dinner here a couple weeks ago. I can't say it's the best Italian I've ever had, but the food was good (although a bit expensive) and the service was fantastic. The decor is cool - we sat out on the patio on a beautiful evening - and the bar serves up some interesting chips with your drink.

I was totally annoyed by the live music - it was WAY too loud and would have been great if it was quiet enough to be "background music". I hate having to shout at my dining companions. I would've bumped them up to 4 stars had this not been the case.

We didn't do dessert, but I did enjoy a great grappa, which is a rare find in any North American restaurant.
