V-_Kh0RtKcKdQ0ON4eVQ-Q Went for lunch and spent almost 40 minutes before getting served my soup and salad...

Soup, and salad.

They weren't even very busy but there didn't seem to be enough staff to handle everyone that was there. Also I was disappointed that they don't have the soup salad and half sandwich combo they've always had in the past. All the rest of their menu is pretty expensive for lunch. I really don't think I'll be going back.
