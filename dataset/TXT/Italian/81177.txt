dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw Food was good, but did not match the menu description, and the service was the worst I have ever had.

After being seated about 7:30 p.m. we were given water and menus right away, and that's where anything I could call service ended.  20 or 25 minutes passed, and someone in our group had to hail down the server to take our orders- they hadn't even come by for drink orders.

Our food took a very long time, was lukewarm when it came out, and was extremely skimpy on the portions that matter.  I ordered the shrimp risotto with jumbo sea scallops, and while there was a decent amount of risotto, there were no more than 5 dime-sized shrimp all on one side of the dish, and the scallops were medium size- about the size of a quarter.  Worse yet, they had cut them in half putting the bronzed side up to make it look like more, so the three scallops I was looking at were only 1.5 scallops, and weren't even as thick as my pinky finger.  What was there tasted good even lukewarm, which is why I've given two stars rather than one, but the menu was a complete overstatement of the dish.

The couple in our group that had ordered the prix menu had to hail the waiter over to get their dessert and check so that they could make their 10 pm show, the rest of us, clearly also ready, had to hail him again after he disappeared after taking care of them (they did make their show, but missed some of the pre-show).  The other thing that really bugs me is that we were seated there over 2 and a half hours, saw a manager around, but they never approached our table for the standard "how is everything".

If you insist on going to this restaurant (and with so many wonderful options in Vegas, I don't know why you would), do NOT go with 6+ people- it was very apparent from the evening that the servers were guaranteed their 18% automatic tip for groups, and thus completely blew us off.
