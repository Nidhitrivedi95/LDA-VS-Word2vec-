K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ Great view, terrible club. Unless you pay for bottle service you MIGHT have a ok time, if you can get a table. Guest list is complete BS, drinks are overpriced, even a redbull is $10. There is no room to walk literally, let alone dance. All the females working are complete ass***** with no regard for anyone but their own tips. They will step on top of you to get a bottle to a table, meaning a tip for them. I would never recommend this place or EVER go back. Go to haze or anywhere but Hyde
