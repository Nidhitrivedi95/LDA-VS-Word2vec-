zv7ApWWtKbu1r_qNK4SFrg The meat lasagna is what it says, meaty. I think there is a layer of mozzarella at the bottom which I loved. My only complaint is that there was no layer of cheese on top that you could brown for the last 15 minutes of cooking. It's all sauce. For $35 for a family size, it is pricey but well worth it. I'd buy again for sure.
