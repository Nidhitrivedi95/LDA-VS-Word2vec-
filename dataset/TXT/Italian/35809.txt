6PQve0oFCLPSh4wnIzvJtg Just wish I had been here before now! Have seen it for years. Finally made it in as a friend took me for bday!!! I am somewhat jaded about Italian because lived in NY for years. Love pasta sauce.. pizza. Atmosphere and service. Great for family night out.. date night. Or take out. Will be back.
