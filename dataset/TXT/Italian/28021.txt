4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ One of the best Italian places I've ever been to, this place can rival all of my favorite places in town. Pasquale is also extremely helpful and a pleasure to meet. I had half servings of the Lobster Ravioli and Pene Bobby. Also tried the chicken parm which was also to die for. I wouldn't mind trying everything on this menu.
