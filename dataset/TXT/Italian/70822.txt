c33m1IMz1N7S1-sqTbsqRA Went for lunch yesterday, had one of the specials of 6 wings and a slice of pizza.  The pizza was fine, nothing special but good.  The wings were the tiniest wings I've ever seen - must have been quail or pigeon LOL.  The wings also were not crispy at all, definitely skip the wings here!   Service was friendly.
