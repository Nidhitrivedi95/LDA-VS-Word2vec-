d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew Ok first of all, 
Taking the first bite of my artichoke dip.. Crunch.. There was a large piece of hard plastic wrap in my dip! 
Secondly, 
My waitress couldn't even read her own handwriting and had to make us reorder!  
Thirds the charm, 
The pizza was all dough, no sauce, no flavor & the salad was the meaning of mediocracy due to lack of properly chopping the lettuce. Everybody in my family received their orders at different times. The  last meal arrived a little over an hour after being there. And we were the only ones there.  This place puts pizza to shame!

P.s. Waitress, you shouldn't throw the help under the bus because you didn't know you had a table.   I was debating on leaving you a tip your bus boy did ALL the work
