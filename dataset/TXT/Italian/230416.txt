TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag Sat down for lunch at 11:36 and our entrees were served an hour and 15 minutes later at 12:51. It was 4 adults and 4 kids and during lunch hour... restaurant was barren. Hard to understand the mess up. Manager did comp us so that was appreciated.
Chopped Salad was great, ziti was ok, Chicken parm was good.
