Z072pEHdos2Gjj3nMdR6uA My husband and I caught a movie at the epicentre and then walked down to Luce for dinner. (Note- I don't ever suggest anyone eating at Studio Movie Grill, only because the service is so bad. We just go to the bar to get our drinks, it's so much faster than ordering them from the servers).  We had never been to Luce but had heard good things- and it lived up to our expectations!  This is hands down the best Italian restaurant we've been to in Charlotte.  We started with the Prosciutto e Mozzarella, which also had a little arugula salad with it.  The mozzarella literally melted in your mouth!  We split a bottle of Pinot Noir- I can't remember which one but our server recommended it.  For dinner my husband had the Buttera and I had the Mare.  Both were excellent, and we had enough leftover to take home for lunch the next day.  I would highly recommend Luce!
