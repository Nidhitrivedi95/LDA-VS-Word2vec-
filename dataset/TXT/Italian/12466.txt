0WAL6O1YvcJbeDRYeRm34w I made a reservation on Thursday for a 6pm Friday night on the patio, when we arrived they did not have our reservation. The manager came over and acted like I was not telling the truth about my reservation. He stated the patio was full and it would be a thirty minute wait. The managers attitude was very rude and we had  out of town guests with us NO WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS.
