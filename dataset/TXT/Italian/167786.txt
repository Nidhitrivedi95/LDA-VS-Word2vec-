MikiqSyk81UYT2Xd70xCog My favourite restaurant in Anjou. They have a terrace facing Jean-Talon agree it's not the best view, but you're still eating outside. You can't go wrong with their pizza. Their gnocchi s poutine is to die for!!! You'll dream of it after trying it. I always go for lunch, expect to spend an hour 30 minutes. The gelato is also amazing, quite pricey, but it's a good treat in the summer.
