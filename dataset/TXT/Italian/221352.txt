SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg My party and I enjoyed our dinner at Lago, at a table right next to the window for an excellent unobstructed view of the performing Fountains of Bellagio. We enjoyed our meal of many little dishes and the excellent service. Because I enjoyed myself so much at Lago, my uploaded pictures have minimal captions. lol
