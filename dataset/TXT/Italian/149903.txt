KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ What a lovely experience. Howie was our server and he made the evening fabulous for us. The food was delicious, but Howie made the experience for the seven of us. We also called the restaurant ahead of time to provide a surprise birthday cake. The restaurant made a great tasting cake! Loved it. Highly recommend them.
