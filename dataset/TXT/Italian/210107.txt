qvQ-i1HgSloSJLkGnXsfhw I've been going to this Red Devil since I was a kid. I remember my Dad used to know one of the guys who made the pizzas in the front of the restaurant. Anyway, I went by Red Devil last night to pick up a pizza after getting out of continuing ed at 8:00. I had ordered a half cheese half Mediterranean pizza (spinach, ricotta, garlic, tomato). The pizza was 16$...a little pricey, but not for a specialty pizza. I brought the pizza home and unfortunately it was on the cold side (always a hazard when picking up a pizza) and they didn't include any crushed red pepper in the box (I guess I should have asked). Anyway, the pizza was good, but it was a bit too garlicky....and from me, that is a statement (I'm a huge garlic lover). The garlic stayed in my mouth after brushing my teeth so strongly it was hard to fall asleep....kind of a funny thing. Anyway, I will probably return here, but it isn't at the top of my list for pizza.
