You don't have to go for their famed steak, I have had the scaloppine and the cotoletta the last couple of visits and they were sensational. 

Wine list is vast but extremely top heavy in Vegas fashion. I still have the menu from two years ago which had some better picks in the $80-120 price point that is the sweet spot.
