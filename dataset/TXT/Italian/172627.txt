N8bCOvrGH69jD3-CRc6Fpw Despite the semi-kitschy decor, this little King St. cafe is a winner. We came in for breakfast / brunch and were served promptly, with a smile. Food came out of the kitchen quickly & despite semi-lackluster portion size for the meats ordered, everything was excellent. 

Definitely a positive addition to the entertainment district. Small in size (seats maybe 25 people max?) but has a very extensive menu. Paid about $13/pp after tip. Would go again!
