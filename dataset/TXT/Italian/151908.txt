Deceptive Trade Practice - Domino's Pizza
I recently received this coupon (coupon #4335) in the mail for 2 Medium 2-Topping Pizzas & a 16-Piece Order of Parmesan Bread Bites for $14.95. I placed my order from this location: Domino's Pizza, 3329 Bell Road, Phoenix, AZ 85032, 602-482-3030. I spoke with Brian first, then he put me on hold and Peter (both no last names) picked up the phone. 

The conversation went as follows:
Peter - quoted me $18.95, he said my coupon expired.
Myself - The coupon is a recent mail offer with an expiration date of April 13, 2014
Peter - Corporate issued the coupon but did not update their system and he cannot honor nor adjust the coupon offer.  The problem is with the company headquarters regarding a false disclaimer. 
Myself - The coupon offer would affect a large number of people who received this offer and would hold domino's accountable to honor their coupon in "good faith."
Peter - We sell a lot of pizza's it want hurt us. You're welcome to notify Corporate Headquarters about the coupon. Phone disconnects.

I was a loyal customer until a recent strings of events: bad customer service (excessive hold time), wrong order (not what ordered), and uninspiring food (greasy, pop-up bubbles and less meat). The food was replaced with fresh ingredients and preparations. With this new-enlightened not to operate in "good faith" or excellence was the final decision to discontinued doing business with Domino's Pizza.
