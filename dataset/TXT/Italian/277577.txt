YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw I came here purely based off of Adam T's recommendation, and my homie did me right. 

When I hear that there's a great restaurant inside of local casino I tend to call, "bullshit," but Bottiglia Cucina is the real deal. The vibe of this place is bustling, fun and feels "young" not old and stuffy, which is where most local spots tend to falter. 

Bottigula offers a full open kitchen/dining room, a large outdoor patio, and decent sized bar and lounge area if you're just looking for a few drinks. We showed up early for our reservations stopped at the bar for a quick drink and light bite before the main meal event. The bar is great, and I could have easily eaten dinner here and been happy. We sampled the charred octopus, and a few martinis and both were perfect. The octopus was very tender and just a touch chewy. Once we sat down, we started with Meatballs and Carbonara Mac n Cheese and shared the Braised Short Rib. I don't have one bad thing to say about any of the food, everything came out fast and hot, which is great because they were busy on this night. 

Out of everything we ate, I highly recommend the Charred octopus and Braised Short Rib, order these, and you'll walk out a happy camper. I also keep hearing that this place has an excellent Sunday brunch. Time to brunch so hard.
