2NiBvT5zL272IRcxru_x9A Great place for a glass of wine and talking with your date with a little live music in the background, a singer and his guitar while you are having great conversation. The customer service was phenomenal and so was the pizza. I recommend this place for a night out for casual conversations. Patio was peaceful and the weather was perfect. The wine was fabulous as well.
