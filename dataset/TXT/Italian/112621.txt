Funny, I have been coming to this place since back in the 80's - I was underage and it was called 'Greensleeves'!!! They currently employ two of the worst bartenders ever. One is invisible and the other is an arrogant jerk. It's 44° outside and this idiot refuses to close the door - even after being asked three times! His solution was to tell us to move to the back of the bar!! I wish I'd taken a picture of this guy standing fanning his sweaty self behind the bar with a menu! This idiot is hot so the customers have to freeze - makes perfect sense...
