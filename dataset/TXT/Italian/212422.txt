r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA I love Defalco's! It has never steered me wrong. My favorite menu item is the beef cheesesteak! And a cannoli for dessert. It's always busy during the lunch weekday when I go, so expect a bit of a line, but worth it. You can shop for your Italian food/ingredients here as well. They do sell beer and wine by the glass/bottle, and they have a great deli selection of meats and cheeses. Skip the line by ordering in advance to go.
