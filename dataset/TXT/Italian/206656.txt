QFTIBvLlcOPqBe5byK4ZIg I heard that Verdi's had reconfigured the store to offer a room to dine in, so my neighbor and I stopped for lunch.  She ordered a meatball sub, and I ordered an eggplant parmesan sub.  My neighbor liked the tomato sauce as it was light and flavorful. She said she'd come back with her husband.  The eggplant parm was delicious...the way good Italian eggplant parm is supposed to be prepared!  We both liked the rolls the subs came on...light, yet crunchy outside, and soft inside.  When I reheated my leftover half the next day in a 250° toaster oven, it tasted like fresh again!  I had some delicious gelato for dessert, and both my neighbor and I purchased cookies and pepperoni rolls with banana peppers in them to take home.  My husband got to the pepperoni roll before me, and actually texted me at work to say it was great.  I came home and proceeded to polish off what he left.  He was right!  I warmed that at 250° as well.  Perfect!  The cookies?  Oh my gosh!  I think I'll make it easy on myself, and buy my Christmas cookies here this year...and I am picky...only homemade comes from my house!  And I can't leave out mention of the service...excellent.  Even though it is deli style, they insisted that we sit down and relax while they fixed our orders, and served them to us at our table...even the gelato!  By the time we finished, and ordered our to-go items, it felt like we and the staff were family!
