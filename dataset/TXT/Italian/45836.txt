8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA When I am having one of those "still wearing pajamas at 3pm" kinda days and the phone says I've only taken 17 steps while displaying the middle finger emoji....eating a fucking salad is NEVER on the agenda.

What IS you ask?

A deep dish pizza from Amore!!  The thick butter crust, tangy sauce and all that cheeeeeeeeze fuels my determination to stay in PJ mode until I go back to bed.  

Suck it, daylight.  I've won.
