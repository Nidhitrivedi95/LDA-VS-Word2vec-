VBcmyBxAPcpzbbnPbFfttA I could be sitting down to the best meal on the planet but if the service is arrogant and pretentious it makes it taste like dog poo. But the meal was underwhelming. Pasta was less than el dente (IT crackled). We were told that the chef didn't believe in the following - balsamic, butter, salt, cream or even allowing us to have our steak cooked to OUR liking. The meals were tepid and under seasoned. The olive oil tasted close to rancid. And the waitress whispered through the specials and took over 30mins to take our dessert order then promptly pressured us out of our seats for the next victims. Will never go back. Change your attitude. PRETENTIOUS came to mind regularly.
