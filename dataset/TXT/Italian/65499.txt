BKK6BdsJLPQufoC1T-iu1g I've been here twice now, so it's time to write a review! Complimentary valet service, check. Cute little intimate loft bar, check. Nice patio with retractable roof, check. Great service, check. Great food: phonomenal beans and greens (not vegetarian), meatballs, salad with entree (love the plumped raisins), the pasta and vodka sauce (it's rare I love a vodka sauce), and the steaks....yum! They had a Sirloin served Diane style (mushroom and onion sauce) but I wanted the Filet. They were easily accommodating. The server said any steak on the menu could be served Diane. Prepare to take home leftovers and remember to leave room for your entree, it's hard to do!

Mondays are no corkage fee. Came here for our anniversary and brought wine from our trip to France. They even made us special menus with anniversary wishes printed at the top. Nice touch! 

The only thing that I wasn't impressed with was our servers lack of wine knowledge. Glad we brought our own. The server we had during last visit had a great knowledge of wine, so I'll let these cancel each other out this go.
