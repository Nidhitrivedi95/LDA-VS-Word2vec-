1bYtt80iwckHNPJyIl4qQg Being in a strip mall, it's not a place that many people consider, but it has very good food at a very reasonable price. I recommend the Gyro Doner or the Eggplant Parm, both are excellent. They have good pizza as well, which is very popular with our 5 year old.

My only complaint is that they don't have a full bar, just wine and beer, and their selection is pretty limited. But again, very good food at a reasonable price.
