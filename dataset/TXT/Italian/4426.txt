_lW7i2zGl54a6XtumbtZFQ The food is gross.  I wouldn't even call it Italian food.  It's pasta and stuff.  Not Italian food.  

I had the shrimp spaghetti and I barely touched it simply because it was so unpalatable.

It's worse than the Italian food you get at big family restaurants like Jack Astor's and Pickle Barrel.  It's really bad.  Even the bread they give you is white bread out of a bag.  Just don't go here.  Go to McDonalds across the street if you have to.
