czBupdPk4qbW5wlMOEOcWQ Funny how the only place deserving of a five-star rating in Cleveland is not one of the (supposedly) hip and cool places that we went to given the (almost) unlimited expense account.

Still on the topic of unlimited expense account, I came to suspect that the unusually generous policy with respect to the unlimited expense account is given because of the LACK of things to do in Cleveland, but anyway....

After visiting this little chain sandwich shop more than a few times, I came to conclude that it has THE best chopped bbq chicken salad - hands down.  And this is coming from an anti-vegetarian, yours truly.  The onion strings and bacon strips toppings as well as the combo ranch / bbq dressing was nothing short of pure genius, albeit unhealthy (which completely negates all the supposed goodness of a salad).  

And the total check hardly caused a dent in the (almost) unlimited expense account.
