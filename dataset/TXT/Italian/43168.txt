7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw My girlfriend and I had dinner here with my brother and his wife this past Saturday. It was packed outside so we had to sit outside which was fine. If anything it got a little too warm under the heat lamps, but the atmosphere was fine.

Food was very tasty across the board. We had steak and organic chicken on our side of the table both of which were cooked exactly how we wanted them. Juicy and tender. 

Service was excellent. Recommended.
