uDb1lOfDhl_VLmAbYvp-vQ Hands down best pizza in Charlotte! Slices as big as a newborn baby! I love to come here any time of day! The windows out front give it an open feel. More privacy in the back. Great music. Laid back. Wide variety of beer and non alcoholic beverages. Definitely a place for ALL walks of life!!!!
