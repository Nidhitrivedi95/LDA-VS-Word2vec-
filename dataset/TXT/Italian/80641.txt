D8ztK8n4L0_6cAslAPFYTg I grew up in Madison. I've been to this place many times even when it was formally known as Longos.  Ever since the name change, the pizza has been below average.  I've had experiences where the silverware and drinking glasses have been dirty. Service is slow and the prices are bit more than it is worth. I believe that this restaurant is so popular because it is the one of the few sit down places around.
