9HdEvvISPbzbL1u0wGJHrg Went to this place late night with a friend as it was the only place open in the area that was not reminiscent of a biker bar.

We had:
- Skillet queso dip
- Bacon flatbread (pizza)
- Cheese flatbread (pizza)

It was greasy and gave us heartburn and indigestion.

They gave us Seagrams when we asked for grey goose and the tab was $88 w/o tip.  For a beer, a grey goose and 3 apps that were horrible.

I won't be back.
