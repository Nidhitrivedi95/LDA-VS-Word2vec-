NrjzI_RhWLJBqWVustL2sQ I recently went to Buona Notte for a bachelor/bachelorette party dinner. It was my first time eating at a supper club in Montreal. I was told the waitresses were some of the most gorgeous women in the city and they did not disappoint. There's an interesting atmosphere to the club because it presents a high class feeling yet people are allowed to wear jeans and button-down shirts. You'll see tons of different people there but it seems to be populated with company parties and bachelor/bachelorette groups. However, despite the high-end feeling, the service is quite slow and it gets a little hectic at times. The food variety is streamlined and easy to figure out but lacking in variety and is quite expensive. Even when my food came out (cheapest option) it did not live up to the $15 price tag. Be careful of the drinks because they'll add up in a heartbeat. At around 12 the kitchen closes and the tables are removed to convert it into a dance club.

In the end - If you're going on the weekend you might have trouble finding a table due to all the reservations. You also have to be somewhat dressed up, so no ripped jeans or sneakers. I was a little bit disappointed because it didn't really live up to its name. I don't think I'll go back but it was a interesting experience.
