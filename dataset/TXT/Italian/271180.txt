XqSN1PtZkJ6QorOUa9AAdA We were impressed!  The attention to detail regarding food and service showed, right down to the selection of uber quality olives.  Those and the cured meat, along with their fantastic rustic bread and super premium olive oil started us as we enjoyed Italian whites by the glass.  We moved on to a Montepulciano d'Abruzzo to accompany our rabbit papperdelle and lamb.  OMG, the food was delicioso!  The exquisite quality truly reminded us of Italy, where the food is simple but sings with flavor.  If there were kinks, it's that we found the decor/chairs/linens too 'hotel standard' and lacking in charm.  And a little more value on the wine list would be nice. Oh well. Kiley, our server, balanced warmth with professionalism, even as we continued on to one more glass of wine.  What can I say - the evening was gorgeous on that patio, the palms trees were lit with romance and, just like when we're in Italy, we simply did not want the experience to end.  Kudos to Chef for impeccably executed cuisine and kudos to management for obviously creating a superior service atmosphere. We'll be back!
