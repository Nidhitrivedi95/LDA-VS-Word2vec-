4LB4xtFAwfvJRachr6Eaxw Visited Sauce today for lunch with four co-workers.  It reminded me of an Italian Pei-Wei with the menu's on the wall and registers where you order then grab a seat and drink and wait for  your food to be delivered.  We ordered the bruchetta appetizer.  It was good but small.  The mozzarella cheese was good and soft but the tomatoes were of the no-flavor-steak type.  We had three pizzas, the best of which was the mushroom and arugula.  The crust is that Roman-kind  - thin and crispy.  I loved it but while the pizzas are good sized - 12" they aren't very substantial and after finishing off a whole pizza myself I had a piece of the bruchetta and two more  pieces of pizza and still was filled.  On a five star scale, I give Sauce 3.
