NrjzI_RhWLJBqWVustL2sQ this place has beautiful wrapping:  vibe, music , layout in the restaurant. However, nothing under the wrapping - food = nop. I did gave a chance, I did try at least 3 times, guess what same conclusion.

for example: the pasta were really bland. well it make me feel better about my cooking, I can do better really.

this place is good to party and been see, drinks after 22h00 yes, food. hmm maybe one day when they change the chef
