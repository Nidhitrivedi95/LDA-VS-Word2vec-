1JgaRBX0oiRsvEhHF3ZMjw The restaurant delivered a great catering menu to our event tonight. We are huge fans! The delivery guy was even nice! 

The house salad was awesome! It has fresh mozzarella, asparagus, roasted peppers, marinated mushrooms gourmet and light. 

Eggplant Parmesan cooked to perfection! Heaven and was still fresh and tasty after delivery great sauce home style breading. Sure to keep the vegan you love happy. 

Rigatoni filling and a real crowd pleaser with plenty of ricotta cheese. 

Three kinds of pizza all awesome crusts and that great east coast style good cheese and quality meat. 

A favorite from now on. Excellent service thought of everything!
