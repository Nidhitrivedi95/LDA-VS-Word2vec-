ii9kqE9s4456Jn9asz-BPQ Please note: My rating was bumped down purely based on the Service, which ruined the entire dining experience.

We arrived for an early dinner at around 5:30pm, to an almost completely empty restaurant. Upon review of our jeans and sneakers (too casual apparently), we were asked if we had a reservation. Since we did not, we were told we could be seated in the bar area, despite the entire first floor of tables open. Not only were we seated in the corner, but under the staircase by the cleaning supplies. It felt that all non-local dinners were seated in the corner. 

The food was average pasta and Italian dishes, with the pasta seeming to be purchased and not made in house. 

For my next visit to Montreal, I will definitely be skipping this restaurant which discriminates against tourists.
