LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA The food and service was great. Our server, Rafael, was so helpful. He made several suggestions that helped us to decide what to order without breaking the bank or over stuffing ourselves. 
We reserved online, got there a bit early and got seated within a couple of minutes.

Rafael explained that anything and everything on the menu could be modified to our desire - different noodle, sauce, substitution of an ingredient, etc. So we ordered the seafood linguine and substituted shrimp for mussels. Came out totally delicious. Appetizers were $4 until 6:30pm so we ordered italian sausage flatbread. Delicious! We were too full for dessert but wanted a tasted of the Tiramisu - our favorited. Rafael suggested the sampler Tiramisu for a fraction of the regular price. We went for it and were surprised by the still good sized portion. Again it was perfect. 
Rafael also gave us suggestions for tours and shows. 
Our experience was fantastic. We couldn't stop talking about it to our family and will try Maggiano's in San Jose
