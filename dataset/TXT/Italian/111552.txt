G5qOZI12XTSowKZzlq_5lw Don't waste your time. The service was horrendous. That was just the start. The bread tastes like it was a month old. What 
Italian restaurant has awful bread??  They are starting with a limited menu and can't even do that right. Another pizza joint with crap service for Irwin. Great.
