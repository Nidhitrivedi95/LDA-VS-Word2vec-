pjpUOlJLlkIxBZ5BquA2PA I decided to pick the prosciutto pizza with Brie cheese.  Something on the unique side of a pizza. The taste combination is actually delicious when you can actually taste chunks of the two together.  I wish there were more chunks of Brie cheese and prosciutto. Otherwise my second pick would've been a meaty pizza.  It went nicely with a glass of Syrah. Then at the end they also gave us fried dough and limoncello! :)
