B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw Gusto isn't reinventing the wheel when it comes to good Italian food but they execute things well and at a good price. Gusto provides a more casual and inexpensive alternative to some of the other restaurants in the King West area, but doesn't sacrifice quality. The sauces are fresh and flavourful, the pastas are perfectly cooked and the pizzas are well-made and satifsying. The ambiance is slightly more casual and a little loud, but in a charming, vibrant sort of way. They have a good selection of wine, cocktails, beers and wine on tap, which is a nice option that brings back memories of Europe. If you're looking to stop for a decent plate of pasta in the city, this is a good contender.
