l-Zjik0MbpabQPv-nNp9YQ I love Sanremo's food. I've loved everything I've tried here except for the macarons. My biggest issue is the ordering system. The bakery and the coffee bar and quite straight forward, but the hot foods is a bit difficult with a line covering the options and the menus not reflecting everything available. I'm pretty much walking back and forth trying to decide what to get and the workers behind the counter aren't helpful and are really rude when you ask questions and even when you order (Note: this is only for the hot foods, the workers at the bakery and the coffee bar are really nice!). I try to come here when it's not so busy so I don't get scared of the supposed long lines.

If you're a fan of their donuts, do come early! I came in at 12pm on a Saturday and they have only 2 left. I'm not sure when they make new batches but I always seem to miss them.

ALSO - GELATO DONUT PANINIS. Enough said.
