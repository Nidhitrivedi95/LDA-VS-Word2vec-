l0WauZ92kRg9bu2oxHj4TQ What a bummer... I thought I had found my nice little neighborhood Italian joint.... not even close. I order the pasta w/ clams... server informs me they're out of clams... we were the first customers of the day, go get clams before you open? So, I say I'll take the seafood pasta with calamari and shrimp.... yup... out of Calamari....Daughter orders Chicken Cutlets... ouch. Frozen, burnt , cardboard cutlets... I get the Gnocchi's in pesto... edible but not home made and drenched in pesto.  Wife ordered meatballs and pasta.  She liked the meatball, the sauce had that metallic not homemade taste.  Server was attentive but failed to ask us if we would like dessert, maybe they were out?? just brought us bill. Oh well...
