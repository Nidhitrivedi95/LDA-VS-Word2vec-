qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ After reading the reviews, I was so excited to try it.  Tony was great, garlic knots were great, but the pizza just wasn't so good.  We ordered the Hawaiian Delight.  The crust seemed like frozen pizza dough and the sauce was bland.  The food also took a really long time to arrive at the table.  We also had the caprese salad - hard to mess up, but the tomatoes weren't ripe and should have been thicker sliced.  Probably won't go back, but if I did - I'd try something else, like the pasta or entrees.
