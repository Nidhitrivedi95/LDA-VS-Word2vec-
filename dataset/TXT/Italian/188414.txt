OwYpVa-JnVjfEz4iVZk3ZQ Stopped by at this location to meet a friend for lunch and to use my gift card there.  We tried the 2 for $25 special.  Not a bad deal, but what a drabby decor. It just looks ancient compared to the one that I've been to in Scottsdale.  The special comes with a large plate, soup or a salad bowl, one dessert or appetizer.  We each chose a meal, shared the salad and a good-size tiramisu.  Our bill came to $27 after tax.  

The server was okay.  She sneezed while taking our order, and I think she used her hand to cover her mouth!  I quickly looked away and hoped she washed her hands.  I mean, she's human but I just wished it didn't happen right then.  Later, she got confused about the tip.  She came back after I paid and asked if I wanted change and I was like, "Yeah." And she responded, "Oh okay, let me go and get it." And I'm thinking, why did she come back without it?  She already pocket it. I always tip, I just didn't want to give her that specific amount.  

Needless to say, I won't go back to that location because it needs a facelift.
