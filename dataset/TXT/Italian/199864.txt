PSRZaGGxXmOmabL2si8pKw I like this place.  The décor is nice, the staff is friendly and the menu has a great offering.

I have tried numerous items on the menu from pastas to the fantastic pork chop marsala (which you must try) and have never been disappointed.  In addition, the FREE bread and the olive oil spice mix you dip it in is the best bread offering of all the chain restaurants I have been in.  That mix of spices is tasty!  One other thing you must try if you like soups is the lentil with sausage soup.  It is fantastic.

Oh, I don't know if they still do this for the kids, but they used to hand out dough for the kids to mold and shape (and I think bake for them) which was fun for our kids.  That was kind of a neat twist to keep the kids entertained.

It's a little farther from the house than other popular chain Italian places, but it's the best of the chain restaurants in my opinion.
