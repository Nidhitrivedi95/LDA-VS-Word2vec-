I took a seat on the patio. Service was friendly,   albeit a bit delayed given working through kinks on first day (still putting cushions on seats when I arrived). Menu consists mainly of pizzas and pastas. Decent cocktail list, but was a little disappointed with craft beer selection as they only have a few great lakes and thirsty dog. 

I got the half order of Devils pasta ($9). Great serving size for lunch at a reasonable price in otherwise pricey flats. Nothing extraordinary, but pasta was tasty with a good amount of shrimp included. 

I will be back to try a pizza esp once Thirsty Dog opens next door. Good casual addition in the Flats.
