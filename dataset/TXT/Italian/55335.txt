aIBvcOjkAURJJ-UH0G-s0g Stopped in here really by accident while trying to get directions to a certain other place and it was so busy and smelled so good that I had to try they're pizza. I had a pepperoni slice and it was huge! Their "slice" is almost like two slices. The pizza was good and the I loved the crust but it wasn't  the best pizza I've had. It was worth the stop though and the you can tell that this place has been around for a long time. The staff was friendly and even though I've had better pizza, I'm glad I stopped here and gave it a chance.
