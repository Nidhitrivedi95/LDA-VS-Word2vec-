AuIiqDeL65kczmiFSkAWrA Formerly on of my favorite italian spots to frequent, my last trip went a long way to changing my opinion. The waiter was disorganized. At various times be absconded with my unused napkin, half my silverware and my dinner companion 's entire place setting. Getting spelnda for my sweet tea took three requests.
Then came the meal. The baked ziti in pomodoro sauce with sausage salty to the point of being inedible. The fettucini alfredo was passable, but only after the addition of some grated Parmesan after the dish arrived to thicken it and add flavor. The (unfortunate) highlight of the meal was the cheesecake which I strongly suspect was bought in and not house-made.
Unfortunately, last night's trip gave me an Olive Garden experience at triple the price. I will be hard pressed to go back.
