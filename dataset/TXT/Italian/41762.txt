7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Lady marmalade has been my favorite brunch spot for years and I always ordered the same delicious breakfast: the roasted vegetable Benny! 

It was so flavorful especially with the roasted beets that added just the right touch of sweetness. Sadly, I went in for lunch today  and it seems they've changed their menu and this dish specifically, replacing the actual roasted veggies with a "meh" pre made paste. 

L.M. If you're reading this pls change back my fave dish!! I don't know if the lines will be worth braving anymore...
