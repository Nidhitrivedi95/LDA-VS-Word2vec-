d1_Ko1DQ4QyB9BjnCFjVLw We used to really like the food here so decided to try it again, especially since we found online where kids eat free. There was a little bit of a hassle when we got the check, but ended up getting that removed. However, we were still charged for our kid's drinks when the menu specifically said they were included with the meals. The antipasto salad we got was not filled with "meats" as described, but rather a small portion of only pepperoni and the dressing had an unusual after taste. The alfredo sauce was real bland, chicken parmesan too thin and mainly breading. When we reached out to the manager, never heard a word back so obviously customer service isn't such a priority here. We will never go back.
