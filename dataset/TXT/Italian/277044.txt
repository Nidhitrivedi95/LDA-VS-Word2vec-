YgO2v1VNtbPA7zgp0szJXA Food was absolutely terrible. Ordered a supreme  (one of their specialties) and it arrived soggy and lukewarm. Literally a pool of water had formed in the middle of the box and soaked it through. Called to ask about a replacement and was told that the pizza is meant to be that way because of all the toppings and avoided doing so. Thankfully I used eatstreet and they refunded my money without a hitch.  

Drove downtown to return the pizza and the cashier said the pizza had been made fresh and sent out immediately. No excuse for crap Pizza and even crappier customer service.
