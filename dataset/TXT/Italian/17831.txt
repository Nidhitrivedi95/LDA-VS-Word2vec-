2i0dDzxLuQQAwzxDZVR-1g There was big hype surrounding this restaurant and I couldn't wait to try

The restaurant decor and layout was very nice, they even managed to make a nice ambiance on the main floor 

We were a party of 6 and started out with some appetizers (buratta, calamari , salumi platter) all good 

When it came to the mains the table decided to each order a pasta  and split a second

For me, when trying an Italian restaurant I like to try the pasta with red sauce and their pizza 

The pasta came, it aaa just a plain spaghetti with basil tomato sauce and was very tangy. Had a slice of the pizza and it wasn't half bad, but you wouldn't make a special trip for it 

The tomahawk which we all split was delicious, the best part of the meal by far.... cooked and seasoned to perfection 

Overall, I did leave disappointed because it did not live up to the hype, I thought it would have been a little more fine dinning with more refined dishes but that didn't happen, and by looking at the bill at the end of the meal..... it didn't leave a good taste 

Overall if you're looking for casual Italian with a decent ambiance and don't mind overpaying, give it a try
