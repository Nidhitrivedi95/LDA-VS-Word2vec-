dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg I have to say the people in Phoenix really love their pizza.  On any given night, Pizzeria Bianco has a 2+hour wait, Cibo has an 1+ hour and then there's Oregano's with their ridiculously long wait as well!  

Several people had recommended Oregano's for their Chicago-style deep dish pie, so this particular Thursday night, my coworkers and I came here for their stuffed pizza which takes 45 minutes to bake!  Here's Oregano's menu description:  "The "piece de resistance", we take a deep dish, add a light crust and fill it with cheese and fresh ingredients. We cover it with a layer of thin crust and top it with a tangy sauce. This "stuff" is so good, it'll take about 45 minutes, but it's worth it!"  How could we resist?

So, we order a few things to nibble on to pass the time...
Mrs. Gibbilini's Original Spinach Salad
Wings of Fire
Bistro Classic Pizza
and of course, the stuffed Numero ONE-O Pizza

Salad, Wings, Classic Pizza....ok, nothing spectacular, usual chain restaurant tasting food.  An hour passes, where's the Numero ONE-O?  We ask our server, she tells us it's on its way.  Another 15 minutes, it looks delicious and HUGE!  One bite, it's still cold in the middle!  What!?!  No we don't want to wait for a new one!  

I wish we had gone to Cibo instead!
