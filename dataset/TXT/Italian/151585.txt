KpgPSQmQDgx3tJ6RlKVCBA We were sick and tired of ordering Pizza from Pizza Hut when friends came over. I've had my fair share of NY pizza so we decided to try Streets Of New York. It had to be better then Pizza Hut! LOL The thin crust pizza was delightful, the flavor of the crust was good and fresh. Impressed with huge selection of unique toppings - toppings you cant get from national chains like roasted garlic and fresh basil. The toppings all had own flavor, not that salty preserved taste. I wasn't puffy from eating it the next day.
