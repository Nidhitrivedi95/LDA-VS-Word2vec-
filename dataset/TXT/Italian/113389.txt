Gh-qmVwvibLnNdqEZXcQHw I had such high hopes for this place, especially after reading all of these great reviews and I was thoroughly disappointed. 

First of all, they request that you do not make any changes to their menu items - which is just nuts to me. I couldn't request that a salad NOT have mushrooms thrown on top for some reason....apparently it's too much trouble? 

Second of all, the one or two things I did find on the menu without mushrooms were salads and one didn't even come with lettuce. So I defaulted to another salad and it came how it came - which was pretty bad. The dressing had no flavor whatsoever, and the salad as a whole was just boring. Iceberg lettuce, red pepper, and artichoke hearts...that's it! 

Now, my coworkers all loved their meals so I may give them another shot, but it's not likely. Any place that doesn't let you modify your order is just not a place I want to go.
