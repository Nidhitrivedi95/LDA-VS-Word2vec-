hlrZHM4D48XiQtXh6cRg_w I've been here a few times over the past year since my bf lives so close by. We both like it, especially him since he loves cheesy, carby Italian dishes lol. The interior is absolutely MAGICAL -- it looks like a carnival with a carousel, giant version of toys, fake phone booth, etc. It's a perfect place to take your kids because they will not get bored! Lots of families come here, so it does get pretty loud.

They also have an associated bar with a bar menu and an outdoor patio for the warmer months.

We got the combos a few times with a salad to start (very sad salad... small, more lettuce than anything else, too much sauce), a main (many to choose from, including vegetarian options), and ice cream to finish (recommend spumoni flavor = vanilla, choco, pistachio). The combo is pretty good $ value and is available for lunch and dinner. The mains are all pastas if I recall correctly and everything has a fair amount of cheese.

Overall the menu is very cheese and carb heavy, not super healthy. But if you do want healthier options, they do have decent full-sized salads you can get as a main. I recommend the Esplanade Salad ($12.50) with grilled chicken breast (+$5.99). It's a filling salad since there's also candied pecans and goat cheese.

Complimentary bread comes with every meal -- very soft and fresh. You can ask for olive oil and BV if you don't want butter.

There's nothing questionable about the food quality or dishes, but also not wow-worthy. But you will leave feeling full... Very full. Come for the cool interior design and cheat day menu!
