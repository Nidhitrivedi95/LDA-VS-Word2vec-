dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw Pretty good deal for the food here, more so than at other restaurants at MGM Grand. I ended up just getting a dish to go - the Mezzaluna. For $22, I was impressed with the serving size (plus an entire to-go box filled with fresh bread AND their cheesy crackers). The mezzaluna was flavorful and filling. So why just 3 stars? Well, I only ate about half of the food...I started feeling sick to my stomach so I decided to quit while I was ahead. I only have one food allergy (spinach - I know, random) and that wasn't an ingredient, so I have no idea why it made me feel ill. It was good while it lasted, though!
