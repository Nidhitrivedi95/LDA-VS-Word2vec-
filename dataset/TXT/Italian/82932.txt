dfrYOqM0hxcsOTPIcRDUVg I wish Yelp would let you pick 1/2 stars because I would be at 3.5.

Ate there last night and I am not a huge fan of the style of pizza (western NY) but I have relatives there and have had it before, it is like a hybrid between NY city style thin crust and Chicago deep dish.  The pizza was good, like I said just not my style.

Thew wings are great and so is there homemade blue cheese.

I like the seating they have improved I guess over a year now.

My biggest complaint is the iced tea is from the fountain and not brewed, I know this is a Buffalo style restaurant but respect the southern TEA!  I mean come on even McDonald's,  Burger King and Arby's has real brewed tea.

If you want good wings, Labbatts draft beer this is the place to go.
