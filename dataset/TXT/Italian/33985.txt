64o_nYvzIKwHFOSYSEm-qw The pizza was great. The service and my dad's tummy after eating the chicken wings---awful!! We got our order but noticed they missed our side of fries. I immediately asked a girl behind the counter if the fries were coming out. She looked at the cooks to see if the fries were made and they said no. She looked at me and said it will be out in a few minutes. We ate our entire meal and never got the fries and never got an apology. The girl served other patrons and never acknowledged us. 

My dad also ordered the chicken wings as hes a wing fan. He got the wings and after tasting it immediately said the wings weren't fresh or crunchy, which he requested. We asked the guy who served us if we can get deep fried wings like we were told instead of the oven baked they gave us. He said sure and comes back with the same wings stating he didnt know until then that their deep fryer was not working. My dad said thats fine and tried the wings again and kept saying it wasnt fresh but didnt want to be a bother. The next day he told me that he had stomach aches and tummy trouble all night! I guess he was right and they served nasty old wings not cooked the way it was supposed to be. Awful service!!!
