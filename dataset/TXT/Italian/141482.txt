jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg Came to celebrate my late mothers birthday. Buca was her favorite place, she loved the pasta San Remo. This is my 2nd yr celebrating her birthday here enjoying our favorite meal. The service was fantastic, I couldn't have had a better server for this special day. My Chopped Antipasto salad was delicious and so was the pasta San Remo. The bread was warm and fresh. Love and miss you mama, my sweet love bug!!!
