G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Booked a reservation a few weeks in advance on open table since we were a party of 10.  They sat us in a private dining area which was just as beautifully decorated as the entire restaurant.   

Started with a medium Salumi platter although the waiter said it feeds 3-4 people it actually is plenty for about 5-6 people.   Also had the calamari and shrimp and oysters for apps which we were also delicious.   Since we were a large party, we ordered different dishes and I was able to try several which were all fabulous.   Signature spaghetti was the top of the list, lobster ravioli, risotto, and branzino are my runner ups.  Ended the dinner with the chocolate molten cake. 

Awesome dinner, fantastic service by Timothy our waiter, would love to go back and try the new additions to the spring menu.    

There's even a photo booth to capture these memories.
