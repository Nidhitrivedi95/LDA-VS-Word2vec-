I don't remember what everything was and their online menu doesn't seem to show it, but there were these chewy pieces of dough served with fresh basil, and tomato sauce, a rice ball stuffed with mozzarella and meatballs with crusty bread. All of it was outstanding. Not wanting to leave without trying a pizza, I ordered a margherita pizza and it was excellent. Check this place out, it's very good and services was fast and friendly.
