0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw Great breakfast place. Hugh servings and the waitress was fantastic. I called early and said I have 15 or more people coming around 10:30AM. Was told no reservations at that time so I said I would chance it. I arrived and they had a table set up for us, and gave us one waitress who was great. Nothing missed. Food was good (mine was a little cold) but considering they had so many plates coming out at once, it was fine. I could not eat all of my dish it was so big. Had the black forest ham omelet with hash browns and pumpkin bread for my bread. Wow.
