ZMH9VRSRdGsECRjxFYpLqA Split personality alert.   I really want to like this place. It's a community restaurant nestled in the business district of Wilmerding.  Walking in the door, it's like stepping back in time 50 years...no problem there, but definitely geared toward a more traditional crowd.    

The food was really good.  I had the Johnny's salad with bleu cheese, the duck wings with fig glaze, and the risotto.   I also sampled the chicken romano.  The fig glaze was way too sweet for my palate; but otherwise, I was really happy with the meal.   

The service on the other hand was bad.  I mean...really bad.  It's been a while since I have encountered a server with such a poor attitude about serving people. 
- We had a large party (maybe 12 or so).  Only half of us were given menus to start with.  When I asked the server for more, she said "can't you share?" and then only begrudgingly went and got more.   
- She complained about everything.  We wanted separate checks - complaint.   We ordered a frozen drink - complaint.   We ordered drinks with our food - complaint.  We sent back a dish that we didn't order - complaint.  Ridiculous.  
- The food took about an hour and then came out all unorganized.   I get it was a large party, but geez.   The first round of drinks also sat on the bar for a good 20 minutes before the bartender asked another server to bring them out.    
- The person who sent back the dish she didn't order got no apology for having to sit and watch us all eat for 15 minutes while the correct dish was made.  Instead, she just got attitude because the server had to work a little extra to correct her error.
- My drinks were $6.50 at the bar, but magically rose to $7.00 when I got to the table.  I didn't notice it till I got home; but I feel quite certain that if I had questioned it, the answer would have been along the lines of "It's only a dollar - can't you just pay it?"

Overall, a really poor service experience, but a promising menu.
