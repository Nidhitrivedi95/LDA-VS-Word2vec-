TFftsYkRIUtdo6ZhRwJ2lQ Food was very fresh and tasty. We ordered the daily special. It was exceptional.  Servers were very friendly to us. If you want to sit t the patio tho you might have to arrive very early.  They even have packaged sauces and food items to buy and take home. I will definitely come back even tho the price is on the higher end...
