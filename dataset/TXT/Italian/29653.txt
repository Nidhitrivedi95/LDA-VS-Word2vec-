5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g After attending an event uptown, we arrived at Rooster's on College Street at 8:50 last night (11/17)  to be told they closed the kitchen just before we came in.  When we stated that their website says they close at 10:00, the hostess informed us that the restaurant has an "Open-close" policy...which means they are open to decide when to close. So, we went down the street to another establishment that was extremely happy to have our business.  Why publish closing hours if they are not valid.  This is no way to run a business.
