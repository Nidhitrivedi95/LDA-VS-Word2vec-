HzOhgBM3jpNR05TuzhfNNg I don't like to tell too many people about this place because I am afraid that I won't be able to get a reservation.  I want to keep it all to myself.  It is that good.  Seriously.  We try to go at lease once a month.  

Try one of the price fix menus for $60/ person for 7 courses or order off the menu...  Even better, go to one of their wine/dinner nights and be amazed.  And Wendy is the best server in Ohio - tip her well...
