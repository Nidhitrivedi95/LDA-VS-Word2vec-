6okGKL2PA7kkc-GjZzNHnA I first visited here during restaurant week. The service is very good. And I enjoyed the three-course meal a lot. 
The Parmesan crust steak is very special. And the starters were very good as well.

Then, I took a second visit at their Sunday brunch. It includes prime rib, omelettes, waffles, and other food and sweets. The prime rib was good, and all the other food were very tasty. They also had pasta and teriyaki salmon rice which turned out to be my favorite! The all-you-can-eat brunch is $15 per person. And not to mention their endless mimosas for only $5.5!
