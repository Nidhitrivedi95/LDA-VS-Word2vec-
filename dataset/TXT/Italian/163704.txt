lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg Have you seen the cheese pull!!??
Please get here now...today...asap
Deep dish can take up to 45 min to cook so come hungry and start out with some appetizers.
We
Started with the family Cesar and meatballs (get the 5) oh yeah and wine!! Wine prices are very reasonable!! 
Then the pizza came we ordered 3 smalls ( 3 adults and 4 kids) and still took some home!!
Our server Bryan was awesome (I've had home twice now) and he has the best hair to go along with his personality! It was also good to see managers like Evan help out and run food and not just stand around "managing".
Staff is great and food is great what are you waiting for!!
