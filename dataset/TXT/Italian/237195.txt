It's mainly Italian.  Dinner and lunch menus are great, the servers are all fantastic!  I have eaten here half a dozen times in the past year.

Surprising thing here is something I would have never expected, they make awesome sushi!!  Yes, an old school looking Italian restaurant also makes sushi!  Crazy but true.  And the quality of the sushi is superb, compares to a nice downtown sushi spot.  

When you go, make sure you've given yourself enough time because as is the case with most Italian restaurants, it takes a good 2 hours to have lunch there!!

PS during the summer the valet will also wash your car!
