aYjZc-3aVbPIPaJgGiUK_A I love lamb. Not to be confused with I love lamp.

But let's start at the beginning. The marinated olives and sourdough focaccia was the perfect starter. What looks to be normal bread is actually a tasty homemade loaf of deliciousness that you can dip in marinated olives. Who needs a plain plate of olive oil when you can dip it into actual olive juice with tasty olive treats.

I was very excited to see Whole Wheat Pappardelle with lamb ragù. The pappardelle noodles were fresh and al dente, just the way they should be served. The lamb ragu was incredibly flavorful with the whole dish looking small but being incredibly filling to the point where I couldn't finish it all. But then there's dessert...

I was full, but that didn't mean I couldn't indulge in a little sweets action. I mean, c'mon. We ordered up the Affogato (caramel gelato, sea salt, espresso, bombolini). I would have never thought to put gelato in a pool of warm espresso, but hey, that's why I'm an awful baker (and cook for that matter). The gelato ran into the espresso and made a dreamy concoction that could satisfy you alone. But no, there's more. Served on the side are four tiny sugared donuts. Added dipping bonus round! 

I also thought it was nice that this restaurant doesn't scream Italian. It doesn't have pictures of granny's making pasta or vines of grapes hanging from the walls. It's modern, sleek and clean. Perfect for lunch, dinner or dessert. Like... you should go in for all three because you'd be cheating yourself if you didn't!
