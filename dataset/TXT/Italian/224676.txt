sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg I lived in Pittsburgh for a year and this was my go to place to watch sports and drink beer. Mercato has one of the best beer selections in downtown which is constantly changing. They have many big TVs so you can always get a good view or one or two sporting events that are going on. The food is fresh, good quality and a good value. The staff is very friendly and Matt who bartends there got to know my beer taste and after a few months always recommended something I would like out of the 30 or so beers on tap. I consider myself pretty picky about beer too.
