GmgAToSKHnnB3BUtp9eQzw One of the best restaurants in Arizona.  The farinata is a must have.  Great food and great atmosphere.  If I could change one thing, I would ask for larger plates for the secondi course.  Patrons are encouraged to dine family style, which I enjoy.  But the secondi course is a little difficult to eat on the smaller plates.  Other than that, fantastic experience.
