LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw Only been to this oreganos 2 times and the first time was alright not really any complaints but this second time last night was awful. A couple of friends and I walked in at maybe 9:20 and ordered a salad and a pizza that took 45 minutes to come out. So it's now 10:15 and they are closed so we look like the rude ones but we tried to get in and eat before they closed at 10 but we just got really bad service from the bartender. Who the entire 45 minutes we were waiting did not fill up our waters once. Did not give us silverware till about 6 minutes after the salad came out so we sat their staring at it for a while then the pizza came out finally, I understand the wait time for food because all 3 of us work in the restaurant industry but it was hard to try and be happy when we received the kind of service we did. And another server was walking around while all of our glasses were empty she was sweeping and I understand it's not your table and your finishing up your side work or whatever but at least have the decency to say hey your table doesn't have any water... but nothing. Not a good experience at all. Wish I could have said something more positive but their is nothing more to say...
