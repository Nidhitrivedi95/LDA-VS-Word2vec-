hlrZHM4D48XiQtXh6cRg_w Similar to Eastside Mario's in the sense that this restaurant isn't known to be high quality, but you always get the best bang from your buck.  Really big place that's spread out over such a wide area, that an annoying crowd at the front may not even be noticed in the back.  Casual/family atmosphere but not "too" family necessarily.  Warm lighting.  Wooden tables, old-fashioned (but clean) carpets, random decorations, lots of stained-glass, but most notably, a big merry-go-round in the middle.  Tons of staff.  Bathroom shared with the bar next door so people walking around is the norm.  A bit loud from how busy the place usually is, but not the music.  Friendly enough service.  Newsprint place mat menus.  Your choice of soup or salad comes with the entree, and their Caesar is surprisingly good.  Decent minestrone.  Also comes with ice cream for dessert but only once in my party (of usually four people) did one of us ask for it as we are too full 90% of the time.Very good prices for what you get.  Yummy spaghetti with browned butter with mizitrha cheese?  Never heard of it but similar to a cross between parmesan and crumbled ricotta?  The portion doesn't look huge at first, but is quite filling.  Good penne with chicken.  Can't seem to find the drink menu online but they have a standard selection for a casual, family place.  On one occasion, the four of us ordered two half litres of white wine and two pints of draft.  The whole bill came to $88 which was definitely good considering we were all buzzed and full.  LOL   Go back?  Definitely...but only when in the area and starving looking to fill a cheap pasta craving.
