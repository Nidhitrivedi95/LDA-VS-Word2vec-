QGXJym9oxglaJTD9dicmaA When you are looking for that little fabulous place that only the locals know about and call their own, this should be one of your first stops. It's totally cute, great food, awesome prices, and very friendly service by folks who make you feel like family. The food is fresh and Italian in nature including pizza, panini, salad, pasta, yummy Italian deserts and of course coffee, espresso, cappuccino and ice cream. The menu isn't huge, but there's plenty to choose from and the pizza is made fresh with nice crisp veggies and tasty meats and cheeses. They are adding new items all the time. I highly recommend this as your new regular haunt.
