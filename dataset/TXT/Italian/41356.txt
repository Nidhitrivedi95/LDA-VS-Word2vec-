7o4SWZDKYHYfv6X0U21ErQ Bravo's is my M-I-L's favorite restaurant.  Weird 'cause she only orders the salad.  She's missing out on the Crispy Shrimp Napoli which can be ordered during dinner service as a full appetizer or in a slightly smaller portion as a "bar bite" for less than half the price.  I also love the Grilled Chicken Chopped Salad and Petit Filet and Grilled Shrimp.  Yes, this is a chain.  However, the quality, portion size, and wait staff are consistently better than Olive Garden.  

Some of the problems encountered by other reviewers should not be discounted.  It probably makes sense to first try this restaurant M-Th to avoid a long wait to be seated or over-crowding.  However, with reservations it's still a good pick any day for small or large groups since there is a broad selection of soups, salads, fish, meat, poultry, and pizza.  We recently hosted an intimate graduation party.  Everyone ordered something different and everyone was delighted.  The only complaints were about an overly-dry bread pudding and the caramelized sugar on the cheese cake.  Skip dessert and head down the road for pie at Baker's Square, and everything should be peachy! 

For anyone who's still on the fence, consider stopping by between 4:00-5:30, grab a seat in the bar area.  Try a $5 drink special and order off the bar menu.  You'll spend $10 plus a tip and you'll have a better idea whether or not you want to try the dining room another time.
