fDkQcos3MqqCYGWfl64iiA The restaurant was very accommodating- seating us in a private room which provided an intimate setting without sacrificing service. 
The wait staff were very attentive and friendly- ensuring that we were well taken care of throughout the night. 
Having been most of our first time dining at Mistura, the waiter took the time to explain each of the dishes that each of us ordered. 
When the food arrived, it was exactly as was described and the presentation delectable. 
I ordered the CARCIOFINI- the crispy fried artichokes to start, and CAPESANTE- the seared N.S. Scallops. Both dishes were delicious. My partner ordered the RISOTTO ROSSO- the red beet risotto which was also spectacular. Unfortunately the  VEGETARINO- eggplant dish was bland and felt like it was missing something. But aside from this, everyone in my party thoroughly enjoyed their meals and had a wonderful night at Mistura. 
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who hasn't had the chance to go-
