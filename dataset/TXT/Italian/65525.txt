BKK6BdsJLPQufoC1T-iu1g Enjoyed our first meal here and it was amazing!!! Stuffed meatball to start was delicious. Salad was the best 'house salad' with lots of extra yummy toppings. Had the cheesy pasta as well as the regular and both were good. The 'small' veal dish was delicious and there was nothing small about it. The raspberry almond tiramisu is now my favorite!!!! Definitely non-traditional with no coffee flavor to ruin this perfect dessert!!! Highly recommend for a great date night or special occasion.
