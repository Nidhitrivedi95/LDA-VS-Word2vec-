YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ Ahh Mac Shack. A little joint where you can get just about anything in your macaroni and cheese.

My boyfriend and I come once or twice a month.  It's good, affordable, and quick.

When it comes to my mac and cheese, I am a plain jane.  I love traditional cheesy macaroni.  Usually I just get regular mac and cheese.  But lately I have been getting the chicken noodle soup (which is pretty good) and the grilled mac and cheese (seriously amazing!!).  My boyfriend took a bite of it and was extremely jealous.

My boyfriend gets the crazy alfredo (chicken, sausage, shimp, red peppers, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, jalapenos, alfredo sauce) and absolutely loves it.  We also get the garlic bread, which in all honestly needs a little salt and should be cooked longer.

Service here is (usually) really good.
