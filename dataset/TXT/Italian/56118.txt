aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw We found this to be a fantastic restaurant!  Incredible house-made pastas, fresh seafood, and a decent wine selection!  

The wait service was attentive, knowledgeable, and respectful. Our water glasses were never empty, and the food was delivered at a very nice pace.  We never felt rushed and truly enjoyed ourselves. 

The only drawback to speak of:  opening, looking, and paying for the bill.  I agree with other yelp reviewers that there is very little value; borderline abuse on the wallet!
