4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg As a late night/early morning  pizza stop after a night of partying Alegro is just fine. But for all the other things the restaurant is trying to be I would not recommend it. Casino prices and underwhelming food, with average service. Expensive wine list
and everything a la carte, even though they call it casual dining, make for a disappointing experience. Kind of like losing at the craps table. We tried 5 different dishes from veal , chicken, fish and pizza and the pizza was the only memorable, authentic dish.
