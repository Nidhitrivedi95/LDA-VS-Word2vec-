OMf69ePEdHXvaqAlCCI01A The service started out great until we got our appetizers then the waitress completely disappeared. We sat there for 10 minutes after we had finished our appetizers with empty drinks before she came back to put in our order. When we received our food it was less then ok. The risotto was under cooked and the lamb was over cooked. Not a great combination. Great place to grab a drink and a mediocre appetizer. Would recommend for happy hour not dinner.
