6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA I absolutely love this place. I have been here twice and always leave happy! 

It's definitely a little hidden gem stowed away in Chinatown. Small quiet cozy place and great for a date or even to bring the kids. 

It's a fusion of Japanese and Italian and everything is so delicately put together. For appetizers I have had the bruschetta and I just can't decide which is my favorite they all melt in your mouth. However I leave the place and crave the tuna bruschetta. The octopus with wasabi sauce is fantastic. I also had the beef carpaccio amazing!! We ordered the cheese platter and to my surprise it was great!! Usually I don't get that excited about cheese platters but definitely a must order.

For entrees I have been quite boring and both times ordered the Uni wild scallop tomato cream sauce pasta. I die and go to heaven every time I eat this. On one of my visits my Boyfriend ordered the squid ink pasta and I loved that too. But if your wearing white or have an engagement after dinner not the best choice your teeth will be black and if your like me it will be on your top no matter how hard you tried not to splatter. 

Great waitresses excellent wine list and by the glass. This place is on my top 5 places in Vegas!!
