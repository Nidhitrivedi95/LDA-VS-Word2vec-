eHhBGqQbDpCcSpz7SZPTbA I come here for lunch every now and again I always order a slice or two and a soda. I absolutely love thier specialty slices, they have the best white pizza I've had in a long time! The slices are pretty generous and one alone can fill me up and happily satisfy my pizza craving :) 
The pizza dough could be a tad bit thinner crispy crust, but that's just my preference. The pizza slices are amazing. I'm glad this is a little far from where I work otherwise I'd be here all the time 
I'm so happy I found this place. There are not many good food choices near my office, so NYPD is an awesome find!
