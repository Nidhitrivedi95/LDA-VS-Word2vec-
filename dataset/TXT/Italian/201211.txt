pXQV_vlMtQt---3W_do9Zg Maru's COMPLETELY changed my mind!!!! After writing a bad review, Maru's' owner Rosa called me the next day, apologized, and offered anything from their menu free of charge. Loved the customer service getting a call from the owner. 

We ordered the stuffed pizza and wings. The stuffed pizza originally comes with sausage, pepperoni and ham. We substituted bacon for ham added meatball and added ricotta and bleu cheese. The cheese was so delicious and rich made for a great slice of pie. All the meat in that was stuffed made it like a meat lovers calzone. The bacon was authentic and tasted right, the meatball were fresh and the crust was crispy  and filled with cheese.  Would highly recommend their stuffed pizza!
