pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ This restaurant  is always busy. Make reservation or you will be waiting  for minimum of 30 minutes before you get seated.  Price is very reasonable servers are friendly and nice. Good place to take your date out on a budget. Pizza is very good but other Italian foods on the menu is OK in my opinion. But it's locals favorites.
