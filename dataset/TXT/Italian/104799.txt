fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ We had a birthday party there last night, and we were really disappointed with the experience.  There were 7 of us, and 5 of us arrived at 5:30pm (our reservation time) and the other two came about 5:45 pm (traffic delayed them).  We were not offered any drinks while we waited for the other two to arrive.  Then the other two guests arrived and it took a while for our server to come take our order--even just drinks.  We finally placed our order and it took something like 45 minutes for our orders to come.  Our server was working hard, but it seemed to us that he had too many tables to take care of (though the restaurant was not super crowded, he seemed to have to cover quite a large area).  It was extremely hard for our two 4-year-old grandkids to wait 45 minutes for some macaroni, but they did their best.  The food, when it finally arrived, was mediocre at best.  My husband had a shell in his lobster ravioli, the bread seemed stale, and my shrimp salad was bland and had only 4 shrimp (though the shrimp was yummy) on it.  This place has really gone downhill.  We used to love the food and the service was usually good, too.  I'm not sure if the long wait was because of the kitchen or the server, so I'm not sure who's at fault there.  Our server was pleasant and helped us with our birthday gift pile and brought a piece of birthday cake to my husband (it was dry).  I think he was trying his best and was working hard, so I left him a decent tip for his efforts (hey, waiting tables is hard).  I don't think we'll be back to this place for a very long time.  It was so disappointing.
