nS6QENxe6YODNrQ45bpC-A I've never dined in, but I order late night delivery eats from here constantly. I've recently ran out of menus to call or order by so lately I haven't been calling. Oh...how I've missed your pizza Cafe Verdi! 

I love pizza! But, don't get me wrong, I am no pizza pro. However, if pizza tastes good, then so far, it's done the job! The taste of their pizza is just sssooo different from the franchised pizza places. It has that great soft herbal taste that goes with the pizza which makes it taste a lot lighter, and little less saltier than most pizza's I've tasted.

I usually love to get their Cheesy Garlic bread for $2.99. I mean seriously! Who doesn't love cheesy bread! Cheesy bread brings out the daring side of a person you know...I also get the 10 inch Hawaiian or the 10 inch BBQ chicken pizza, oh! and the white pizza for $9.99. It's just heaven! 

They are also 24 hours, 7 days a week, including holidays, so it's even better. If you're just tired of the same old $3.99 steak and eggs after a fun night on the strip, this would be another good alternative joint, that's anything besides breakfast.
