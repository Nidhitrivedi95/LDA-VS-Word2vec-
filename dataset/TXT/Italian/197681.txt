pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I understand this place is hyped, but I quite frankly had an excellent meal here.  The food was completely on point.  The service was excellent.  We enjoyed sitting at the little house next door and having a glass of wine and an appetizer while waiting for our table which was available much sooner than expected.  Super experience, and, most importantly, excellent quality food.  Best in the U.S.? Some say yes, some say no, but frankly, I don't feel the need to look anywhere else for Neapolitan-style pizza.
