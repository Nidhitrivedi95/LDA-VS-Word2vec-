LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Amazing food - The bread, OMG! The bread, it's warm, and addictive.  Moms lasagna is perfect, the 4 cheese ravioli melts in your mouth.
Great price about $15 a plate and well worth it.  Some of the best food I have had in Vegas for the price.  I was staying at the Wynn hotel, very expensive food, expensive does not make it good.  Walk across the street and have one of the best meals of Italian food!
