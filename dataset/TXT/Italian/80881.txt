dcFMlXIEun1ax2ebW_Y7-w By far some of the best New York Style Pizza I have had!
I went in expecting to just eat some normal pizza but was extremely surprised when I saw how delicious the pizza was.
To top it all off i was greeted by some young men that were just the kindest I ment in vegas 
They were really helpful by helping me deside what to eat s\o to these funny out going gentlemen 
Thanks alot 
Definitely can't wait to be back next week to eat some more bomb food!!!
S/o Oso And Angel Absolutely Great
