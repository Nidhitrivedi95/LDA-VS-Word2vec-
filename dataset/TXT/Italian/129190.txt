i53HvxUdQEMllZ1XmpjjyA My boyfriend and I were up late due to the crying baby and decided to order pizza. We put in the order in at 3:00am and it said a 30-45 min wait. 

After a hour I called and asked if the driver had left yet politely, the women who answered the phone was rude and had a nasty attitude. When she said the driver left I thanked her and told her to have a good night she said uh huh and cut me off by hanging up on me. 

Finally at 4:32 the food arrived and the pizza was cold and we had to reheat it in the oven, then the French fries were soggy and cold and frankly disgusting. 

The only thing I liked was the delivery driver, we asked to be called so he wouldn't knock and wake up the baby. He was very nice and the only pleasant thing about this experience. 

A hour later my boyfriend is stuck in the bathroom throwing up and I'm on the brink of it as well. Do not eat there food! I made the mistake of not reading the reviews first! 

Save your money, because this place was my worst food experience I've ever had.
