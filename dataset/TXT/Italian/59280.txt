ataRn8s6owt3SObGajp4KQ Great place...great service...great food! We plan work lunch here from time to time and never have to worry about going over our time break! This is a restaurant that gets it right! People are friendly and helpful! Location could be better...little hard to find because it's tucked back in off the main road but worth it when you find it! 
Must try the garlic knots!
