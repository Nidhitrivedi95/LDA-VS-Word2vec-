knyRhFaM4Bwa8AldEbOiqw I normally would give this location 5 stars but after the poor service I received last week, I can no longer give them my business. I ordered a pizza for pick up, as I've done so many times before. But this time, the pizza was not up to it's normal high standards. The pineapple chunks were too big and the sauce and crust tasted 'off'. The ingredients were just not fresh. I could taste the chemicals. It tasted cheap! This use to be the best pizza ever, but not that night!

The following day I called them up and asked to speak to a manager. I got Matt on the phone and I don't know where he learned to be a manager, but after trying to see if they changed suppliers, he was so dismissive in his response. I felt completely brushed off by his tone. He kept saying he'd look into it but they haven't changed suppliers in the past 12 months. But something was not right and I really didn't get the feeling he really cared. I explained to him about their usual high standards and how often we order from them, but I really didn't feel he appreciated that. So, I'll be taking my business elsewhere. I do not want another un-tasty experience. I don't give my business to those that don't appreciate it. Way to go, Matt!! You just lost a very good customer!!
