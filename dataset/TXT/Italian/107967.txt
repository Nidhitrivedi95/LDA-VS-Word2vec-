FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A Don't go after 8:30.  Their staff only cares about closing up and ignores anyone still in the restaurant.  Never received garlic bread and had to ask for refund; and they took away the iced tea from the beverage station with 5 - 6 tables still occupied.  May never go back.  Only giving 2 stars because food was good and the cashier re-stocked the Tootsie Pop display.
