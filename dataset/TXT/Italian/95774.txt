epWC7CGRbNHkXM7G2ulYzQ I've only been here for lunch and loved it.  Seat yourself on slow days, order from a counter, but they brought our food to us when it was done.  Clean and neat and even a game are for kids.  KIDS EAT FREE ON WEDNESDAYS so I really enjoy that, since I have 2 hungry boys.  Fast, friendly service.
