uEqkWCzfywBb8hCHhTquIA Wonderful place. Good service. Still new but very good food and owner very interested in knowing what things need to be improved. Had the Arancini. Was wonderful. Antipasti was also a delight and good variety. Fried zucchini was very light. Probably could have been cooked at a higher temp or for longer as they became greasy after sitting. Informed host and item was removed from bill. Wine list has a nice variety at several price points. Decor is wonderful and not what you expect from the outside. Will definitely be back and recommend others to try
