9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw What a great place! I yelped this restaraunt on the way to the airport. The service was speedy and the food is phenomenal. I got the funghi pizza with Italian sausage and my brother got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It was the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever tried. I only gave it four stars cause the service was a little awkward. Our waitress didn't talk much but it wouldn't be enough to prevent me from going there again. We will definitely be back!
