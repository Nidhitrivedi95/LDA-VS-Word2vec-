J4tO07oCDhwP3rdcgjjdxg Went on Saturday night. Place brand new. Nice decor. Good waitress and service. Bread very good. Calzone very good and large. Great price $6 plus $1 each item. Too much for one person. My only other food comment would be that the sauce wasn't very flavorful. I told the owner as he was circulating around the dining room asking everyone about their food. He was very attentive to my comment and was sincere. I would go back and try pizza next time. Prices are good but he has lots of competition for italian on mayfield.
