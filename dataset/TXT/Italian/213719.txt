r7IvPMyza853adkAvi1RNQ A nice, clean bar/pizza/Italian restaurant. It was completely dead when we went in there on a Tues night, just one rockabilly (with fake boobs of course) bartender/server working. We sat on a couple of couches in front of a cool coffee table that pops up so you don't have to bend down and eat your food (not that I minded). I got a PBR, which was served to me in a glass (not necessary) - PBR is more for guzzlin down on the cheap, not for tasting all the aromatic qualities, but hey we are in Vegas, so everything has to be fancified, even in Henderson. 

The main reason I gave Carmine's 4 stars instead of 3 was the entree. My spinach/mushroom calzone made with ricotta and mozzarella cheese tasted incredible. It wasn't HUGE; a place I go to in Atlanta makes them so big I always have leftovers even if I'm starving (and at 25% cheaper) bit this calzone was just damn tasty. It came with a saucer of marinara which I promptly added crushed red pepper to. Mmm! I think it was the dough and the ricotta that really did it and they didn't skimp on the fillings. Also, this place is 24 hours, which is always a plus. Woot. :)
