7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ I'll start off with the reasons why I didn't give it 4 stars.  Parking is quite limited.  You can't park on the side streets so valet is often an alternative.  Also, with the place being pretty busy, there can be a little bit of a wait for a table and you might be pretty near the adjoining table.

The pizza itself is really good.  You get to see them make it in the open kitchen so all the ingredients are fresh.  It can get hectic in the kitchen but it's cooked properly and with the right balance of meats, veggies, and sauce.  We had a margherita and it was very good due to its simplicity.  The rocket man added a few more distinct vegetables so that every bit didn't end up tasting the same when you put too many ingredients together.  Service was good and able to get drinks from next door as well.  Overall, another great pizza place in the Phoenix area!
