DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw I had a lovely time with my mom at Ferraro's! Apolo is a great server! We both had an appetizer combo, drinks, and dessert. Everything from the service, decor, food, drinks, atmosphere, was perfect. I heard about the place from an Uber driver while in town. I'd definitely dine there again if I visit Las Vegas again.
