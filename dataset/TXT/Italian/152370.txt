KsNZgnE0tFblW4Rfu72mZg Horrible customer service, horrible delivery service, and just overall ridiculous and pathetic. I can't speak to the food because after my scheduled order was two hours late and the customer service was so terrible, I sent my food back. I actually downloaded yelp just for the sake of writing this review because of the way I was treated and the service was so bad.  Do not patronize this establishment, don't waste your time or money, and find somewhere less awful.
