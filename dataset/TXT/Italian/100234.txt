fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w Let me first start off by saying the only reason I gave this place even 2 stars is because they play great music. We ordered an old fashion and a cranberry vodka, took almost 20 minutes for them to get out. We were planning on just hanging out ordering a bunch of stuff and snacking for a while. We ordered the calamari and a side of truffle fries to start. The food took 30 minutes to get to the table and both items were soggy and cold when they came out. The truffle fries ended up being about a handful of fries and two handfuls worth of cheese. All in all not worth the $50 we spent and we definitely didn't order any more food after the 2 apps that we ordered. Our server, Jason, never once asked us how the food was or how we were doing. Just not worth the trip at all.
