y0QzKWNVoXCbZpk6uhEgGA I have been coming to Mamma Martino's for about twenty years. The service is often less than desirable, however at a certain level that you come to expect from a family owned and usually busy place. When it's busy, I have no issue! You understand to a certain point that there is only so much that can be done. However, today may have been my last time coming here.

There were no more than 5 tables being served throughout my meal, so it was not busy at all. Not once were we checked on to see how everything was, which is a basic formality in this industry. I am not one to complain or make a scene over food, nor ask for freebies, and this was my first time complaining (very politely!) about our appetizer. The waitress didn't even ask about what went wrong or apologize and threw our bill at us, effectively letting us know she "did us a favour" by removing the app. Our food and drinks as well took nearly 30 minutes to get to the table which isn't normal for this place. Our apps came very fast, so we believe since we ordered the mains after we chose the apps that they forgot to punch in our order. Again, no apology. The table beside us that sat down AFTER we got our appetizers received their mains at the same time that we did. All in all it was a horrible experience today that had a domino effect on our enjoyment of the meal, and none of the staff cared.

I would not have thought that a restaurant that used to be a favourite of mine would become last on my list to go to, and be my first place I would ever send back food. Really disappointed!
