I heard so much about their freaking pizza here, and I'm sorry but you need to try Zachary's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/zacharys-chicago-pizza-oakland#hrid:D4WR-ODCz7HzmFihXKblQg/query:zachary's) 
and see what good deep dish is.

When I first walked in, EVERYONE said hello that worked there, which is fine I suppose, but its weird. Our waiter was helpful, but then later said it didn't matter how much I ate (after I said I was full), because I was just going to throw it all back up anyway. He apologized, but what the hell?

The food was just ok. A lot of freaking cheese doesn't equal good pizza.
