cs1qJvnWUg_f8g020z_3PQ Heard great things about this place, but it was a disappointment. The decor is great, but our service was terrible. Food was brought out at different times and it took a long time to get our waters too. My lasagna was a little bland. The best thing I ordered was the house red, and even that was just okay.
