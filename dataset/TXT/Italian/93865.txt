eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ A great impression from the moment I walked in the door.  They had outdoor patio seating with the heaters turned up.  Only one table was occuppied outside, but seemed like the heaters did a good job of warming up the area.  It was about 55 degrees without the heater going.  Inside, the lights were dimmed and the feeling was cozy.  

I ordered the wine flight and was impressed with the quality of the wine.  The wine flight gives you 4 -2 oz glasses of the varietal of your choice.  I went with the syrah and was pleased.  We ordered the Tapas Plate Appetizer which came with about 6 items.  The Swedish Meatballs were my favorite on the tapas plate but the grilled vegges were a close second.  I had the Ahi Tuna as my entree and was very impressed.  The portion of fish was sizeable and the mashed potatoes, spinach and asparagus were delicious and perfect compliments.  We got the chocolate fondu for dessert and I think the fruit was great but didn't like the pound cake that came with it.  

I'll have to go back on a Monday when the wine is 50% off.
