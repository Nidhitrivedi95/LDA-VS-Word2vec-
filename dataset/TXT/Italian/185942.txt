OnLlTiUpFRRNOmqKkDUnRw Who would have thought a little sandwich shop in a strip mall had the best tuna fish in town....well they USED to. I had not been here in a while (atleast since the new ownership transpired). I went in today and ordered the tuna and the recipe is not the same. 
***Please new owners, make the tuna how the previous owners did... there was a winner in that sandwich!
