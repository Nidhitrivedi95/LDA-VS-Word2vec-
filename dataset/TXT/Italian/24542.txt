4EfiNcKSsafogIhAjwv0gg DO NOT CONSUME FOOD HERE. You've been warned. Came here for a second time, the first time was a take out order and I did not see them preparing the food. This second time was a nightmare. I observed the woman preparing the food with her bare non-washed hands. When I pointed it out the man at the front got very defensive!

I let it go and continued to wait but saw her touching meat products and then touching other products all while not washing her hands once. Me being a vegetarian my fear of cross contamination kicks in and I again speak up to the man working the counter only to then notice a DIRTY damp towel laying right next to the loafs of bread I ordered for my eggplant sandwiches. The man goes on to throw the bread in the trash and puts on gloves to give me new bread (all while not washing his hands first after he had just taken a cash payment from another customer) so at this point we are both frustrated with each other I'm sure. 

I then ask if he could kindly clean the space he was attempting to prepare my food at as it was clearly and obviously filthy. This place does not clean after each order. Truthfully I don't think they clean at all. Needless to say I will not be dining here again.

Oh but I'm not done, after I asked him to clean the space he then tells me he was not going to do that and that he would give me a refund because the health inspectors come to inspect their business. Clearly they were not observing the same things I was. I expect my food to be prepared with clean hands at the very least if I'm choosing to spend my money on your food. A sanitary space to prepare my food would be even better. 

The man was very angry and upset that I called him out instead of apologizing and making the proper corrections. He rather lose a customer then own up to the fact that the kitchen and the cooks are very unsanitary.
