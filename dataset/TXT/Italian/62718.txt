I went her with a good friend of mine. We split the Tuscan fries, that come with a spicy marinera/ketchup. Really yummy

She order the seafood pasta and in her own words its the closest that seafood pasta has come to the best seafood pasta she has ever had in her life in Boston. 

I order the Da Dee Pizza which is sweet potato, kale and caramelized onions. So delicious and I felt great because I felt I was being super healthy.

They serve a small bread basket with olive oil on the table. 

We didnt stick around for dessert because we had a show to catch but I will definitely be back. It loses .5 star only because I felt the food wasnt hot enough when it came out and became cool rather quickly.
