3-6biVwm7VwPZ-k67jml-Q I enjoyed my dinner so much, I came back the next night to take more home. I love the family running this little gem, and appreciate the quality and freshness of their food. The penne with veal sauce was great, and the tiramisu was some of the best I've eaten. Looking forward to trying more the next time I visit my Mom.
