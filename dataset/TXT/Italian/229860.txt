My grandma liked the eggplant parmisan (a full inch of fried eggplant, the best in the valley for sure. I ate half because she couldn't finish it.)

I love the manacotti. Seriously, when are you ever going to make this at home? -For lunch it's $7.95 with a decent sized salad and a full side of spaghetti. Everything comes with free baguette and butter.

My uncle likes the garlic cheese bread.

My mom likes the shrimp thing she always gets.

My friend liked the chicken dish he had.

Inside is a little different than most places. The decor is traditional, the atmosphere is calm and cool, and you can't see or hear the traffic, so it's like getting out of Arizona for a minute.

The only difficult thing is remembering how to spell the name so your friends can find the place.
