qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA I used to go to Postino every now & then when I was younger, and oddly, when I moved back to AZ about 2 1/2 years ago this place fell off my radar. In the past year I've rediscovered it, and have been to all 4 AZ locations in that time (including this one twice).

I love all Postino's. The food is delicious & consistent, and the service is always friendly. Depending on when you go they can all get pretty crowded. In the two times I've been to this location (both midweek...once for lunch & once for dinner) I was surprised by the crowd. Despite the fact that it's right smack in the middle of ASU's campus I didn't get a real college-y vibe. Granted, Postino doesn't seem like a typical restaurant you'd find on a college campus. 

The one thing I don't like about this location is the parking situation. Since it is right on ASU's campus parking is scarce & it's metered everywhere. 

As far as food/drink, like I said, it's your typical yummy Postino. You can never go wrong with a bruschetta board (I think by this point I've tried them all, and I can't think of single one I don't like). The sandwiched are all delicious as well. Also the $5 glass of wine deal until 5 o'clock every day is great.
