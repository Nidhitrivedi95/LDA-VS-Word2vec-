Service: good 
Price: cheap
Ambience: meh 

Probably the cheapest steak you can get in GTA. Wish they know what they are doing though. Asked for a medium rare steak, and get a rare steak. Rice for chicken skewers was dry and had those cheap frozen corns, peas, and carrot pieces in it. 

Their concept is interesting...or should I say confusing...They don't have any story to tell. The ambience of this place reminds me of a food court. It is just a cheap restaurant that serves whatever they can make. They have a make your own pasta menu going on which sounds interesting. 

Overall...I recommend their breakfast menu and ribs (OK for the price). Don't expect too much from this place.
