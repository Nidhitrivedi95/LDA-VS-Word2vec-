n8fGqb4CCheGyWtr9KM6qw This place was very disappointing. Walked in on Mother's Day with a party of 4 adults and my one year old son. The waiter seemed annoyed and acted like there was no where for is to sit and he would have to "figure something out" when I could see two large tables open. Not only that, I realize it's a small restaurant but they only had two highchairs and both were In use so we had to spend our whole time there over two hours passing my son around to hold him and feed him on my lap. Service took forever 10+ min for drinks 30+ min for food. Very limited menu and food was ok. Small sad portions for the price.
