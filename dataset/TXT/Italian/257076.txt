w2b0ve7xpuCQkwYICFIUOg Good af. They had a lobster and salmon special that made me want to cry. It was so light and just melted in your. The service was good. The food was fresh and authentic. Best meal I had out in ages. The artichoke appetizer was simple and good. The bread was good. The service was great. The tirimisu was awesome. Definitely coming back.
