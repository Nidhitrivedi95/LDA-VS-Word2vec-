VnS3kmAmRyHeN9_lMPBp0g After hearing really good things about this place, I was excited to try it. My dinner was horrible, the service was friendly but lacking. I ordered the fettucine alfredo, which was not fully cooked and the sauce had no taste whatsoever.  I also paid to add chicken to it, which was a few tiny pieces of rubbery, inedible chicken.  My husband's pasta was not much better.  By the time the server finally came to check on us 20 minutes after we got our dinner, we just asked for the check and left.  It seems like a nice atmosphere, but we won't be coming back to give this place a second chance.
