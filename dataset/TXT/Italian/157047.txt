lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ Came here recently with a group of 4 people. We loved the food! We were happy to find a Buca di Beppo in Las Vegas strip. This location was great! The service was fast and the food was delicious. I highly recommend it for families and anyone in Las Vegas. Highly recommend making a reservation to avoid waiting for a table.
