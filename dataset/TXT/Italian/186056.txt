Oo1nQkuBnshQBy-iTpxiow I have to say that my boyfriend and I were treated like monarchs when we visited Medusa. You would think this would actually incline one to repeat such a  flattering experience; but the in-authenticity of it all made me realize my experience would have been different if my boyfriend and I had been dressed differently. 

Dressed in business attire having come from the office, my boyfriend and I were welcomed by the owner of the establishment. True story: we were given complimentary appetizers for no apparent reason (not that I'm complaining about that part), and while we waited for our plates to arrive, the owner proceeded to give us a tour of the restaurant, and his other restaurant upstairs (Arlequino Pizzeria). He then proceeded to show us a private banquet room, where he explained that such a hall would be perfect for an engagement party (wink wink towards me) or even a business conference (nudge nudge towards the bf). He capped it off with some information on the priciest wines from his wine collection . He then accompanied us back to our seats as our meals were being placed on the table, and gave us complimentary promo bags. 

I wonder if we would have been doted on as much if we didn't appear to be wealthy young professionals.
