Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw I have been here two times since I started working at UNLV. 

The first time I went after work to get some spaghetti and meatballs for dinner. It was wonderful! A huge portion that really filled me up and left me with extra to enjoy the next day. 

The second time I went, a friend met me for lunch and we each had a slice of Sicilian and the NY style. Two solid pieces of pizza. They were very efficient at getting the people through the line and they were fun people to talk to. Good atmosphere.
