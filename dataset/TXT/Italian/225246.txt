So132GP_uy3XbGs0KNyzyw Just realized that for claiming not to be 'An Italian food Fan', I seem to eat at a lot of Italian places.  My friends like Italian.  We were out and about around Nov. 8th and saw this place as we drove by.  I remembered reading about it in one of our Vegas Weekly magazines.....so a quick "U-Turn", and we were at CASA DI AMORE. 
ATMOSPHERE: 4-STARS, Even tho this was Friday and we did not have reservations, the host did not make a big deal.  We waited at the bar for about 15 minutes or so and were seated. I liked the two-man band and old time songs. Just a nice casual little dark, dive- type place. Old Vegas.
FOOD: 3-4- STARS, good basic Italian.  Not wonderful like LAVO, but 'go back, good'.
SERVICE; 4-STARS, attentive and good.
PRICES: 3 STARS,  Pretty much in line with regular Vegas prices. 
I will go back for a second try with my many Italian foodie friends.
