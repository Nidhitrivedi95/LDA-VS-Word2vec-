Lu5hB_5YtX5Re2067Zf3cg I found this place on the way to Zios. Zios wanted me to wait 20-30 minutes for a table for one so I said nope. I'm glad they did. The pizza at mezzanotte is delicious. I once yeld the opinion that you couldn't get good pizza in the US because of the lack of native born and enthusiastic Italians. MezzaNotte proves that wrong.  I can't speak for the non-pizza dishes, but I can say the pizza is good. 

What I really like about this place is 2 things, the atmosphere, and the quality of the food. 

The parking is pretty generous from many of the other places I've seen. 

This place does not exist without a huge irony. Most of the staff that I saw when I went were Hispanic. Their working language was Spanish and their front of house language was English. This isn't a bad thing, its just rather amusing to see Hispanic workers doing as well as native-born Italians. 

The best spot in this place: If they would move the dishes on the bar, is infront of the pizza oven. Its one of the primal urges that connects a person with food, and basic needs. Its a wood fired pit. 

The bad: The place isn't a very large place, and I had to wait for 15 minutes just for a bar stool. I can't remove a star from this as that I got the impression that the front of house matradee keep very good tabs on who was still occupying a table, and who was leaving.
