D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA What a gem!!  EVO has a chic and cozy vibe and the food is simply amazing!  We stopped in on a Saturday and were surprised to find out they have happy hour daily. The arancini balls were so decadent and the polpettine were so tender and flavorful.  Hubby and I both had pasta dishes which were also very good, but the highlight was definitely the brown butter babycake that we had for dessert. It took 20 minutes to make, but was totally worth it!!  The crust on the cake was perfectly crisp and then you bite into a creamy center complemented by whipped cream and raspberries.  To die for!!  Can't wait to go back!
