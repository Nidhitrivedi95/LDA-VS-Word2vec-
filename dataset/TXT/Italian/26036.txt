4KYnY1nNTaD7vb3Eo1G3Hw do not order from this location

i ordered a large grilled cheese stuffed pizza , i was called ad told that they are out of grilled cheese ad they only have regular cheese. i was annoyed because i wanted to try the new   product  but it was fine it happens . but this just the beginning the pizza was oily and soggy [check pictures ] . the previous time i ordered from this location the send me a pizza with the wrong toppings . this is a poorly manged location . what a waste of my money .
