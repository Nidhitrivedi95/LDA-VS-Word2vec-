qlg2QMEErgseygqs_MQETA Went for lunch with a colleague before heading to the airport for my flight home.  Good choice.  Nice sized, roomy restaurant with an open outside seating area.  It was such a nice day we chose the outside area.  The service was attentive and friendly.  

We both had personal pizzas, mine was the margherita pizza.  Before the pies came out we received a large bread for the table.  The bread was delicious.  It had the consistency of pretzel dough.  I loved it.  The pizza was very good.  It was cut into small slices and had the same dough as the bread.  Lightly salted as well, and with a nice sauce to cheese ratio.  It isn't NYC pizza for sure, but I would definitely return if business brought me back.
