She returned with beverages and pieces of scrumptious Italian ciabatta bread, fresh from the oven.  OMG, amazing!  Luckily, they sell loaves of this bread.  We ordered pizzas which were hand-crafted and baked in a stone oven. They were delicious.  We ended our meal with cappuccino and HOME-MADE gelato.  The strawberry gelato had fresh strawberries in it, and the lemon had a bright tartness to it.  This is the closest we've found to the flavors of gelato we experienced in Italy. So happy to have this new independently owned restaurant in Peoria!
