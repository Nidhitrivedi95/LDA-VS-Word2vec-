G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I couldn't wait to try Giada's Vegas restaurant because all of her recipes that I've made at home are impeccable (I'm a huge fan!). The restaurant is gorgeous--bright, chic, with lots of personal touches.  Server Elena was excellent.  I went for breakfast and had coffee and the Caprese Frittata, which was unfortunately overcooked. I got a spongy egg patty with raw caprese elements sitting on top.  Usually a frittata has the non-egg ingredients incorporated into it, so that's what I was expecting.  The patty had sundried tomatoes cooked in it which was kinda weird with the fresh tomatoes on top.  There are so many other restaurants in LV that I'm not sure I'll make it back to this one.
