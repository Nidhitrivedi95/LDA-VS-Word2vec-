wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g had a lunch on the Chrismas day...without reservation!
the courteous receptionist showed us to a nice booth inside without any wait!

we had 'insalata canelitto' ($8.99) and 'quattro stagioni' ($15.00)
the salad was gresh and the vinegrette dressing wasn't over powering.
the thin- crust pizza had 4 sections of dufferent toppings - ham, mushrooms, artichokes and asparagus. so yummy.

the waiter was very friendly, too.

really enjoyed a relaxing lunch with good food.
