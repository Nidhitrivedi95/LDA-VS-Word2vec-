The cheese tasted like rubber, pepperoni was small and crusty, the crust itself tasted like cardboard. I picked it up and the atmosphere seems pretty cool inside, just don't expect good pizza, this was by far the worst I've ever had. We got a large and threw the leftovers out, you know it's bad when that happens.
