QzJRy39dMq844mPzj9Mlfw I live right around the corner, so I've been here a couple times. The atmosphere is local, and the service is friendly and attentive. What wins this place 5*s  is the food - some of the best italian food I've ever had! Pasta, gnocci... even the salads have been delicious. The bar is beautiful as well. It looks very old but in a good way. I was so surprised by this place - it's one of those Bloomfield gems that I was very happy to discover.
