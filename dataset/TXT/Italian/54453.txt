abA0s0uxoeOn7zNm-1dDxw Ugh, what happened to Mia Za's? It used to be a great place to go to for a quick, customized lunch. Now the pasta is obviously frozen, portions are small, Alfredo sauce almost flaky. The amount of meat they give you is lackluster and the salad dressing is weirdly fake-tasting. 
Some pros are: big and roomy. Convenient location. Very customizable. 
I used to go often. Now I go never. Even with their price tag, it's not worth it. If you want cheap, quick food, do Chinese. Do McDonalds.
