pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Linguine and clams for me. The pasta was a little bit past al dente and on it's way to overcooked, and the clams too, I don't know, noticeable? Does that even make sense? "Noticeable" as in a little too much of a flavor, which makes you wonder how fresh it is... Also, I'm not used to parmesan cheese on my L&C. 

Pasta with arrabbiata sauce for him. "Very bland," he says. He also kept reaching for the crushed red pepper, which should be unnecessary with an arrabbiata sauce.

It had been years since I've been to Nora's. I used to have such fond memories, but so far, nothing can top Parma as #1.
