D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA I had a good experience, likely because of the great company... Anyway, EVO is just north of Indian School on Goldwater Blvd. The atmosphere is modern with subdued lighting. I started with the Scallops as an appetizer (decent), then I tried the NY Strip which was on the small side but well cooked and flavorful. The service was upbeat and prompt - I shall return.
