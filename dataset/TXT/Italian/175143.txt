ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw Went for lunch with the boyfriend. First time I've been here without having to wait. I'll admit the only reason i come to here is because of the service and that rosemary potato chicken pizza (I rarely support corporate, I'm too hipster lol) . My partner had the pasta which i was questionable on however it was great and spicy. Our server was so sweet and very helpful. She walked by with this cheese crisp guacamole plate for another table with I hated her for due to I wanted to order it too. Food does take some time but this place is a small establishment. I'll be back.
