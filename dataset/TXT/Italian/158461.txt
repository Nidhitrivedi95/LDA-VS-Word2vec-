LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA First time we are here it was a private event in the secret back rooms and it was incredible. So we've been meaning to come back and try it out as a regular punter. WOW. 

Fred was our server and he was the kindest looking person and a true gent. If the management actually read these things then please praise him from us and our team. We love him. 

So. 

Salads are STRONG here and we are large tattooed bearded meat eating machines, so trust us. These are mega. 

Lasagne. Hands down. Best lasagne we've all ever eaten and that's a promise. We eat ALOT of lasagne but this was insane. A little rich but we like that. Meaty, saucy, and sweet. How we like a chics . 

Love this place. Much love
