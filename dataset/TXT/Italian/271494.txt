xrA53WYhRCml2bMfpQ_Hig We went as a group and had a family style dinner the following was incredible:
Cauliflower 
Fig pizza
Seared tuna
Pig cheek
Eggplant pasta
Kale
Salmon 
Endives salad

And the list goes on. I will say the meat is a bit salty but it was delicious and the family style dinner is well worth the price tag. You really get to enjoy the chefs choice.  
You can tell the staff takes great joy in the space and the food and the experience.  
I definitely recommend going with a group
