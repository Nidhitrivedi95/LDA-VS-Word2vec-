My boyfriend and I were staying at Aria and wanted to try Carbone because the pictures looked amazing on our friend's SNS. We tried to make reservations for Friday night on Friday afternoon and it was booked so we decided to make reservations on Saturday instead. 

Service is superb. Complimentary bread, pickled cauliflower, and spicy salami when you get seated. They also come around with a cheese block for fresh Parmesan. I decided on the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka because Yelp said so ;) and because I was ready to devour carb after a week of salad diet. My boyfriend got the rack of lamb, this dish is MP but I believe it came out to be around $85. PRICY but seriously the best lamb dish I ever had. We also got a side of asparagus. All of the dishes were amazing. Seasoned to perfection. Rigatoni sauce on point. The portions are not huge but sized right. We were definitely full afterwards and no room for dessert. 

We were about to leave the table but one of the servers came by and told us to wait for the complimentary lemon liquor and italian cookies! The lemon liquor was so strong, the server said it was 100% proof.
