pa2Y633N7lG7SHCIriE8GQ An old favorite   I haven't been in a couple years
I was happy to be greeted and seated quickly 
The menu had some old favorites and some new items
The drinks were quickly served and so were the apps. The shrimp scampi was delicious and with plenty of bread
Salads fresh and cold
The porkchops are still good and big enough to share 
My meatball app was small but tasty. I didn't want to share 
The pasta was cooked just right 
Pizza for the kids
Overall it was a good experience. We will put it back on our list of go to places
