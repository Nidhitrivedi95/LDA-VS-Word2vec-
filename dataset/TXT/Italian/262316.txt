At first I wasn't a fan of North from my first visit due to the lack of service on a slow lunch afternoon. It was really disappointing. They also knew there wasn't any service because we received free Zucca Chips. They were good! I was really bummed with the service because I loved the look and feel of the restaurant. It felt like you were somewhere completely different than Camelback and 40th Street!!

As I thought I wasn't coming back, this has been the hangout for my co-workers and I!! We love the happy hour that ends at 6pm and is perfect for us just getting off work. We love getting the bottle and board for only $20!!!! What a deal! And the boards are NOT light, lots of food on it. This last time I tried their Sangria and it was really good.

I'm glad I ended up liking it again :) Thank you!
