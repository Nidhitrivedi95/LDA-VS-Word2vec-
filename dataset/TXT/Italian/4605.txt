_mg5bYknpZgaWSfjQVmrJQ Spinato's is our go-to pizza place, and with it being walking distance from us, we go there quite a bit.

They have gluten free options throughout the menu, which is a must for me. Second to that, the staff is educated on cross contamination and up front about their kitchen. The gluten free cheesy-garlic bread is *to die for* and the pizza is amazing, not soggy or limp like most gluten free pizza crusts.

The staff is always super friendly and the prices are reasonable for a family owned, quality pizza place.

Happy hour prices are great, and if you're just looking for some snacking/drinks, I would highly recommend going during that time.
