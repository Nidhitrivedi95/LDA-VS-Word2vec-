ppwYJPfE0tpSJA9X8l54cQ I've been here 2-3 times.  The pizza doesn't remind me of NYC pizza.  

Once I asked if they offered 'Grandma-style' pizza and the guy made a wise crack saying they didn't have that nor Grandpa-style.  He obviously didn't know what I was referring to.

In the Avondale/Tolleson area, I prefer Costco pizza or 1 Brothers Pizza over this place.
