Dlp6bJU71-iNI_TCrVzHJw Was driving through port credit today and had a craving for an Italian style sandwich. A quick perusal of the insauga.com top 5 list for best Italian sandwiches suggested this place as the number one of its kind in mississauga. 

Be forewarned though: none of the stores in the little non-descript plaza it resides in have any signage, so put your trust in Google maps and you should be fine. If you pass the hasty market you've gone too far. 

Walked in to find friendly staff and a clean, simple atmosphere with a minimalist approach to decor. Two high tables and some chairs pretty much rounds it out. Cashier and the store manager were both friendly, easy to talk to and willing to make suggestions. 

Tried the veal sandwich (around 9 dollars, toppings extra) - within a few minutes out comes a humongous, saucy, and great tasting sandwich loaded with onions and sweet peppers and cheese. Tasty, filling, and lots of sautéed onions which were great. I haven't tried on a bun or some of the other locally acclaimed choices so I'm not in a position to compare but Saucy Kytchen certainly did not dissapoint.

Would go back, and if I could make a suggestion - go there on an empty stomach!
