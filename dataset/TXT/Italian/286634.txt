zINKP9rtvo2IUKTZoYJUvQ We came here for dinner on the graduation weekend before heading to overture center for The Lion King. The food were amazing, super tasty and just perfect. We ordered cod and steak for our main course and we had nothing to complain! We ordered budino for dessert it is certainly a must try here!!! You won't regret it! Service is also super! The waitress we had was very good at timing knowing that we had a show to catch! Definitely recommend it!
