-httBl6DSZiUtDX4SQWtag Soooo I have a biscotti addiction. It all started with the red velvet biscotti from Crazy Mocha. Ever since I had one of those and dunked it in my coffee, I was on a mental quest to find them. On a morning stroll in the strip I came across Enrico and was extremely excited. They don't have red velvet but I love the chocolate chip and coconut.  They have other Italian desserts, I love the coconut macaroon which is the size of my fist and dipped in chocolate. Its like a baseball sized mounds candy bar.
