xAuRUPj5p04uvj5WRYa9Xg The food was decent. Nothing amazing. The pizza was a little off and the lasagna sauce was too watery. The location and decor is nice and the price was alright. The service was too slow and the waiter never came to asking us to refill our water or anything. It wasn't busy at all when we went. There was way better restaurants in Old Montreal. I would say avoid this place.
