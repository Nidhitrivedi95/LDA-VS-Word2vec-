Ehl4wwFZnB6WhiHt-0tIwA We went to KiWe Kitchen for some beverages and drinks. The ambiance was pleasant and the servers were nice. We had an assortment of martinis and beers and they seemed to do a good job on those items. 

The desserts, a tiramisu and a chocolate tort, were not bad and worth trying. It might be a place to try for dinner and the restaurant was busy during the 9:00pm hour.

Its just an A-OK for now! Good luck.
