I have been here so many times, and I rarely have a wait.  I hear from people that have never been here before that they don't want to wait 4 hours for a table.  

I just went this last Friday at 6pm and there was NO WAIT!  

I honestly can't think of a time I waited more than 10 minutes for a table!  Some times I'm actually sad that there is no wait because I do want to go over to Bar Bianco and hang out for a bit before going to dinner!  :-)
