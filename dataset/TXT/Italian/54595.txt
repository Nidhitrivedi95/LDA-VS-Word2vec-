Being a gyro lover, and with all of the competition out there, I would not choose this location to satisfy my gyro cravings.  The gyro meat was at the right temperature, texture, and flavor, but otherwise lacked any distinguishing characteristics.  The fries that were ordered along with the gyro were lifeless and bordering soggy, the house salad was merely a small bag of shredded lettuce with no dressing, and a few sprinklings of feta.  Furthermore, we had to wait more than an hour for our food to be delivered (delivery order), when all we had were two gyros, fries, and a salad.  The restaurant being less than a mile from our home, and no one communicating or trying to make up for the delay, left a bad taste in our mouths.
