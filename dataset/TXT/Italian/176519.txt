nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ Cute Italian restaurant in downtown Summerlin. I believe there is a location on the strip as well but I like this location better.

It has outdoor seating but since it's winter we opted to sit inside. There is a bar inside and as well as an open kitchen.

I started with a glass of wine. The waiter was very helpful in picking a glass of wine. I told him I was ordering penne al vodka and he suggested a red pinot. It was a great pairing! The pasta was also good.

Dessert was, of course, my favorite. We ordered tiramisu and it was the best tiramisu I have ever had. If you order dessert you must try this one.

The prices were moderate. Not overly expensive but not cheap. The service was good but we did have to wait a little while at the end of the check. Overall a good experience. My pick for best Italian in downtown Summerlin.
