I live right next to a Babbo - so we've been there a few times in pinch...
I thought it was strange when I saw the same fancy soda drinks on the menu.  Then the bread came out and it hit me - this is Babbo.  Same bread / same oil and vinegar set up.  
The food was fine.  It wasn't bad.  Based on all of these reviews I expected much more - but once I found it it was Babbo Under Cover - I was less than impressed.
A few friends and I are doing a little pizza tour of the valley and ranking them amongst ourselves.  That is why we chose this place as one of them - lots of great reviews for a pizza place.  We all agree that after having been to 5 or 6 places on our list thus far - this one is at the bottom.  Not trying to come down on this place - like I said the food was fine - nothing outstanding.  Probably good local spot for those who live over in that area.
