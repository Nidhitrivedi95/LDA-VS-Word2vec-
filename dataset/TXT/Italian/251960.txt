The staff is knowledgable about the wine they serve, the food and preparation methods used by the chef, which is nice to hear when making and selection. And though I'm not always a big fan of asking a multitude of questons before making a selection, it is nice to know the knowledge is there if I asked.  I've always been treated well by the staff and get the impression they know their restaurant well. 

 The wine selection is lovely but I would like to see a few more wines by the glass and more in the range of $7-8 rather than $9-10 on a more consistent basis. They do usually have a nice price for a bottle though and the entrees servings are very generous.  A delightful spot to while away some time and relax with a great wine.Overall, it reminds me a bit of a european bistro, a nice neighborhood restaurant where the staff knows its' patrons well and creates lovely meals.
