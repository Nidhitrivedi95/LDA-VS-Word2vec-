ymCESYHxTlGgvrMIB8VY0A I really enjoyed this place, we were a party of 6 for a birthday, they're great for groups. I started off with the lobster bisque, WOW what a flavour, nice subtle hint of cognac and lobster broth, delicious, also tried the fried calamari, they were fantastic with a nice spicy aioli. And I got to try the salmon tartar it was also really good, came with sweet potato chips.

As a main I took the chorizo pizza, the chorizo was nice and spicy and the addiction of the rapini and mozzarella with the tomato sauce, perfect mix. I also tried the gnocchi with rose sauce, the gnocchi were light and the sauce had a little hot of spice, amazing.

The real star of this place are there lobster dishes, the risotto with lobster looked incredible someone took it at our table and it looked like a work of art!

The service was impeccable, my only complaint is we kept getting bottle water without asking, at 6 dollars a pop... We ended up with 20 dollars of water lol. That's just a small problem, I would definite come back!
