Ua6pmGj4sVnm-XONmoynSg Been ordering from this Ray Road Pizza Hut for 6 years,  usually $50-$70 per order for parties at our house.  Now, this franchise has started charging for red peppers and cheese packets.  Terrible decision.  After complaining to the manager and driver, found out it is the owner of this and 5 other Pizza Huts around Tempe/Chandler that has added this extra fee.  We now order from a distant pizza hut under different ownership and pay the driver a nice tip to avoid this Ray Road business.  What's next, a fee for the box?
