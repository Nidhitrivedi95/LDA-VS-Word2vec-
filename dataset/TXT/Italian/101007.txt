This was our second time at the PV mall location--we were part of a group of six and actually scored six seats at the bar while waiting.  Not bad for a Saturday night at around 8:45.  The seats were at the outside bar, and while it was crazy hot outside, the misters and fans made it more comfortable.  Contact lens wearers should beware of the fans, though.  The pizza was very good (I'm from Chicago so a tough judge on this one).  We tried the El Picasso (a southwestern pizza), which was pretty good and came crispy as ordered.  Our friends opted for a more traditional pizza, which was also very good.   I definitely recommend ordering a salad or some type of app if you're hungry when you come in--because you're waiting for a table (can be long) and then again for pizza (can be another 45 minutes).  

I like the character of the Scottsdale Rd/Shea location much better, but just getting in on a Saturday night was a pretty big deal.   We'll be back
