z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ I absolutely love the dim romantic and cozy ambiance. It's fancy without feeling snooty. The service is fantastic and all waiters wear white dinner jackets with black bow ties which is a really nice addition to the ambiance.

The caesar salad is cool to watch be made tableside, but honestly it's not the best caesar salad I've had. That award so far, is reserved by Fleming's Steakhouse in Palo Alto (of all places...). 

The pasta for the veal papparadelle was impeccable--suuuuper fresh. And that bone in ribeye, medium rare, was just divine. No other words.
