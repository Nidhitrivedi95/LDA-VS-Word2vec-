v43qggsvaezDlZSC_IGJIg Their chicken and wings are really good, but I've honestly thought about going to the one in Millvale due to the rude people who work here. I'm also pretty sure they are charging around $3 for delivery even if you are just a few blocks away, and it still takes an hour. Stick to pick up and brace yourself for a less than friendly experience. For anything other than the chicken or for faster/cheap delivery I stick with Ron's.
