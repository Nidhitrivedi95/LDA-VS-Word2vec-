LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g I cannot believe this restaurant actually has good reviews, so perhaps I was incredible unlucky and everything went wrong in the kitchen. Anyway, here is my lousy experience: 
We were staying at the Stratosphere and where too lazy to go out to eat at some other location. So we agreed to check out the Italian restaurant inside the hotel. The place was cute, lots of people in there so we figured that it had to be good. The service was good and I water was really nice. I asked him what he recommended and he suggested the Mediterranean Linguine and since I love seafood I went with it. We were a party of four so we also ordered an appetizer of stuffed mushroom and garlic cheese bread. The appetizer came and the mushroom was alright. Nothing out of this world, it was all covered in a tick layer of cheese, so of course it was going to taste good. That was about the only thing that tasted good in our entire meal. The garlic bread was terrible. It was literally old bread with melted cheese and no garlic flavor. My pasta was discusting! All the seafood was chewy and over cooked. So I tried to eat just the pasta alone and it tasted horrible too! Everyone in my party ordered something different and no one finished their meals. The two gusys ordered steak and I guess it was ok (they both said that the one at the buffet was better) but their sides of potatoes and pasta tasted horrible. The other girl that was with us ordered veal parmesane and she barely touched it.
Then we got the $120 dollar tab , with gratuity included I have to add. And it was painfly to pay. EVERYTHING TASTED TERRIBLE! First time this happens to me anythwhere. Anyway, never EVER coming back
