cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q So last night I went with my family and we ordered some mushrooms, salad, soup, calamari, and the buy one take one. I don't know what went wrong but instantly I felt ill. I came home and took some medicine but it only hid the symptoms. Upon waking up I realized I have food poisoning and so does my father. We knew something sketchy was going on when a table of 3 took a while to receive our food when it wasn't that busy. Hugely regretting going there and will not try it again. Thanks for ruining my Easter weekend Olive Garden!
