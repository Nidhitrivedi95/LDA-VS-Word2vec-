2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg Poor design when we came in.....line to order has a door by it so everyone was passing in front and behind us to include servers. Not horrible but not great. Bathroom is down the street, so to wash hands before you have to walk out or plan ahead.      

Great smoked salmon entrée, but the hashbrowns were the worst I've ever tried....chewy and gross taste.  My BF had an entrée with hollandaise sauce that the server said he would bring a side cup of the sauce which never happened.  It wasn't a big deal but considering the water is self-serve, I'd expect a little more service for other things. Overall not great but not horrible. We both liked our main dishes, but I won't go out of my way.
