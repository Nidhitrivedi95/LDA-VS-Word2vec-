pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ I love this place! 

I had their gluten free pasta and pizza. It was to die for. Usually after you eat pasta you will feel so stuffed, however after eating here I didn't feel "heavy" at all, which was pleasant :) Their waiters are so nice and friendly. This place is located inside the Miracle Mall where Planet Hollywood is, so it is a great place to stop by while you are shopping!
