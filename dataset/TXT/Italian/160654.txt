liCPyfxs-CYXAV_zAmB9dw This place is right next door to my old house- so its an extension of my kitchen!
It used to be the old Honey's Beestro, which closed down (cause it was crap) Ganzi is AMAZING! The service in impeccable, the waiter remembered my wine of choice and name after I had not been there for a year! The food is incredible, seasonal, and while it is on the pricier end, I have never been disappointed! The decor is amazing and a great place for a private function. I LOVE IT HERE! 

This place is always full of hot chicks!!
