H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g I love this place. The Margherita pizza is out of this world. For dessert, I get the dark chocolate dessert which is a warm chocolate cake with peanut brittle, dark chocolate malt gelato and peanut butter gelato. I highly recommend it. Can't wait to return here for my next vacation!
