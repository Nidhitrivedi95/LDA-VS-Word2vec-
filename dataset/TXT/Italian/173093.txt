N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg I've been to Lou's in Chicago and was amazed at the quality and quantity of the pizza and salads, but now they are in Phoenix!!!  Of course we had to go, and the line was long, just like it is in Chicago.  However, they have this great gadget that sync's up to your phone and it tells you what number in line you are, and the anticipated wait time.  You can browse around and not stand in a crowded restaurant waiting to be seated.

We did find a place at the bar during our wait and we were served quickly and were not neglected so the 45 minute wait went fast.  We pre-ordered our pizza after check-in so our two deep dish pizzas were ready within minutes after we were seated.  Genius.

Number 1:  The service is great, despite the wait.  The staff are very friendly and efficient.
Number 2:  I love the deep dish pizza and the flavors; my husband could take it or leave it.  Everyone has their own tastes on pizza, and for me, it hits the spot.

I live across town so we won't visit too often, but it's definitely on the list when we want something special.
