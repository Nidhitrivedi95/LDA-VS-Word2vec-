AWJhMTYsIYzCIYAIUA-waA We were in the area and decided to stop here for a late lunch.  When we entered, there were several people waiting in the front area but the dining area was less than 1/2 full.  After standing unnoticed for several minutes, we were just about to walk out when a hostess apologized for the wait and informed us that there are not enough servers to serve the entire dining area so there would be about a 15 min wait.  No problem, so we sat in the waiting area with the others.  After a couple seconds, I couldn't help but notice the extremely high-pitched, continuous noise coming from the kitchen equipment.  As much as I tried to block it out, I found myself getting almost an instant headache, which is quite rare for me.  It was at this instant that I decided this just wasn't worth the wait, no matter how good the food is! So we left and went to Chili's a couple doors down :)
