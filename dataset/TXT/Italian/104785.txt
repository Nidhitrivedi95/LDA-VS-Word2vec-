fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ Really one of the worst meals I have ever had.  The stuffed mushroom appetizers were cold, calamari was  bland and rubbery , the prosciutto and mozzarella cheese had flavor ..only because the prosciutto was salty....My eggplant parm  was tasteless, pasta over cooked, the lasagna was burnt and the pasta was over cooked...the fish had too much flavorless breading...blandblandbland... We talked to the manager and she said they have a new cook and he need to put more salt and pepper in the food...yeah..that won't help. ICK! If you have taste buds don't go here.
On a good note...our server Lamad was really great. If not for him, this place would have really been a total loss.
