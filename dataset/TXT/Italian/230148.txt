With that said, I've had nothing but positive experiences. The place itself is beautiful. The staff is attentive. The food is delicious!

I have had the chicken scallopini and it was very good. The last visit I tried the eggplant rollatini and it was also very good! 

I would highly recommend this place if you were looking for a place to have a shower or any other gathering and I will definitely make a trip to further explore the menu!
