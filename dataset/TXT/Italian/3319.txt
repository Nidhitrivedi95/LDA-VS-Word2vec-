_4noxz6NM0gBeVhZ58Emtg Great food and baked goods.  I always order the meat lasagna.  Very tasty and generous amount of meat.  For the price it's filling and satisfying.  Try the meatballs as well.  Tastes good.  Meaty and dense. 

I've tried every pizza flavour they have.  Favourite is porchetta.  I get pizza at lunch and its always freshly, tasty and great quality ingredients.

For dessert, try the lobster tail and cannoli. Also, nutella and pistachio cream puffs are worth checking out. 

Personally, I'd skip the gelato and donuts.  

Service is very poor and lining up can be tricky. The servers are very slow and not friendly at all. I'd give this place a high rating but it is a shame they're lacking in the service department.
