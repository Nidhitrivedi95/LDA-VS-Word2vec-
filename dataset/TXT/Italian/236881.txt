tXJkGjBkGOZHWAcCmlzS6w I walked in here with a group of (8) friends after having dinner down the road. It was later during the night and the server asked if we were going to have dinner, we told him that all we wanted was drinks and desserts. He asked to stand for a moment and told us that he had to take the tablecloth off the table because we weren't having dinner. He said that those tablecloths are expensive and he then put some paper over the table. We walked out. Never going back to this place. I don't usually review bad experiences, but this was really rough, especially having people from out of town.
