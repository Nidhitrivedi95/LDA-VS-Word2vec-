r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA Super Friendly Awesome Helpful Staff! It was so busy it was a bit intimidating at first, but after we entered we realized they had everything under control! The line moved fast and the ambience was welcoming and calm. The food was unbelievable! and the dough even better! We re-heated our sausage and pepper sandwiches for dinner and the bread was even better heated (in the microwave!) A must go to for locals and visitors alike!!
