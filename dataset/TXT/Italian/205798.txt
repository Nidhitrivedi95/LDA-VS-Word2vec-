qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA We stopped in to the restaurant with my wife and two small girls (5 & 9 years old) on our family vacation. We were not sure what to expect, but it was one of the best meals we have ever had. First, the staff was very friendly. Our server could not have been nicer. Also, everyone who stopped by our table with food or drinks were very nice as well. So great with our kids. Our server suggested a nice bottle of wine which was amazing, yet reasonably priced. My wife and I had salads while the staff brought the kids out fresh blueberries to eat while we waited for our food. In addition, they also brought out the most AMAZING garlic knots I have ever had. They were almost like garlic muffins with butter and garlic...WOW!

Our dinner was great. I had spaghetti with the filet mignon meatballs which was very tasty. My wife had a delicious vegi pizza. Kids has basic pasta which they ate up quickly. Overall, just and amazing meal. I really wish we lived closer so we could dine at this restaurant all the time. Great food, good prices and kid friendly...what could be better. I highly suggest restaurant and can wait to visit when I am in Vegas again.
