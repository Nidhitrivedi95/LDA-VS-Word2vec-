CPgyfcsyPegLha1ajaSRoA This is my favorite Italian restaurant. I love everything about this place. The service is always great, we typically ask for Jamie C. if she is working. She knows us and what we like. They have the BEST oil for your bread. There is nothing like it! I wish they bottled it and sold it in stores! I could just go there for that! Their portions are huge and never disappointing. I enjoy the lobster Mac and cheese and crab bisque the best. But I have tried to many things here that I honestly can say nothing is bad. Their linguine and clam sauce is so good, light but yet very flavorful. Their desserts are also very yummy. They always have so many options to pick from it's hard to just get one. I really like their peanut butter pie! I love this place and it is a must go for you and your family!
