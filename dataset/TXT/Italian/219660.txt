SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg First time in this restaurant. We got a table right away. The waiter was good in taking our drink order and the drinks were amazing. the steak was cooked just the way we ordered and the side dishes were amazing. the best part is that all the food was on happy hour. A very classy place for food and drinks.
