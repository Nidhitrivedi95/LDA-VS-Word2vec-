38-sjGYYVcQEKrZe5Nu47A AHHHHH-MAZING!! I called in for pick-up and ordered a pasta dish with a pound of wings. The smell on the drive home tempted me so much. The food was great and the wings were perfection. Being from the east coast -- I know wings and these were amazing. Will definitely order from them again and hopefully stop by and hang out inside soon.
