n4uDGwRGtJ3vW2Adbha_wg Very rarely do I give a 5 star rating to any restaurant (let alone anything - I'm pretty picky)...however, Decca 77 earned that 5th star! The ambiance, to say, the restaurant layout overall, the distance between tables, service and the overall decor is lovely! The lighting is dim but not so much that you cannot see the person in front of you. It's rather romantic actually (so yes, perfect for a date night)! Now to the good part, THE FOOD! Every plate is made with care. The flavors are heavenly no matter what you order! The chef(s) have a talent for both matching flavors and presenting their meals in a way that's almost "too pretty to eat". 

Not that pretty though. Simply too delicious not to take another quick bite!

Bonus: they offer coat check so you don't have to sit uncomfortably with your coat around you or sprawled on your chair.
