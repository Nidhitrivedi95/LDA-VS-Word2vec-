oH6QAuoTLFaX97oqqpLTMg Good NY style pizza plus they deliver. Is it authentic NY style pizza? I have no idea. The last time I ate a slice of pizza in NY was about 20 years ago. But compared to similarly styled pizza in Vegas and other cities, it's top-notch. Huge slices, lots and lots of toppings, and the crust is a little crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I usually just get pepperoni (it's hard to screw that up) but last time I tried their veggie pizza and it was delicious (although it was weird to have broccoli on it). Their garlic bread is pretty good and the meatball sub was decent, although it could have used more sauce.
