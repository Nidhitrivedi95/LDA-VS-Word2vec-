G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Finally made it here! Took three separate attempts in order to finally secure a reservation, but it was worth the wait. Amazing how completely packed it was even though walking through The Cromwell was depressingly empty. First impression was this amazing panoramic view of the strip. I was the first of my group to arrive so found a spot to wait at the bar. My plan was just to order a martini, but I can get that anywhere so I decided to look over the fun specialty drinks. What actually got me was I saw someone else's cocktail with this really cool ice sphere displaying Giada's signature G. So I opted for the Destroyer which had tequila, fresh tangerine and basil. Delish! Lucky for me, the friends I went with have a similar passion for food so we order a lot and everyone shares. That way we get to try a little of everything. Bacon wrapped dates, lemon crab arancini, arugula salad with candied lemon and crispy pancetta and the scallop risotto were all amazing. We also ordered the 28 oz bone in rib-eye finished with lemon and topped with a sunny side up egg which I was really disappointed with. Although the presentation of it was impressive, it was over cooked and a bit on the tough side. Unfortunate especially since that is supposed to be one of the signature dishes.
