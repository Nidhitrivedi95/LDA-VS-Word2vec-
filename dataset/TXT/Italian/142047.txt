JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A BLINDLY following a group of people past a narrow front door, I found myself in front a stairway to somewhere.  At the top, we got a glimpse of the restaurant decor which had a nice cafe/bar mood but after a couple steps we were back on a second set of stairway to the CAGED roof-top patio which reminds me of some ancient apartment patio's back in Hong Kong.

Also reminds me of stories of Hong Kong Karaoke joints in apartments that catch on fire and people try to stomp on each other to go out the ONLY exit.  The good thing is that the cages here look wimpy so you might be able to leap across the other rooftops during emergencies.

Services was very nice with efficiency as long as they can REACH us through the single-row stairs that remind me of the original Donkey Kong where people are the barrels and make it difficult for Mario to get up or down the stairs.  Be POLITE and let the servers with Food or Dirty Dishes go first.  

We were provided lots of Ice Water to combat the heat and I think Shari M. got comped for her Italian Peach Premium Iced Tea.  To Susan C., it was more like Italian SNAPPLE Peach Iced Tea.  

Dulce de Leche Cheesecake($7.00) was pretty good with Choco shavings on the side but probably work best with some fruit on the side to cut some of the sweetness with every bite which actually was not overly sweet.
