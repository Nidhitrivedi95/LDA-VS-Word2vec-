3-6biVwm7VwPZ-k67jml-Q This is the best Italian food I have ever had in AZ. It is fresh and homemade (not processed), some of the ingredients are imported (imported for a reason--they are authentic and amazing) and the flavors are marvelous.  I recently discovered that the person who runs this restaurant mentored the guy who runs Pizzerio Bianco (also excellent)! That makes a lot of sense.  I am gluten free, so they make an eggplant sandwich without the bread for me and it's fantastic!  The wine is also very nice.  The atmosphere is casual, friendly and unpretentious.  I almost didn't write the review in fear of having it become too crowded as everyone's favorite Italian place!
