DmgWQ9UiAEfovtDpa_-OKw I must admit I had my doubts about a restaurant "specializing" in both German AND Italian food but my wife suggested we go there.  I was pleasantly surprised with the overall quality.  The jaeger schnitzel was pleasantly tender, thick and nicely breaded with a savory, but not overpowering, gravy, sides,  The accompanying roasted beets (made fresh) and a tangy, yet sweet, German potato salad perfectly complemented it.  The homemade, delightfully flaky, apple strudel with a mysterious, delectable drizzle, was a perfect end to the meal. Our server was very attentive (albeit it was a slow night).  

There were some minor nits to an otherwise wonderful meal.  First, the lemon in my first iced tea, which was refilled quite attentively throughout the meal, may have not been kept cold enough as evidenced by a slightly carbonated and bitter sensation it imparted to my drink.  Also, the hot bacon dressing was quite heavy on the vinegar which made me unable to taste the almost pulverized bacon pieces mixed in.  They would be better off using recognizable pieces of bacon, a bit of sugar and a lot less vinegar.  Lastly, this is the only time I have ever been to a restaurant where no bread is offered with the meal, which I must admin I am very partial to having, so its absence was noticed.  These concerns will not be enough to keep us from returning (although I may try a different salad dressing next time).
