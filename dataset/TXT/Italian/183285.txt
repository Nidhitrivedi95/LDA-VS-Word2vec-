OdHYF4rxY94qMz4AUaDxXA This place has decent food and the waiters are friendly...my only pet peeve is that they cater to only the local customers, I guess they do not want foreign tourists who visit Montreal to spend their money at the restaurant, otherwise they would have a bilingual menu, like most of decent restaurants in this city, and a bilingual website, as well. I tried the table d' hôte, including the bruschetta, the Caesar sald and the teriyaki pasta, good food, nothing spectacular but good enough. Eventually I will come back.
