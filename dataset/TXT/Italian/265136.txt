wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw Usually we have a really good experience here but this time was awful. It took over an hour and a half to receive our food and we noticed that multiple people who had come in after us were getting theres before us. My boyfriend had to leave before the food even came because he was gonna be late to work even though we got there more that two hours before his shift. It was also not as busy as it could have been. I don't suggest coming here for brunch.
