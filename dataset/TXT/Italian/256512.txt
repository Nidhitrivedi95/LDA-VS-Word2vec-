w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q Based on the food alone, I would give this place 5 stars. Everything we had was prepared perfectly. We had a good sized party and absolutely everyone was thrilled with their food.

The service was okay, but unremarkable. Definitely had better service at some other high end steak houses, but it certainly wasn't bad.

The big problem with the Palm is the ambiance and the space. They literally cram as many people as possible in there. You get absolutely no room whatsoever as other diners and staff are totally on top of you. Additionally, the acoustics are horrible and the sound just bounces all over the place. As a result of that, and all the people they pack in there, the Palm is one of the loudest restaurants I have ever eaten at. Good luck holding a conversation with someone.

Despite how good the food is, I doubt I will be back unless they move to a bigger space with more room and better acoustics. Las Vegas just has way too many good restaurants to bother going to a place this loud and cramped.
