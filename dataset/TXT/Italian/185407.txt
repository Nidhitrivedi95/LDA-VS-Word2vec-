oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ I came for dinner and had a seat on the patio. The ambiance was nice and staff was decent.  The menu is pretty extensive and contains all things Italian. 

The bread to start was very tasty and has an amazing rosemary and sea salt flavour. 
I ordered a soup to start and got the stracciatella. It was much more filling than I expected and tasted great. For a main I got the orecchiette In house pasta. The flavour of the ingredients were good and well put together though the temperature of the dish when served wasn't as hot as I thought it would be. 
For dessert I shared the tiramisu which was the perfect amount of sweetness and had good texture, but could've had a stronger coffee flavour. 

Overall a nice scene to sit outside and have an enjoyable night with friends
