kR4NBNFf5SLpeAtZ-uPoPg Yum yum yum! This place is really authentic! The owners are  lovely people from Milano Italy, where competition is fierce...In North Scottsdale I haven't seen any places like The Amore Gelato; They allow three gelato tastings per person! Three sizes,mix n' match flavors, under 6$
I had the cannoli with candied fruit pieces,chocolate & hazelnuts and rum raisin for a delicious medium combo that brought my tastebuds back to this summer in Milan within seconds!!! Definitely going back to try more treats!!!
