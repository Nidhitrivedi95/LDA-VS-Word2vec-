LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA The service was phenomenal.  Our waiter was perfectly pleasant, witty, and attentive.  The food was incredibly delicious, and the pricing was very reasonable.  Be prepared for a considerable wait without reservations, but I would highly recommend for anyone visiting the Las Vegas strip.
