zxsktAMsVBKj2PvvCV11UQ My fiancé and I went for restaurant week, and I would not have put this on the list for restaurant week. The food is overpriced for what we ate. She had the She Crab Soup (which was amazing), the grilled filet and shrimp (which did not have much flavor, the asparagus was the best part, and the mac and cheese was meh), and the lavender crème brulee (tasted interesting at first, but in the end was great). I had the lamb slider (delicious, and their fries were actually seasoned), the blackened salmon which was placed on top of a salad (it was alright, but I only could taste fish, and no seasoning on it. The cucumber salad was all but that, it was mainly lettuce with a few cucumbers), and lastly the Caramel Apple Cannoli (they were small, but they tasted great, it comes with caramel drizzling with cinnamon apples, so it isn't like the actual thing is a caramel apple, even though the taste is pretty close). The waiting staff did not seem to care about paying attention to their customers, and that caused an unhappy experience. I would not recommend this place outside of restaurant week because I have a feeling the prices will be too much for the experience you will get,
