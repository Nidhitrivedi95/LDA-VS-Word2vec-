TLbx_MR2dyFztoyR5d9H2A I visited this restaurant on numerous occasions and will never go back after I found a dead fly in my salad and flies inside the restaurant.
The restrooms are dirty and no soap in the men's room.
The pizza isn't anything like the restaurant in Chicago or the pasta sauce .
The pizza is always over cooked and the owner doesn't accept criticism very well.

I found a true Chicago restaurant in Queen Creek Arizona called Baci Italian Bistro which has authentic Italian food and the best thin crust pizza I've ever had. The 

We revisited this place before Christmas and the place was empty and the service was absolutely horrible.!! We ordered pizza again this time it came out burned. The cheese was black and of course we sent it back.!!  That will be the last visit to SALERNOS.!!  It's very obvious when they are selling Groupon's for $8.00  for $15.00  value during the snow bird time your business is doing poorly.!!  We will stick with Giordano's and Lou Maloti's both now here in the valley .!!
