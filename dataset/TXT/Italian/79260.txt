-1 star for the entrée I ordered. It just wasn't that great.
It's really a 3 1/2 star review.

We made reservations for a late night dinner. Our table overlooked parts the Palms, the Rio hotel and partial views of The Strip. We got complimentary bread to start off with while our waiter brought out our drinks.

My baked penne pasta with sausages and brocolini was definitely nothing to write home about. It's very filling because it's covered in a thick layer of cheese. I'm not a big fan of cheese....especially if it's overboard like that. The sauce was a semi-spicy tomato sauce. Overall, it's a bland entrée. =( I was disappointed. I'm sorry but even dishes at Olive Garden tastes better. I know, I know....a lot of you may be hatin' on me right now...but sorry. That pasta dish wasn't good...so I advise you to pick a different dish other than the BAKED PENNE PASTA.

My special someone ordered a Flat Iron steak entrée and he loved it. It was cooked to his perfection.
We got some side dishes; compliments of the chef. Our favorite side dish was the loaded mashed potatoes. (I'm sure someone already took a picture of that.)

Just when we're already super full.....out comes the waiter with a complimentary dessert!!!!!! My goodness.....we're are NOT dessert people at all but I felt bad to not take a bite out of our cheese cake drizzled in raspberry sauce + chocolate chocolate cake. WOW!!!!! The cheesecake was delicious...the raspberry really helped balance the "heaviness-filling" feeling of the cheesecake.

We definitely walked outta there with our tummies super full.
Will I be back? Yes, I would. I'll just order a different entrée. The view is too gorgeous to pass up and not eat here again.
