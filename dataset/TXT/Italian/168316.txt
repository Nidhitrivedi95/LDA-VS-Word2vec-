mJYzopHZZEXVJJrsue34aQ Tommy Vs serves a burger they call the millionaire burger... lamb and beef combined, sesame seed bun with cheese and great toppings. Unfortunately tried to order it medium rare, and came out more like a leather hockey puck. The fries along with it are hand cut, and well done.  Tiramisu for dessert was great. Good bar, but few craft beer selections. I would go back but definitely consider ordering other things.
