r6jbUGiyoN05mZ13apQGgw Our friends love this place so this is the second time they ordered delivery for their party & the same two pizzas that they love.  The Badabing or something similar & the Meat Lovers.  I checked their menu & what a unique pizza selection!  I have never been into Mama Depalma's & have only had them twice here at our friends.  

They order the same two pizzas so I was excited because the first time it was great!  Maybe that was because it was a large, not a level above large, SUPER large lol wow!  It was enough for the ten of us.  The larger the pizza, the more greasy!  I couldn't soak up enough grease w/ the paper towel.  Being that it's summertime, I hate to say it, but if I'm gonna waste calories or have a cheat day, I want it to be worth it!  I didn't feel that way & wish I said let's try Grimaldi's this time, my fav pizza that they've never had.  One slice of this ginormous pizza was like a whole personal pan pizza!  The toppings were sliding off, it was soggy & it was horrible!  Not to mention a stomachache after!

The delivery guy both times was fantastic is all I can say positive.
