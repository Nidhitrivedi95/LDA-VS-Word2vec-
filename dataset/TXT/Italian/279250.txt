yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w One of the places I have to go to whenever we're in Vegas.  I've been telling everyone how much we like coming here.  The atmosphere, food, wine and the acordian dude.  OMG always a fun night.  This time had the shrimp scampi. Fantastic!!!  Finish with the BATTISTAS Cappuccino and what great dinner.
