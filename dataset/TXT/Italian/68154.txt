Bs8AvNO3xWoURWpqiGd_4w I was forced to handle some business on this side of town and found myself eating lunch at this Macaroni Grill. I normally stay in Scottsdale and abhor the west side of the valley. Oddly enough, the entire experience was phenomenal. The bread was warm, the drinks were cold, and the food had the right amount of salt. The service was attentive from the server to the hostess. Even the lanky manager, Larry, came by to see my table. He cleared plates and made a tiramissou recommendation. We ate it, it was ok. All in all, if I have to travel to the west side again, I would eat there. I do love salt and fat.
