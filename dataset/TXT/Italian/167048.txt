Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw This is now our favorite Italian deli. The food is spot on. I had the meatball parm sandwich, and my wife had the Rigatoni Bolognese. The sauce for her meal was honestly incredible! We also had garlic knots. All the food was delicious. If you come at lunch, there may be a bit of a line because this place is so popular with locals--always a good sign. The owners and servers are East coast Italian, which adds to the experience. Know what you want to order before you get to the counter or you may get a little New York attitude.
