Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag I was really surprised at how much I actually enjoyed this restaurant. We had just arrived in Las Vegas and we were starving with no dinner reservations. We hopped the train from Bellagio to Crystals at City Center and within minutes we were seated at a booth overlooking the cavernous Crystals bottom floor. What a treat! While we dined, we were treated to a quasi-flash mob of dancers as well as various duos of dancers performing modern and classical dances. Without a doubt, these are the most coveted seats in the restaurant!

There was no pretense at all at this "celebrity" outpost of the famed Wolfgang Puck. It was casual and comfortable, and the service was attentive but not overly so. We started with the calamari fritti which was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. My husband had the Veal Scallopini. It arrived as an abundant plateful of succulent and tender veal 6covered in mushrooms and artichokes. My hubby, who has a huge appetite, was "complaining" he was full about half-way through his plate.  I had the Eggplant Parmesan which came with a side of Capellini Pasta. It, too, was a generous portion of delicious eggplant which was not overly breaded or greasy.  (I consider myself an eggplant parm connoisseur and order it whenever I see it on the menu.)  This one did not disappoint! Like my better half, I could barely get through half and was bummed that I had no place to heat it or store it back at the hotel to devour later.

What impressed me most, after the food and unexpected entertainment, was the modest bill. With all we ordered as well as a glass of wine and a martini, we didn't even hit $100, a feat I wish we could duplicate at other LV restaurants named for a famous chef!
