3qrfY-XCUKVyrO5T6GskqA We ordered in trays for a coworker's retirement luncheon. It was a great idea, it was a massive amount of food for 15 people. I've previously eaten with the Cranberry Township location and I'm not a fan as the food tastes processed but I really enjoyed the Alfredo pasta creation. If I was craving quick pasta, I would go here for the Alfredo.
