M1U7h2PUg_smJI8fgeixOw If I could give zero stars I would. Was sold a burnt custard tart and I'm not talking about the general top being spotted with black... but the crust was burnt so badly that it was absolutely disgusting. I don't know why they have so many positive reviews as their food quality in garbage. This was the WORST custard tart I have ever eaten (I mean taken one bite off, turned it over noted the black hard crust and threw it out). I  will certainly not be returning, as they clearly have no pride in what they serve customers. It's the first time in my life I have been sold and served something that should have been long thrown out.
