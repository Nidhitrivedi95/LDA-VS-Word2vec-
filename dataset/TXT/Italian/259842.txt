wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg I'm mixed about this place. On the one hand it's good Italian food, if not best in this 'hood. It's a short walk north of eglinton subway so convenient to try. On the other hand, if your wanting Italian food, is say little Italy is your best bet for authentic Italian cuisine. Gracie is a very large location and lively atmosphere which makes it a great outing. One very special thing about this restaurant is how all ingredients are fresh for there dishes and you can taste that for sure. Friendly service each time. If uptown and in the mood for Italian food this is the best option w/o a doubt;
