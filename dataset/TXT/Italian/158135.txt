LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Pretty much one of the best places in town for Italian food.  If you wanna do some shopping and get some grub, go to the Fashion Show Mall and find this place.  Greatest Lagasna you will ever have.  And their cheesecake is to die for.  Amazing service and the atmosphere is not stuffy but very nice.  Have a large party or want something more intimate, they pretty much do anything for you here.  And they even have private banquet rooms for parties!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!
