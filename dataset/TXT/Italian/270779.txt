XPDzKfrq5uzz4o82eCZI7w this is a nice restaurant bordering on fancy. the best thing I can say is about the natural, fresh selections on the menu and the decor which is old west, old cowboy and western movie-themed .the pictures on the wall inspired by old postcards, oil paintings and prints of the cowboy way of life are fantastic. the service was prompt, knowledgeable, friendly and very professional. the place was a bit formal for my taste, but it looked like couples, families and work parties would be very happy here. tucked in the back of strip mall of a busy road it's not easy to find..for a NY-er. but it was delicious. unfortunately the Chimichurri sauce was too strong for me and I did not feel well after all, but it was a joy to eat steak here for what it's worth.
