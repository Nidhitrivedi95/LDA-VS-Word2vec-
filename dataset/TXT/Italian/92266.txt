eH96MBK-EAcC0Q-lYqIb8Q Stopped in here for lunch on a business trip. My local colleagues recommended this place, said it was fantastic. I couldn't agree more. It's a homemade lunch and comfortable seating. Beats a fast food stop hands down! I had the pork schnitzel, mashed potatoes with gravy and my favorite part was the fennel corn romaine lettuce salad. Wish I could get that recipe!!! If anyone know what goes into that in addition please message me!!
