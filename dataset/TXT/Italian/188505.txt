When you are seated they bring out olive oil with balsamic vinegar on a plate with some small slices of bread that appears to be made of the same dough they use for the pizza crust. We split a Mista salad which is perfect for the 2 of us. The place is both attractive and plain at the same time. Nice decorating accents make the place look inviting right when you get in the door. Other parts of the dining room are rather plain however with plain tables and chairs. The place always looks clean however. I'd definitely return and recommend to others.
