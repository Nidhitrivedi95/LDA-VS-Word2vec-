Well, at least at this restaurant. In the past I have come here for lunch and have felt satisfied enough to come back- they would have had a 3 star if it was just based on that experience. This was the first time I came for a dinner and was truly dissatisfied. The pre-fix dinner included 1 appetizer and 1 entree. I chose the Bocconcini Pear Melt with (supposedly) a divine (according to the menu) balsamic reduction vinaigrette . It was a disaster. I would be embarrassed to let that leave the kitchen. It tasted and looked like canned pear.  They attempted to melt a completely tasteless bocconcini cheese on top with a droplet of balsamic vinaigrette. The cheese was like the texture of my finger. Just awful. 

If things couldn't get worst my entree was the most rubbery, bland steak I have ever had in my life. The potatoes on the side were so dry that I did actually choke on them. The only good thing that I had at Nevada was the Shiraz. But - that is not enough to have me return. It is unfortunate because I really did enjoy the lunch I had in the past. But, once a restaurant loses touch with their food..they begin to lose touch with their reason for being.
