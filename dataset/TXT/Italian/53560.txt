a4MVM9E9022sYFrrYWy9DQ I am definitely a fan of this place, which in my opinion, has the best pizza in the city. They have a wood-fired oven in their kitchen...this place is the real deal.

On my last visit I had the Pizza Campagniola, which is topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy Italian sausage, roasted red peppers and grilled eggplant. It was so delicious and savory accompanied with a bottle of Peroni, their house Italian beer. The only time I can eat an entire pizza is at Marcello's because it tastes so darn good.

The atmosphere is sometimes boisterous, but that seems to be because they are more family oriented at certain times of the evening. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Let them talk you into a slice of their amazing tiramisu. You'll fall in love.
