The lights, being surrounded by the city and the summer evening weather set the tone for a great night. Service was fast and the hostess was very accommodating. We had dinner on the first floor which has a menu of meatballs. Being vegetarian I've never had meatballs but when I saw veggie meatballs I had to see why this was a menu item. Holy. Moly. The veggie meatballs did not disappoint and I wish I had at least one extra stomach so I could've kept eating. It was so good!!! The pesto almond sauce was bomb and complimented the veggie meatball with provolone perfectly. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice. I can't say enough how delicious this dinner was. I would recommend this place to everyone.
