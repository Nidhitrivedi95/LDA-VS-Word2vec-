And if the menu description says "Tuscan mashed potatoes" you would expect a side of mashed up potatoes, right? Well, my order  had no shrimp and no mashed potatoes!! $21.49 for the dish and I'm missing two parts of it?! What kind of restaurant does that?? Never going back again.  Warning to others, if you order take out, make sure all your food is there!
