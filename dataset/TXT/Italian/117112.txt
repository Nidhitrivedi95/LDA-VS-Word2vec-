gvmhnxxuS6BrPoIuBYd6dw Nancettas is amazing!! I can't believe this place only has 3 1/2 stars! If you love authentic Italian food like I do, this is the closest to Italy that you'll get in Pittsburgh! 

I had dinner reservations on a Saturday night for my boyfriend, my parents, and I.  When we arrived, we sat at the bar for a drink before we sat at our table. We ended up making great conversation with the owners, a fabulous couple who are both so sweet! They even brought us out a plate of his homemade Soppressata. My father has had a lot of soppressata in his life (including his own family's homemade in Italy) and he said this was the best he's ever had! The rest of us agreed with him as well. They also had homemade bread with an amazing olive oil dipping sauce. They kept bringing it out, and we continued to eat it! 

For dinner, it was a beautiful June night, so we decided to eat outside. All of the other customers were also eating outside ( I don't think anyone was inside eating). Their patio is so cute, covered with trees and umbrellas! We continued to have amazing service during our meal by both the owners and our waitress. For my dinner, I ordered chicken piccata and shared a side of the gnocchi with Chris. Both were amazing! Everyone else said how amazing their meals were too- eggplant parm, veal parm, and Chris tried rabbit (which was actually great!) 

Since we were there to celebrate, we also decided to get dessert! Even though we were all full, we saw the table next to us order dessert and we were basically drooling looking at it. The 4 of us shared the lemon tart & the raspberry chocolate chip gelato. I am not much of dessert person but these were both amazing & the perfect ending to a great meal! Even if you don't live close to Nancettas (like us) it was worth the drive! I cannot wait to come back!!
