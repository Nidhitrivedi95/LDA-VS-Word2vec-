_W-qUlstqSuWZzvIOxTEXw If you view this place as a bar, then it's very good, as previous reviewers have described.  Excellent views, libations, and people watching.

But the restaurant aspect is much flimsier.  The food menu fits on one small sheet (4 paninis, 5 mains, and 5 salads).  The mains come without sides, which you need to order separately.  I've tried the halibut and roast potatoes, finding them OK but nothing exciting.  The dessert menu offers a bit more variety, though I haven't had any.

On this particular night, the waiters were slow; I sat at my table for 10 minutes before the waitress came by.  But this may have been an exception, judging from other reviews.  Everyone was definitely pleasant, polite, and cheerful, so that's a big plus.

All in all, I give it three stars as a compromise.  It's an excellent waterlooking watering hole and a mediocre restaurant.

Tip #1: Entrance is from the outside facing the water.  It's hard to reach from inside the mall, and you end up going outside anyway.

Tip #2: Remember to order some sides with your main.
