4qQVf2lt-47VcQ4v54PEXQ My mom found this place and it is a hidden gem!  We went for dinner with my two year old and everything was amazing.  My mom and I split the grilled chicken salad and between the two of us we couldn't finish it.  We ordered penne with red sauce for my daughter and thought we might get a couple of bites, but she ate every bit of it!  Everyone that works there is really friendly and we have already been back for round two!
