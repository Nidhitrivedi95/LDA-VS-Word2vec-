4YKU46PNs-wCi3TAafrRaQ Barros is a great "go to" for quick, but delicious pizza. Better than most of the chain places in the valley & their service is normally friendly.

As far as food, pizza is great & I like the style of crust that they use. Not too tough, but not too thin (Im not a huge fan of cracker style). We usually get the classic pepperoni pizza & a side of breadsticks with cheese.

This time we actually stopped in for a simple order of wings-- teriyaki & medium. Both sauces were very flavorful & our wings were juicy, cooked just right! We also ordered a side of the breadsticks with cheese (a favorite from Barros).

The restaurant wasnt busy at all, so our service was prompt & friendly.
