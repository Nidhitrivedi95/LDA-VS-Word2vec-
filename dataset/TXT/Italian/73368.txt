cKXMA7AoyvrFKaZzNOp0nA From start to finish, my expectations were met and exceeded.
We shared with a calamari appetizer, very fresh and perfectly
Fried with a delicious marinara dipping sauce. The portion was very 
Large. I had Oso bucco and my guest had chicken piccata. Both dishes
We're among the best we've had. The room, which was full yet was blessedly Quiet, we could actually carry on a conversation. The service was Attentive. 
Delicious food, beautifully served in an elegant room.
Perfect!
