6PqYwabO2g1r2ZB7eImOiw Will never go to any Olive Garden again! The waitress says do you want dipping sauce it's extra, we figured maybe 1.00 or so NOT it was 3.79 for each single scoop, maybe 1/4 cup of sauce! You could buy an entire jar! Then at the end she tries to push the end of the table charge device, flips it to face the kids when I say no I don't like those, and of course the kids start touching it and I end up getting charged 1.99! What a scam that is! The food was very expensive as well for pasta and chicken. Will never go to Olive Garden again.
