SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog Yes it's only 8:45 in the morning but I am still having Rigatony's withdrawal. Can you guys ship in bulk the spicy Italian sausage rigatony dish and some stuffed shells?

Also, it's not on the menu but you should ask for a blended cappuccino pie with cafe patron or baileys (like a milkshake). It's a secret menu item!
