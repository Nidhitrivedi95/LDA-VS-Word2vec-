bCrMHwCLZzyKsAUOiAL0OA If you are looking for respectable New York-style pizza by the slice, Ray's is worth a visit.  If you're only interested in taking down a whole pie, don't fret because you can get that here too.

I have had their cheese slices, sausage slices, mushroom slices, and Sicilian pieces on many occasions.  All of these are good options, especially if you are looking to taste a vestige of New York cuisine.
