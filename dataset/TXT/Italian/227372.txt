SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ We hate here several times over the years and always liked the food. This time we had Philip for waiter and he took care of us. They don't have carpaccio on the menu but he asked the chef and since they had the ingredients they did it for us. Since the chef was the only one to know how to do it he did it himself. And it was damn good! Thank you to chef Paul and Philip for going the extra mile. Food was perfect and we had a wonderful experience even though it was during busy Christmas season.
