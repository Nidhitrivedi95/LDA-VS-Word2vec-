yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Just a hop, skip, and a drunken amble off the Strip, Battista's was an unexpected delight. From the outside, it looks like a sleazy bar, maybe an extension of the liquor store next door. The inside looks like a low-rent version of Buca di Beppo, walls cluttered with photos and inscrutable memorabilia. I was worried that the food would taste like Buca, but my fears were assuaged. 

They start you off with the "free" wine and tiny glasses; my large party had carafes of white and red. The white was perfectly pleasant "chablis," and though I didn't sample the "burgundy," my companions pronounced it to be nearly palatable.

Then the garlic bread appeared. Like an idiot, I gorged myself on it. It was quintessential - fluffy but chewy, loaded with salty garlic-ness. 

The minestrone soup (also included) tasted fine, though the base was a bit gummy. Most of my tablemates opted for the salad - I just do not understand.

By the time my lasagna arrived, big as a brick and covered in molten cheese, I was so full I could only take two bites. But man, was it good! 

The food is very straightforward, American-style Italian, cooked to generally pleasing textures. Very appetizing stuff. So good that I took several more bites of lasagna than I should have. 

To cap the night, they offer you this little mug of cappuccino topped with whipped cream. Honestly, it tasted like hot cocoa, which is fine by me!

The prices were outrageous, of course, this being just off the Las Vegas Strip. At $25, my lasagna was one of the cheaper entrees on the board. But considering the extras, the large portion sizes, and the appealing renditions of American-Italian classics, I'd say it's worth a shot.
