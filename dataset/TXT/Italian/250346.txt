vNQkym5qZ-E-4AJ4IQ5JEg Our all-time favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  We have been coming here for years and it never fails to provide a comfy, cozy, welcoming atmosphere and simply unbelievable food.

Let's start with the appetizers (you get bread and various dips before but please take my word for it, try not to eat it, you will thank me by the end of your meal).  My favorite is the meatball, it is giant, perfectly seasoned, sooo flavorful, covered with tons of sauce and gooey provolone cheese.  Seriously the best meatball you will ever have.  Make sure to share this bad boy with at least one other person because it is HUGE.

Next you get a salad with your entree.  The salad is refreshing, well balanced and very tasty.  Pine nuts, very sweet raisins (I love these things), gorgonzola cheese, nice dressing, peppers and greens.  Considering how heavy everything else is, the salad is perfect.

Next you're brought out pasta alla vodka.  The vodka sauce is creamy, flavorful and goes excellent with the spicy olive oil mix they give you.  If you like spicy make sure you put some of that oil on.

Now onto the mothership - Veal Milanese.  Let me end all debate and discussion - this is THE BEST VEAL CHOP YOU WILL EVER HAVE ANYWHERE.  Simply AMAZING.  Perfectly cooked, lightly breaded with pine nuts, crab meat, olive oil, natural juices, it is seriously PHENOMENAL.  MUST TRY!!!  Everything is great, but I have only tried those other items off other people's plates because I ALWAYS get the veal milanese.  However, the steak here is incredible as well.

Lastly, I love their take on Tiramisu very unique.

Let me say again, the best restaurant in Pittsburgh and THE BEST VEAL MILANESE IN THE WORLD.
