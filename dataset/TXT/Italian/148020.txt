KcW_eVY0T0NSwlbXqUrRuw Me and my fiancée were given some sample meat to try by the server. After trying the sample, we decided to get one order. Upon getting ready to pay, we realized that the dish was veal meat and came to $28.70. As it was a food court, we expected the cost to be $10-$15. Little did we know, the price would be double- triple our expectations. When I asked where the pricing for this dish was, the cashier told me it's on the signage, which was quite hidden in the corner and in French. If you cannot read French, I would be careful eating here. No complaints about the taste of the food.
