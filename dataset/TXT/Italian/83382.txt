DitQU2Y-WONolisjxP-2nQ We were coming back to our hotel from a Jays game and just wanted to grab something and take it back to our room. This Pizza Pizza was really close to our hotel so we went in. 

I've never had Pizza Pizza before being from the West coast.  I think they have them in Cineplex theatres, but no where else AFAIK. 

They have slices available, but some looked like they had been out for a while so we went with their $14.99 deal ($2 more for XL). Any size pizza with 3 toppings, 3 cans of pop and 1 dipping sauce. It was pretty solid for 2 people and the pizza was fine. Might not be the best pizza, but I enjoyed it.
