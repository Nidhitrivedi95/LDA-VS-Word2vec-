DWPAFq8HdzGzo2vhKixDJA Very clean and it's a nice place. My girlfriend and I had different experiences. I had the brisket and I thought the portion was a little small. She had the catfish and loved it. The brisket was ok but nothing special. The cornbread and awful. The sides that came with the dinners are fries and slaw with no substations. I'll try it again but I don't think it's special.
