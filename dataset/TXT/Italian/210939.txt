qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ Waiting over 90 minutes to get 2 one item pizzas is flat out stupid. I can't plan my day around will I want to eat pizza 2 hours from now. Plus they waited till I payed and then told me it will be another 20 minutes. Don't care how good the pizza is if the service is like this.
