The pizzas were thin crust & tasty. The food was a positive for us. We were told it depends on what your order, at times the food can be bland. As for the service, they were friendly and accommodating. They sometimes talk to their patrons like they are children instead of seniors, but perhaps that's their attempts at talking clear and slow for the hearing impaired. Our plates were dirty and had to be replaced. When we were getting our leftovers to go, the food was not packaged for us; instead we were given the containers. For a senior hang out, one would think they would offer to do it. That's all the feedback I have. Hopefully next time will be a better experience altogether.
