Gm---0O1y_4TAQAl5qKvqQ We were given the wrong pizza tonight when we went to get takeout in the middle of helping friends/family with a move.

Normally, getting the wrong thing when I order takeout is a huge bummer for me.  I'm a little particular about what I order, and I'm just annoyed when it's wrong because I was looking forward to whatever I thought I was getting.

But this time?  I did not even care!  The three pizzas we actually got (whatever they were!) were soooooo good.  The only tiny bummer is that one seemed to be some kind of white pizza.  It was delicious, but the sauce they used on their other pizzas was the Platonic ideal of pizza sauce so I kind of missed it on the third one.  But, still not really disappointed!  Because even the no-sauce one was phenomenal!

Hope whomever got our order was equally happy with the veggie no mushrooms we'd ordered!  :)
