CSaVK9wgqe2_tQuuCDINyQ Amazing! Being East Coasters... My wife & I are completely burned out from looking & trying these "NY STYLE" pizza joints. 

We search NO MORE! The search is OVER! We are home again! Amazing service, food, portions, quality, atmosphere, etc. 

They're even child friendly. Balls of pizza dough for them to play with! 

The cook "Frankie".... 2 words... AMAZING COOK! Knows NY crust & cooks it VERY well. And his chicken parmesan was killer too! 

WILL DEFINITELY BE RETURNING FOR MORE!!
