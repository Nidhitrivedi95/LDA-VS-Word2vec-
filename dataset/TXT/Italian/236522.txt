Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA Stopped by to grab a bite here with my daughter. The ambience is nice and I really enjoyed the music selection they had playing. The food quality was good, but a bit expensive for what I received. Didn't get a chance to try the pizza, but will on a future cheat day. I'd re-visit, but wouldn't make it one of my regular spots to hit up.
