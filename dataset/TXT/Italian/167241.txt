Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw The picture of the homemade mozz drew me in. Boy, was I sad. It was a $7 ball of tasteless solid white rubber. This is not the "fresh homemade mozzarella" any legit Italian would be caught dead selling. I'm embarrassed for you, Cugino. Either learn to do it right (and sell it only while fresh) or don't do it at all. Absolute waste of money.
