As someone who has eaten at many restaurants this one didnt live up to expectations. The bread is ice cold, the food is quite bland.  At the end of the meal they bring you bubble gum, the kind you has as a kid, rock hard.

For our dishes we ordered the portobello pizza which lacked flavour. My friend ordered the baked eggplant which had way 2 much sauce. For the pasta we had the chicken fettachini which the pasta sauce didn't stick out.

If you are looking for a great Italian place to eat that is at the same price range with better tasting food. Go to seven numbers 2 doors down.
