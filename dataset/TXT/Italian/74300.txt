cpkBJhBujpBFZ0rOItE-4g My mom went to Ruffino's and thought it was really good so we decided to give this place a shot. When you first walk in there a small bar that looks a little cramped but the dining room is pretty big. Nothing really stood out with the decor. 

Anyways, we started off with fried calamari and it was a huge appetizer. The batter on the calamari was very light and cooked just right. I thought it was really good. Also, they gave us little pieces of garlic bread. Outstanding. Really good. Everyone gobbled it up so we had to get another basket. 

So each meal comes with soup or salad. I got the salad and I thought it was really big dinner salad it had mixed greens with cucumber, mushrooms, and tomatoes. The salad dressing was great. Not overpowering because at some places the vinegar is a little too much. Not here. Really good. 

I had the Seafood Ruffino. It had shrimp, scallops, muscles, and clams over a bed to pasta with a red sauce. I thought it was pretty good. I thought the red sauce could have tasted a little better. It had a good taste but not great. My wife had the chicken primavera. Chicken was moist and she enjoyed it. Hugh dish. 

To end our meal was tried the chocolate cake and cheese cake. I thought they were good. Not great. I'm used to these Italian restaurant having great deserts.  

The service was top notch. Server took care of us and he was always checking on us during each portion of our meal (appetizer, salad, entree, and desert). Our glasses were filled on a regular basis. The only thing is the server did his job very good but didn't feel like he had personality. Very business like. Seemed like all the servers were like that. 

So really good service, good food, and huge portions. Not a bad place. We'll see if we can make it back to this place.
