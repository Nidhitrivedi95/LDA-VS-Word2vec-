SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg The food at Lago is very good. It's tapas style, therefore, the portions aren't very big but what you do get is very good! We really enjoyed the view of the fountains. However, the service we received was poor. We were ignored at our table we had to call for the server when we needed more water, when we wanted to place our order, etc. At one point one of the hostess was near our table and I asked her if she could take a picture of my boyfriend and I and she said she didn't have time. I am giving it a 3 star rating only because the food was good and so was the view.
