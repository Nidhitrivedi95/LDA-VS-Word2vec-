5dy8OiWJty9AuxBcBzeBZQ Whatever you do, do NOT order the spagettone meatballs! I can't believe an Italian restaurant can't make a meatball. Crazy dry, dense and rock hard. Burnt on the outside...for $26 (3 meatballs) it was ridiculous. The only thing to write home about was the egg yolk ravioli. That was good. Service was meh. Not really impressed.
