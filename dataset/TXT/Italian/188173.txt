Story: Just last week me and my girls were in LV, and a promoter who was getting us a table and such at Wasted Space, in the Hardrock Hotel, had us eat at AGO for his special promotion. We had a 5 course meal for FREE, as long as we paid for our drinks. They actually only charged us for one round, $36.00 dollars later we tossed trey 20's on the tab and moved on to the club. So the meal and a couple rounds of drinks turned out to be very inexpensive!

The courses: They brought us bruschetta, which was great. It was spicy, just the little kick this app should have, and the tomoatoes were fresh and tossed in a tastey vinegarette that was also used on the mixed green salad it was pared with. Next 2 bowls of pene pasta were brought out. One with a light marianara and one with a creamy alfredo. The pasta was cooked perfectly, but sauces were better when mixed together.

Lastly 2 thin crust pizza's were brought out. One was a plain cheese, and one an artichoke, feta and proscuitto. That was the bliss. We didn't need the desert after all that food, but I'm sure it was good as well.

What a great night, definitely one to remember! So if ever in Vegas ladies, cruise around the Hard Rock Hotel and get yourself some free grub at AGO.
