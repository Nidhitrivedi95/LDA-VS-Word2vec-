aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw My girlfriend wanted to try this restaurant mainly for the ambiance.  It was quite stunning inside.  Although it's mainly a seafood restaurant they had several vegetarian pasta and salad options for me.  It seems their specialty is whole fish and they bring a cart filled with fresh fish to your table so you can see what you're about to eat.  Great wine list.  Mixed green salad to start was quite good.  For an entree I ordered the gnocchi and honestly though it was some of the best I've ever had.  It would easily compare with gnocchi I've had in NYC.  The desert had a very fancy name and was very aesthetically pleasing.  My girlfriend is still talking about it.  The wait staff was beyond excellent.  They are exactly what you expect from a fancy restaurant : friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.

As a side note men have to wear collared shirts and no shorts or sandals.
