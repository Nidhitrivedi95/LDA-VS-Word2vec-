UcjkMUsguCsYihmzjYdlUg I have some family friends over at Varennes and we often go have breakfast or dinner at this mikes. The staff is very friendly and the food is great, the ambience is quite calm for a family restaurant, loved that. The food is great, (yes, I said it twice) nothing to complain about. Service was quick and the waitresses come often enough to refill my coffee.
