7qo6rqDjlHds8ObxzxBD4A Food was excellent as always, but like I said in my last review, only go to Lindsay and Warner for the best service- Kelsey is just a GEM! She was the sweetest waitress we've ever had, cracking jokes left and right. She filled our drinks without us even having to ask and was on top of everything. We asked her so many questions and she knew the answer to everything, we were SO surprised to learn she has only been here and has only been serving for two months!! Definitely get her as your server and chat with her for a while- she's such a sweetheart. Best dining experience we've ever had all thanks to Kelsey!! (with a y not an i ;) )
