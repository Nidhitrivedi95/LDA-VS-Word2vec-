ewEDv_q-K0fV0FepkHB8sA This was my favorite place to bring friends and family for late night drinks and the delicious streak sandwich. So why a one star rating? On a visit last night, after one drink, my son was carded. Which is fine. The problem is that my son is a bar owner in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. But the server and others at the Tornado evidently are unaware of this basic geographical fact. They believed that a Puerto Rican state I.D. was false. There are many layers of stupidity involved here. But it's a very pathetic level of ignorance for a bar to not recognize "foreign" identification.  When it was pointed out to the manager by an attorney in this group that the manager was racist, the manager called the entire group of seven "assholes". There's more but it's for a civil suit to decide.
In conclusion, if you're lily white and have a state I.D. from Wisconsin, you're ok. But if you're "foreign" or have darker skin....stay away. At least until the group protests are organized.
