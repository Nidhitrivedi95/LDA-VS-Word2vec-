Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A I really like the vibe in this place. On top of that, our server was perfectly attentive without being annoying and she even cut us a little break on our bill. 

We started with the artichoke appetizer, which was disappointing. It came in a cream sauce and was baked and smelled delicious, but just wasn't. The sauce was bland and the artichoke was awkwardly cut.

Then, for the main course, I ordered a pasta dish called the Voodoo Penne that had a cream sauce and a cajun chicken that was a tasty departure from the appetizer and even had a little kick to it. 

The wine list was impressive and they offered a few different wine flights. And my favorite aspect here was the decor: very chill, conducive to conversation, and stylish.
