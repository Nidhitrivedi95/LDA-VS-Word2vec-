Een2yret0IwJUpHLwcxtRg I have been here twice and it's definitely going to become a ritual. It's right next to my pediatrician's office so it's easy to grab lunch there before going home. Both times we had no problem getting a table and there are high chairs. Awesome!

The food is fantastic!!! Authentic Sicilian! I had some questions about the arancini and compared them to a dish I had in Rome. They were able to explain the difference and the meaning of each of the words in Italian. It was fascinating! 
 
My latest time there I had an classic arancini ball. It's a fried risotto ball with bolognese meat sauce and peas inside. The perfect size - the size of an orange - and was a filling meal when I added a cup of wedding soup. My son got a piece of plain pizza and devoured it. I had one bite and knew why! SO GOOD. 

The set up is simple, order at the counter, grab a drink from the cooler. Easy and quick. The decor is so cute with lots of orange accents, which made a lot more sense when I found out the arancini means little oranges! 

I highly recommend this for lunch or dinner!
