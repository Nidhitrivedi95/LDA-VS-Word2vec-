NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ Really wanted this place to be better. The food is ok, but the sauce is too acidic for my taste. Really dug the lasagna explosions and the garlic knots. Pizza wasn't nearly as good as it looked and the chicken parm sandwich was tough, and as I said before, the sauce was a little too acidic. Service was great both times we went there, and I would go back and give it another try just to try some of the desserts!
