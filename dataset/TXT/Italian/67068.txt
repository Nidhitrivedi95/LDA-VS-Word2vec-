bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg An Englishman, a Frenchman, a Catalan and a Colombian walked in as our research had shown that it was indeed possible to find a Pizzeria in the US that did authentic thin crust pizzas and we were not disappointed.

As we didn't need the portion sizes usually served in the States we chose to share two appetizers amongst the four of us and the server was happy to put out 4 place settings and gave us a run down of the interesting beers "on tap".

The Pizzas were very tasty and full of flavour and the crust was spot on, lovely and crispy.

For dessert, which we ordered out of pure gluttony, we split the Bread and Butter pudding amongst us,just enough and we left having had a very pleasant meal, in a friendly environment and delighted to find a Pizzeria that does Pizza right
