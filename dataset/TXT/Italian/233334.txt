TNz-jO5giwObxMkbj9wAag I visited Otto with a big group of people for a friend's birthday and was pleasantly surprised.  Overall the service was relaxed and friendly.  They had no problems accommodating a large group and were patient with explaining various menu items to some of the people in our group with dietary restrictions.  The food itself was better than I expected.  Usually in glitzy places like this, the food looks good but is just alright at best.  But this was really tasty.  I had the homemade tagliatelle with meatballs and spare ribs.  While it was pricey, I easily could have split this dish with a dining companion and we would have both still been satisfied.  The desserts were equally good, well presented but also quite rich and decandant.

The decor is really special.  Lots of red, and unexpected textures.  It was the perfect backdrop for a birthday celebration (and lots of picture taking).

While I will not be running back anytime soon, I will keep this one tucked up my sleeve for future special occasions.
