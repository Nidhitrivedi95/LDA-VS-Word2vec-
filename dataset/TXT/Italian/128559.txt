Hz9aGjQAuMxBi_9dBFjejw This place was very close to our apartment so we decided to try it. I heard it's a chain restaurant so we thought it would be good. If you want to get a View from your table just ask to see if there are any tables available along the back. We were lucky enough to get a view of the Belmoral hotel! We started off with their garlic bread. This was amazing! You have to order it. We also tried their bruschetta, which was also amazing! So from these foods, we thought our main course would be great as well. Well, my husband's dish, which was a Seabass dish was delicious. But my pizza tasted like from a cardboard box. You know like Celeste. Which equals the one dollar frozen pizzas at your local grocery store. Not sure if it was because I got their classic option versus the rustic option. But it was horrible. The kids spaghetti was ok. 
So I guess my only bad review was on the pizza. Everything else was all right. But being that this was a pizza joint, you would think the pizzas would be amazing. Just keep that in mind if you try this place out.
