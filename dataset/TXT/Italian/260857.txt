wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g Probably one of the more decent meals I had while in Vegas, but still quite average by my personal standards. 

Nice atmosphere - located right in St Mark's Square. 
Friendly guy but extremely slow service! Water being forgotten, can't place dessert order, no refill on olive oil, etc... 

Not too many vegetarian choices and limited customizations because apparently the food is pre-prepared in the mornings, not made to order. 

Portions were very inconsistent - while some entrees were huge, others were tiny!
