HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q I came here every morning to have their ham, egg and cheese on a toasted croissant. I know, I'm weird, but it was sooooo good! I also loved that they had fresh squeezed OJ. 

Also, if you don't come here for breakfast I do highly recommend this drink called the "That's Amore". OMG! Heaven in a cup.
