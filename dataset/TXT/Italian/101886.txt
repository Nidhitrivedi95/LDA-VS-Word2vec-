fe8jmKzXtGvMVQDUvW0pGw Maybe my standards aren't as high as Peter's but I liked the food.  I thought the place was quaint and friendly and very family oriented.  You can order a big dish for everyone in the family to share.  The cheesy bread sticks were my favorite part of the meal.  I'm always a sucker for cheesy bread sticks.  I had the pasta with sausage which was very good.  Yes it's kind of hard to mess up pasta, but hey I had a good time.
