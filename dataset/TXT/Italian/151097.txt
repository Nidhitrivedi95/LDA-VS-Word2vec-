klfhmP97VMajZmFE-GCKTw I went here with my daughter and we decided to start with a Cesar salad but they don't use anchovy to prepare it, instead they use a "of the shelf" Cesar salad dressing...not good for us that frequently have REAL Cesar salad.
Then I asked for a carbonara pasta but I inquired about if they prepare the real Italian carbonate with an egg and parmesan cheese  ...again they use a "carbonara cream sauce" from the shelf.

Two basic classic Italian dishes that are so easy to prepare and because they cut corner I was not impressed.
Other reason why I did not gave the third start is because the long time waiting between we received the menus and when the waitress came back to take the orders.
The place was not crowed at that time but looks to me that they are short on server.

I won't come back here, there are so many Italian restaurants in Edinburgh that I will pick one that at least is run by an Italian or have real knowledge of the Italian cuisine.
