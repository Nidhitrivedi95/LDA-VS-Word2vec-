hrNIDao4XnOhrv7aaFehTg My bank was charged mulitple times for one transaction. After inquiring about it to the owner Tim, he derogatory explained how "pending charges" work as if I had never used my debit card before. He had no consideration or empathy about any inconvenience. In addition he stated, "I don't care about what your bank statement says. " 

No one should trust this owners' business with any card transaction. 

For a mediocre pizza place, it would make business sense for the customer service to be better. 

I usually don't post reviews but when money for pizza is being over charged (100+), the bad customer experience had to be shared. I always support small businesses, however Tim made Pizza Hut, Dominoes, and Papa Johns look good.
