FXiPQQGr_2bwlJ4wOrW2eA My wife and I had our New Years Eve diner here and we were surprised to find a great restaurant. Great decor good for both intimate dining and business diners. Food was excellent service was great, prices were fine. It's located in he JW Marriott in Summerlin and has great parking. I highly recommend this restaurant.
