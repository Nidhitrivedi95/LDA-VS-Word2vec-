ZvtELJTUOh0yRrPxyyiakQ The food is what you know and expect, but holy cheese the service last night was insane.  We had a fifteen minute wait when we walked up and were served couple pieces of a pizza and had our drink order taken while we waited.  Our waitress (so sorry I couldn't remember her name) was great and friendly and we never had to wait for a thing.  Even having to listen to some ASU bros describe how blown away they were by the end of The Usual Suspects couldn't dampen a great meal and amazing service.
