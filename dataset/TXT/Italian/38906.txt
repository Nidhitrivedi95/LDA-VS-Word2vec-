7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA This may have been a bad night however, the wait after being seated was over an hour. The veggieballs are just some kind of flour reminiscent of corn flour and a few veg thrown in, the vegan sausage sandwich was more like meatless ground tossed in some marinara that tasted okay but seemed to come from a jar. The Italian dressing, supposedly vegan, was just bad. According to Jason, the steak sandwich was like what you get in a package at Costco. Not bad taste, just generic.

They didn't bring the veggieballs with the other non-vegan appetizers and the meal as a whole was delayed so long we thought the order was forgotten. We almost walked out twice.

Not so sure I'm going back to this place
