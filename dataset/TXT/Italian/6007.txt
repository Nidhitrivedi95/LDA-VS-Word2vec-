_VHU9KZUHRLp2Hc2JOKlYg We went here tonight and totally enjoyed the cigar bar, went to the restaurant and had a reservation which was handled wonderfully. We were a table of 8, the amount of time just to get drinks was unbelievable. I was drinking beer so I was served in a responsible amount of time. We ordered a bottle of wine and it took almost 30 minutes to bring to the table and pour. Those that ordered mixed drinks took the same amount of time. The food was good but the service is so slow. We had reservations at 7:30 and did not get finished until 10:00pm. This was not due to a stretched out service but to the lack of attention.

With all of the other choices in town I will not go here again, too pricey for bad service. Since we were a party of 8 tip was added in automatically and looked like we were charged twice which totally ruined the evening.
