A_YO9kvdEqd8vXGKc696yg Ordered delivery from Eastside Mario's for my birthday dinner, my pasta arrived luke warm and my husband's thin crust pizza was stone cold. He tried warming it in the oven which ended up just drying it out. He said the pizza tasted like a frozen pizza. Overall very disappointing. When I've eaten in the restaurant it's generally pretty good. If they're going to offer delivery they need to find a way to keep the food hot.
