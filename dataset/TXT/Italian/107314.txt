fXBZsZYPFDDhYk5ySJJQFA On our way to the cottage we picked up some garlic bread and a medium lasagne. I think the garlic bread was $2.50 and the medium lasagne just under $10. For dinner we made some cesaer salad and had the lasagne and garlic bread, and it satisfied three hungry women with a bit to spare! 

The lasagne was good - nothing too fancy, noodles, sauce and meat. But it was very tasty with a homemade feel to it.

Great to pick up a few things for dinner on the nights you don't feel like cooking!
