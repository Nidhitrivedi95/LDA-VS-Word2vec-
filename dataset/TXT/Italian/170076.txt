MtvN8vMiKcLkkz_tCvBx3g Came here after a long day of work and coworker and I ordered the artichokes, carmelized gnocchi and the scallops. The artichokes were just ok, not my favorite thing to eat to begin with. The gnocchi were fantastic, really interesting flavors and loved that they threw in some fresh cucumbers in there. Scallops were divine and really light which was perfect since I had a heavy lunch. They were cooked to perfection and paired well with the pork belly. The bread here was really good too and I liked that they did not just serve it with the traditional olive oil but gave us beans. Service was excellent and it was nice ambience. Would definitely come back again while I am still in Charlotte.
