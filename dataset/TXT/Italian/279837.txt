yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Solid old-school red-sauce Italian. With a straightforward menu, great service, and an absolutely delightful accordion player, it's definitely worth heading off the Strip. I had the cannelloni. Nice tender meat, good pasta texture and simple but flavorful sauces...tasty. The after-dinner cappuccino was fantastic. No clue what they put in it, but it was deliciously creamy. 

Did I mention endless wine? It wasn't the best wine I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't the worst, either.
