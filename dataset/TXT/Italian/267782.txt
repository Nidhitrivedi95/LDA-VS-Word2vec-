XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q horrible and slow service if we could give zero out of five stars we would. Out of the 10 plates we  were given four for them were dirty . My husbands soup was spilt in the plate that was under the bowl, The waitress showered me with a cup of water, and my chicken was completely burnt. Never coming back again, very disappointed.
