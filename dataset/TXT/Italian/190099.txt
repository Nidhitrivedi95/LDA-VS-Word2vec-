P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw Naked City Pizza serves up tasty pies, fries, wings, and specialities.  NPC is located inside Moondoggies, a smoke-filled dive bar. you order at the little window, which you can't miss since it's lined with all their prestigious awards.

That's just it, this place is all about the hype. Yes, it's a decent pie, but the toppings were sparse. The pizza also isn't anything that you can't find elsewhere and it just doesn't stand out. It's good, but not great and definitely not remember-able. 

Where NCP excels is in the sammie & fry departments. There are unique offerings and tasty combos. Suicide fries offer a mighty kick and are best served with milk to kill the fire. Not for the faint of heart. My go to sub is The Guinea which as a pizza is meh; when translated to sandwich is crave-able. (I'm salivating as I write this!) With it's combination of house-made Italian sausage, sweet and hot peppers, onion and ooey-gooey mozzarella cheese! This is a sandwich worth driving across town for. 

I also had one of the best Osso Buco of my life here. It was a weekly special and it was tender and juicy. 

Although they claim pizza in their title, their best items can be found elsewhere on the menu.
