UutHMmZx1CQcjiyfmVa_7g I had heard many great things about Eddie D's from friends that frequented the other location, so I was excited to give it a try for lunch recently when I was running errands in the area. As other reviewers have mentioned, the staff is extremely friendly and will ask if you have been there before. Sadly I was not offered a free meatball to try like some of other Eddie D's virgins... 

I was unsure what I wanted and apparently my facial expression made this clear, because one of the employees suggested I try the Pauly Walnuts which they stated was their most popular sandwich. I also ordered lunch for a friend, the eggplant platter. I thought it was nice that the employee actually brought my to go order out to me rather then calling my name. Sadly, the eggplant platter was placed on it's side in the bag, making a mess. 

My sandwich was HUGE, with lots of prosciutto, capacola, genoa salami and provolone cheese. It was tasty but simply too much sandwich for me. Eddie D's should consider selling half sandwiches for those of us that are watching our girlish figures! The bread was nice and hard without being stale, but there was too much Italian dressing on the sandwich for my liking. 

My coworker enjoyed the taste of eggplant platter, but the serving size was pretty small for the price. 

Overall I was a little disappointed... Perhaps my expectations were too high?
