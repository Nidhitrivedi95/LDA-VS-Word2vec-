IT0IODInyhKbG4a_ka71MQ My kids and husband enjoy coming here to have a dinner night out. The prices are great with huge portions. I love all there appetizers especially the  brochette. They also have the great cookie dessert . They are very kid friendly and while you wait for tables they can play outside.
