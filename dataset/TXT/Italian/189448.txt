OZqAZkjhV_nyHsbnKaD1WQ What is that smell when you first walk in?  It smells like mold & cleaner gone wrong.   Not appetizing!

Now that I've been back twice more I'm sensing underlying issues.  It seems the regulars like this place mainly is because it's a lot of food for the money!

Pros: 
Soup & salad included with entrees 
Solid appetizers- calamari & mozzarella
Decent service with an elegant attempt
Shot of Sambuca at the end 

Cons:
Weird smell 
Slow bar service- (all 3 times... SO slow)
Reservations are not timely- They act as if they don't expect you to show and then scramble to fit you in... Even if your family has eaten here for 25 years. 
Sub par desserts 
Mostly clientele over 60 years of age
