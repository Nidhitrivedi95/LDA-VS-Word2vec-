Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA Was looking forward to checking out Federal Pizza. Atmosphere was great, service was okay, food was not what I expected. We ordered four pizzas for a large party of eight people, three quarters of the pizzas ordered were very undercooked in the middle, which made them doughy and soggy. I then asked the server about how our pizzas were, she said this is because they are woodfired. She then told me I would have to order my pizzas well Done, most woodfired pizza kitchens make sure the pizzas are cooked all the way, regardless of the woodfired method. On the service side, after we ate appetizers and the pizza was delivered, I had to ask for fresh plates and silverware so we could eat our pizza. The server should be looking for things like that, attention to detail. After all that is why we go out to eat for the experience of great food and service. When I go out and treat several people to a meal, I expect to have great service, when I am spending a couple hundred dollars are just a few dollars in your restaurant. At this point I am debating whether or not to give Federal Pizza a second chance.
