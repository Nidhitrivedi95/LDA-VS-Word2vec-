EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw Smoked olives- Looked great, but I wanted to save room for mozza and griglia menu items! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crudo-phoenix-2?select=-0XG_gn3NAyh2BllGwAbIA

Grana spread: Loved this!  Really loved the granular texture, and the flavor and feel of the olive oil.  Might've been the only one who did.  Can't blame my friends... the other plates were quite scrumptious!

Crispy pigs' ears:  My first time trying this-- why did I wait so long???  These were wonderful!  Like chicharrones, but with meat, and the sweet peppers gave this dish a sweet kick!

Fresh Mozzarella, with bacon relish and caramelized onions.  Good, but would've been better if the mozza was a little more tender/silkier.  Bacon relish was the superstar in this one.

Straciatella, with battuto (root-based pico), hazelnuts, and radicchio.  I enjoyed the crushed hazelnuts over the creamy mozz.  Had to avoid the battuto due to carrot allergy.

Ricotta, with walnut sauce and honey.  Another favorite of mine, for I am a lover of fresh ricotta that's well-made.  And walnuts.  And honey. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crudo-phoenix-2?select=Dz9DxRl2e94VzEHvxjxwQA

Brisket, with fingerlings, raddichio, and collatura ($19), with added Bonemarrow (+$5).  Found the brisket to be a bit too salty.  Fingerlings were excellent- crispy skin-on exterior, and fluffy interior... simply magical!  Really appreciated the bone marrow presentation (whole, uncut), which had a lot of meaty marrow that didn't make me feel like I was eating foamy oil on bread. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crudo-phoenix-2?select=HUGs_MRx5lKquEWRE5F8Pw

I had a two glasses (OK, a glass and a quarter) of the pinot noir on the happy hour menu.  Was able to sample this and one of the cabernets, and I surprised myself by favoring the pinot more.  The cab was a tad drier than I liked.

Yes, I want to return again soon.  Very, very soon.  Big thanks to Chef JK for recommending this place to me months ago, even though I'd had it bookmarked for years.  Why did I wait so long???

p.s.  Thanks to friends JY and DK for meeting me here-- what a fun evening!
