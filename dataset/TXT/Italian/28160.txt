4XDWHIN46wzg8MXpo8PvQA Worst service i have ever had in my life. Ive been here 3 times. First time i thought "okay maybe they were having an off night, it happens." Second time same nasty attitudes by the girl behind the counter and the owners. Thrid time was the worst. Horrible attitude. I asked if they could leave 5 chicken wings outta the 20 piece we ordered plain for my 3 yr old and the told me it was impossible. So i said fine can u do half with no sauce? They agreed and then charged me for sauce on the side. We bought a large fountain drink and their fountain machine was broken so i asked for a refund on the drink and the owner yelled at me, literally yelled at me with my 3 yr old in my arms about how it wasnt his fault and why couldnt i just drink water from the fountain machine. After making a scene infront of the other customers He slammed the money on the counter, shoved it to me and stormed away. Not a family environment at all and horrible people! There are other east coast pizza places and i will never go back here again!!!
