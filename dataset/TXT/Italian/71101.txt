c5x6HWB8MTZvlTgabihaSw Having read some negative reviews lately we chose other Italian restaurants although we had liked Arrivederci's before.  Friends invited us to dinner and here we came.  Though not as busy as we had experienced in the past, the food and service was what we had remembered and were glad we came.  It seemed that the main complaint was reservations not being honored in a timely fashion.  I hope this is not the case, as we have always enjoyed our evenings here.  Perhaps that is why the restaurant didn't seem as busy as before.  We will be back again.
