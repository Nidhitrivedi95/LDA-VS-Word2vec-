9WIn1fMJoDPqkc5HOQdybw Just had an exceptional dining experience! Service and food outstanding. Calamari appetizer with spicy pepper sauce fabulous. Beefsteak exceptional. Risotto made with squash,cheese and tiger shrimp delicious. And some sort of decadent chocolate mousse. And a great gin Cosmo and a great wine ...

One of the truly best meals I have experienced in a very long time
