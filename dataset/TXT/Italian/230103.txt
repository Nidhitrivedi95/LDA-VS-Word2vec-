Tc511yME8axDPq2J6woxkg I recently had the opportunity to lunch at LockKeepers. Despite the ever-so-packed parking lot (and dining room, for that matter), I had a good experience top to bottom. 

The ambiance is nice enough to merit a business suit yet chill enough to accommodate your khaki/polo shirt crowd. Our server was attentive and delightful, recommending the prosciutto, arugula and parmesan pizza. As always when I'm conflicted about what to order, I took her up on the recommendation. 

Here's where the review gets really good. 

This is what pizza is supposed to be like; simple, rustic, and artfully conceived. The crust was thin, crispy, warm and chewy. The flavors and textures of the toppings created a perfect compliment: paper-thin slices of rich, salty prosciutto, generous shavings of parmigiano-reggiano, crisp, peppery arugula, a drizzle of olive oil, and fresh ground pepper. YUM! 

I'm going to save a higher rating until after I'm able to take advantage of the dinner menu. I might even up the ante by making the best of the warm, dark atmosphere by taking a date. Stay tuned...
