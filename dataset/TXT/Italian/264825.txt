wyKd4F1fAfDCA1rTxSoT_A This was the second visit to Dolcetto. The first was solo and I only ordered a few appetizers and drinks. This second visit I brought the family. We live a couple of blocks up the street and figured we'd have dinner.

The waitresses was lovely and we really enjoyed her service. Little can be said of the rest of the establishment. The food had ridiculously small portions and I could finish my pizza in a few bits. You'll want to hit BEVO nearby if you really want some pizza in this area.
The second was the price, not worth the portion size.

Finally, they charged us $5 for a glass of milk for the little one. We travel the world and have never been charged this much.

NO chance will be coming back.
