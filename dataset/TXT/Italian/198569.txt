A quick note on the restaurant itself, it's pretty small inside. I would guess it could hold, at most, around 50 people. There are usually always waits but in my experience, the lunch hour is the best time to visit the original location. If you do decide to brave the wait for dinner, there is a bar that they run next door that serves alcohol and some small plates to ease the wait.

Now, onto the pizza. I've tried all the pizzas on the menu and the two that I recommend most are the Margarita and Wiseguy. Both having different appeal, the Margarita is superb. The tomato sauce is fresh, juicy, and not too sweet. The mozzarella cheese is easily the best I've ever had on a pizza - smooth, firm, and properly salted, it is a wonder on its own merit. Finally, there's the crust, crisp and bubbled on the outside and soft and airy on the inside. Combine the three elements together with fresh basil leaves on top and for me, it's the best pizza there is.

As for the Wiseguy, any meat lovers will adore this masterpiece. A white pizza, this one features fennel sausage and roasted onions along with the aforementioned mozzarella. Both the sausage and onion carry a smoky flavor that is enhanced by the smooth creaminess of the mozzarella. This applies to both pizzas but I highly recommend adding garlic to the pizza for an added flavor dimension. 

Overall, this is easily the best pizza in Arizona, with apologies to Pomo, Cibo, and Federal. As for the best in the country, perhaps that's a better question for someone with extensive experience. For me though, I see no reason to doubt the claim.
