Orgm9nmcClxnAUva4nOKyA A good place to go for brunch near St. Lawrence. Spacious inside and nice street view.

Went there for brunch. Food was ok, not much surprises. The french toast I ordered was given a fancy name called "Hot House French Toast", should be their special, but not that special to me, as it got soaked in the maple syrup which made the whole dish very soggy and super sweet. Even I like sweet but still couldn't take that much. Next time hope they could offer the syrup on the side.

Other than that french toast, everything was good.
