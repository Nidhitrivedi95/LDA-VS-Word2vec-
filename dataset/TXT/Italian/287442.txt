ZL6BK8wweb-8ncJ7kFIG-A Went there last night for a birthday dinner celebration.  Everything was amazing!  While we have tried their pizzas, it was the first time I had a dinner entree.  Wow!  The portions are extremely generous- could have fed three with my veal dinner- they provide lots of garlic bread, salads were delicious.  And since we brought our own wine, the bill was very reasonable!  I highly recommend this place- Pete puts his heart into his food and it shows.  My only suggestion is to get rid of the plastic utensils but overall, great night.
