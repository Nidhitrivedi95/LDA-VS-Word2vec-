iAD5r5vNOzc1AP6UA5yFiQ I guess I should have known when the description said they serve three types of cuisine....Italian, Mediterranean and Hawaiian, hard enough to excel at one, they're trying all three.....anyway had a pizza, nothing special, run of the mill pizza....
Somebody had a burger, same thing, frozen patties, run of the mill.....
Somebody had a chicken skewer plate with Potatoes that were super over seasoned, chicken was ok....
Then we got the gelato (seems like their claim to fame),  and even that was nothing special....
Anyway, somewhat edible, but definitely a one and out visit.
