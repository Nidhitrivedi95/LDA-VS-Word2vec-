KDF3qxIYv1OkqtSUl4PwGQ I was invited to a business dinner with my work and this restaurant was an excellent choice. We were first seated at the bar and had a variety of cocktails to choose from, all of which were presented well and delicious. The bar tender was very attentive. Afterwards we were seating on a table that looked like a dinning hall table, it was very nice. The decor and ambiance were excellent. We were offered a set menu as this was a business dinner and I chose the Mozzarella appetizer with tomatoes and the cavatelli (ricotta cavatelli, wild mushrooms, basil cream, pecorino). It was excellent. I finished my plate. The dessert was a selection of different dessert on a plate. It was all very delicious. The service was great and I would defiantly be back again!
