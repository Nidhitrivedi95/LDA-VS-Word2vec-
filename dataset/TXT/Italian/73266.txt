CKJnoUSWocdVIj6Fqbgm5g It was a Thursday night and my fiancee' and I were exploring King St. There are within any half mile range more places I can count to eat at around here. I saw the sign hanging outside for this establishment and immediately had a memory of my mother raving about this spot, since we are a family of foodies, I decided this would be a good bet. 

Upon walking down the steps into the main room we noticed it was absolutely jammed packed, it was seriously like a sardine can there were so many people here. The hostess asked if it was just the two of us and started to write our names and then out of the corner of her eyes spotted a table opening up so she gave us that one. I kinda felt bad for the 12 other people that were waiting along the rails behind us but hey, I'm not the one seating people. Moving along..

Our server literally had to be a contortionist to reach us due to the crowd, but reaching us she was friendly and had all the specials both meals and soups ready to go at a moments notice. We both decided on Pasta dishes that at the moment escape my memory. I'm sure that she had a simple linguine dish whereas I chose something a little more exotic with chicken and a garlic sauce. Hers was very tasty and came out promptly. Mine took an an extra 5 minutes and when I got it the pieces of chicken were cold. Also, the pasta was very spicy. It didn't say that it was spicy in the description however when I got it I could only handle a few bites before calling it quits. The server took notice and they did give a slight discount on the bill so I will give them points for that. We'll give it a shot again.
