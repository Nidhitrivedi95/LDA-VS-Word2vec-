VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w We started the day at Tao beach, then ended up at Tao and eventually at LAVO. I had a good experience here. The dance floor is small but I got comped for drinks and was having a grand o' time.

People who stand in line, Vegas have promos from August - October where you don't have to stand in line! You can get the All Access Wristbands and you just cut through everyone! It gives you access to Tao Beach, Tao Nightclub, and Lavo. 

Clubbing in Vegas was fun for us and we had a good experience with the bouncers. I'm glad we didn't experience the drama that everyone else had to go through with the reviews on here or else it would have totally ruined my trip!
