7JWWeXqil03Ua_wV9KN8ZQ If I could, I would give this place a solid three and a half. But, I can't- and hey, if you aren't expecting the absolute best Italian food out there but need something to lean on, then this place is for you. 

It was relatively busy when we walked in, but there were still some tables open and we were seated relatively quickly. Bread and olive oil came promptly. The service was good, and our server was very nice. We actually talked a little bit when dinner was over. His service alone made me round this review up to four stars.

Onto the food. I ordered the Gnocchi Sorrentina, which is gnocchi in a tomato basil sauce with pieces of fresh mozzarella. My mom originally ordered a salad, but the server was kind enough to let her change her order shortly thereafter to a pasta dish with penne, chicken, and broccoli in a light cream sauce. My dad got a salad with salmon, my brother a pasta dish with bolognese sauce. 

The food was good, typical Italian. The sauce on my gnocchi was exceptionally good, along with my mom's cream sauce. I didn't taste the other two dishes, but I heard good things. Portions were perfect- not too big, nor too small. We had Creme Brûlée for dessert, a perfectly sized Creme Brûlée that was tasty. Overall, it was a good experience. Would I come back? Yes.
