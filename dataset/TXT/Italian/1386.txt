-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q When Guy Fieri of Food Network's "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives" visited this little known entity in old downtown Glendale, I thought twice, three times, OK...I had to go see the guys from Jersey who like all other easterners come west and say they are going to make a killer pizza, but usually end up with the usual corrugated cardboard with flavorless cheese food and a red spot called sauce.

My search has finally ended. This place blew me away with their wonderful La Piazza Verde with it's tasty carmelized onions, mushrooms, roasted peppers and....drumroll....Arugula! It was a flavor savior and I enjoyed every bite! My wife had the Margherita and she loved it too with it's fresh mozzarrella and tasty basil. 

Friendly atmosphere. Great service. Reasonably priced. Make sure you get to try one of their chocolate covered cannolis. To die for, but don't! You want to come back for more!
