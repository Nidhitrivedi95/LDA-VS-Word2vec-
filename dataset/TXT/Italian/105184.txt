FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q A good Italian restaurant on Flamingo off the strip that my family has been visiting for years. The head waiter, Nikolai, knows his stuff and is very helpful. 

Their pre-dinner bread, with oil and vinegar was really good! As an appetizer, we got the stuffed artichoke (Carciofi Romano) with parmigiana cheese, breadcrumbs, garlic, and Italian parsley. The artichoke itself was prepared well, but I think there were too many breadcrumbs in the middle, which kind of made it difficult to eat the second half of the artichoke. The pasta fagiola soup was good, but nothing to write home about. 

The entrees are large, so I would recommend getting two plus an appetizer for 3 people. My friends ate the Portofino (mixed shellfish) and it was a table favorite. I had much of the Chicken Parmigiana, which came with a side of penne and marinara sauce. It was easy to cut, covered beautifully in cheese, and tasted really good.
