-httBl6DSZiUtDX4SQWtag The pizza here is really good. I want to go back for more. The rose was also tasty. I got the fig jam pizza and wish that it had maybe not quite as much fig jam, and had a salty meat to go with the sweetness, but it was still good. It just wasn't exactly what I was in the mood for that day. The crust was amazing though.

The cafe is tiny. It will have a wait, but they try to clear things fast and once you order, your food will be made quickly. The staff is super friendly and makes the whole place feel like home. It's a little crowded, but it's not like you're on top of the next table. I'd be willing to try brunch, but it might be hard to not just order pizza every time. 

The actual store is awesome. I love the biscotti. There are so many flavors. The other desserts that I've had were good too, but I mostly focus on the biscotti.
