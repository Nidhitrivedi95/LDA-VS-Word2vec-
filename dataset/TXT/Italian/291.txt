-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw We hadn't dined here for a few years so decided to try it again.  It is still good.  I had the two plate lunch including the wedge salad and the pepperoni (etc) flatbread. It was good and reasonably priced. My wife had the chicken risotto with a Caesar side and liked it. One friend had the  chicken limone and enjoyed it a lot.  The other friend had the pesto chicken salad and liked it.  The wine list is adequate and reasonably priced. There are interesting drinks: mango iced tea and white peach Arnold Palmer as well as the Arnold Palmer.  All were enjoyed. 
Service was fine but there were long delays between drink orders and receipt of drinks and order of food and delivery of food. In addition, when a salad and entree were ordered they were served together rather than as separate courses.  That meant it was necessary to eat the entree before it cooled, then the salad.   I assume that is a bar/kitchen problem or a management decision. 
We sat on the patio. The chairs were uncomfortable which surprised me. Some places intentionally do this to discourage long term dining.  Not sure about this.
