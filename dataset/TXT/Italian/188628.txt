oX7lSVsg4j7-SrSZVGWVnA 3 Stars but let me explain.... Food is Great, employees who are generally high school students in the evenings are wonderful, and for that it would be a FIVE STAR!  HOWEVER, every time I go in there there is a female manager or owner, not sure what she is but she is SO RUDE!  Not really rude to customers but I cannot stand the way she speaks down to the employees and has no problem critiquing them in front of customers.  I generally just get an order to go so I do not have to see her, it is so rude and really not being a good manager.
