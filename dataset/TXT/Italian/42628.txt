7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg SOOOOO very good! I had their chicken fettuccini Alfredo, the sauce was nice and thick, not too cheesy, but just enough. Also a lot of times Alfredo can come out oily but this one wasn't! We also tried their penne vodka and their simple house salad, we got big portions for just the two of us. So very yummy
