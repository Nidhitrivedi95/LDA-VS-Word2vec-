NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA Bacon candy - that's all you need to know!  If you eat nothing else, eat the bacon candy!  My husband and I were in town last month for Kenny Chesney and wanted to try as much "local" stuff as we could.  Proper was at the top of our memory list when we left town after the weekend.  I do not remember all of the exact beers my husband tried, but he enjoyed them all.  They had so many different beers to choose from!  My husband had the carnivore pizza and I had the forest pizza - both were delicious!  I am a huge mushroom lover and this pizza hit the spot!  Our waitress was very nice and so patient with us as we asked so many "touristy" questions.  We like to travel and we're big foodies so we're very inquisitive once we find a place we like.  The manager that was on duty kind of irritated me when he changed the tv from a baseball game that I was watching to something for someone else that was apparently a friend of his.  When we asked about getting it turned back on a different tv, he just blew us off.  Oh well, we came for the food anyways (which was fantastic) and the game was just a bonus.
