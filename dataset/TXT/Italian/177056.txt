nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg I normally don't write reviews below a 4 or if I've only visited once, but we had some of the most terrible service I've ever encountered. I brought my friend out to see chandler when she was in town and found this place through Yelp. We were seated at hi top by the bar, which was fine, because it was a busier Friday night. A waiter came over for our drink orders and then.... We got our bottle of wine but not iced teas. We asked again, knowing it was busy, but no dice (that time or the next time we asked). We then asked about the cheese plate. Our server didn't know what was on it and took ten minutes finding somebody who did. It was paltry at best for $14, but that's the nature of cheese plates. We asked about the specials and the waiter went off to find somebody who knew, again. He was gone for 30 minutes. No further service during this time. At this point we were so frustrated that we decided to leave. We asked for the check (which took 10 minutes) and then the waiter very awkwardly asked if he had done anything wrong :/ 

Based on that time only, I would give this place a 1. Since it was my first time and a Friday, I feel like that isn't fair. I did want to leave this review though so management is aware of some deficiencies in service. 

We left, went next door to San Tan on a very busy Friday and had dinner, beers, AND iced teas and were out the door in 45 minutes.
