Ea4ODC2cfqAbDbb_sYdPZQ Great pizza and wonderful service! My husband and I are a little picky about service- so that is a compliment indeed! Sandy was his waitress and he was impressed. The pizza was excellent too, we are happy to have a neighborhood restaurant so near our house that has great food and a great staff... when I logged on to see the reviews I was shocked that there are some negative ones! Either they have fixed the "issues" or it was a fluke.We thought the food and service were stellar!
