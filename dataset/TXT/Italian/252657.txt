VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w We came during 4th of July weekend because a friend found a promoter who said guys could get in for $10 and girls would be free if we came by 10:30pm.  The promoter also promised the girls a Full Open Bar until 11:30pm, which was another huge incentive for us to come.

Right before we headed over there, the promoter apparently changed his mind and said that guys had to pay $30.  What the... not cool.  We hoped the free drinks would offset the cost, so we went anyway.  The Full Bar only consisted of basic drinks like vodka/tonic, rum/coke, redbull/vodka but nothing too fancy.  Oh well, it was good enough.

The dance floor is TINY, but we still had a lot of fun here!  Much more fun than we had at Tao.  We enjoyed the Deejay and the music he played.  Good times.
