l4x5FFzfiCFrGN0S-uZbBQ Nando is a place for a special meal if you're not terribly hungry. Everything we ordered was delicious and beautifully prepared. My husband had a octopus appetizer that was delicious and tender. All the pasta is homemade and came out steaming hot. My pet peeve is when food arrives lukewarm.  Our waiter Trent was wonderful and attentive as was the rest of the support staff. Nando was pricey, but a treat!
