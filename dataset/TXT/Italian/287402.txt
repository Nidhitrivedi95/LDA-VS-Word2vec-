ZL-4ejIO3DCgSsdRWwsX-A We tried this place out because of the reviews here on Yelp and we were not disappointed! Staff was friendly, helpful and quick to help with your order. We moved here from NY and it was the first time our 1 year old ate pizza without spitting it out, mind you it was the Margherita pizza but he ate it! I enjoyed the thick crust slice and my husband got a slice of stuffed which was to die for, I am getting that one next time. It was the best we have had since leaving NY.
