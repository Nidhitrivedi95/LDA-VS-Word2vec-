wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg Grazie has been a favourite spot for my family for years, and I will never pass up an opportunity to go.

It's a Yonge and Eglinton staple. It's crowded, loud and the tables are tight, but it's a wonderfully lively overall ambience.

The staff (you can't miss them, they're in a shirt and tie with jeans) are extremely friendly, and will remember you. Jack and Rohan are the absolute best of a great bunch, and we have had the pleasure of having them serve us for years.

The best thing about Grazie is the pasta. There aren't enough superlatives to to describe it. Always cooked to a perfect consistency, and topped with incredibly flavourful sauces, I have never had a less than sensational one yet. The tomato sauce is full of garlic, rich, and full bodied. Starting with bread with chili-infuses olive oil, vinegar and parmesean is definitely recommended.

Grazie definitely lives up to the hype!
