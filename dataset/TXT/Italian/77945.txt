cZO6RmJcqRY9jGbYY71z-A Came for lunch, be warned the lunch menu is very limited. Mainly sandwiches, a couple of pastas and chef Mikes personal favorite a Sicilian pizza.

We liked the food enough to want to return for dinner, chef Mike says reservations are encouraged as they've been selling out most nights.

Good for him, good for them, I wish them continued success.
