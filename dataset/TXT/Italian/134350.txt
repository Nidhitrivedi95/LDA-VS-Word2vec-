iqntlaqSCB4hkzTzlPlEmQ Both the food and service are excellent. Very similar to Bios's and Carrabbas. The rewards for dinner credits should be done without the Wi-Fi as it does not work correctly. They are slightly less expensive than the aforementioned restaurants, but food quality and quantity is equal.They are located in the Galleria Mall. Definitely recommend you try them out.
