rU3gQnwoCx_bjDJEsxathA Wow, was this bad! I work in hospitality and the lacklustre experience of my brunch was atrocious, their tightly confined seating in this restaurant was reminiscent of a sardine can when they forced everyone into the front section leaving less than a foot and a half between tables, romantic? 

The flavourless food really didn't help them either and neither did the poor service. It was clear that they bought pre sliced meat and didn't really know anything about smoked salmon or eggs or that hollandaise should taste like something and not be a watery mess.

The bumbling staff made me nuts, failing to clear tables, bring food, refills, bills or anything in a timely fashion was insulting. There was four of them and none of them seemed like they wanted to work together or get anything done except to have sour looks on their faces.

I couldn't imagine coming back to this place and reminds me of other pretentious, overrated restaurants on the danforth. Seriously needs an overhaul, hopefully their dinner/lunch is better but I won't risk trying it any time soon!
