This is a great place to take the kids but its always busy and sometimes there's a wait for a table. Sometimes we take away from here and if you have a voucher it can be worthwhile. We went to my nephew's birthday party here and all the kids loved it. You can't go wrong with pizza, can you! The all-you-can-eat pizza deals are the best, but be warned, you won't be able to move afterwards! Fortunately there's loads of free parking so you can park close by. Also handy if you are visiting the cinema which is just across from here.
