uIuJGLPWli4dbomvANcuiQ Visited last night with my two girlfriends for a nice dinner out. After seeing reviews online and pics of the food, we were excited to go and try this new "hidden gem" as some had reviewed.

Our reservation was for 8:30pm and we didn't leave until 11:00pm. This wasn't because we were having such an amazing time chatting, it's because it took forever to get our food and the service was so slow. Our server would go from table to table chatting to other patrons - it took 30 mins to get our $70 bottle of wine! The place wasn't even busy - tons of tables available. The food came and it was good but I've had better Italian at the same price point (Figo for example).

Overall I left exhausted and underwhelmed. I'd suggest finding another place to spend your Saturday night.
