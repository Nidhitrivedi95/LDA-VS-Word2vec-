tXJkGjBkGOZHWAcCmlzS6w Awful - stay away.  We had a horrible experience at Valerio's.  It took an hour and a half to get our meal after being seated.  The waitress asked if we wanted more bread, we said we did, and she never brought any.  She never asked if we wanted another beverage after the first, and never asked if we wanted ground pepper like they did at other tables.  There were plenty of employees - they were just busy rearranging napkins and silverware on other tables.  It took a ridiculous amount of time to get our salads.  Eventually two of our entrees arrived, and then it took another 5-10 minutes before the other person at our table was served.  The food was lousy too.  My cucumber and onion salad seemed to be an entire shredded onion with a few slices of cucumber.  The Pollo al Limone was so tough you could barely cut it with the knife.  There are much better choices in Little Italy a few steps away, like Etna and Mia Bella.  Don't waste your time or money at Valerio's.
