nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g Huge Disappointment.  I had been to Terroni on Yonge St and I always had a good time.  However, we went to Terroni at Adelaide St on Friday night and the service at this location was poor at best. We ordered a bottle of wine, appetizers and entries. However, after a while we received the appetizers with no sign of the wine we had ordered. I mean, this is Restaurant Business 101!!  We kindly told them that we wanted the wine first and then we got the wine and still, there was the lady with the appetizer lining up to staffing the appetizers into out throats. Give me a break, I am trying to have a good time with my husband on the only night we go out in the month!  We finally made it through dinner, but Terroni at Adelaide St is not  at a place we want to go back.  I mean, at least someone can come out to apologize!  Even a small gesture such as a dessert and a proper apology would have made the difference. Again, take care of  customer service, because we also noted the servers wondering around looking for the customers who had ordered what they were given from the kitchen. Very unusual for Terroni standards.
