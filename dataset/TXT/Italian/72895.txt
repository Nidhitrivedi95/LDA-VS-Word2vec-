cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ Great local Italian cuisine NW side of Vegas.  Very reasonable prices for GOURMET fresh made pasta dishes.  Started with their versions of pasta fagioli and bufalo tomato salad.  Both excellent!  My main course was the "deconstructed" lasagna with beef short rib meat.  Chef Marc likes the pink sauce and does it very well.  My son and I were both in the mood for Italian and this place filled the bill!  Service was also excellent.
