qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg Stopped in for late lunch. Mostly couples enjoying a nice relaxing Greek lunch. Saganaki is awesome. Had the Gyro platter; very good, but have also had better.  Wife truly enjoyed her chicken kabob. Atmospher was nice and comfortable. Nice wines.  Very good lemon rice soup, and pita bread is awesome. Will definitely return to try their world winning chicken dish. Definitely worth a try.
