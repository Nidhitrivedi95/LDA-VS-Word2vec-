hh-N1r9O1JpvzGw1mp0bKw I was so glad to have stumbled upon this adorable noodle shop! I had bookmark this restaurant, but wasn't intending to eat here until I passed it on the deuce. It was very close to closing time when my friend and I got here , but the gentleman at the counter was very nice and didn't seem too bothered by our late arrival. My friend ordered a pasta dish with pancetta and asparagus that was light and springy. I ordered the beef bourguignon pasta dish that had a lot of flavor and perfectly tender beef. I love that they offer half portions. The half portion is on the small side but plenty for most people and reasonably priced at around $8. The garlic bread that came with the pasta was buttery and delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting or living in Vegas.
