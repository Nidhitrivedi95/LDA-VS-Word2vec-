e_yxY8iYwK6WDnUSz3v8ng I enjoyed my first lunch visit to Flour.  Lunch menu is completely different from their dinner menu so I'll have to come back again and try out the pasta dishes.  Our server was very attentive.  She offered us suggestions on the wood fired pizzas and appetizers.  Our orders were accurate and brought out in a reasonable time.  

We started out with the Truffled Parmesan Tator Tots. Nice size tots with slivers of truffle fried golden brown.  Simply delicious plain or with the roasted garlic aioli.  I had the Porchetta Bahn Mi sandwhich.  A nice fusion of Italian and Vietnamese.  The combination of the veggies and the prochetta blended well.  There were nice char marks on the bread from the panini press. The aioli saved the sandwich from being too dry.  A solid item that I would order again.

I'm looking forward to trying other things on their menu next time I come back.
