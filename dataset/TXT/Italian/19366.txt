2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg Ive been coming here for the past couple of months, so ive decided to finally write a reivew.  its a great cafe to grab a quick coffee on the go! Overall service is just okay. The dessert i always get is a chocolate croissant! Probably one of the best in vegas!

Overall staff is friendly...but a little odd how every employee ethnicity is asian. It just seems strange in my opinion. The managers come check up on you which is also a PLUS! but one seems to have a very moody face all the time.

I do suggest you come check this place out!
