IDW4QFw-fN_wk81G9OV-Mg I've eaten here three times now. The first time was great, second time was ok, third time... should have been "the charm," but was far from that.

Ordered the gluten free shrimp scampi to go. Food was bland, shrimp was bland, even had a piece of the shell from the tail in my food. My dish was also not labeled as gluten free, so I have to wonder if it was even gluten free to begin with. 

Pretty disappointed in my dish and the shell in my food. Doesn't take much to end my trips to restaurants, but that will probably be my last at this location.
