8UiPh7jaIqT_Dm8Qt_9frA Amazing pizza and pasta for those who love authentic italian. Food is ALWAYS consistent and the staff is an absolute pleasure! Always treated like family whenever I go in. Cannot give a higher recommendation for this restaurant. If you're a foodie and in the Junction, this restaurant should be first on your list.
