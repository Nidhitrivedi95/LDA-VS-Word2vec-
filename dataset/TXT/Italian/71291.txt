C63sF-wG4f1doMIMv2qvOg Food - I had the Salsiccia pizza, which came with cheese, Italian sausage, mushrooms, and green pepper. It was decent pizza, with thinner crust and meltier cheese than you would get from most fast food pizza places. The size was just like a personal pizza you'd get at CPK or elsewhere.

Price - Paid about $15 for the pizza, When I ate at CPK, I had a much better personal pizza for a lot less. Another friend who ordered pasta paid about same price as me but his portion was tiny.

Overall - We were there for dinner and the place was quite full, I liked the atmosphere and location of the place, it's right outside of the Hilldale Mall area and you can walk to a lot of places afterwards to walk your food off while shopping. I don't think I will be coming back to this place any time soon though.
