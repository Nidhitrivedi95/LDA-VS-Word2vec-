60uVlCUiLJvq3xNo_3bhQQ LOVE this little pizza place! It takes a lot for me to find a really good pizza that I sit and daydream about... Carmine's is drool worthy! Pepperoni and olives= perfection in my book! I prefer the personal size pizza because the crust is perfect each time. But the larger sizes are equally as delicious. 
Did I mention the ranch dressing?!!! I want to guzzle a gallon (but I resist)... and you CAN actually buy some to take home! The ambiance is cozy and I love the reminiscent decor. Outdoor seating is available as well and gated for some privacy! They provide take out and delivery. Prices are also extremely reasonable for what you get! I also love that I see the same friendly faces each time I go there. Definitely nice to have consistent customer service.
