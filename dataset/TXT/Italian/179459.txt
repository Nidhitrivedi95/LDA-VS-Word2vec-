nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A I recently ate here when I was in town for my birthday, and I'm glad I did. From the start to the end, service was great. 
The food was delicious. I remember before arriving looking at all the pictures and how cheesy everything was, which our plates did not disappoint with the amount of cheese. The garlic bread we orders came with three large slices, more than enough to share. I ordered the shrimp scampi. The shrimp were large and juicy, yum! My fiancé ordered the chicken Parmesan and he really enjoyed it. 
Atmosphere and food were great, the price was fair for the amount of food you get.
