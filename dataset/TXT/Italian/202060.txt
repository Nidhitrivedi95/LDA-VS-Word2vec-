Q2OjPFhDg_5JqzXmWChpZw Great lunch spot across the street from my office and 2 blocks down from the Notre-Dame Basilica.

They are purely a lunch spot, catering to a crowd looking for something cheap, cheerful, and good.  They have two different eating experiences - if you are coming in for take-out, just go up to the counter and pick out what you'd like.  You'll do better to sit down and have a good and quick meal at one of the snug yet comfortable tables.  

The owner/maitre d' is a jovial and gregarious Italian gentleman, who will gladly recommend whatever special he has that day, although the waiter can be a bit...curt.  The food is comprised of basic staple Italian fare, with good soups, pasta, and meat dishes.  Standouts are the calamari fritti and manicotti, although their specials on the meat side never disappoint.

Finally, if you like a bit of heat to your food, be sure to ask for "La Bomba".  I don't know what's in it, and my nose twitches in recollection.  I could only appreciate about two drops' worth on a piece of bread, although a colleague of mine who loves spice enjoyed every bite (notwithstanding the beads of sweat on his forehead).
