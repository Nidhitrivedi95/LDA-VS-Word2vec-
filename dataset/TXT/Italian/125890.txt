hrNIDao4XnOhrv7aaFehTg *NO STARS* so glad I started eating pizza first....there was pieces of black plastic in our pizza!!!! My 5 yr old was about to partake when I found 3 hard black pieces of plastic that I bit into! I can't believe that my kids could have bit into this or swallow it. We ordered a few items but were so disgusted that we just returned everything!  My husband left to return the items because I don't want to be accused of consuming the items and not returning it all...we wouldn't want to eat anything else anyway. Such a disappointment and ruining of dinner and appetites! We will def NOT be ordering from here again...once is enough! Terrible!
