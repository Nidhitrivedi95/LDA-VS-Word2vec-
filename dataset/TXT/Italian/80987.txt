dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw One of the best meals of my life. In fact, if I remember I over ate so much that night I actually had an out of body experience. Instead of an apple just stuff a big wad of black truffle potatoes in my mouth. I'm done.

This restaurant was recommended to me by George Carlin. Yes, THE George Carlin, so we scooted over there one night and were seated promptly. 

The prices are what you'd expect for the Strip but I hadn't heard anything about the executive chef, so I wasn't expecting to have my taste buds be punched with flavor. KO.

I had the Manzo that was cooked perfectly with a side of black truffle potatoes served in an all-clad pot. My wife had the lobster Gnocchi, which she talked about for days after.

I had some coffee with dessert, which they brought out in a french press. Nice touch and great eye opener.

I have been back several times.
