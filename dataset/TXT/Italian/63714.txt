BaVtTt9pBoI8rrN35tsj_g Great service, great food. Jessie was an awesome hostess. She was very friendly and was awesome to us! She even packed our food to go for us, when usually the waitresses would just give us the boxes. Only regret I have was being unable to find the general manager to give her more kudos!
