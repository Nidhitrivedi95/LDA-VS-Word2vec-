2i0dDzxLuQQAwzxDZVR-1g A friend asked to meet me for dinner and wondered if I was okay with Oretta as an option, and I actually got really excited because I'd never heard of the place. Going to a restaurant without knowing exactly what I'm going to order? What a novelty!

We decided to start with the Tagliere Misto ("selection of two cheese and two meats with pickles and jam") and it was very good. It also came with a whipped ricotta spread that was nothing short of delicious, while the meats and cheeses were also excellent. We could've used more than three slices of bread, but that's a fairly minor complaint.

For my main, I decided to order one of the pizzas: the Calabrese ("tomato, fior di latte, n'duja, rapini, pepper"). It's pretty tasty but falls short of excellence. My biggest problem was the inclusion of the rapini, which, although I usually enjoy it, was so bitter than it obliterated the other flavors in the pie. I enjoyed this pizza well enough but it doesn't quite compare to something like Pizzeria Libretto, unfortunately.

I should also add that the service was above average, although the restaurant does do that thing where they place the tables way too close together.
