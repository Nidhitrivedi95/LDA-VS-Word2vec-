UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ I absolutely love this place! Went for Valentine's day and me and my boyfriend were so pleased. They have great customer service & the food was delicious. They have a cute outside patio where there are dining tables set up. The food came in a timely manner even though they were super busy. I was very very happy that this is where we spent Vday! Plan on coming back often! I ordered a pasta with chicken, bacon, and spinach in alfredo sauce - my boyfriend had a pasta with lobster and shrimp in it. It was literally perfection on a plate! Not to mention the roasted & artichoke dip that came with it was TO DIE FOR. I loved it. With those three plates it came out to be about $65
