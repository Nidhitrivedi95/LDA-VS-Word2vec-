OXrFWgoz533T8tMRemkiww We were seated in the wine bar area as the first customers for the evening. Two other tables were seated about 15 minutes after we placed our order. Started off nice. Excellent cocktails and appetizers. We ordered 2 pasta dishes, 1 pizza and 1 calzone. The 2 other tables that sat after us received both their appetizers and their entrees were delivered before ours.  Finally our pasta dishes arrived. Then about 5 mins later our pizza arrived.  During that delivery I informed our waitress that my pasta was too hard and she took it back to the kitchen. Finally the calzone arrived.  My husband and sons finished their meals and I had yet to receive my pasta.  When I finally received it, it was good but not worth $18 for a cup of pasta.  I doubt if we would ever go back based on the poor service from the kitchen.
