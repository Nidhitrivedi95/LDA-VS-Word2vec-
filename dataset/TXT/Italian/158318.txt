LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Maggiano's is one few decent cheap eats in Las Vegas.  Located conveniently outside Fashion Show Mall, perfect place to grab lunch or dinner if you're at the North end of the strip.  There isn't a Maggiano's in the Bay Area, but this best resembles Romano's Macaroni Grill and/or Olive Garden.

My boyfriend and I came here for lunch before our flight home and ordered:
-Rigatoni D: chicken, mushrooms and rigatoni pasta [I forgot what sauce was used...since this was my boyfriend's plate and I didn't really eat off of it cuz my sandwich was so filling].
- Seared Salmon Sandwich: the sandwich included 1) seared salmon was so moist, 2) applewood bacon was so crispy, 3) avocado gave it the perfect ring to my sandwich (I LOVE avocados in my sandwich), 4) tomato, 5) lettuce.  The brioche bread was so fresh and soft!  Kettle chips was a bonus!

Bill wasn't too bad for 2 people considering how full we were.  More worth it than other places on the strip and our waiter was superrr nice & friendly!
