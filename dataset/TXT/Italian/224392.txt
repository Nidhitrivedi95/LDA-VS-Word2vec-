sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg I called to inquire about Valet Parking and was told that they most certainly offered Valet parking services.  Needless to say they do not.  I was told by the hotel across the street that they tell people that all the time so it won't keep people from coming.  Also, the food is average.
