cOWXtCz7F9GQhPIks8gm6Q Everything in here is homemade, and the restaurant is family owned. It's a gem, and is hope it gets the following it deserves. I had the Verdura, which is a vegan option, and a bruschetta that was to die for. The chef makes her own pasta fresh every day and her own Titamissu.. In a neighborhood full of chains, this is a welcome addition and I want it to do well!
