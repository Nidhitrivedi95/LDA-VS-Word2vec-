x4aHNNo1osWNCB75q_PijQ Was not impressed. Beautiful inside and food presentation was very nice. Service was also good. Mushroom soup was delicious. Had the salad with beets and tomatoes and there might actually have been beets and tomatoes in the salad but very, very few. Watched food workers mold dough without gloves ..... not good.
