OYaL_-uxBCgrE94uNQ4VCA Love this place. The delivery is SO fast and I haven't had a single thing I didn't like yet. The garlic knots are sinful. The gnocchi is cooked perfectly and the meat sauce is outstanding. Their subs are also great. The pastrami was so tasty (make sure you ask for it with everything, except I took of the tomatoes). Their Philly cheesesteak, also delicious. The only complaint I have is their jalapeño poppers and the fried mozzarella. I can expect the poppers to possibly be store bought but an Italian place that doesn't make their own mozzarella sticks? You can just tell. All around I love the place, the owner is very friendly and again, the fastest delivery I have ever seen. Will be continuing to order from her once a week.
