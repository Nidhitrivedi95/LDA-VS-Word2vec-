ehRigNzlkRQlvhzKr7PLCQ I don't like to give bad reviews when the place represents a good cause, food comes out hot and on time or when the service is fine. So, I will point out the positives and let the stars do the talking:
-Food was priced good for what you get
- real butter
- Hot and fast 
- juice or coffee priced w/the breakfast
-other folks seemed to be saying they liked the food
-short wait (when I went )
