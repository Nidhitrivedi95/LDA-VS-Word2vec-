xmARZ_MuSfrQCXP4e8RQjg We love this place. They are the real deal. Service is always great & it's never too busy. As for the food I know you want to know about the pizza. The crust is perfect the perfect ratio of crunch & chew. My favorite is the Mt. Veggie, which is saying something as I'm typically not a veggie pizza person. Any other time I'm a pepperoni & jalapeño (or olive) kinda girl, maybe Hawaiian. There's just something about the little caverns of cheese the veggies make, meanwhile the veggies come out hearty & flavor truly worthy of being on a pizza. However, the real treat here is something totally unexpected for a pizza joint, the salads. The secret is the house dressing which, honestly, if it wasn't frowned upon, I might just drink. It's that good. You can even get this sun dried tomato spiked treat by the bottle to take home.
