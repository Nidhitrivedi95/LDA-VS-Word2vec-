A caesar salad appetizer to start was crunchy and fresh with amazingly flavoured dressing. Complimentary brushetta, bread and olives are also served. The brushetta is laced with fresh basil, chopped tomatoes, red onions and drizzled with Italian olive oil. 

For entrees, we had the Chicken Parmegian with pasta and the Spagettini with bacon and goats cheese. Both dishes were excellent, although the spagetti bacon was a little over salted. Both dishes were served witth perfect 'al dente' pasta. 

The homemade Tiramisu to finish was pure greed (we were completely full by this stage). However, it was worth it. Fresh creamy layers with coffee liquor soaked sponge and cocoa power bliss. 

Service is friendly and very Italian, prices were reasonable and portions were large. The 'hidden gem' term certainly applies to this place and I will definitely return. Check it out - you will not be disappointed.
