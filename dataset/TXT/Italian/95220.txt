eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg I guess I missed the fine print when I was looking for a late night snack.  There is a happy hour menu after 10:30pm (or maybe it was 10pm).  I went to the hostess in order to place a to go order to take back to my room, but she told me that I had to order at the bar.  I went to the bar and asked about happy hour and the bartender said I had to wait a few minutes.  So I decided to wait.  He did not however say anything about having to eat in restaurant.  After waiting, I went back and tried to get a pizza to go.  I got the receipt and the pizza was $18 - full price.  I asked about the happy hour menu and was told I had to eat there.  I was not in the mood to argue or sit there so I just took paid and waited for the pizza.  All I got was a plain pepperoni pizza.  It was pretty good.  A little salty and the sauce made the crust a little soggy because it was pretty thin.  Not really worth $18, but I guess that's what I get after gambling all day and forgetting to eat dinner.
