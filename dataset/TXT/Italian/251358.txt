VraSwdw04w1LASF1xRBkdw I rarely venture to south Charlotte, so I was excited to try a place I never heard of before. Stopped by on Saturday evening for a quick dinner and was seated promptly. We decided to start with the half order of the anti-pasta salad. It was a good size for two as a starter. The dressing was great and loaded with meat and cheese pinwheels. We got the 18' (8 slices) pepperoni. Holy pepperoni! This pie was covered! The mozzarella tasted very fresh. I would say, that's one thing that really stood out to me. The pizza just tasted super fresh, just something about it. Yum!

Our waitress was friendly and we enjoyed watching basketball on the Tv's. Good local beer selection too!
