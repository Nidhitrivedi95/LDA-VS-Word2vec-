eQCYur0033RkZdh5VjbF8A 6 of us went yesterday to try it out.  I've been to the ob in bayview village but this location is the first.  The server we had thinks he had a good memory or what everyone ordered and tries not the write it down.  But he actual got it all mixed up.  But good try.  I ordered the lamb sirloin and it tasted sweet.  Doesn't suit my palate.  The wine selection is very average and new world.  The som could do better and offer a few selection that are more unique and non generic
