SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw I give it 4 stars because it was pretty good and inexpensive. The service was friendly and very fast to feed 3 starving teenagers. We ordered the garlic knots and a large cheese pizza. The place is a little hole in the wall and doesn't look nice, but we all felt it was pretty clean. Definitely a nice spot to go if you want fast pizza at a great price.
