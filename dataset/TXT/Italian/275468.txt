yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg God, if i could give this place negative stars i would. The owner is a friggin' prick and a half and the wait staff are just plain horrible - rude, entitled to not work or do anything, and acted like they were all around just annoyed that anyone would dare show up here. All the previous reviews about the so-called "owner" (or the guy who just looks like an old white disheveled vagabond at the front who likes to yell at and about people that come through the door) are absolutely spot-on. I should've read the reviews before coming to this place...please learn from my lesson and do the same if you're even thinking about coming here. Will never go back to this S&&Thole! As a side note, i walked down the street to Grimaldi's Pizza and that place is lightyears ahead in terms of food quality, service, and all around appreciation for your business.
