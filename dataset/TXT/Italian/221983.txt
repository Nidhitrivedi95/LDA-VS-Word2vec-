Manager was outside talking to some friends as we waited twenty minutes to get change for two dollars in quarters. The place had no way to access money via atm for cash to purchase tokens for the kids to play the limited games they have. The desserts for the kids were basically on the counter behind the buffet. Overall two stars and that's pushing it on this first visit....
