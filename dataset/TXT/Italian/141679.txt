JogUSDKa1xyG3lLEmD4Xjg Was staying in Charlotte for the evening and based on Yelp reviews, traveled a short distance to Fiamma. OMG, this place is incredible.  Amazingly beautiful ambiance and restaurant layout... they had candles and everything, not too stuckup but classy and romantic if you needed that vibe... I had the BEST service from Yoshi, he was an incredible waiter, I'm dead serious.  Wonderful fusilli pasta dish, made fresh, got a delicious glass of wine from Yoshi's recommendation, just a spectacular meal, and very reasonably priced.  Sat in the indoor window booth, so we could see it get dark outside.  The Yelpers were right, this place is wonderful.  I would go back in a second!    Highly highly recommended.
