OBG1j517k7aZRNC1HAL0TA I love the décor here.  I guess I would describe it as hipster...modern yet rustic. We were a group of 12 which included two babies (one that's 11 months and the other 22 months. The waiter was very accommodating to all of our needs (e.g., bringing extra plates, napkins, etc. for the children without us even asking). One of the couples wanted to share their dishes and the waiter took it upon himself to get the pasta dish split up into two separate portions.  He also regularly came back to check on our meals and to refill our water. So in terms of service, I think they were great! My husband and I ordered the pappardelle with braised beef and the beef, veal and pork ravioli.  Right away, you can tell that their pasta is made in house...and it's delicious!  Their sauces are flavourful and do not overpower the other ingredients.  We also ordered the frites with chives and truffle oil accompanied by a garlic aioli.  Then frites were delicious, but I would've liked them to be a little crispier.  Other than that, I would definitely come back here again to try one of their other dishes.
