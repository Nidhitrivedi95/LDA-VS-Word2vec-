BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg When my BF and I want pizza, this is where we go. We start by sharing one of their delicious salads. We especially like the Insalada Grande, Panzanella and Romania. The greens are always very fresh and the other ingredients are top notch. And then we usually have the Settebello pizza but sometime order a Margherita or Diavola pizza. We love their thin crust and fresh ingredients. Ask for their spicy oil to really bring out the taste.
