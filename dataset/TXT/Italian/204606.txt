QcV8KIPKbGRnWQPql55bKQ We placed an order for several hotdogs and one sausage for delivery (we are a local business located VERY near this restaurant).  After waiting 1 1/2 hours, our food FINALLY arrived.  It was clear it had been sitting for at least an hour or more after being prepared.  ALL of it was cold.  All of the buns were so soggy it made all of the hotdogs and sausage INEDIBLE.  Coldest french frys ever.  We called the restaurant (09/06/12 1:00 pm) and it was clear that the person who had took our order didn't care AT ALL.  They've lost our business for good.
