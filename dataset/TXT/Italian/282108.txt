YXvXE2p6xeg6a11SMIjQ3w The happy hour here is very good! I would not recommend the bruschetta it was diced tomatoes with Parmesan and nothing special at all. I really like the pizza. The cocktails are some of the best I've had and for that happy hour price can't beat it! We had several, the margarita, Moscow mile, and the rye whiskey one (can't remember the name). The house wine is also pretty delicious. Recommend the restaurant especially for happy hour!
