pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg Italian food, family style, I am in.  It's the spouses favorite Italian restaurant in NY (she's a NY Italian), so I assumed it would be good.  She had to have the tartufi.  The food we had was all great!  I enjoyed it very much.  They waste a lot of water by putting a pitcher on each table (not wise for a desert during a drought).  I look toward to going back.
