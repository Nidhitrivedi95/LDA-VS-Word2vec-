We were greeted by friendly staff as soon as we arrived and they were more than happy to offer suggestions as to what is good off of the menu (answer: everything! But they told us what is most popular). My daughter loved the spaghetti, husband enjoyed his butternut squash ravioli and I liked my meat lasagna. The best part of the meal was the antipasto salad we shared. So fresh and delicious! Although the food was exceptional, I would come back just for the salad! We had a cannoli for dessert.... Yum! You won't be disappointed.
