ZHNxxsZrowzP-RedJ6cSFA I stopped by with my hubby and a business friend for lunch today. Very cute little place with lots of fun Sinatra memorabilia. It took about 10 minutes to get our drinks but we were sitting around talking when she came by the first time. After we got our drinks, it took another 15 minutes or so for them to get our order. Once our order was in, our food came out in just a few minutes. Server was very polite, and all the staff was talkative and friendly. Food tasted great, sandwiches were fresh and the wedge fries were hot and tasty. What a great atmosphere, and especially if you want to go for a little music entertainment in the evenings. I would recommend.
