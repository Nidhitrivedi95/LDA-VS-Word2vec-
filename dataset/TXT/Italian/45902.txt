8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA I read all the reviews about Amore and we decided to try it since my boyfriend loves authentic chicago deep dish pizza. I ordered the chicken angelo. I do not recommend the chicken angelo unless you like canned mushrooms and artichokes. I am sure everything was canned and not fresh. The angelo sauce is the easiest sauce to make fresh but not here. Also the bathrooms were dirty, dirty, dirty. We will not be returning.
