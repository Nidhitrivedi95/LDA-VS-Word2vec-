The dishes are awesome and the wine even better. The staff is so helpful to walk you thru all your options and have a great date or family night out. From time to time, they have live music with a guitarist that just builds on the ambience. It is small and if you show up on a peak meal time, be prepared to wait - but it'll be worth it!!
