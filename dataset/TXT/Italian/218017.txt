rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ really a 4.25....

PROS
excellent service.....well timed...did not have food forced down our throats.

carrot cake...not an everyday item on their menu...yummy

short rib starter...very tender..excellent sauce...could have used a touch more seasoning

goat cheese salad...could be prepared easily at home...however, still excellent

peanut chicken entree...right on with spices

cappucinos...spot on...Lavazza espresso

martinis...had the hot and dirty...also a couple with bleu cheese olives and horseradish olives...extremely tasty...but a little pricey...go during happy hour for 2 bucks off each martini and starter ...5-630pm

CONS
duck entree...not enough flavor...slightly over crispy and dry

lamb chop lollipop starter...not much flavor. left with a lot of waste and connective tissue on bone...would have been nice to have a steak knife....but still to much effort needed to get all of lamb of the bones

patio outside...should have more foliage to block out gas station lights..simple fix with about $100 investment


WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK...most likely will get a couple of starters and martinis
