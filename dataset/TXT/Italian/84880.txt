DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA I was in Arizona visiting friends, I thought it would be fun to visit Amy's Baking Company, we ordered a "simple" sausage and pepperoni pizza, some ordered salad and one ordered a burger. As for the pizza, we should have ordered from Dominoes the salads tasted like it came from a salad bar and the burger was horrible. The only thing that was good was the desserts. Don't waste you time or money going for dinner, get fast food and pick up desserts here on the way home.
