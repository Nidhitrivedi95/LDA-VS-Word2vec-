UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ This is a solid restaurant. 

I've been to a location in Orlando, and now the one in Las Vegas. Every time the food has been consistent, flavorful, and served hot. This particular location has paid close attention to the aesthetics, which from a designer's point of view is always appreciated. 

More important however, when considering any restaurant with multiple locations and above-average prices is the food and service. Again, I have yet to be disappointed. Considering the brusque treatment I got at the Grotto in the Golden Nugget, I was afraid that might be par for the course. Thankfully it isnt. 

Brio's Vegas location in a walking mall is a nice change from the more parking lot-oriented locations in other states. Its nice to be on a patio that isnt overlooking only cars but real pedestrians going about their business. 

For a nice bite of Italian close to McCarran, Brio's Las Vegas location gets my nod.
