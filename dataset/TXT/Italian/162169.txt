lNh_U1fEfxtcLRpT1RpX8g This was my second visit to Cafe Notte, after having brunch there when they first opened a year or so ago. Two friends and I met there for drinks and dinner on a Thursday night, which is acoustic guitar night -- in the little room that is the Cafe Notte dining room, even quiet acoustic music is too loud, so needless to say, this drastically affected our ability to have any conversation. 

There was one server for the room that night, and the restaurant was full, so service was on the slow side. We were offered a bread plate while we were reading over the menu, which we gladly accepted, only to find out when we got the check that we were charged $2 for the bread (generally a pet peeve of mine to be charged for bread!). 

Two of us ordered mussels -- a bowl of probably 1.5 dozen mussels in a pretty tasty broth. I was a little nervous about ordering mussels here, but they were fine. The third ordered a risotto, which she considered just okay. 

There was nothing wrong with our visit, but it just didn't wow me.  Our bill was $85 (bread, 3 appetizers, 4 glasses of wine & a dessert), which is average, but between the loud music, the poor service, and the general okay-ness of the meals, I think we were all underwhelmed, and probably won't return to Cafe Notte again.
