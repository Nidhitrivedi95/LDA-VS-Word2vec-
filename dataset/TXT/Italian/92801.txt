EhuKnhTKJTm_EZ_QGe7PvQ Got the chicken parmesan with pasta on their lunch menu and the chicken soup. My husband ordered the exact same thing (plus one soda). It's been quite some time since we were here last and remembered why when we got the bill. The food is good (not outstanding) but a $35.00 bill for lunch menu items (smaller portions) I felt was not worth it. I saw on Mondays they are offering pick 3 for which includes soup or salad, dessert or appetizer and an entree from a special menu for $12.99. Might go back to try this special but there are just too many other options available more reasonably priced.
