SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg We went for the prefix lunch for $28 which is very reasonable for the Bellagio. The ala carte items were reasonably priced too. The portions sizes were adequate for a filling lunch but not a stuffed to the gills experience. The fountains were visible from our window seats and it is a quite different experience from having to stand and jostle with the crowds outside.

The food was quite tasty except for the lemon dessert which was too tart for me. I would return for dinner at some point to experience the fountains in the evening.
