pOhX1XjbBdPoO2Fyy8RGJg Sorry but I was not impressed. Looks like nice neighborhood place with some good character but the food was just so-so.

I had a small sausage pizza, lacked flavor and reminded me of a pizza served at high school.  I also had two meat balls, no flavour, but the sauce was alright.
