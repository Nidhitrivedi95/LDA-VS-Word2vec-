azE1DNVQFBU8boVbaJhj7w I don't mind paying high prices for great food, I just want it to be great and if it's not, I do expect the service to make up for it. Lidia's food was pretty good, but the service was just average and for the price of pasta, they weren't very accommodating to special requests.

Most of our group ordered the three pasta special. After the first round of pasta came by it seemed to take forever to get another round. The dessert I was hoping to get was 'reserved' for those ordering a special dinner that night, and when I ordered a glass of 'a dry red wine that's a bit oaky' I ended up with a somewhat sweet cabernet.

While the pasta that did come to the table was excellent, it wouldn't be enough to sway me back.
