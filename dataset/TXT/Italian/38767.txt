7CPGGNwHibzQtnERq7u2Hw Buca Di Beppo is an awesome family-style restaurant that serves up authentic Italian dishes in a cozy atmosphere.  They always play Italian music and the last time I went, some mobster look-alikes were having a nice dinner before they went and wacked someone I'm sure.

The dishes are all big enough to share, so it's fun to order a few different dishes and then pass them around the table.  

If you have a big enough party and you make reservations ahead of time, you can ask to be seated in the 'Pope' room.  There is actually a pope head in the middle of the table, and you can spin him around and if he happens to land on you, you're supposed to confess all of your sins. It's funny, I swear.
