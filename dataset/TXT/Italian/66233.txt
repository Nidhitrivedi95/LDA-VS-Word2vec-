bNNF6Z91L7Omfdi8QSo2_w This is a great place for a quiet lunch (exactly what we did when we first arrived) although, it was almost....too quiet. We returned the next day for the breakfast buffet and felt it was over priced. Though our toddler ate free, the bill was almost $70 for two of us....a lot for breakfast with very standard fare....Venture off site (if you can!) to Daily Dose or Arcadia Farms for breakfast nearby....
