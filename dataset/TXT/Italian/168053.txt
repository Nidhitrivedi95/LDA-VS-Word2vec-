mJ_ucQ2_3hfTsmCcKb-hgw Just stopped in here for a late lunch/early dinner.   The place is on the small size but that didn't matter to me as it was pretty empty for lunch. 

As an appetizer, I had the sausage and bean soup. While it was just a tad more salty than I would have liked, the taste was amazing. The sausage and white beans combined to make this a hearty soup on a cold day here in Pittsburgh. 

For my main meal I had the Bucatini, which comes with two mozzarella stuffed meatballs. This did was even more amazing. The pasta was cooked perfectly and it certainly tasted home made. The meatballs were out of this world!  They also tasted home made, but I'm not sure if they are. And the sauce that surrounded everything was absolutely delicious. 

Overall, a fabulous experience and I would definitely come back here again.
