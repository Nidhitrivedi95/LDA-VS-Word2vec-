YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw Horrible service!!!! Sat at the bar with a bartendar named Jen, she was so rude. Had to ask for the check 3 different times and there were only 4 other people at her bar. Asked for lemons, she gave us limes then rolled her eyes when we asked for the lemons we originally ordered. She didn't tell us her name at first so called her sweetie... BIG MISTAKE... the food is good but not worth it for the service you will receive. Don't sit at the bar, and if you do and her name is Jen.. RUN.
