RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q Worth every penny and then some. The secret is in the sauce I am pretty sure. The pizza is thin crust and sliced into squares so each piece is easy to handle. Meats are great and fresh, spegetti calzone is amazing, and prices are really good for the quality you get. Be warned though...,once you have Spinato's pizza the other stuff just won't do.
