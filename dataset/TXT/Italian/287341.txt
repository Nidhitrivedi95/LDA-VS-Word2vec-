zKwzMHiufpQ3bRAA7R7f8w I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time. I went last night and still can't decide if I liked it or not. The service was average. The atmosphere was loud. The seating was a bit strange. One giant table down the middle of the room where you were seated with others. 

The shrimp alfredo I ordered was a bit bland.

However the chicken piccata we ordered was the best I have ever had. I would go back to try other meals based on the amazing flavor of this chicken alone.
