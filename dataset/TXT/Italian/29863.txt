The hospitality was also amazing. The manager was constantly patrolling and making sure that everyone was enjoying their food. Since it was my girlfriend and my anniversary, they gave us a complimentary dessert, which was a fantastic chocolate mousse. All around this was an amazing dining experience from the food to the service and everything in between. No doubt that I'll come back and done here again.
