In fact, if I focus on this, I can almost forget the taste of smoke in my mouth, the toothless guy with the cracked hands that kept grabbing my arm, and the horrendousness of my off-the-strip suite in hell.  

I loved the feel of sitting on the "patio" in the square. I loved the fried squash blossoms - the bit of ricotta was completely unexpected and delicious and I can't wait to have it again.

The blood orange cosmo was divine, not at all syrupy like other cosmos, and it lacked the bitter after taste I sometimes get with cosmos made with orange vodka. 

And then there's the pizza. I'm giving up pizza for a month because the Pancetta with carmelized onions and goat cheese was as good as pizza gets. The tomato sauce was fantastic, a little tangy, which I adored. The goat cheese wasn't too earthy like goat cheese sometimes is, and well, how can you go wrong with pancetta and onions? The crispy thin crust was still chewy, too. Hooray! 

Seriously, when in the Venetian, head down here in the afternoon, ideally just before the mimes start a performance (ask for a seat that allows a view) and order yourself a glass or two of Prosecco or some blood orange cosmos. Order the pizza (any will do) and try yourself some fried squash blossoms...you'll thank me.

Another tip: Don't go to any off-the-strip buffets, even if 16 of your friends are going there for dinner. You'll regret everything about that decision.
