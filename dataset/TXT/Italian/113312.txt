Gh-qmVwvibLnNdqEZXcQHw I ate here last week with some friends from college.  I wasn't sure what to expect since I had seen good reviews and bad reviews.  That atmosphere was nice but don't like the fact that you need a special key for the bathroom which is not inside the restaurant.

The menu is way to big.  It took us 25 minutes at least to order.   One thing that upset me was that the waitress said you can't make substitutions.   At the same time she also said everything was made fresh.  Seems like a small thing, but couldn't let it go. 

Portions sizes were big, only ate half my meal.  We ordered dessert and went over to the case to see what they had.  Besides the fly in the case sitting on one of the cakes it looked good.  We ordered some dessert and for the money I would say pass and go somewhere else.  This was the smallest slice of cake I have ever been served.  Some of the others at my table complained that their cake was really dry. The waitress also split the check for the party but already added a 20% gratuity according to my friend.  I didn't verify the percent but seems excessive for auto gratuity which is traditionally 18%.   Spent 66 dollars for two entrees two desserts and two sodas.    There are  many better places to spend my money,  I won't be back,  sorry euro cafe.
