bYPahCt2MBgEqSahPS8GJQ Visiting from New York City on business. Staying at the Lowes hotel, which is about 5 blocks walking distance. Braved the cold 20-degrees and carried it all the way back to my hotel room. Still arrived piping hot. Ordered the veal parm with spaghetti and caesars salad. Salad was crisp, lightly seasoned. The veal parm was still warm, felt like they just made it as I arrived for pickup. Veal was tender and succulent. Very happy with the texture, and seasoning. However the sauce was a little bland. Only negative I could find. The thin spaghetti was al dente, maybe a touch undercooked. But I ate it and was somewhat satisfied. Overall, for my first Italian take out in Montreal I came away satisfied. But I'm still on the lookout for "my go to" Italian spot the next time I'm in town for business.
