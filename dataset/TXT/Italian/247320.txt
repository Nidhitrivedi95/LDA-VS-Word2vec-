VA95qAV2PRH9gtTi2Vfv4Q The Mafalde ai Funghi was simply delicious. As a vegetarian, I am always delighted to find a well-known spot that adequately caters to non-meat eaters. This has become one of my staple recommendations to friends and family! The only reason I did not give them a 5-star is due to the lack of service. Regardless, I think this is a great dish and a great place for any one to try!
