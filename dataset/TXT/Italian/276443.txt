yfqcuTARKwO0Wx3VuMWrWQ My husband suggested TJ's because he loves their Italian wedding soup and before his retirement this was a regular with the people at his work.  The parking lot was really crowded which is always a good sign.  We walked in and seated ourselves.  We were quickly greeted by the server (I  think he was also the owner) and our drinks appeared very quickly.  Took me forever to decide what I wanted but opted for the Italian wedding soup and it was as good as my husband had said.  Wonderful  home made rolls and they were so nice and warm.  The butter melted on them.  I ordered seafood alfredo but wanted to swap out the pasta since I really enjoy the thin pasta.  No problem at all.  My husband had a veal parmiagian (I can't spell it) and he loved it. Service was excellent, the food delicious and there was enough to take home for lunch for me the next day. I love this place and we'll be coming back often.
