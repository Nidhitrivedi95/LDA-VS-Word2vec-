y0QzKWNVoXCbZpk6uhEgGA Let me make this simple. Six hungry people waited in line. Six hungry people ate, calamari/mussels appetizers and garlic bread. 2 linguine pescatores/1 fettucine alfredo/ 2 chicken parmesans. 1 Veal parmesan. 1 liter of red wine. 2 Coffees and 1 expresso. 2 cheesecakes. $126.00!!!! Before tip. Six full diners, so full they were almost bursting at the buttons/belts. 
Serve was very welcoming and friendly. Food was like a home made kitchen. Something you would expect in an Italian home. Loved the flowers and décor inside and out. We were not in a rush nor did we feel like we were being rushed to eat and move along. It is a bit loud with all the patrons chatting. I will be back again and again.
