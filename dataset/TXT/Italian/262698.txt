wuHPirjfXUCpNL3XO_vHUg Love this place.  I have been here many times and  the food is consistently great. I have never had a bad meal here. I have had most of the items on the menu.  The Caesar salad, Calamari, Arrabbiata pasta, Pepperoni pizza and Don Corrado pizza are my favorite.  The owners are fantastic and take great care to provide a quality dining experience.  I really enjoy the second floor dining area which is an adults only section.  Brooklin has a lot of families so If you are planning on going here without children, I recommend going after 7:00pm on a friday or saturday night as most families will be done dinner by then.
