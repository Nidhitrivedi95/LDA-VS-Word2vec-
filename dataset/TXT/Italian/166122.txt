mClrNYcwg8-pUJA2yMJttA Pretty good. We just happened to try this out based on the reviews on yelp. I really enjoyed my meal. I ordered the Osso bucco $24.  Large portions and delicious.  The chicken parm was $19.  The ambiance was really nice. They had live music which was tasteful.  I would visit again for sure.
