wo6Z6VLOJejln04CsoX1WQ Not sure why this place has such good reviews but it is pretty bad. Maybe they do delivery better than sit in.

Food -- pizza was best thing we had and that was mediocre. Soup and pastas (and especially the pasta sauce) tasted like it came out of a can. I do not recommend any of the pastas.

Service -- If I got a dollar for the number of times the waiter had to say sorry to us other tables, we would have got our five meals paid for. Just get it right man--it's a tiny restaurant, it can't be that hard. And food was soooo slow in coming.

Overall just a poor place to eat. I felt the need to make a review because this place unjustifiably has a high review.
