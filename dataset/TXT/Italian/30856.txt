5MXNeLctex2NmVZHnSvIvg This restaurant just open their new location in Kennedy Twp.. I was extremely  disappointed. This was their opening day. Could understand that everything was a little hectic and slow in service along with a long time (20 mins.) between salad and my meal. I ordered the Chef's Lasagna with extra sauce. First the small salad. It was served in a small saucer. Nothing exceptional and you get more from chain restaurants. Then came my meal, disgusting. Not a lasagna you'd expect from an Italian restaurant. Not even a taste to resemble lasagna. It was loaded with cheese and hardly any sauce. I ordered extra sauce. The lasagna was served in a casserole dish, now do you think there was extra sauce. Any other restaurant serves it on the side so you can add as much as you like. As I kept eating the lasagna, I wasn't sure if it was pieces of chicken I biting into so I asked my wife to taste it. Sure enough it was chicken, not called for on the menu for lasagna. Good thing I wasn't allergic to it. I didn't quite eat half and had the rest boxed up. My wife's meal was only a salad not much but she said it was very good. Then came the bill $$$. Yes it is a little hefty for what you get. My lasagna was $15.95 on the menu, but there was a $4.95 up-charge for the chicken, of which I didn't order nor ask for. Oh another $1.50 for the extra sauce which there wasn't any. My lasagna is now $23.95, "WOW." My wife's salad should have been $8 ended up being $10. We did have desert, as scoop of ice cream and expresso. Total bill $41.95. We are local to this restaurant, but would find it hard to give it a second chance. There is an Italian restaurant  in West Park (called 1905) about a mile and a half from here that makes this restaurant look really "BAD."
