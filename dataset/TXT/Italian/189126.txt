OYaL_-uxBCgrE94uNQ4VCA I've been going to linos for a while now! I have nothing but good things to say about there business and the family that runs this establishment , my go too is garlic knots and any pizza cut into squares!! Can't go wrong here. I would recommend anyone in the centennial area looking for good pizza spot!
