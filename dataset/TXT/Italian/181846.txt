o75ipeJO4E0Pfvq39jwcQg I picked this restaurant for my birthday dinner with my cousins. I'm attracted to 'made-to-order' restaurants that can accommodate someone with a severe dairy allergy, but unfortunately I chose poorly. Let me caveat by saying that the rest of my family had an amazing meal here. The atmosphere is cute, the server was very sweet and accommodating, but sadly the chef was sloppy and careless. After explaining my dairy allergy, the waitress brought me my dinner. After two bites, I felt a tingle on my lip and proceeded to fork a piece of penne, which had a long string of cheese attached to it. The waitress was extremely embarrassed and apologetic & took my entree to the kitchen, where the chef denied that there was any cheese in the dish, but begrudgingly made another one for me. The second round tasted awful and was missing the shrimp I had ordered, but at this point the rest if my party was almost finished eating, so I just let it go. The waitress was nice enough to take he shrimp off my bill, but not the entire dinner. I mean they only almost sent me to the hospital. In any case, this is a nice restaurant but steer clear if you have any dietary restrictions. Made to order? Not so much.
