h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ Came in for lunch and the food was adequate for the price.  Service was mediocre at best.  Menu was inaccurate and failed to mention that my order had cheese on it.  Sign board with daily specials written with dark color chalk on dark background impossible to read.  Wouldn't go back again.
