NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ Love this place and love the atmosphere here! They play movies (The Departed was on when we went) and cool music. Its dimly lit with cool purple lights. Our server was bomb! Now for the food... It was so delicious. My caeser salad was so freakn good! My fiance doesn't even eat salad and he was eating this salad. I got spaghetti with meatballs. Yummy! Their portions are huge too. Can't wait to go back!
