fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg This place is awesome! Definitely one of the best noodle joints in Phx metro area.  Had the spicy Korean beef noodles and the hakata ramen (salmon replaced the pork). Their eggplant appetizer was unique and delicious but was tempted to ask if they had a side of rice with it. Definitely coming back!
