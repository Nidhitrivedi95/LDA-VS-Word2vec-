6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA I don't like uni.  I don't like it at all.

But the Uni Tomato Cream Spaghetti?  To die for! 

I took a risk and ordered it for the first time 4 visits ago and have not ordered anything else since because I am in love with this pasta.  I'm sure their other dishes are great but this Uni spaghetti is so deliciously sweet and savory that I cannot bring myself to order anything else.  It's that good!

Fortunately, I've tasted my friend's food.  My husband really likes their Wagyu beef and kurobuta pork hamburg steak.  He says it's "solid" and he's quite a picky eater.  Others really like the miso carbonara, the squid ink pasta, the Kurobuta Sausage and Mushroom.

I say go for gold and get the Uni Tomato Cream Spaghetti.  Do it!
