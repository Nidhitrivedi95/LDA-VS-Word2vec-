h_y6FbNPaFbAgeMCD4bcAw Let me start it off by saying the customer service here is fantastic. They are warm and friendly. The atmosphere of the restaurant was classy and had a nice Italian feeling to it. The path to bathroom was unpleasant, the bathroom is side by side with the dishwashing space so you would feel hot steam and smell some weird odour coming to and from the bathrooms. The bathroom itself is nice though. The food here tasted amazing but it came in small portions and a heavy price. Overall, it was a great experience to try one of the many restaurants in Unionville, but it's a first and last time for me.
