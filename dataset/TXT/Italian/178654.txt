NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ This was my 3rd time here. Fantastic Italian food. Ordered the special steak and risotto. Cut like butter, awesome flavored mushroom bernaise . The spaghetti and famous meatball was a little dry this time, so did not eat all of that. They comped dessert to make up for it. You can't ask for extra sauce since all is prepared to order, so ask for more sauce in advance. Great wine list, and great waiter. Knew the menu well. Will be back when visiting Vegas.
