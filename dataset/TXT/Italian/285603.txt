zFnPRtP7LGvr3sfxvy_dfg Stopped in for a pie and a few brews Saturday evening. It had been a couple months, which is a long time between visits for me, and I discovered they had redone the bar area.  About doubled the bar length. I am usually alone and prefer sitting at the bar which in the past was often full. No trouble getting a seat now.  They added TV's too so there was a game to watch from every seat.

The pizza was great as usual. Same great crust. Same fresh toppings. So yummy. 

It was their 4th anniversary and they had some special limited availability brews on tap. And of course their usual huge and tasty lineup of "reagular" tap beers.  Awesome. 

Only 4 stars this time because they had the music blasting way too loud. I was told the managers were trying to create a party atmosphere for the anniversary celebration. Could barely communicate with the bartenders was so loud.
