JSnEUK2skTyYVaAQBqIJPw Well I was hungry and found this place. Went in as it said Italian and was ready for my usual disappointment with this country's fake Italian culture. I looked around and said ok the place looks comfortable. There is a small hot table sort of thing and a menu as well. Ok cool so far. Oh and they are actually speaking Italian. Well the anticipation is killing me let's order some food and see what they got. I ordered some of the Friday special fish. Well hey what's up with this it's actually really good. And there is no attitude from the staff. People are acutely friendly. Like really not that fake pretentious friendly but actual eye contact friendly. Then I ordered my go to sausage sandwich. Wow this is really good. So I'm really confused because this place has nice friendly staff with authentic really really good real Italian food. Why is it so hard for other places to do this. I have reviewed several places and I'm very critical especially if you claim to be Italian. This place seams to be able to do this perfectly with little effort. It's very refreshing to see this place function. I don't think they could tell by me just sitting there in amazement at the place but it's really good and I don't just say that. My suggestion for all other Italian places to go by here and have a bite to eat. And please try to learn something. 
I will stop by here every chance I get. I would defiantly stop by with clients I'm trying to impress. 
Great job people please keep up the amazing job.
