VgfqjXetLMxn5X5_uomBkg I had the pleasure of attending a friends wedding last weekend that Alexi's Grill catered. 
This was such a class act. The staff were so professional and Michael managed the event perfectly. You had the sense that everything was taken care of, no worries. 
The presentation was fabulous, creative and fun. 
You can see that this establishment and its owner take great pride in the quality of every aspect of the event. 
Now to the food. OMG the appetizers were incredible. So fresh and full of flavor. 
Dinner was exceptional. Hot like your mother just took it from the kitchen amazing mushroom sauce on the chicken, cooked perfectly. Oh and they prepared some food outside so the aroma was like you were in Florence. Seriously.
The pasta was out of this world, vegetables cooked just to the point of a crunch.
Bread, yum.
And of course desert, I tried them all. Absolutely a 10. You can not go wrong with this caterer. 
I have also enjoyed lunch and happy hour at the restaurant. It is such a class act. 
Do not miss this gem. Quality all round and a complete pleasure of an evening.
