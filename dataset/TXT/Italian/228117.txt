SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog Food here is delicious. The bread and salad at the beginning of the meal is extremely delicious. It's probably the best part of the meal. I ordered the chicken parmesan. It had a little too much sauce for me and not enough cheese but overall it was good. My husband ordered the Baked RigaTony and he thought it was tasty. The staff was nice and happy. We will definitely be back.
