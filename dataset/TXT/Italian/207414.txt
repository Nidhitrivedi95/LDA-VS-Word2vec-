qisbqK1wxuwp6GumMrwB2Q Been here twice now and think it's a new favorite. The first time in was couple Saturday's ago and three of us split the Mista salad and 2 pizzas. Quattro Formaggi, a white pizza with just the right amount of cheese, the Gorgonzola gives it a nice kick. Speck and Brie, a red pizza that was suggested by our wonderful waiter, interesting blend of Brie with prosciutto, YummO. We topped it off with a couple beers and a bottle of wine and ended the dinner with shots of limoncello. The second stop in was a late Sunday afternoon by myself, happy hour all day Sunday. At the suggestion of the owner Nick I started with a drink special, a Chambord margarita, good and refreshing after a busy afternoon. I ordered the mini pizza and mini cheese plate off the happy hour menu. Pizza was good and tasty, salame and such a fresh basil taste. I definitely took home leftovers. I finished up with a glass of Prosecco and limoncello cheesecake which was wonderful and light. The owner Nick is always so welcoming and makes it a point to check in on guests. You've gotta go!!!!
