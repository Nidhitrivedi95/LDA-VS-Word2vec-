LXheNwqZPoXuXNNeP1sNew We were one of 4 tables in the restaurant at 6 p.m. on a Saturday night.  We ordered calamari which was delicious.  The pizza literally fell apart as we picked it up.  We had to eat the toppings and crust  separately. The crust was soggy. Service was very slow considering how slow the restaurant was.  We won't be back :(
