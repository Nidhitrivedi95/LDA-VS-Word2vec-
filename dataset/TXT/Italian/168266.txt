MJr8aeWhwTvpLz0mrX5hCw I was excited to try this place but unfortunately it fell short.  I ordered delivery and when I finished my order request the person that took my order said "that's a small order, you sure you don't want to come get it?".  I was just thinking, that's the whole convenience of delivery?? I ordered the "It's a Rapp" with various meats and basil.  I found the sauce to be not even as tasteful as I could make at home.  The crust was pretty good but the basil was dark and yucky. I also requested no green peppers and they were on there and embedded in the cheese, so not so easy to take off.  I ordered a Cannoli and it was very disappointing.  The cannoli was soft and overpriced at $5.00 for one.  I really wished this would have been good, but unfortunately it was not even as good as some frozen pizzas I've had.
