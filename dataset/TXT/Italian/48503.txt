97-_E9JpqbUmaUg33-SOyQ Stay away from this store!!!!!!!!!!!!! They need to be shut down or the staff Aaron the "manager" was very rude and staff member Deonte. I called im to order a pan pizza, and he says, we are out of pan pizza because theres not any pans available!!!!??!??!!! And he laughs like its just a joke. I immediately! Asked for a manager thats when Aaron came on the line and was highly rude!!! I asked if he could take my order instead of the other guy who was clearly unprofessional and Aaron then hangs up in my face!!!!!!! I get to the store, i ask for his managers name and corporate number to file an complaint and he hets highly upset and tells me to get out his store and that he is the only manager and they have no corporate number!!!!! Someone really needs to do something about their HORRIBLE customer service!!!!!!
