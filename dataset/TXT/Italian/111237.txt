G099MT9cwtwgdsR71JLp6w Come here for dessert or lunch. They have the best sandwiches in madison. Their butterscotch pudding is exceptional (and is also the only regular item on the dessert menu) and so is their flan if they have it. Been here a couple times for dinner and I would not recommend it, but maybe I will try again. The interior is warm and cozy.
