_OAtYMzu_oOf2-HGVhrHVQ Brothers Pizza does not honor coupons.  They make it look like they do but they really don't.  I ordered Pizza twice online and received an email stating how much it was and then when I got there and presented a $10 off coupon they didn't take $10 off the price I was quoted online but actually charged me more than what I was quoted online giving me a BS reason of the online system quoted me the wrong price.  Even after I showed them the email they still didn't budge on the price.  So I basically wasted my Restaurant.com Coupon there.  Pizza is good but Service is Terrible.  Not surprised we were the only people in the restaurant the way they treat people.

I completely understand not honoring the 10% off online and the $10 off coupon but it appears as a consumer that I didn't receive either tonight.  The Subtotal on the email was $21.70 before tax.  10% of that is $2.17 which brings the normal Subtotal to $23.87 plus tax which puts me at about $26.  If your not going to honor both which is fine, take $10 off my original Subtotal before the online discount and that puts my bill at about $16.  Not the $23+ I was charged tonight.  I would much rather have $10 off than $2.17.  And if there is something wrong with the online pricing to where the price is not correct for what you ordered online then get it fixed.  Don't have the customer think they owe one amount and then they get there with a coupon and get charged a totally different amount.  As a Manager myself of a Business, I feel this situation should have been handled much differently tonight in order to keep a customer.  They obviously did not want to keep me as a customer the way I was treated tonight.
