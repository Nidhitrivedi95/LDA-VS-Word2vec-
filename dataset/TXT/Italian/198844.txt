pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw People must rate this place high because they are just that hungery when they finally get to sit down.  I don't understand at all what the fuss is about.  No way in hell is this "the best pizza in America" as Oprah and Rachel Ray say; they must have some investment in this place because this pizza is nothing special.  The pizza's are overpriced (like $15-$20) for a personal pizza.  Maybe because there are no brick oven places out in the valley like back East I'm used to, is why this place is so hyped.  You can get much better pizza at Spinato's in Tempe or anywhere else in Chicago, NJ or New York.  Not worth a 30 minute wait, let alone the 2-3 hour wait people seem to do. 

Thanks but no thanks.
