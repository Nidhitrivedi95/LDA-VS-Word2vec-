Z0c9-Eoxz7SQ__68bl3TQw My wife and I went to Nora while on a visit to Cleveland. I couldn't have been more impressed with the attention to detail. We had the bone marrow appetizer and meatballs both of which were excellent. Both the parpadelle bolagnese and veal were delicious and the service was top notch. Will definitely return!
