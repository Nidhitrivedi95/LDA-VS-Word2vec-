UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Second time coming here and it's only been for happy hour! It's so great:) my sister and I decided to spend some quality time together. We sat at the bar because all the couches were taken. Delmar was amazing:) Excellent service. He was so nice and even made my sis and I a yummy shot because she recently turned 21. Cute! Kind! And good at what he did. No complaints here lol oh and the food is always good. Next time I go here I'd like to see the actual menu though. I'm sure it's delish. Dessert was also very good! Overall this place is great to go out on date or hang out with the girls.
