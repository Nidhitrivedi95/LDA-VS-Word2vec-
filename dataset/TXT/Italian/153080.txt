KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg Just enjoyed the Pizzeria Lunch Prix Fixe, and it was excellent!

The arugula salad with pear and shaved parmesan was fantastic, great quantity, with a sweet, delicious dressing.  Secondi was the margherita pizza (always a classic), and it was up on there on the 'my favourite pizza' list. The additional $2 for extra cheese was well worth it. I think everyone I ate with was jealous of the choice. The chocolate gelato in a tumbler was the perfect end to a great lunch. And all for $15!

Service was fantastic, very friendly AND attentive. Great setting as well, quaint but lively! All in all, a lovely place to lunch!

One downside, they don't have tea!
