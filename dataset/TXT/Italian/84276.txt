DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw No you're not in Brooklyn your in the desert.  It's mostly all here in a boring strip mall - the older cashier from Sicily, the large selection of olive oil, the homemade cannoli, and the other Italian items one would expect.  

It's like getting a big hug from your tough Italian Aunt.
