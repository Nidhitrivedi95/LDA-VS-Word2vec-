So132GP_uy3XbGs0KNyzyw We went late on Sunday night and the place was packed and we didn't have reservations. Didn't think we'd need any at that time. However, they were able to seat the 2 of us right away at one of only 2 tables available. The food was phenomenal and the staff was very friendly. Our waiter, Tony, was very personable and attentive. My wife needed to custom order her dish and they gladly accommodated her needs. It can get a bit expensive if you order an appetizer, dessert and a lobster dish. Our dinner for two, even after using a $25 gift cert from restaurant.com was $98 including tip. If you order a canoli or creme brulee, you get a free souvenir t-shirt.
