DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw After reading about this place in an airline magazine (never trust those reviews) I thought I'd try it.  Lasagna was good, not great.  The only thing more over priced than the food was the wine.  Salad, lasagna, 1glass of average pinot noir was $55 not including tip.  You can do better for less.
