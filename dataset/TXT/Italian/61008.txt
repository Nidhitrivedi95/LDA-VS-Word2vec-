Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg I love the food here. Authentic and delicious. We had sea bass with veggies and cheese ravioli. For appetizer, we had percutio, marinated olives, bell peppers, artichoke, and caprese. 

The fish had great flavor, ravioli was delish! Appetizers were just right!

Desert is awesome. One of the best places for tiramisu and authentic cannoli!
