Looking at their menu, I love that they offer you the choice of spinach vs white pasta. It's such a change because you usually never get to choose.

I ordered the spinach pasta with meat sauce and my friend ordered the lasagna. We shared both and it was so delicious! Their lasagna is so cheesy, warm, comforting, and filling. Their spaghetti tastes fresh and the meat sauce is so well made. 

I don't like that they are cash only but at least the ATM fees are just 1.95$.

A great place for a date, a friend lunch/dinner, a family meal, or a solo adventure!
