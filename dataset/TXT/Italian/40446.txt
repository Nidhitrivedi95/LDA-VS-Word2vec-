7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Ugh the disappointment is overwhelming.

I loooove Mario Batali because i don't really trust skinny chefs... which is not a problem for that fine gentleman, but I don't know what they hell happened at Carnevino.

Take a look at the other Yelp reviews on this page, A restaurant of this caliber, which caters to these discerning diners, and charges as much as this place does, should have nothing less than 4 stars. But I guess I am not the only person to see the lackluster performance of the place.

Now by all means, the food is not bad. The bone-in rib eye is massive, the taste is decent but it came out quite dry with a questionable texture. I like the fact that it was cut tableside, but we ordered it medium-rare but it came out medium-well if anything.  Sides such as the corn with lime and chilies is ok, while the eggplant with tomato and ricotta cheese was good but far from impressive. I would speculate that these dishes could have been made by an amateur chef, not what I'd expect from Mario Batali.

One of major issues with the place was simply the price. The average diner cannot get out of here under $100, add even more if go with wine pairing. Now, I don't have an issue with paying if the food is worth it, but I am not sure if thats the case here. The fact is that there are alot of high-end steakhouses on and around the strip that compete for your business. For the money you are going to spend here, you are better off at Wolfgang's Cut (also in the Palazzo) SW at the Wynn, and even save some cash and check out Capital Grille across the street.
