78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw i think we were more enticed to step in here because of the walk-up la creperie located right next to it (thought it was part of the restaurant). darn, we really should've went there! the food here was okay, nothing great or flavorful but their portions are hefty!

-the fresh baked bread were glorious
-lobster bisque was too rich
-mixed salad was delightful
-WARNING: do not to get the pizza (since we weren't too happy with the pizza, they took it off our bill)!
-chicken penne pesto pasta was perfectly al dente, except that the chicken was a lil dry
-the eggplant parmesan was decent

we had to end our meal on a sweet note..so we ordered the french beignet (known as a french market doughnut). the banana beignets were coated in powdered sugar and served with a chocolatey-coconutty sauce and a rum creme sauce. wow, this made up for the "not-so-good" meal. 

so my 4 stars goes to the bread, dessert and great service.
