MWYJl-bIxhtQ-4Kg3ENUxA We tried the Chicago style pizza and hot buffalo wings. Both were good, but neither was particularly noteworthy. The pizza had a very thick and somewhat doughy crust and a good amount of cheese and toppings. The sauce is a little on the bland side and the two pizzas I ordered both failed to travel particularly well even though it wasn't a terribly long drive home. The first small pizza was sausage and pepperoni and it was probably the better of the two. The sausage was somewhat on the bland side with very little in the way of savory or spicy flavor. That being said, the texture of the sausage was really good and the amount on the pizza was generous. The pepperoni was also pretty good, but not being on top of the pie during cooking means it doesn't brown up nicely and it gets a little lost. The other small pizza was veggie and it was also good, but somewhat on the bland side. The veggies give up a fair bit of liquid during cooking so this pizza did not hold together structurally as well as the other. The cheese on both was abundant but not exciting and lacked some of the amazing pull that comes on the very best pizzas. 

The wings were cooked nicely, although maybe one more minute in the fryer wouldn't have hurt. These wing are breaded then fried which makes them slightly heavier than non-breaded wings. The hot buffalo sauce was good, but again, nothing special. 

Rosati's was good pizza and I would be curious to try their thin crust options, but there are much better options in Madison and incomparably better options in Chicago. I also thought it was a little silly to be charged $0.53 for a side of hot giardinaire on a $48 order of two small pizzas and wings. Not the end of the world by any means, but still a little lackluster.
