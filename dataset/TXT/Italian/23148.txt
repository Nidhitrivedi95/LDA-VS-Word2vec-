3psSpUMwT4zdNca2pOPxRw Let me start with a short story: I had eaten the pizza from here before and been very impressed. It was fresh, slightly doughy but not overly so, toppings were good and cheese was evenly distributed and overall good quality. I said I would order again.

So, tonight I had friends over at my place, one from out of town who wanted a local Toronto business to eat from so I suggested we order here. When I called I asked if they had any two medium or two large specials with three toppings and they they advised me to order one called the "Football Special". It was $26.99 for two larges. Since I had specified I wanted three toppings, I assumed these came with the special. Nonetheless I asked to clarify and the guy on the phone kept repeating the special so I figured that's what it was. The pizzas arrived in about 50 min. Not too long, but considering how close they were and that the driver said they weren't busy that night, not too quick either. But that wasn't the issue. The issue was that the pizzas came out to a whooping $53!! The driver had left by the time I looked at the receipt and my friend's girlfriend had put it on her credit card and was the one who had signed for it so it was too late, but $53??! On top of that, we'd asked for double bacon and there was definitely NOT double bacon on it, and the receipt said we'd asked for goat cheese on one pie, which we hadn't. 

Won't EVER be ordering again. They ripped us off. Terrible experience
