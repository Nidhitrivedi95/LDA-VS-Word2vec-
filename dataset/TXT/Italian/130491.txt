Iam7tYWhssw_rscSBkeRIQ Let me start by saying that I am a self proclaimed pizza snob. I grew up in Central New York and have spent a considerable amount of time in New York City where it's difficult to find bad pizza. That being said, I was delighted to find Fiori's. The staff was friendly upon arrival and patient as we looked at the menu. The menus pizza section says "thick crust" which made me nervous as I was hoping for a thin crust NY style. I asked if they do a thin crust and also how thick their normal crust is. The pizza maker showed me what the standard crust looks like and it was exactly what I was hoping for. So we ordered a large pie, half meatball and half Italian sausage and it was delicious. Fresh and plentiful cheese with a nice sauce. Sauce had a very subtle sweetness to it. The gentleman who made our pizza brought it to our table and offered grated cheese and red pepper flakes. Very friendly atmosphere with a big screen tv which was showing a soccer game at the time. It's worth the trip into the south hills for this pizza as many locals had told me. We will definitely be back
