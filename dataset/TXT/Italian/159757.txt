lgWB0yGXpZvupYREWxtV7g Like Amber- I want to hate this place. There is just so much hoopla in this country over some pizza and the like.
What Panne Bianco gets right is 
-quick, polite, but personalized service
-a great short menu with no surprises
-great "to go" options
-big portions (when a sandwich and a drink cost $12 it better be good)
-close to my work, wishing they would move into my work's cafe space
-its right by lux
-its food that any single person could make at home with a sandwich press, but doesn't b/c high quality bread and the like go bad too soon

the somewhat bad-
wierd hours and parking
kinda high prices
no place to "sit" and "wait"
