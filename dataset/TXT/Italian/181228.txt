nzUA0vgcta7OPwpWPbe7Ug Wow so disappointed. I just picked up a bowl of their homemade chicken noodle soup which is just a big bowl of noodles in water with a couple of dry pieces of chicken and a couple of chunks of vegetables no flavor very very disappointed... I would have just opened a can of soup at home if I would have known!
