PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ Remember the show "Cheers"?  Where everybody knows your name!!! That's Zest!  But zest is classy with fantastic food, incredible staff, an owner who is passionate about his business and makes everyone feel like they are his "favorite customer".
Can't say enough about the dinner menu:: shortrib ravioli, rib eye steak (traditional for me), chicken parm and the cheesecake is top notch!!!!!
They just opened this weekend for brunch and it was AMAZING!!!!! Finally, a great brunch place in #southernhighlands which conveniently reopens at 4 for a great evening ;-)
I highly recommend Zest Bistro and Bar!!!
Shout out to Donna, Jesse, Johnny and everyone else who makes this place a great place to eat drink and be merry ;-)
