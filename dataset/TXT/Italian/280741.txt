We made reservations for Saturday evening to have a nice dinner as a belated, low-key birthday meal.  In full disclosure, we celebrated in stealth mode and didn't let the staff know that there was any specific reason for dinner.  It was just an occasion to try out another restaurant in the city.  Decor is as the other reviewers have already mentioned.

We started with calamari which was good.  This is the first time I've seen the addition of horseradish in the sauce, so it seemed more of a cocktail sauce than marinara.  My fiance ordered the Bucatini Carbonara and I got the Chianti Braised Beef w/ Ravioli.  He thoroughly enjoyed his plate and I politely declined to share any of mine with him.  Luckily we each had some left over so we could afford to let the other taste.  There was no way I was going to leave behind what I was too full to finish, so we took the rest home and the beef/ravioli heated up quite well the next day for lunch. 

The only part of the dinner I did not like was the service.  The hostesses and other waitstaff seemed quite friendly, but our server in particular just was not at all. Not that he was rude, but he seemed very much indifferent to us being there and there were some long delays when we asked for a beverage refill or box for the remaining food despite the fact that he didn't seem to have more than one other table.

Overall, it was a very good meal and dining experience meant to be enjoyed, not rushed through.  We'll just hope for a different server next time we visit.
