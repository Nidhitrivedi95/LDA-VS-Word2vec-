u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Love me some Postino. The only problem is, so does everyone else and the wait can at times be excruciating. This restaurant serves up some of the tastiest bruschetta in town, which appeals to the masses. Seriously, it's hard for me to eat bruschetta anywhere else because of how amazing it is at Postino.

They've also got some other good items on the menu like paninis, salads, and a variety of appetizers - I'd recommend the cheese board and/or the olives to start.

Mondays & Tuesdays you'll need to get here early because they dish out the deal of $20 for a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board. The wait will easily be an hour if you get here late in the evening, not to mention the parking situation here is less than ideal.

A great place for some casual conversation, a bottle of wine, and delicious food...but it's good to catch them at lunch or off peak hours when the whole neighborhood isn't in line to grab a table.
