0URIvKxCNT-AVgtdYFAX8w Here's some advice:  If you're in a small cute little bistro, please PLEASE refrain from throwing your head back and laughing as loud as your lungs will accomodate you.  Not to say you need to ruin your fun...but GAWD DANG it can be loud in the ears!  And when I'm trying to have a nice conversation with two friends and can't hear them when we're all talking above "inside voice" level, it can get quite annoying.  It seemed that my ears tried to squeeze themselves into my head!

That said...

The awesomness that was Harley's included a cutie-patootie server by the name of Justin who made you feel right at home, bread (as it seems everyone else who yelped enjoyed), and my entree.

*wiping drool*

So I ordered the Bistro Chicken.  It was chickeny!  I was spinachey!  It was creamy saucee...e.  In other words, It was roll your eyes in back of your head, sit back in your seat, and melt in all of its goodness.  The proportions of ingredients were extremely generous.  None of that $13 all pasta and five pieces of chicken nonsense you get at some places.

My ONLY critique is that I wished what seemed like 12 cloves of garlic hiding along my journey of tastiness were roasted as opposed to au natural.  Mind you, this is only a teensy tiny critique.

Conclusion:  It's got reasonable Bistro prices with none of the pretentiousness of the staff.  Loved our waiter.  One plate could serve two people comfortably.  Can't wait to return with my guys to try out the Tiramisu!
