l-Zjik0MbpabQPv-nNp9YQ i had heard about this place because of their pumpkin cheese donut. i brought my friend here after our bike ride and we were both pleasantly surprised. big store with a lot of seatings both inside and out. not just a bakery but also a deli and a mini cafe. i got the maple bacon donut + deep fried apple cheesecake + croissant + iced frappe. the iced frappe took a while to make but the flavour was there. the donut was soft, and tasted fresh like it was made the day of. my favourite was the fried cheesecake - crunchy on the outside, soft and full of flavours on the inside. not to mention it's a pretty big portion for an affordable price. I've yet to try the croissant so i can't comment on that. my friend had the chocolate coconut and she really enjoyed it too! good place to sit down and enjoy the afternoon/read a book/catch up with a friend
