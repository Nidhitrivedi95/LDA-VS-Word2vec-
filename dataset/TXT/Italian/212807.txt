I love Sandwiches and this place delivers the goods!

I like to get their whole sized Combo (Ham, Salami, Pepperoni, Mortadella & Provolone), $6.45.

It's very tasty and filling, however it's not an overwhelmingly large portion.

The seating situation here can get dicey, especially around lunchtime.  There's not too many tables/seats inside and while there are a few located on the patio outside, it can get real hot there during the Summer months.

Overall, it's a great Sammie and I always look forward to dining here.
