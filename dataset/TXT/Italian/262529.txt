wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg If you like Fox Restaurants, you have to try North! Like all of the other concepts, this restaurant has a great atmosphere and trendy interior, and the service is great as well. Our server was really friendly and helpful, and made sure to get our drink orders on happy hour when there wasn't much time left, which I always think is nice. 

I didn't pay much attention to the wine and cocktail list, but they have a really great selection of beer --lots of local choices. For an appetizer we got the calamari, which they pair with arugula. We thought that was interesting since we've never seen it before, but it was great! I definitely recommend trying it.

For dinner we got The Pig pizza, and it was delicious. I would say I've had other pizza I liked more, but my boyfriend thought it was great. Maybe next time I'll try asking for less soppressata because it was really salty, but that's just me :) 

The dessert looks amazing too, we'll definitely come back to try it sometime!
