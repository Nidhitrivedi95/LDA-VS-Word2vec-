QDJBn7I1EdtP9w4nYT24Pw Had several items delivered. It was bad. The poo poo platter seemed like it was made hours before and the items were sitting under a heat lamp. The beef dish(think it was Mongolian beef) was nothing but onion. Literally jus pile of onion w bland sauce and cpl strips of beef. Its so close to my house but I will NEVER go there again.
