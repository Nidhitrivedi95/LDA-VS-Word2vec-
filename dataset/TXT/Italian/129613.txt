i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Found this place using Yelp.  It sounded good, a deli with freshly made food.  I had the meatballs sandwich and a side of pasta salad.
The meatball sandwich seemed a little plain to me, although the cheese was very tasty and helped.  For fresh made meatballs, I really couldn't taste any seasoning too much.
The pasta salad did taste fresh, and I thought it was well done.  I recommend it.
