zxsktAMsVBKj2PvvCV11UQ I always enjoy the exceptional lunch buffet at Cafe Siena and the salad bar is really becoming a favorite of many uptown lunch goers. I like that they have a different selection each day. Maybe italian one day, then the next Asian favorites. But I must say my favorite is the seafood gumbo with the huge shrimp served with the rice pilaf. Even though the lunch time can be quite busy the waiters and waitresses they I have gotten always seem to be quite attentive. For am all you can eat buffet I think the price is quite reasonable. I always enjoy my dining experience. Oh, and let me mention it would be nice if they offered a daily dessert with the exception of the banana pudding that should be served every day. It is AMAZING!!!
