Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA After a week in LV, Il Formaio was one of the nicest dinners.  Across NYNY from 9 Fine Gentleman-where we went everyday for Happy Hour-made a reservaion that day before 9fine.  Bread was very good, entrees excellent.  I had chicken broccoli pasta
Hubby had something with sausage which he really liked too.  Service was very good.
