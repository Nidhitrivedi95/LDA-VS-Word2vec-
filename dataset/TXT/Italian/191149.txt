pdGbbysWAjxHtyXePV1oHQ Horrendous customer service. Over priced. Rude owner. They tried to bend me over for a few scoops of cold salad. An argument at the cash over the price of my meal led to me leaving hungry and frustrated with the way in which the staff handled the situation. This establishment has a lot of good food but needs a lesson in common curtesy and customer service.
