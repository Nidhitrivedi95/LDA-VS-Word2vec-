Actually I believe this place may have been named after the title 1950's book by Gabriel García Márquez... or inspired by a lonely bartender.

I stumbled onto this place while waiting for a friend at College and Bathurst. I decided that after our meal we would go check this place out.
It was a Sunday night around 7pm and the place was empty which didn't bother me as I just wanted a latte and a seat in some comfy chairs.

The atmosphere is very cozy; sort of like hanging out in someone's cool basement. My latte was good and the barrista (who may have actually been the owner) brought us a plate of assorted cookies to dip into our caffeinated beverages.

The venu is also a full bar, features a DJ area (though we were listening to Radiohead a la Jukebox) and has a food menu.
