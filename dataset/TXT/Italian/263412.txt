wWDNwNb6ygJorKujOuifhA Came here on a whim and we were pleas entry surprised for a little late night grub down. Everyone here is very Italian which is seemingly great. The food options were on point. They have a wood fire oven in he back that is clearly manned by someone that has done this before. The wine list was slightly limited but sufficient and he ambiance was energetic without being rambunctious. Not sure if it's in my top places to get to but I'd def recommend it to a friend looking for some good grub late night.
