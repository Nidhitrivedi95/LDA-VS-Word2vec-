1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ I'm giving two stars only because the place is cute and the apps were yummy. Our server was sweet but so busy that we barley got looked at the whole time, except when we had to complain about the food, then we sure did get looked at. My husband never complains mind you but this food was so bad that even he couldn't keep his mouth shut. The side of dried pasta with no sauce that comes with the meal is pointless and gross, I would of rather eaten Top Ramon. The Chicken Marcela  was so dry it was not even edible, and I'm pregnant I'd eat almost anything! The sauce on it was bland and lacked any flavor, other then bad gravy. Honestly I know good Italian food and this is not it... I would rather go to Olive Garden, yes I just said that.
