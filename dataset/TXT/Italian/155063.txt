l0WauZ92kRg9bu2oxHj4TQ I'm Italian.  I was born and raised Italian.  No one knows Italian food better than I do, and I want you to know Aiello's is the best Italian food I've ever had in a restaurant!  I say that because I have to reserve a little respect for my moma! 

 I've been to some of the best Italian restaurants in the Little Italy neighborhoods of San Francisco, New York City, San Diego and my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio their food was good, but when I first tried Joe's famous Meatballs and Sunday Gravy - it just blew me away!  Finally, I thought, real, Italian cooking, just like what I was raised on, it actually made me cry.

Joe has that touch, that I can't describe, but it makes every dish special.  I had him take me into his kitchen once to show me how he does it, and there is no secret, just all fresh ingredients, everything made from scratch.  And the flavors are so vibrant!

I always order the Cavatelli with Joe's Famous Meatballs and Sunday Gravy, not only because it's so good, but it also brings back memories of my childhood, growing up in an Italian family.  Ruth usually gets the Linguini Fradiavolo and she loves it. The appetizers also are authentic Italian, some of which, my dad and I made together when I was young, escarole and beans in olive oil, antipasto with real imported meats and cheeses, and the calamari has always been spot on and absolutely delicious!  By time desert rolls around, your stuffed, but the Tiramisu is just so creamy and amazing and the strawberries and Zabaglione are out of this world!

 When friends and relatives visit, I always take them to Aiello's and when my family comes to town, some of them born in Italy - they all say it's better than they ever had anywhere!  

And Joe and Myra are such wonderful people, they are like my family. They make every guest feel at home, many times just spending time visiting with them at their tables.   I love them.  You will never be disappointed.
