KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg Looking at my reviews star graph, and it shows no 4-star, and I'm thinking, really, there's no place where I think food and service are pretty all right, then Piz Lib pops straightaway into mind.

PIZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZAS (3 - 3.5 stars)

It's not Rome or Naples quality, but, ya know, for fancy Toronto pizza, it's pretty decent, no complaints, quattro is fine, sausage, sides,apps all fine, really, how hard is this stuff, as long as ya got the oven and good ingredients.

SERVICE AND VIBE (5 stars)

Ya see, this is where front of house manager makes all the difference.  The place is packed, packed, packed, man, even PAC MAN can't eat enough standbys to get in on a Fri/Sat night, before they opened up second location, do they finally take reservations at Oz location now?  Think they do.

But I just love the vibe at this place, the staff, the energy, it's casual, but the service is precise, pro, hipster, certainly, but these guys are late 20s, 30s, some pushing or past 40, and this is their livelihood, man, these are pro service guys and gal.  Real pride and great on execution.  Freakin samurai warriors and that lone goddess of a FOH manager.

Always, always have a good time here, dates and groups.  Really like the lighting too, is it funk or is it just well-lit for ambience and scoping out your date's rack ... of lamb.

Gotta visit the Danforth loc at some point.  Pics of interior looks faaaaaaaantastic.
