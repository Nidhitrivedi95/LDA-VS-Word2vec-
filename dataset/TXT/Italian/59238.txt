ARWLV46iIa3Dvt1y8-SPpA Amazing personal family style service. The staff made us feel welcome and provided a fun warm atmosphere. I would go back in a heartbeat. I saw a complaint below that it was loud. Its a family style authentic restaurant so if you're surprised that it's loud you don't deserve to enjoy the delicious food and awesome service. If you want quiet atmosphere go eat some French food. 

The food was fresh and authentic.They have fresh seafood saturdays.

Highly recommended
