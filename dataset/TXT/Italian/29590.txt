5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Came here for Saturday night dinner with my girlfriend.  We showed up around 8 after she got off of work.  No regular tables available, so we settled for the kitchen bar (which is great for two people who want to see how food is made!).  We split the roast chicken, the beef short ribs, and the beets.  Beef short rob was great - fell right off the bone!  The chicken was nice and tender (we got dark meat), and the BBQ dipping sauce was mind-blowingly awesome (LOVED the chili kick it had).  Beets were OK - more my girlfriends thing than mine.  Would definitely come back and try roosters again!
