j54J0Ky4ruVbN_NTJ3daFg I have been to Girasole 3 times now, once in June, August and today. Here are my thoughts over all three of my visits.

The atmosphere is inherently romantic, except that the popularity of the restaurant combined with the small space makes it difficult for it to be an intimate outing on a weekend (I've been there on Friday and Sunday evenings for dinner, not sure the situation on weekdays). Sometimes it can get pretty loud.

However, the food makes up for what lacks in terms of atmosphere. I love that they give unlimited table bread with your choice of butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Their entrees come with a house salad that is exquisite: sometimes I look forward to it more than the pasta! It has this great tart dressing with gorgonzola cheese and roasted pine nuts. Absolutely divine.

I've tried three entrees:

1) Cavatelli with lamb sausage - light sauce, very flavorful meatballs. Loved trying a new pasta

2) Penne with grilled chicken - a constant on an otherwise seasonal menu; this is my BF's staple order but was a bit too safe for me

3) The famous cheese and spinach ravioli in a tomato cream sauce - THE BEST RAVIOLI I've ever had. Dipped the bread in the extra sauce, this will definitely be my order moving forward!
