6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA I phoned in an order for pick up: miso carbonara pasta. The pics on Yelp made it look so darn good and I was craving noodles (but let's be real... when am I not craving noodles?) Anyways.

I walk in around 4 in the afternoon and to my surprise the place is empty. As soon as I walk in I am greeted with a bright smile from a girl who has my food ready to go. It was about $14 and some change. I walk out and I'm happy that the cashier was so friendly.

The miso carbonara was so. fricken. good. Not too salty, flavor was just right, and the noodles were thin spaghetti, perfect for miso. I literally ate my pasta in one sitting, which probably wasn't a good idea, but I couldn't help myself. 

Would definitely come back here to try out other items. The menu looks very promising!
