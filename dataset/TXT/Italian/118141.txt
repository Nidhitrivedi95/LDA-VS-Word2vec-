gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw I had just finished speaking at a conference, and wanted a place to sit down for a meal... and found my way to San Marco, which, after reading Heat (about Mario Batali), how could I do anything but sit down for a meal here. 

The service was fantastic, food was pretty darned good (the pork belly ragu was yummy... but the vegetable antipasti were just amazing).
