qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg My review is for the gelato. Although they do not carry much favors like Espressamente IIIy, Cocolini, and Häagen-Dazs, they are less pricy. $5 including tax and sugar cone. Although the lady who served my gelato seemed to have difficulty putting soft gelato into the cone and ignored my request for a cup, I had the chocolate chip favor (forgot the italian name) and it was super super! Hurray to home made gelato!
