AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw The food is fabulous and service is pretentious enough for a 5 star restaurant. Brought my Clients here before the 'O' show and everyone left satisfied.  
We had an assortment of appetizers including beef carpaccio, mozzarella and tomatoes, Frittura di Calamari, Antipasto assortment. The  rack of lamb is their specialty and delicious especially with BR Cohn's Cabernet. An extensive wine list and we get to enjoy the fountain in our seat.
