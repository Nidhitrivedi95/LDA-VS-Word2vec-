74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw My husband and I tried to recreate our first date at this place. It used to be called "Onda" when we met.
Even though the restaurant is now called Portofino, the service was absolutely amazing and the general manager Chris Zadie was very accommodating to our needs. He made our night extra special with the superb and impeccable service. 
It's nice to feel like you are valuable as a customer. I am extremely appreciative when people go the extra mile to make your celebration perfect even thought it really doesn't mean anything to them. 
We want to be back soon. Thank you for giving us the perfect dinner date.
