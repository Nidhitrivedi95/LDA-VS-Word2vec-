pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw We had three pizza's - Margherita with garlic and salami, Margherita with fennel sausage, and a white Piazza Blanco.  All three were unbelievably delicious.  Our waiter was phenomenal.  He has been working at the restaurant since it first opened in 1994.  They have a small but very good wine selection and nice beers.   I have to add that we are originally from New Haven, CT where the #1 rated pizza restaurant in the US is located - Pepe's pizza, and we loved this place.  Will definitely go back.  It is very close to the ball park and looks like a great place to go before the game if you get there before the crowds.
