k3fn9JFiNLNy2q5p0cE1kg I've walked by here a number of times and from the outside it seems like a cozy, cute corner restaurant.  Finally, did a lunch here today.  Decor is quite dark inside but nice, probably looks better during the night.

I had the special soup of the day - peach and corn soup.  It was very nice and more of a puree.  I'd recommend if it if comes up as a special again.  My main was the vitelllo saltimbocca.  It's basically veal scallopini with a piece of proscuitto on top.  All of the secondis come with mashed potatos and vegetables, which were meh.  The main was OK, veal was cooked nicely but I wouldn't say I'd order it again.  They have some other interesting things on the menu that caught my eye.  My colleague had the wild boar ragu which he enjoyed.  I'd have to say the best part was the bread they give you.  It's a nice soft Italian loaf that is seasoned and drizzled with olive oil.  I probably ate half of my table's serving.

Our initial waiter was an older gentleman who was extremely friendly and helpful.  They ran out of the wine he suggested, so we were given a more expensive one for the same price.  Half way through our lunch, it swapped to a younger waiter who seemed to lack on the hospitality side.

I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars if I could.  Everything was decent, but nothing jumped out at me.
