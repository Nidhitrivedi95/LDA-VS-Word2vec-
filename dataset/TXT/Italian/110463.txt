G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q First time to Giada's. Great ambiance and nice decor. View of the strip was even better with open windows.  Menu for brunch was so interesting. I got the Farro salad with salmon bottomless mimosas. Love the flavor combo of cucumber and mint and salmon on the salad. Husband got the salmon cake Benedict . Generous portion, amazing flavor. He would get it again.
