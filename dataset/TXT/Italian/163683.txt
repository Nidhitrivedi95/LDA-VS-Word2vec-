LWwAMZUiH6iBaL4a6jGRWw Sad to say, on our last visit, it sucked here!  First off, when I opened my cloth napkin it was stuck together with blue gum.  As was my daughters.  We were a party of five so two out of five isn't too bad.  Disgusting but whatever.  The waitress when we point them out said ''oh, we never know what happens at the cleaners.''  Huh?  How did you wrap the silverware in the napkin without noticing??  Got the basket of bread sticks and the two dipping sauces. Two out of the eight bread sticks were moldy.  I'm talking grey mold!!  I asked to see the manager.  When he finally showed he said ''oh, those have to be replaced.''  Not one single I'm sorry.  Then the moldy bread sticks were never replaced.  So, as we're packing up our leftovers I asked the waitress if we could have two bread sticks to take home.  ''Oh sure'', she said ''but we charge for bread sticks to go.''  Okay, by then I was peeved so I said ''how about two bread sticks to replace the moldy bread sticks that were promised by the manager?''  That manager never, ever came near us again to apologize or offer us a discount or a free dessert or anything!!!!!  We have eaten here many times and it's always been just okay.  Not terrific or wonderful, just okay.  Needless to say we will not eat here again nor will we recommend the place. Just yuck!!!
