Cons: Spaghetti Meatballs and Baked Lasagna

This is the first time we ate here. The meatball was COLD and did not taste like a meatball. It was dry and tasteless. The Baked Lasagna was a huge disappointment. Just gobs and gobs of cheese and pasta but NO BEEF! I am positive that on the menu it said it contains beef as one of the ingredients. Stouffers frozen lasagna dinner tastes better and has BEEF.

I cannot speak for the other entrees here, but save yourself the trouble and go to Olive Garden instead. Or go to Anthony's Burgers and Steakhouse next door. Food there is MUCH BETTER.
