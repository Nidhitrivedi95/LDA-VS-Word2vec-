7JWWeXqil03Ua_wV9KN8ZQ Just about the worst dining experience I've ever had. Walking in, just my mom and I, 3 different waiters came up to us and tried to sit us when the first waiter was already in the process of trying to sit us. We were then sat outside near the gate and our table rocked and it hurt to sit in the chair. Our waitress kept referring to us as Lady. "Do you want water Lady?" Didn't sound good. Nobody explained anything on the menu. Once we ordered, my spaghetti was ok, but my mom's parm w eggplant was inedible and looked old. We placed the plate on the edge of the table to show that we were not about to eat it, about 3 waiters and even our own waitress looked at us and the plate many times but then kept walking away. 10 mins later she came to us and said how is everything. When we finally got a chance to tell her about the food, she looked at us weird and said ok...it was awkward. We just decided to leave. I tried to talk to the manager and they all kept saying he's really busy n what not. I waited for 5 mins before I finally gave up and left. It was ridiculous. I stayed mad for like the whole rest of the night. That was My experience.
