JtSNHDRRZffnHBEsJudW-g I've only been to this location once, but it was enough to make me not want to go back again.

I had just dropped my boyfriend off at the Truax campus and decided to get myself something to eat. It was extremely busy when I went inside to order, so the wait was fairly long. I ordered a caesar salad and the wisconsin mac & cheese, then took it over to the school where I sat in the lobby while I waited for my boyfriend to get out of class. When I opened it up, I was disappointed with everything. The croutons on the caesar salad were greasy and burnt, and the mac & cheese was so liquidy that it was more of a soup than mac & cheese.

Furthermore, the staff weren't very friendly and cared more about getting my money and getting me out of there. This was a few years ago, so things could be different now, but I don't plan on ever going back.
