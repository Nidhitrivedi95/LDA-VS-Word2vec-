My first annoyance was, we were a party of 4 with a 5th coming to join us for a drink later in the evening. There were 2 corner tables for parties of 5 and we asked if we could take one of those and were told they were reserved. I waited all night to see if that was true and it was not!! We had to squeeze ourselves in to a small table for 4.

We had several of the cheese platters, the caesars, which was ridicoulously small even for 1 person, several of the pastas and the porterhouse steak with the several sides, one being the polenta, which was dry and the other being overly cooked mushrooms.

The best things on the menu are definetly the pastas, the waiter did say they were house made.

We had 2 bottles of wine and the sommelier was extremly personable. My biggest complaint about this restaurant was our waiter. He was extremely pushy, we really only wanted a couple of things from each course and he was beyond insistent that was not going ot be ok. after getting our first course very quickly he came over once again and asked us if we were ready to put in our order for more food. We said we would put our order in for our 2nd course and if we could have some time eo decide on the next courses. He said no I really need to take it all now. Since we were not quite ready, he stood over our table while we contemplated a good 5-7 minutes on what we wanted. SUPER ANNOYING!!!

We were visinting from Los Angeles, I will definetly not go back, however I hope for the sake of such a beautiful location, they will make it work.
