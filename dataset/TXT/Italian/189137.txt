OYaL_-uxBCgrE94uNQ4VCA Super bummed I ordered a pizza and some garlic bread with a side of marinara and 2 ranches. Was told 45 min but it took an hour no big deal but I got stiffed on the ranches. I didn't have any ranch in the fridge and I happen to enjoy ranch with my pizza. Super shitty now the pizza tastes bland. Going in the trash 30$ down the drain....the ranch was the most important part! Oh and the Garlic bread with marinara, It was really good.
