wxzG81ZyWpBje_mU4aFLaw Everyone in this town, including me has become a self proclaimed  pizza critic.  

Humble Pie, Pizza Bianco, Cibo, and the Parlor are eveolving Phoenix into a serious Pizza city.  

Those who enjoy brick oven pizza this is a must.  And those who just eat delivery pizza must come to grips that Pizza Hut's HQ is not in Italy.  

Food:
The heart of the house is right in the dinning area, a wood fire brick oven. And ladies, were talking real wood here.   They make the pizzas right in front of you, how fun see.
Quick note, they do a great job with non pizza items, and a fun kids menu. 


Service:
this is a pizza joint right,  rule number one for amateurs, don't get antsy pansy because things take time on the weekends, this place gets crowded. Why well probably because Humble Pie has created a popular brand.   

I like personal service, most the time your server takes care of you from start to finish and i like that.  

I think restaurants like Humble Pie have given new life to the 7th St. Phoenix restaurant district.  Im glad to see the 85006 zip code continuously attracting more restaurant owners.  The Phoenix area is building up and keeping growing businesses a shot at success.  

Happy Pizza,
Kevin U.
