SD3ZyFR5ZjFneWpYhT6tLg I don't find a Taste of Italy to look as Italian as it may like, but if you're looking for a quickly whipped up satisfying pizza, then chow down on what this place has to offer.

Convenient and styled like a modern fast food establishment (with a few booths included so you can sit in) A Taste of Italy is a pretty tasty option if you're looking for takeaway in a hurry. It pulls a lot of its business in from the neighbouring Playhouse, and from people making their way to and from work.

Interestingly, this place is owned by the man who is behind the absolutely delicious Vittoria restaurants. It's proof you shouldn't judge a book by its cover since I find the exterior to look more takeaway than culinery delights. But I appreciate that Crolla is attempting to move in a different direction, and it opens up his highly acclaimed business enterprise to another audience. This platform does the job nicely - all the quality of the Vittoria's cooking but lower prices and a different pace of service.

 If I stayed within a mile of this place, I would happily become obese. But considering I don't, I satisfy my cravings when I'm through at the theatre. Bella, bella!
