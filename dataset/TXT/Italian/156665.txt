L9qDnDHSnINNjePwrJz-uQ A lot of my friends always want to hit up (insert mediocre chain name here).  On the other hand, I love supporting local businesses and the food is almost always better.  Somehow I didn't try this place for years even though I shop at the Fry's right next door.  Dang, I'm sad I was missing out - great food.  This is my go to Italian place now.  If we are feeling lazy, they are great for carry out too.
