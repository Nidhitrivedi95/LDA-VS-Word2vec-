SN5r_mlySBoAGVzXD6K0qA I dined at Amarone's after hearing several people rant and rave about it.  The food is very good.  They serve bread before your meal that tastes like fried onions but awkwardly it's actually tasty.  Their pizza is good but sometimes takes a long time.  I've tried the lasagna and that was pretty good, too.  Out of the five times I've eaten there I'd say 3 of the times  the service was horrible. Back in the day this building was home to a Peter Piper Pizza and it's pretty shocking how they transformed the place.  Check out their bathrooms if you decide to eat here.  They're built to look like a cave and I've never seen anything like it.  I'll probably go here again but not for any special occasion.
