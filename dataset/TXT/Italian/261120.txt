WPV0ucYjnb2HOrNxSopv6A I had the Greek Salad and was not disappointed.  The salad was large and all the ingredients complimented each other well.  My only negative feedback was pricing.  The add on for salad was about $3.95 which would have made my salad over $14.00. It was delicious but NOT $14 delicious.  They need to modify the add on charge. Monday is draft night, so I'll be visiting soon!
