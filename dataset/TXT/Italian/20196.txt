Then, I requested red sauce or ranch for my calamari and the owner came unglued about it. He told me that I can not eat my calamari that way and would not give me any sauce.  Then, he told me to leave the restaurant because I said that is the way I like my calarmari. This was my first time and it will be last time.  Really, just a little sauce and I get asked to leave.  Salad was dry and bland as well.
