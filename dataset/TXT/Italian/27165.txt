4RL5ydKIIFpU8bevsOKRdA Wow I really love Libretto's pizza! 

Ive gone twice and both times my pizza was fresh, hot, and tasty! There are many choices to choose from - some very unique, some standard. The pizza is NY style (wooohooo) it's thin and crispy. Both times I went for a white version pizza (white veggie, and Pizza Bianca) - so I can't attest to the red sauce but these two were scrumptious. 

There are other options available too, garlic knots (they were good!), pasta, salads, sandwiches etc....and it's open late!

My only complaint (why I didn't give it 5 stars) is that it's a bit pricey (almost $5 a slice-yikes!). I also heard a rumor that come 1-2 am when the post bar drunkies come in they charge whatever they feel like....geez l hope that's not true!

I think they need to get some good specials going for the lunch crowd and this place should do very well.

I will be back to get my slice of NY ....couldn't resist the cliche sorry : )
