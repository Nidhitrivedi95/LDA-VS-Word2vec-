7qo6rqDjlHds8ObxzxBD4A Edible but will not order again. They advertise delivery but use Slice to deliver which took an hour and the pizza was cold. Ordered Margarita which sucked, not enough cheese. The meat pizza was better but both had to be reheated in my toaster oven to eat. $50, so not worth it. I only ordered because of reviews but maybe that is for dine in only. Dont get delivery!!!
