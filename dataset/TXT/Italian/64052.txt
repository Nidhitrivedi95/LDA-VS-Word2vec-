BcLFIr4wtd3GQ3fnz15yDQ This is the sort of place where you can't go wrong on the menu. Everything is delicious. I know this because I ordered way, WAY too much food,* and I'm not sad about any of it, not even the stomachache I have from trying to finish it all.

As a quality Italian eatery, I was not surprised to find that their meatballs are about as good as meatballs can be, and that the Italiano panino is top quality as well (that cherry pepper relish makes it pop). 

If you arrive before 11 am on a weekday, the breakfast sandwich (add coppa if you know what's good for you) is an excellent choice, and pretty much the only one. The pizza is also good; sausages and hot peppers are a winner of a combo.

But I want to talk about the Ham & Cheese. 

This is not your average sandwich. This is their fantastic house bread slathered with boursin cheese and stuffed to bursting with honey smoked ham that was tossed in a pan with a messy and generous amount of black garlic barbecue sauce and topped with pickled onions. It is holy fucking shit delicious, and I'm still dreaming about it. And it's only $10. 

As an added bonus, DiAnoia's is bright, clean, staffed by the friendliest folks you'd ever want to have putting gigantic portions of Italian food in front of you, and it has what looks like the finest selection of amaro in Pittsburgh (sweet Montenegro tap handle). 

Love this place. Love.
