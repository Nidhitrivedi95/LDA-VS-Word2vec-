_BnBjRMt5Ba-TAv07r3fyw Our service started out okay when we were the only patrons on the patio, but slowly dipped as soon as more people arrived (on a 7 table patio). 

Our waiter was impatient from our first order and we sat between the clearing of our appetizer plates from even ordering our entree for a good 10 minutes. 

After ordering our entrees, 5 minutes tops, I asked if I could change my pasta option for my entree and was told he would check, 10 minutes later he came back and said no can do. I'm very familiar with the restaurant business so this alone would not have been a count against the service but was still surprised how long it took him to check. 

Our entree came and my daughter asked for more bread, he nodded and we waited for bread for the entire time. No mention that there was a table limit or he couldn't do it. We waited with our finished entrees for a good 15 minutes (no sight of the waiter despite a now filled patio) had to wave him down and then waited another 5 minutes at least. When he came with the check he cleaned our table with a dirty rag left the rag there and tended to another table and then came back to us to take care of our bill, leaving the dirty rag the entire time. As we were walking out we saw the manager, who had come out multiples times seeing impatient tables and did nothing, and told him our service was poor. He said it must have been a mistake and our server was the best they had, no apology and basically shooed us out and told us he didn't care.

Lastly, the food was mediocre at best. Definitely go someplace else.
