wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg This was probably my third visit to Grazie.
This restaurant is more than just food. There are all sorts of ages amongst diners. There are grandparents, children and young couples and single fellows.
On a Sunday night you can expect a full house with loud music and a group of servers singing Happy Birthday songs every 15 minutes.
I personally love these environments where you feel so alive. 
You can sample any wine, but my favourite is their Rose. For dinner I recommend the Milano. It's linguini with chicken and a creamy white sauce.
