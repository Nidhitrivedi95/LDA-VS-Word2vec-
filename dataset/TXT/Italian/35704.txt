6oq_MZwbP5z2XZZoc_rIOg This pizza hut restaurant has had a make over and is shiney shiney new.  I like the booths and free salad bar as well as the self service drinks.  They now have syrups that you can add to your drinks like cherry syrup to add to your lemonade, it is nice.

These guys know their stuff and do a mean pizza. I even got a little doggy bag to take my extra slices that I couldn't eat home with me.  Is it wrong to admit that I had them as a packed lunch the following day?  

Really helpful waiting staff.
