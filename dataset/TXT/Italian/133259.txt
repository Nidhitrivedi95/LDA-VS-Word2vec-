iLLzOJLU4tPAN9UUHlyZiQ Awesome addition to downtown Gilbert. Had the vertu octopus as an appetizer as suggested by others and it was delicious. Happy Hour prices were very reasonable for our beer and cocktail. The spaghetti al pesto was great and the other dish which I forgot the name was exceptional as well. Will definitely be back.
