uIuJGLPWli4dbomvANcuiQ Wow, I had such a phenomenal experience with OVEST this weekend. I don't typically take the time to write out positive reviews unless a place was extra special, which it certainly was. I have worked in the service industry for years so I tend to hold service to a higher standard than others. On top of that, my family and I were celebrating the nuptials of my closest friend and his now husband, so I was pretty nervous about trying a new place. To make matters more difficult, there were over 20 of us, none of whom wanted to do set menus which is often the norm with large parties. They went out of their way to allow us to order a la carte and let me tell you, OVEST DID NOT DISAPPOINT! Our server, Daniel, was knowledgeable, efficient and beyond warm. He never made us feel rushed and even took a moment to honor my friend and his new hubby with a lovely cannoli dessert! The manager, Sophia, bent over backwards to make any and all adjustments and always followed up with me professionally when making arrangements. I am truly blown away by the excellence of service, quality of food and exceptional bang for your buck at this reasonably priced Italian eatery. Well Done OVEST, I will surely be back!
