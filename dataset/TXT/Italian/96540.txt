ERnG-1q3igX3VSgm5uLZ6A On a quest to discover the best pizza around, a small group of pizza fans met here on Wednesday evening to give the pizza a try. Located almost right at the corner of Dufferin and St Clair Ave W it's a super nice location with a focus put on their massive pizza oven.

I enjoyed the focaccia/bread with olive paste, mushrooms and what I believe was artichokes to start. One of the group ordered their calamari to start and it was served well, not overcooked and battered perfectly for my taste. It was served with only lemon so I can appreciate the authenticity of the dish, but I guess i was looking for something to dip it in (old habits I suppose). Still good with salt and lemon juice!

I went with the funghi e Salsicce (mushroom and sausage) pizza, which was $19.75 for one personal sized Neapolitan style pizza. I have to give them full marks on this pizza. Dough, sauce, toppings, all of exceptionally high quality and perfectly cooked (if my mouth is watering right now as I recall my experience, it's a testament to how much I enjoyed it).

I should note that I expected a top shelf pizza as they are one of (if not THE ONLY) spots in Toronto that is Neapolitan Pizza certified locations. to find out how one becomes certified authentic (meaning it tastes EXACTLY how a pizza in Naples would) see the qualifications found here - http://americas.pizzanapoletana.org/getcertifed.php

The only gaff and the only reason for a less than perfect review was the service. I found our server to not be too interested in our group, awkward, not exactly engaging and when he left the bill he then disappeared for 20 minutes. I'm not sure where to because this spot isn't that big, but he was GONE. We had to flag another server to find him so we could pay and leave. Maybe an off night?

I'll be back - this pizza is the real deal!
