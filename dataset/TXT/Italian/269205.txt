xjjxHavx4RIiW6zS6rasGA This place was excellent from the beginning to the end. My fiance order the chicken parm and I got the lobster ravioli and shrimp. And it was delicious and we'll done, portion was just right and the server was very helpful. He actually helped us pick a nice bottle of wine. If you looking for some good food n a nice atmosphere. This is a good spot. FYI it can get a little loud and busy.
