d5TMOfz_CrjKDGbIpfoVCA Stopped in for an impromptu date night on a July night.  I happened to ride my motorcycle and the owner greeted me asking me if it was really that cold out.  I laughed.  He must not be a rider.  We were seated immediately and greeted by our server.  He brought us waters with lemon and explained the specials while handing us our menu.  I was so hungry so started consuming the bread.  It was delicious however butter was better on it the tapenade they served it with.  I had a Saltimbocca alla Romana which was good.  It was rolled and stuffed and quite tasty, albeit a bit small in portion.  My date had a special rigatoni.  The rigatoni was tasty although it seemed a "zing" was missing. Overall a well rounded meal.   Price maybe slightly more than I would've liked, but a decent American Italian style meal.
