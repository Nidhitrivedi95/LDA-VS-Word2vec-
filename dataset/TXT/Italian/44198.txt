The last time I was at Rico's was close to 20 years ago, and I can confirm other reviewers' comments that it hasn't been updated (ever?).  Really, that's too bad, because if the atmosphere matched up with the surroundings, it'd make a nice restaurant with a good reputation even better.

We started with the zucchini - yes, you've got to have it if you go to Rico's!  For my main plate, I had a special, swordfish, with spinach on the side - the markup for the spinach side was insane -- another $7?  That's like a whole box of spinach at Restaurant Depot!  And with the prices, the fact that salad is not included borders on unacceptable.  I had creme caramel for dessert - which was not very good, also outdated, and saturated with caramel like someone had too much fun with their squeeze bottle back in the kitchen.

Service was very attentive, even as it filled up over the course of the evening - I'd either show up kind of early or make reservations to make sure to get a table with views of the trees and not the internal room with no views.

Overall, I think that Rico's is coasting on its reputation instead of doing anything innovative, creative or interesting.  Updated food with slightly more reasonable prices would make me go back, and keep coming back, but for the time being, I wouldn't.
