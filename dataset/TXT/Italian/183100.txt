obzBY9Pea6nUXsjtEjo-Cw Favorite place in Boulder City.  Love the martini's.  Food Fantastic!  Always have a great variety of specials to choose from.  I had Chicken Piccata and others in our party had Filet, Fish, Salad and not a complaint from anyone.  Fantastic meal.
Small place so Reservations are definitely recommended.
