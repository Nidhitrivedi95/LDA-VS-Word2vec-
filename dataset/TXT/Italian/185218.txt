Ojw5eTqzbv6k27_Df3q0-A Took advantage of restaurant week and had their lunch special. Had the peach and shrimp appetizer, the rock shrimp premavara, and the tiramisu. It was good not great. Same with the bread. The bread and appetizers didn't taste fresh. The sauce on the entre was very good and the tiramisu was great. Our waiter was a pro!!  He was personable, attentive and aimed to please!  He gave helpful suggestions. I give him 5 stars!!  I will be back to try their lasagna and salads.
