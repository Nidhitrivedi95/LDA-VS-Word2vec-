It was just a bit too cold for me, so we decided to sit inside. The waitress was very nice and more than happy to accommodate our vegetarian diets. We had the mushroom bruschetta, penne with arrabiatta that I forget the name of, and margherita pizza, all of which were amazing. I especially liked the pasta. Would definitely come back here when it's warmer so we can sit on the patio!
