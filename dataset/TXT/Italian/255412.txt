VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g Saw Sergio's on Restaurant Stakeout and decided to give them a try (always looking for a great local restaurant!)

Everyone needs to get over the strip mall thing, it is normal out here! Décor was so-so, painted ceiling and fake flowers are not my thing. The piano player started at 7:00 and he was pretty good!

The staff was pleasant, the bar had no bar tender on a Monday (wait staff were playing bartender and watching the soccer game). We seemed to have a switch in waiters at some point but were not notified - yet the original waiter did come back with the check.

We eat early. We ordered the steamed clams as an appetizer. They were fabulous! Both has the house salads with the house Italian dressing. Also good!

My husband order the Veal Marcela, it smelled fabulous the veggies (carrots, green beans and potatoes looked great. The carrots were good, green beans were a bit chewy, potatoes were OK. He is not a polenta fan so he did not try that. The veal had great flavor, for him it was a bit chewy.

I ordered a linguini pasta with calamari, shrimp, scallops, squid and clams. This was great, the scallops especially were something I wanted more of.

The Chianti we ordered was very good and the Tiramisu was fabulous (it was enough to feed three!).

For the price of the meal ($165.00 including the tip), if locals are not interested in going to the strip, it is good. We have eaten at some fabulous places on the strip whose food is better and not as expensive (even if I take out the bottle of wine).
