4LXZzgsrM1ZyS_-uB9Od2Q Lil' Baci is another random places that I followed a group of Yelpers here during our A night of drinking in Riverdale drinking crawl. 

I really want to sit at Lil's Baci back patio!! But it was packed.........and ended up have to sit near the washroom...........boo...... 

The interior is nicely decorated with dim lighting and a rustic feel. A little too dark for good looking food photos though. 

Pizza Pizza and more Pizza........ If you like eating pizza, you will find it A-OK. But if you not into pizza, you better go to other restaurants in the area.. 

The 4 pizzas that I tried none of them were outstanding. I have to agreed with my fellow dinner mates that the thick and doughy crust was really disappointing! I like the Pizza Margherita the best... simple, tasty and saucy... 

I don't mind coming to Lil' Baci to share some pizza with friends if I am in the area... or have the lunch specials... but definitely not going to make a special trip to eat here!
