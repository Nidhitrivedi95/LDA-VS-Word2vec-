7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Being from the East end, I always see the longest line up for this place. So I gave it a shot to see what the hype was all about. 

Why this place kinda sucked:

1) waited 45 minutes in the cold cause they're a small shop and the line is outside 
2) they put me and my BF at a table just above their floor vent so there was a nasty breeze grazing my leg 
3) I ordered the banana bread French toast - big mistake. Way too sweet, soggy as f, and COATED in syrup. I literally had a bite and put down my fork. 
4) coffee = watered down, like an intercontinental breakfast. 

The only redeeming quality was that my BF ordered an eggs benedict which was average. At least they know how to poach an egg. 

Not worth the wait.
