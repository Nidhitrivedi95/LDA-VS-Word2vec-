XxmziAeRqMKwsDjyyjVgeg Unexpected find with a lot of family charm (tons of nicknacks in main dining room) but high prices. Dinner includes salad and bread with make your own olive oil dip and Parmesan but ranges around 20-30$ which is high for what they offer. Alcohol is pricey for ambiance but very friendly staff. We had come because they gave my friend a free plate last time she came in for coffee!
Veggie perspective- 1-2 veggie options. I had the ricotta noodles with eggplant mezzanine which was good not great. Salad was excellent.I loved the tiramisu which was very rich. Ricotta cake I wouldn't order again. 
Probably will not return due to pricing and ambiance style.
