TIYnquDIPdYmVJK4GNeXSQ Great deal buy one and enjoy and take one home.  Nice size portions and nothing beats their salad. The one big problem had was being sat all the way in the corner by the kitchen. .there were two of us and we were forgotten for at least 15 min   I could see if super busy but all it takes is a hello and order drinks and then take your 15 min to do what you need to do. I will say that was a turnoff.
