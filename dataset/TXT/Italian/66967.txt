bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg We went there last year some time.  Everyone loved their pizza and enjoyed the fact that the ingredients were minimal and fresh and not laden with cheap greasy meat by products..  I am a vegetarian and ordered a pizza without any meat.  It was very flavorful and fresh.  I also ordered a salad for myself which was nothing out of the ordinary, but the ingredients were fresh.

I think like any restaurant if depends on the night, chefs and service.  We just happened to love our service, the atmosphere and the food on the night we went.
