Super efficient  service! Place was pretty packed and very loud when we got there. Loved the fact that the food came super quick! Pasta was good. Nothing over the top extraordinary. If you're craving pasta, this is the place to go! 
Price: average 13-20
We had the Alfredo kara Mia and saffron sauce penned.
