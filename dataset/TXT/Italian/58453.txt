aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA Visiting from Florida, service is spot on & attentive. The wait on a Friday night was less than 15 minutes. So at that point ya step into the bar, order a drink & pass the time w/ good conversation. Restaurant is centrally located. They offer an outdoor patio w/ lots of tables. The ambience is Italian pizzeria w/ Frank Sinatra playing in the background. Highly recommend ordering the Antipasto to share w/ the table. There is enough food on that plate to feed 4! Best antipasto I have ever experienced. Trust me when I say this isn't a salad you eat, it's an experience. Also had their thin crust pizza w/ sausage. That pizza pie was tasty as well. If you ever find yourself across from the Holiday Inn in Scottsdale, Arizona, near old town you would be amiss if you didn't stop by.
