1. Food: Our food was decent--it wasn't terrible but it didn't WOW me. The menu was passable, but there wasn't really anything that stood out. I ordered the Frico (brunch menu), which I don't recommend. It was a fried potato pancake with duck egg and cheese, and wasn't very notable. The "seasonal salad" was a pile of dandelions with a vinaigrette. I didn't have an issue with the dandelion salad, other than the fact that it was too bitter to be consumed. I asked a server if it was possible to get another salad. This brings me to the next category.

2. Service: She inquired with the chef, who said they didn't have anything else. I asked for fruit. She inquired with the chef, who said they didn't have any fresh fruit, they only had pre-grilled peaches. I asked for the peaches. She inquired with the chef, who said I would have to order something to get the peaches. It was ridiculous. This is unacceptable for any restaurant, much less an upscale one like Buca. The server felt bad afterwards, so she spoke to the manager, who brought over some grilled tomatoes, but the damage was done. 

3. Price: I knew, going in, that this wasn't going to be a cheap place. I go out a lot, and I'm okay with paying more for better service, ambiance, and food. I really don't think the price reflected what I got. 

I won't be back.
