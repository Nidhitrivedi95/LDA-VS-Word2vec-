W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg We are visiting Cleveland for a trip to the Cleveland Clinic and wanted to get away from the hospital and hotel. We found this place unexpectedly and had a wonderful dinner, the owner even came by to share a taste of a roman pasta dish with us. Very authentic Cleveland italian restaurant with a good atmosphere and good food.  The bruschetta was great too.
