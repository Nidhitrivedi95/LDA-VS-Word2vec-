VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w We went here for dinner before a concert at MGM. The food was absolutely amazing and the service was good. The portions are definitely large enough to share so we ordered some of everything and split it amongst the table, which is helpful since there are so many good entrees to choose from. 

Counting the days until I can go back for more!
