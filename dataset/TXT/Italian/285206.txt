zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g I feel badly to write such a poor review because I have had several good meals here but I ordered a salad for take-out tonight and what I received was the poorest excuse for a cup of mixed greens and a few croutons. There were literally 2 cherry tomatoes, some diced cucumbers and a shaving a parm. I would not mind if I hadn't paid $13.00! Sure, I ate the salad but it was SO small I'm still starving. I may return and order meatballs or mussels, but never a salad...not worth it!!
