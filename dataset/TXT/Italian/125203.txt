Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A To be brief and allow you to make your own opinion on how Brendi H served us tonight I'll just transcribe the dialogue between her and I and her and my colleague that I was sitting next to.

My colleague ordering an appetizer
Colleague - "I'd like the Formaggi i Salumi"

Brendi - "Would you like the Proscuitto and Tres Leches?"

C - "Is it included?"

B - "Yes"

C - "Sure thank you"

When she received her bill she would find out those two items were each $5 and not included
Disclosure: the menu itself doesn't hide that they are $5 supplements

Myself ordering dinner
Myself - "I'd like the voodoo penne"

Brendi - "Would you like the arugula or house salad?"

M - "Sure" (I didn't hear the 'or' and for whatever reason I thought maybe the house salad was made with arugula)

B - "Which one?"

M - "oh sorry, I'll have the arugula"

This is a $12 salad and I didn't enjoy it much.

By the time I was halfway through the salad it had got around the table to me that she deceived me into thinking it was included because she got a few others at the table too.

What she said to my colleague was a lie and what she said to me was deceitful and I will make sure my team does not have dinners here anymore. The only reason I didn't give one star is because every time I have a large group that needs a recommendation in Tempe this place is accompanying and has good food but what happened with Brendi is very unfortunate.
