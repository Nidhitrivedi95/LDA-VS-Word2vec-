me17NOULVwu40AdKGYHIaQ As a transplanted New Yorker, I can tell you that this place is the real deal. I'm pretty much a regular customer and everything I've tried on the menu has been just like home. The veal parm dinner.... chicken parm sandwich (fantastic bread!).... garlic knots.... pizza.... cannoli.... zeppoli.... all of it has been delicious!
