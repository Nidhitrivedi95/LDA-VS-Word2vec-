hdZ_4Vd9opGm5UajNUuhwA If I could give this place a 0...I would. My fiancé and I went there to grab something small to eat after a long night of gambling. When my fiancé approached the server to ask for a slice of pizza, the server coughed in his left hand and continued to grab the plate and pizza. We didn't want the slice but didn't want to be rude but the server was very rude to us and asked why we didn't want it. We said 'you just coughed in your hand and served us pizza'. His response was 'I coughed in my left hand but handed you the food with my other hand.' He THEN placed the pizza under the warmer. I feel bad for whoever got that piece of pizza. Everyone behind us saw what happened.

Can't review the food - we didn't eat it.
