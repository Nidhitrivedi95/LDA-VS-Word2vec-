o86OGfW63bVqWkIrvxcEQQ I live in the neighborhood and was so happy to see this going up a few months back. Been in a few times and really enjoy the location. It's not unlike other Postino locations, amazing food and good selection of wines and beers. Great for large groups, brunch, outdoor patio, kid friendly, huge couch available for large groups, and amazing happy hour with large bar. Can't wait for fall to take advantage of the outdoor space even more.
