2r9U0--QqAK0JjL8vxB7mA I live very close to this place, and I have to say that it has grown on me in the most wonderful way.  Their menu always has something from the "what you might be craving" section, and the service is great.  Last time I went, I ordered a burger medium, which to me means a warm pink center.  When my burger arrived, it was exactly that.  I was so happy that after my meal I went over to the expo window and thanked the cooks for taking the time to do my burger right.  Seriously, I think my original review for this place was too harsh.  It's a real gem.
