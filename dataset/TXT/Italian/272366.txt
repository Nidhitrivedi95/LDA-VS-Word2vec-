XVDR44P_74FmA0ANanm4CQ Love the "old school look, feel, and juke box." I've been going here for about 25 years. It began with my grandparents after church on Sundays for lunch. Now that I've moved further away I still make time for a chicken parm sub when I'm in the area. Huge portions of spaghetti that can feed 2 or you can eat on it later.
