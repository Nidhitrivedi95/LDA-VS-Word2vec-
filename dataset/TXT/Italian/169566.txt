MrmwDgMlL2GtthlAZsJwNQ Not too impressed.  The menu is described to make it seem like they have the most authentic Italian food.  
It's basically Italian fast food. The fresh mozzarella ball was the best dish we had. The meatball was a bit salty, osso bucco tasted like an Asian dish, fried artichokes and cauliflower were good but only had 3 pieces of artichoke and the rest was cauliflower.  Pizza was bland and dry and the carbonara was not at all great. 
Panna Cotta was creamy, tasted like pudding.  Also, they ran out of polenta bites and zeppole but i'm assuming I didn't miss out on much.
On the plus side the service was good but I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone nor would I return.
