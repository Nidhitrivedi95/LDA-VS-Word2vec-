Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORST BUFFETS I HAVE EVER BEEN TO IN LAS VEGAS! I HAVE NEVER LEFT A BUFFET UPSET & HUNGRY!

I came here for breakfast MONDAY MORNING right after the whole EDC WEEKEND. I thought to myself...HOW CAN YOU REALL F*CK UP BREAKFAST?? ITS LIKE IMPOSSIBLE! 

Anywho...this place happened to do so. The eggs are tasteless...LITERALLY TASTELESS! The sausage was OK...the bacon was decent...the biscuits were whatever, etc... EVEN THE OMELET TASTED WEIRD...and THE APPEARANCE OF THE OMELET WAS DISGUSTING. Out of my whole breakfast meal...the best thing was the unlimited servings of ORANGE JUICE...and the GRAVY.

I have never left a buffet so upset and so hungry in my life. 

On the other hand...the restaurant looked very clean and very beautiful, but the food does not speak for itself. Another thing about this place is that they have cheap food...the price for breakfast was about $7?? &
&
YES I WAS HUNGRY...I did not lose my appetite from you know what.

FINAL words? DO NOT COME HERE! if I were to come here...it would be for Champagne Brunch

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^
