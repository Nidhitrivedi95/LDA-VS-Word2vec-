yatT2q_zmb4-yvzr9Bx5lA OMG, delicious pizza. Some of the best I've had. However, those pizza logs are not good. Wontons and pizza ingredients are not a good mix. Also, be sure to have plenty of time when you order. Full pizzas are like 25-30 minutes to come out. Also, the charbroiled wings are hands down the best in Charlotte.
