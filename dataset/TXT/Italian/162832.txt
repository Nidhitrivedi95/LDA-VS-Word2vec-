Lu5hB_5YtX5Re2067Zf3cg Ordered carry out for lunch and got the rigatoni with marinara and meatballs. I really did not like the meatballs at all. They were sort of mushy and flavorless with a hot pink center, which is probably ok, but creeps me out somehow. The sauce was only ok, it was not as flavorful as I had hoped. The two stars are because the bread was really good.
