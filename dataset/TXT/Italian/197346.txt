ppwYJPfE0tpSJA9X8l54cQ Extremely rude staff, right when I walked in I got barked at by the lady taking orders for walking in with a drink from QT,  was getting stared at the hole time I was eating, can u say uncomfortable! Food was nothing to get hype about if you want some good pizza and wings don't come here. My niece and nephew didn't even eat to slices and they are usually savages !
