yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w The pasta was OK, but overpriced, before you take into consideration that it is all you can drink wine.  You start with a liter of red and white, and when finished they will give you more.  We where there with a group they all though the food and wine were OK, nothing great.  We may go again, but I feel this is best done with a group of 4 or more.
