UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ This is not pizza! I have had better pizza out of the freezer! The crust is hard and flavorless. There is no chewiness to it whatsoever. The cheese is flavorless and the sauce is something else. 
I have nothing good to say about this place. It's just a pizza place and for some reason people seem to like it? But if your a true pizza lover, this is soo not the place for you. There is much much better out there. Find it!
