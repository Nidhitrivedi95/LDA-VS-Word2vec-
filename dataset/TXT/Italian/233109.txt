Ordered the calamari and smelts and were just delicious, and the thank you from Frank was even more surprising. The seafood pasta was delicious and I didn't need to ask for any salt. The flavour was bang on. I never was here before nor did I never meet the owner, but I and my date had a great first experience and will come back again soon.  The guitarist along tonight really added to the mood too. Great experience.
