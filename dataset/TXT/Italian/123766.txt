HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q My eyes could not stay away from this place everytime I passed it. Hence, I came here twice in one weekend. So many gelato flavors and drink options. If you're an espresso fan, I think you'll like this place just fine. 

The service here is a bit of an issue - they are slow and a bit aloof. But that's forgiveable considering it's just an order then sit place, not a big deal. It's also very warm in here, uncomfortably so. Don't know if it was just an off weekend....

It's a cute place to have a chat and eat some tasty desserts. I enjoyed their gelato and strawberry shake. Yummm. I am not sure how their savory foods or pastries are but they at least LOOKED nice. The espresso drinks are strong (duh), and tasted better than Starbucks (yeah I said it!).

You can buy Illy merchandise here too - limited edition espresso cups, coffee, gift sets, etc.
