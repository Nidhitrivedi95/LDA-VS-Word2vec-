kQ9gVGp5R_jZwLi0-q8PZQ Pretty terrible food. It's pretty much the equivalent of boiling your own pasta at home and putting canned tomato sauce on top. 
Not only that but the spaghetti and meatballs was not even spaghetti. It was clearly linguini- a flat pasta. 

Confused why this place gets such high ratings. Terrible.
