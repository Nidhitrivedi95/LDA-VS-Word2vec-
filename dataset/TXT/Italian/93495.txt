Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag I had no idea Wolfgang Puck was so upscale! The only Wolfgang Puck I had ever eaten at was in Macy's food court. I have to say I'm quite impressed.

We told them we had a show to catch, so they were extra quick with service. 

My mojito was yum.
The bread was tasty. My favorite was the one with raisins.
My pizza was huge! I had to give my bf some.

I probably won't seek out this place next time, but I know I don't mind coming back.
