Cg2h2Cn_yEs06NZP-3QQtg So my fiancé and I heard a lot of good things about this place, so we decided to give it a try. We placed an order for pick up, and when we got there, the guy behind the counter had his head phones in and was pretty rude, like he didn't want to be bothered. 

So we got our food, we both ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich. The sandwiches were not good at all. The chicken was sliced, grilled, and tasted like it was microwaved. The best part of the sandwich was the cheese. 

All in all, we were really disappointed and will not return. Big let down!
