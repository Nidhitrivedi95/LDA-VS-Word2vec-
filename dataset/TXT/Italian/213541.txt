r6jbUGiyoN05mZ13apQGgw Awful. We got food from here today and it is so bad the my taste buds are waging a war. Being an Italian from NJ, I'm actually offended that this pizza box says "authentic Italian specialties from back east". The crust on the Sicilian pizza is completely bland and tasteless. The garlic usage on all of this food is enough to kill Dracula's entire bloodline. The only thing remotely tasty was the buffalo sandwich on focaccia. The focaccia was well seasoned and had a nice texture. The only way I would go back here is if vampires had taken over the earth and I needed the garlic. Seriously, go to Rocco's if you want legit italian food.
