a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w We ended up here one night after grocery shopping, and craving Italian food (my partner is full blooded Italian -- Olive Garden just doesn't cut it).

The prices? Quite a bit higher than we had expected, but we were hungry, so we ate.

The eggplant rollatini was to die for.  My partner said it was almost as good as her grandmother's, and that is saying A LOT. We decided to split the pumpkin ravioli, and although the addition of fresh corn was a little odd, it was really delicious, and one plate was the perfect portion for two; better yet, they split it for us in the kitchen, making it easier.

The servers were quick about our iced tea refills, and one of them chatted up my partner as they were both from New York.

I'm giving 4 stars (instead of 5) for the price being a bit high, and the oddness of having sports play while eating $14 ravioli.
