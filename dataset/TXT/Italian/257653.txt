w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A Came here over the weekend w my family - what a great family restaurant! It was pretty busy, but the wait time wasn't bad, approx 10-15 min. They do not accept reservations on the weekends. Upon sitting at our table, they have a calendar of the month and all the specials they offer (50% off a pizza for RNs on one day, 50% off for pizza from like 6-9pm on another day, etc). Wish I had known about the specials prior!

It was a bit diff then I remembered it from the last time I went. I had taken my niece and nephew before and they gave them pizza dough to mess around w while we waited for our meals, this time, it wasn't given/offered. It's been a few years though, so it may have changed awhile ago!

We ordered a half cheese/half meat pizza, fries, parm/garlic fries, juices, $3 beers (brewed by them), and a gelato and the bill came to about $40. The pizza was yummy and we still had left overs for a family of 4. The pizza was just as good on the next day. The gelatos were $7 but big enough to share! And they have like a little area where you can go look and choose. 

The atmosphere is very family friendly. Good prices. Good service. Will definitely come back.
