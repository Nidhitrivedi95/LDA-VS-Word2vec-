lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ Before leaving for Vegas last week, I did a quick Google "Vegan in Vegas", and am really glad I did.  This little gem is in Mandalay Bay up by the shops.  They have a separate vegan menu that does not limit you to just pizza.  As I am a die hard pizza fan, I had to have the personal pan.  This is one large pie! The crust is paper thin and to die for.  They put on  just the right amount of garlic and Daiya cheese. Since I polished off the whole thing, its a good thing I had to walk back to my hotel. 

I have been to Vegas before and ate a lot of Subway. This time, I had better options almost everywhere I went.  I saved a copy of the menu so I can reminisce!  I did have to laugh when the waiter came to take our order and I ordered off the vegan menu, he actually said, "You know that's vegan, right?" Yes, my friend, that is why I plowed  through 2,957 tourists to get here before lunch!

I can still taste the garlic...
