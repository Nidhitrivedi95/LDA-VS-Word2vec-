bKh66jlEqEKZZFkjWipt8w I visited the original Stoney's location in Oakville a few years ago and was very impressed by the food and atmosphere. I was super excited when I heard they opened a second location closer to home. I went during lunch on a weekday and it was insanely busy - they had to stop taking orders until the tables became available again. Regardless of how hectic things were, most of the staff were extremely friendly and operated very well under pressure. 

I ordered a shrimp and scallop caesar salad and a latte. My boyfriend had some sort of chicken sandwich. Both portions were huge and the price was very fair compared to other places we've frequented. The dressing on my salad was a little too heavy, I wished I asked for half the dressing. The place is confusing to navigate during busy hours. We weren't sure if we were suppose to be seated first or order first. When the counter staff told us she couldn't take our order yet because they're backed up, she didn't direct us anywhere. People were scattered and lost their place in line. I've been here on a quiet day before and everything was great so it's understandable when things get a little chaotic during peak hours. Food was great still!
