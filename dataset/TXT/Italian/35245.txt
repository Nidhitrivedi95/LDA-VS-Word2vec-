It was a very busy Sunday night and the waiters were very busy and appeared a little disorganized. The food was excellent and the staff was very accommodating of my 9 month old grand daughter. The tables are a little close together but the noise level was decent. We enjoyed our delicious appetizers, salads and entrees. The host and hostess stopped by our table to ensure we were enjoying our choices and were very gracious and thanked us for coming. We all look forward to our next dinner at Anna Marie's.
