From outwards appearances it is your standard upscale place.Nicely decorated,white table cloths etc. Oh and a hot hostess(gotta have that :). anyways...our waitress was very nice..i asked her to pick me out a glass of cabernet 15 dollar range (wasnt crazy about the selection,but thats the chance you take when you ask someone to choose) Ceasar salad was bland and pretty flat tasting. My guest had the veal salta (something). I thought it was bland and flavorless,mushy texture to the veal. I had the chicken with artichokes...it was unimaginative and needed a binder like a rice or maybe over pasta....there were very few artichokes and it was basically chicken breast chunks..uninspiring. all this for 93.00 which i didnt have to pay for because it was comped. However,if i did need to pay I would have not been thrilled and in general i wasnt impressed. As a side note,i noticed that a lot of the staff kept congregating around the bar and were sitting there chin wagging....that is a huge no-no in a place that wants to be known as upscale. If your not doing anything go fold napkins or clean station..or even better ..check in on your customers needs. This is just another uninspiring experience at a casino resort that just doesn't get the bigger picture. If this were my place there would be a total refurbish of the menu and staff edicate.
