OIdOJaNS8M624F58XGV3PQ Atmosphere: Love it! The place is super cute for a date, intimate, yet sophisticated. 

Food:
1. Buttermilk fried Calamari: AMAZING! Perfectly crisp without feeling greasy, the tomato sauce at the bottom was delicious. Perfect appetizer. 

2. Housemade sausage: it was adequate. not particularly my favourite. i just feel like ive had better pizza. which is strange. the caramelized onions were a nice touch to this pizza

Overall: Will definitely be back. i love the atmosphere here.
