I came here with 7 co-workers and ordered for the bunch. One of the co-owners was working the register, and realized it was my first time here - he offered me 10% off the entire bill, outright, awesome start. 

He was super enthused about his product, and you could tell he really believed in it - "best Pizza in the valley." I figured I would be the judge of that.

The price was certainly right, with all the specialty pizzas being right around $7 including a drink (about 8" round, cooked to order).

I had the margherita, and it was fantastic. I always say the secret to a good pizza is in the sauce and crust, and they had both absolutely nailed - crispy thin crust (but not too thin), with a moist slightly doughy, but not too doughy center along the rim, and a perfectly savory/fresh pizza sauce (none of the sweet/tangy processed stuff here). 

The one tiny, tiny thing I would have improved would have been to bake the pizza with the tomato slices on top rather than adding them after, as a matter of personal preference, but it wasn't enough to detract from this amazing pizza, that I am craving as I write this review.

Will be coming here regularly for my pizza fixes in Phoenix.
