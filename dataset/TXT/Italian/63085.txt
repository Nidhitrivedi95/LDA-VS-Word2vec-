B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw I have been to Gusto 3 or 4 times now, good has always been very tasty and nicely presented. They show care in their work. The service also is quite good. Recommend the buffalo mozzarella, and the grilled octopus. Kale salad is my girlfriends favourite, very good but a little too sweet for me. Overall Gusto is a great place with consistently good food, highly recommend. Go check it out.
