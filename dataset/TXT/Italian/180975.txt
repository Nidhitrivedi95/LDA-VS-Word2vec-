nybEvSB5y3deFPOP7rE46A My husband and I wanted a nice dinner and had not been to Pastina since they first opened.  We were some what disappointed in the experience.  The waitress we had was not very caring that we were there.  She took a long time just to drop off our waters.  We understand that restaurants get busy but it was a little ridiculous on the amount of time she took.  
We each ordered an alcoholic beverage and not once did she ask if we wanted another one.  The only time she checked on us was right when the food was dropped off and that was it.  As for the food, we both got pasta dishes and for both of us the food was too salty.  I drank almost three glasses of water because of it.  Over all the experience was not what we expected for all the hype about the restaurant.  Not sure if we will go back.
