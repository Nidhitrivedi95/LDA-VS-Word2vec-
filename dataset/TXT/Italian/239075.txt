U3xIe5_9iK95S9HxduOgWw This is a 2.5 stars, which is unfortunate given the tasty pasta.

Here's what you need to know:

Simple ingredients put together in a delicious concoction. The duck tagliatelle was simple but tasty as was the canoli dessert.

Prices are way off - $23 for a pasta that's an average portion size.  Prices for the wines are idiotic given it's a small neighbourhood joint (if Skin+Bones is open head there. It was unfortunately closed due to some private event)

Service was terrible at the dinner table, as though the waitress couldn't give a damn. Didn't tell us about the specials, was generally rude and unhelpful. When I asked for advice on wines, she literally shrugged and said "that's a Chardonnay, that's a Sauvignon Blanc and that's how they taste". Really? I asked for a dry and she shrugged and looked uninterested again. Not what I expect when I pay $13 for a very average glass of 5 oz wine.

Service at the bar was better by the time our friends joined us, and the bartender told us about the specials, gave good advice on the menu etc. However, the bar stools were so uncomfortable we didn't want to sit long.

Ambience is meh - nothing to think about. The service and ambience make the prices really stupid. We paid over $85 a person for 1 pasta each, a couple of glasses wine, and one dessert that was shared. NOT WORTH IT!
