SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ So this was my second time to this restaurant, but a much different experience.  The first time I went here, it was with Eunju O., and it was more on a romantic level.

This last time I went, it was with my CES crew, and it was not a romantic dinner.  The food here is decent, but the price is a bit higher than what I would expect for a restaurant in the Forum Shops.  The 3 of us ordered a main dish and a drink, and the bill ended up being over $80.  Not too expensive, but for what we got, it still seemed a bit high.  Maybe it was because we had "outdoor" seating.
