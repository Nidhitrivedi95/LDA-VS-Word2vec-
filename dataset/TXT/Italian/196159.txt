PmwKGY3HLpcnC_-g0NCIvQ The good:  Great bartender and great service.  Cute place.  Ok food--but not great food for Greek-Italian.
The bad:  Ironically, I am Greek and Italian, so have some expertise at this one.  The lasagna...really?  It is a bowl full of lasagna noodles, soggy with tons of cheese melted and some relatively bland marinara.  The avgolemono soup is basically chicken and rice with a filler added to stretch it.  Not much lemon flavor in it either.  I've had better...hell, I've made better.  And the tiramisu--which is made there--was great but where was the liquor flavor that tiramisu is supposed to be soaked in?

All in all, I probably would never go back--unless it was for some fantastic appetizers at really good prices we had there first.  Now that's why you go to this place:  the appetizers and the bar = excellent.

The dinner food rates a "meh" from me.  Sorry...but I'll give it a 4 star cause the bartender was so great and the appetizers were wonderful looking.
