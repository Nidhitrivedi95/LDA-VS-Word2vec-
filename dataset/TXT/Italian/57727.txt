Tomaso was there but spent most of his time watching over the kitchen and serving staff - as he should.  After 40 years he has opened this second location in North Scottsdale.  While we have a handful of other Italian restaurants in close proximity, I can comfortably predict this will become the local favorite.  
A few kinks need to be worked out, but that's perfectly understandable being open for just a few days.  We saw a server move the bowl of grated parmesan cheese from one person that just finished his spaghetti to another that just had some arrive.  That's not like a bottle of ketchup and should not be shared amongst customers.  I know fresh grated parmesan reggiano is expensive and shouldn't be wasted - but the server should sprinkle it on the food for the customer and take it away - unless that customer requests to keep it.  
Everyone I spoke to loved their food.  His prices are about 10-20% lower than Spiga, Pane e Vino and Gianfranco's nearby.  The only complaint I hear over & over again was his high prices for cocktails.  My rum & coke cost $11.00.  Only nearby Mastro's charges that high a price, but it's a much more generous pour at Mastro's.  Most other high quality restaurants in the area charge between $7-$8 for the same drink.  Tomaso needs to address this because his 30+ seats at the bar will generate at least 20-25% of his business in this part of town if he does it right.
Finally, I noticed a few staffers that came from other restaurants in the area.  The waiter John was with Pane e Vino for 15 years.  I stopped going there a few years ago because of the new owner, but missed having John wait on us.  I was sure glad to see him again.  A true professional!

Good luck Tomaso.  We're glad you're here.
