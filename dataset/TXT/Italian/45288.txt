8lZtLSeJVg28Gb75iklmmQ We cannot say enough great things about Gerry and his amazing staff at Eastside Pizza!!! We used them to cater our wedding party and everything was perfect. Gerry went out of his way to make sure every detail was taken care of,  including taking the time to re-set the room when it was done incorrectly by the staff of the facility. 

Our guests loved the food and everyone had a great time. We had the prime rib, eggplant rollatini and chicken picatta and it was all delicious! While deciding what to order, we visited the restaurant and everything we tasted was so good it was tough to decide on just three entrees for the party. 

In addition to having delicious food and an amazing staff, Gerry himself is an incredible person. He is very involved in helping the community and goes out of his way to help the veterans and people in need in the Vegas area. He is honestly just the sweetest man and we are grateful we know him. We do not live in Vegas but look forward to our next visit so we can eat again at Eastside Pizza. 

Please go visit and try the food for yourself. You will not be disappointed. In fact, you will easily be incredibly happy and full!
