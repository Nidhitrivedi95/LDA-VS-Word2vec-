gGS9Os0UBBO8BosD3VnwqQ If I could give this place negative stars I would. I made a yelp account months ago just to post about this place and here I go again....6 months later I gave this place another try after TERRIBLE service....the food is decent...and especially around here where else can ya really go?? Cause quite frankly I was sick off little Caesar's and pizza hut. Anyways yesterday my mother called ahead spoke with someone and explained ALL we wanted was a large pizza and Caesar salad. We just wanted to call ahead so we would have plenty of time to get family to the airport especially with holiday traffic and flights. Well the girl on the phone said no. Sorry. Bye. Just hung up

I understand policy and im sure you have been left to hang in the past. But I just find this crazy and just horrid customer service.  I cannot believe your still in business. 

I work in fine dinning. I would be fired for your rude actions. On my second occasion!!!! Especially the day after Christmas at YOUR prices!!! You should be ashamed!! I know first hand what great service is.  If u dont believe me I will screen shot my restaurants reviews on yelp and show u how many times im praised for my exceptional service. Wow unbelievable.
