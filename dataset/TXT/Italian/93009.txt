Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag I had never tried a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, and I always try to have at least one nice meal while I'm in Vegas, so this seemed to fit the mold nicely. It was a nice experience, and although I'm not sure I would rush back, it is not because of the experience, but just based on the fact that there are so many other restaurants in the genre to try in Vegas. 

I have to say, the one thing that absolutely made the experience was our waiter. The guy was good. from the very beginning to the very end, he was an absolute professional, and very good at what he did. His energy and enthusiasm did not wane, and he always made me feel as if I was his only table. That is the mark of a good waiter. He was also incredibly attentive and knowledgeable about his product. 

The restaurant itself, depending on your perspective, is in a nice and accessible location. It is right in a mall between the Cosmo and Aria/Vdara. It is an upscale mall, and the atmosphere is very relaxing and low key. It is an open design restaurant on the second floor, and overlooks the mall, so there is plenty to look at, but the second floor location keeps it quiet and private. Overall, it is a nice spot as long as you're not disappointed that it's not right on the main strip or its own building. 

The food itself was good. I have the woodfired sausage and cheese pizza, and I thought it was wonderful. My girlfriend had the egg plant Parmesan, and she thought it was good, although it wasn't the best she's had. The appetizer was a cheese and cold cut plate, and I thought that was one of the best parts! The prices were somewhat expensive, but I expected that being Las Vegas and a Wolfgang Puck restaurant. You have to pay if you want to play. 

Overall, this was a nice restaurant, although I'm not sure I would rush back there on the next trip. I would, however, try one of his other restaurants!
