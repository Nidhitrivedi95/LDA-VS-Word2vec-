Iam7tYWhssw_rscSBkeRIQ Pizza here tastes great. I'm leaving the one star because last night I went there and I kid you not- most of the employees were clearly on a substance of some kind- I'd say meth or crack. The person who took our order was shaking and had trouble putting sentences together. Another employee was also shaking and coughed in his hands and proceeded to handle hoagie orders with no gloves. I asked who the manager was, and the one seemed the most cracked out was apparently the one in charge. If you own this business, please immediately handle the substance abuse problem with your employees and sanitary handling of food.
