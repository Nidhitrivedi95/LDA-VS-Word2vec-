C4sVRSWeWuXo0OtnXewsjQ Ive been meaning to review Fusaro on Richmond for a very long time so here it is. A couple of months ago we reserved the whole restaurant for an intimate engagment party. Sandra, manager in charge of Fusaro Richmond location, helped us to coordinate a set menu that suited our budget. Our set menu included antipasto board to share as the appetizer, 3 main choices including the seafood parpadelle, chorizo rapini, and chicken scallopini, and tiramisu as the dessert. Not only did the food tasted exceptional but the presentation of the food was top notch. sandra and her staff went above and beyond and put detail to everything including printing up the dinner menus, to rearranging the set up of the restaurant to accomodate our guest of 15. Fusaro on Richmond is the perfect location for intimate dinner party and their staff will make sure your group is well taken care of. Thank you for the wonderful experience.
