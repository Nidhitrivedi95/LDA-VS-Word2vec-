CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA Personally, I don't care for their pizza, though it is decent enough that I'll get it sometimes with a coupon. Their sandwiches are very good though. Delivery is efficient, and the prices are about what you would expect. In all, a decent place, but not outstanding. I still miss Luigi's.
