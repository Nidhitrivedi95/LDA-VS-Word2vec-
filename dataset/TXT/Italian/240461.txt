My car battery died en route to pick up an order I placed, and it was well after Floridino's closed when AAA completed my roadside assistance. I sped over there to see if they'd still be open so I could at least apologize in person, and lo and behold, my order was still there, AND they remade it since my fiance called to update them what was going on. 

Superb service, food was awesome when we finally sat down to eat. We ordered a small side salad (I think they upgraded me, another kudos),  a half dozen pepperoni pizza muffins and a calzone. The pizza rolls were buttery, just enough cheese and a great chew, and the GINORMOUS  calzone was inhaled in 1 sitting by my fiance. 

Take it from an angry, pizza lovin' New Yorker, this is yummy stuff with outstanding service. Support your local joints, come visit Floridino's!
