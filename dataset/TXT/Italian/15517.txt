1RROh1rSDB4ASIZ-kwxT2w When I was visiting Cleveland for work, my coworkers and I ate at Bravo our first night.  We all ordered various salmon dishes and overall were happy with our choices. I ordered the salmon pasta, they basically just threw a whole grilled salmon on top of pasta.  Interesting visually but the salmon was so good I didn't mind.  The food wasn't anything spectacular but it was good enough that I wouldn't mind returning.  The service was pretty good overall.  The waitress was attentive and kept coming to check on us.  I was appreciative of the fact that my water glass was constantly being filled and that they brought us more table bread without us having to ask.

An overall pleasant experience and I would come back if I am ever in Cleveland again!
