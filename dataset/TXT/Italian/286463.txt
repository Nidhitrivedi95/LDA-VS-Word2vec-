ZHNxxsZrowzP-RedJ6cSFA I had the pleasure of being introduced to this place this past Saturday. The food was good, the service was very good, and the music was fun. The decor was dated, but, if you're like me (who will take good food and service over ritz any day) this was a great place. The menu is simple, but between the five in our party, everything was great. The service was given with a smile and the sangria was good. I liked that the entrees were offered at lunch 'size'. The music kicked in and the dance floor was hopping. The live music was from two fellas, a keyboard and bongos. However that may sound, it was fabulous. Great voices. Musically skilled. It is in the heart of Sun City, so if you're afraid that age is catching or if you're looking for the price tag of your outfit to be noticed, this is not the place for you. However, if you're looking for friendly company, good food, and a fun time, go. Maybe I'll see you there, because I'll be going back!
