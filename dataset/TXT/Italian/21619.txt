3awTUGMdUVrwEBkFFOxn9Q We took clients for dinner last night. Although we had a reservation for eight, we added 3 more to the group last minute, which worried me as host. To my relief, the staff quickly and graciously came up with seating for all. Sevice was exquisite and detailed. Everyone enjoyed their selections. We shared appetizers around the table. I must mention the stuffed mushrooms in a succulent sauce. Personally, I started with a caesar salad. They make their dressing and it is loaded with fresh parmesan. had a very tender chicken marsala. The sauce was delicious. It came with a tasty risotta. The dessert tray was impressive, too. We will be back!
