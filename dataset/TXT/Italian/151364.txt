kO-2Bv52yUG3YVP0bIL5qA For the money, lovely dining experience in a very Italian atmosphere! The folks here are friendly and the food is delicious! I had the Lumache Mediteraneo- Escargot was fantastic because of the sauce! I ate all of it with the bread soaking up every last drop! We shared a Fetticchine Di Parma (OMG so good...pasta was perfect el dente-ish...way I love it!) Lanni and Porchetta Pizza...delicious. Authentic, tasty and priced right...im on my 2nd shirley Temple! Have Libero serve he...quite a dapper fella! :)
