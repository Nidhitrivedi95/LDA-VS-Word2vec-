BCORM4dEleJXnyPXoaH3HQ So I went here years ago with a buddy of mine and was in the neighborhood again , so I thought I'd stop in for a lunch and grab a little Togo lunch.  So for a salad, garlic balls, and two slices of pizza , the total was ~$20. For two people at a pizza joint kind of pricey! 

The salad was nothing special, the garlic balls were burned, had no garlic flavor and the pizza was reheated in the oven! 

That is probably why on a Sunday afternoon , there was not a single soul in there aside from me. 

The service, however, was amazing, everyone was friendly!

Did not make up for the lack of quality of food!
