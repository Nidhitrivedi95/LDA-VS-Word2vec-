I've been going here for nine years, and very rarely am I disappointed. When this happens, it's usually at an odd time, like on a Wednesday night. I have seen some other reviews say hit and miss. It's always hit on the weekends. That's when the pros are working. The only consistent negative is the wait time to get your pizza, but that's the price for quality, and I'm willing to pay it. They also don't take Discover. Despite the negatives, Brooklyn South is still a big winner -- for pizza. The dishes are okay, but I haven't had them in years, so that might not be fair.
