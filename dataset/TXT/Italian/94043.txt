ElFjivhz41XfFiOogtTCvg THE CUSTOMER ALWAYS COMES LAST

I have not even visited this place and have a terrible opinion of it.  I would never set foot in it or speak well of the place as this restaurant in June wanted new customers so they offered a discount through Buytopia -- $15 spent for a $30 food voucher.  I'd been ill and so waited until I felt better -- the last weekend the voucher was valid. 

I called to make a reservation and was told that they had what I call a "bigger, better deal" -- when they had the opportunity to rent out the whole place for those days, they did so.  I asked the man I was speaking to whether the voucher would be honoured later than the expiry date, considering that it was their fault that I could not redeem the voucher.  He told me, yes, they would; then said, ask the manager, though.

Uh oh.

I emailed the manager who said, yes, they booked the whole place but NO they would not honour the voucher after the expiry date (which THEY themselves, failed to honour, not I).

If you make a reservation, don't be surprised if you show up and they don't serve you because of...well, they're greedy and unprofessional and lack common sense.

I see this restaurant offering Groupon discounts, still.  BEWARE.
