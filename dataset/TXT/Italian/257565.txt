w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A I had heard a lot about Metro Pizza.  Everyone raves about it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  A multitude of choices.  I had a specialty pizza topped with Fra Diavlo sauce, calamari and shrimp.  It was terrific.  Fresh ingredients and proper preparation.  Spot on.  I will be back again very soon.
