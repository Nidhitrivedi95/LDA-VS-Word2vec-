ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg I love coming to Crust!  The atmosphere and the food are super homey and comforting.  I recommend the spinach dip (comes out piping hot and cheesy from the woodfire oven) and The Meat (pepperoni and sauge) rustica.  YUM!!

Also, I am super obsessed with their marinara sauce!!  Luckily, they sell it by the jar so I can take a little of their Italian magic home with me. :)
