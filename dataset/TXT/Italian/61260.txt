aYjZc-3aVbPIPaJgGiUK_A Cannot believe I have not written a review for Nostrano yet. It's one of my favorite places in madison. One that never disappoints.

I always liked everything I had here, with the boudin blanc and the pastas being some of my favorites.

I also often brought guests here and they always seemed happy. And the few times I happens to be dining with a vegan, they've always been able to accommodate them.

Also good wine selection and great desserts!
