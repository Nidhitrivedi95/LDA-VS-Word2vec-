fckUjXz1GKpafT4x7-MVJA Christ Taft is one of the best servers I have ever gotten. I own a few businesses now and growing up I have seen a lot of shitty waiters. Most waiters get bad reviews when they do a bad job but this time Chris Taft is one of those waiters that must get recognition for his great service. I would offer him a job immediately if he ever wanted the chance. He was courteous, respectful, efficient and on point, bottom line he deserves a promotion.
