Yes it's a bit filling, but it's deep dish.. and yes it's about a 45 minute wait time, but it's worth the wait. We haven't had any other pizza like it. The tomato sauce and tomatoes are so zesty and fresh. We usually get it when we have family in town or friends over because there's so much and it's a no-fail pizza for guests. It makes great leftovers if it's oven-warmed. He prefers carry-out, though we've dined in before. We'll have to try the mozzarella sticks the next time we decide to get a table if it's not too crowded.
