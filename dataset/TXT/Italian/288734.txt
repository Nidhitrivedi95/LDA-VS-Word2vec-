Under cooked pasta. (I know some places have differing opinions of alienate however hard is hard.) the salad was OK, typical ceaser. Octopus was on par with the best ever. Roast rabbit was dry like cardboard with what tasted like fancy feast cat food liver stuffing. 

Much better places in this city. I'd stick to the recommendations below. I saw some of the pasta recommended below and they all left me with regret for not trying them.
