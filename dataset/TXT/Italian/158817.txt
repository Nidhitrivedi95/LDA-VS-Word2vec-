LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Thanksgiving, ruined !
Dont' ever, EVER, think about going here for Thanksgiving!  First of all, the food was terrible. Over salted. Just awful.  Second they ran out of food, or perhaps do not know how to plan well.  Third, they ran TWO HOURS late for our confirmed reservation!
Ridiculous- ran out of proscuitto for their own Maggiano's salad!  They obviously were running low on food by the time we were seated. (5:15 reservation, seated at 7:15!)
For seven adults, they place two ice cream scoops of mashed potatoes on a small plate in the center of the table-for seven people!  Then the turkey platter looked like  a sad plate of leftovers-and had one little mound of stuffing- which was gone after it was passed to the second person. We kept thinking that was decoration, and they would bring some in a bowl (aka family style). Same for the ham platter, one little scoop of sweet potatoes for seven adults!  The pasta course however, was abundant --apparently the only thing they know how to cook.  They brought two big bowls of pasta for side dishes. Everything was horribly over salted!  The gravy -also they must have been running out of...was a tiny little coffee cup sized dish of milky white looking blah gravy??   I cannot repeat enough it was HORRIBLE.  Two ten year olds could pull together a better turkey dinner.   They have a lot of nerve charging $40 per person!
