KtSEqZbGV1WHgOgtSMEZFQ The food here is great but the service needs work. 

I chose this location for a work meeting. My colleague and I arrived a few minutes early and noticed the person we were meeting hadn't arrived yet. They told us to sit anywhere so we chose the patio and left the name of the person we were meeting. 

Within the first few minutes the server came over a few times, gave us water, and asked if we were waiting for another person. We said yes and she said something like "okay, I tend to think people are waiting for someone when they really aren't and then leave them waiting". Ok.

After 20 minutes, I texted the person I was waiting for to see if she was close. A moment later she walked out holding her water saying she had been waiting inside for 15 minutes. The hostesses/servers never put together that she might be who we were waiting for? Or ask for her name, which we had given them? She sat down and the server didn't come back for a very, very long time. We actually had to flag her down to get her to take our order. We had been there for almost an hour at this point. I guess she did warn us.

I ordered a salad as my main, and when the food arrived, our guest had the salad I had ordered as her side dish and I had nothing. After several awkward minutes of my colleague and our guest sitting with their food, and me sitting with nothing, another salad came out and they apologized for their mistake. 

I would definitely come again as the food was amazing, but the servers need to step it up. Made for an awkward work meeting.
