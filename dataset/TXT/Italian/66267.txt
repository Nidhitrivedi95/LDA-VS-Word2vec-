bNNF6Z91L7Omfdi8QSo2_w Wow! Excellent summer 3 course prix fixe meal for only $29 or pair each course w/ wine for only $10 more! The short rib was very tender & the risotto was simply amazing, just the right texture and great flavor. Service was impeccable just like you would expect from the lovely Phoenician Resort. Sometimes it pays to be a local especially during the summer months. A+
