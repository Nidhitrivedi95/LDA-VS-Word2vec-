dNHDXn2ot4mFc2YfIFBNhQ We/ve had great experiences eating at Carrabas in Austin.  While on vacation we ate at the Carrabas in Surprise.  The food was okay, but the service was well below expectations.  There are lots of good restaurant choices in the area, so I wouldn't recommend Carrabas.  For what we paid, I would expect better service and quality.
