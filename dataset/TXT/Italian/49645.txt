The place was busy and the wait staff was a bit preoccupied, so our check took a bit longer to come. Also, valet was pretty much the only way to park because the street parking was full for blocks. Music? It was amazing. The background music sounded a lot like 70's girl pop from Italy and psychedelic jam bands from the 60's-70's. 'd it!
