azE1DNVQFBU8boVbaJhj7w Love the atmosphere.   Pretty, nicely appointed decor and tables with lots of room between them.  Everyone was very pleasant.   Service pretty good, though took a long time to get bread, and hard to find someone to refill your "unlimited" pasta.  The main reason for the 3 stars was mostly mediocre food.  Pasta was good.   Chicken was strange.  Large very thick breast with bland sauce.   Steak was not good enough for the price.  Seems the food is cranked out.  That said, we had an overall pleasant experience.
