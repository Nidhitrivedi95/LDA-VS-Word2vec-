0xzmIBsJQc5eUNLucFrZ0Q I had high hopes but was seriously dissapointed.  A trendy atmosphere in a casino within the high end Wynn sure be a sure application for success, right?  Unfortunately, of all the places dined at within Vegas, Alexander Stratta's lower end restaurant seriously fell flat.  Sea Bass sandwiched in onion lacked punch or drive, and I almost couldnt taste the fish.  The braised beef short rib had a great sauce . . . but the but was terrible, so much fat that you couldn't even eat it.  My waitress was cold, and the bill made my wallet weep.

Do not recommend.
