ghpFh6XpH1TYZhjAGdx-xw Service was great, the place was clean, and the food came out fast. The only thing that give this such a low rating was the taste. it tasted almost exactly like a tostinos frozen pizza. and for 8+ dollars i expected quite a bit more.  The girls working there did a great job preparing it, but the flavor was mediocre at best.
