The waitstaff was exclusively tending to the gelato counter leaving us to wander with no sign saying to wait to be seated. I ordered a pizza and my friend ordered a salad. The salad came out as an appetizer, and the pizza didn't come out until the salad was finished. When the pizza finally came, it was burnt. And not tastefully charred, I'm talking backyard BBQ  briquettes. The next pizza they brought out was better and quite tasty. The salad was well prepared also. We did t sample the gelato, worrying that it too would be burned or come out of the kitchen the next week. The food was generally very good, but they have to work out some kinks before my next visit.
