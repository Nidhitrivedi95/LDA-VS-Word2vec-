KkgnBZj3jRVjCY2H49JRaw Ordered a gyro and a cup of soup for delivery because I wasn't feeling well. The food was good, but an hour and a half for delivery when it's five minutes away? Beyond ridiculous. 2 stars because I've had the pizza before and it's good too but the wait time is always ridiculous. I went to pick up one time and they told me they had not even started my pizza yet when I got there. I used to live on the Eastside and always had a good experience with the location on Sloan and Charleston. It just seems like this location cares more about the bar than the food.
