TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag Jeff made our quick lunch at the bar a fun experience. He recommended a terrific Italian wine and did not blink when my husband asked which beers are GMO free. He was accommodating and pleasant even when we split one entree three ways. It was a perfect respite from the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas. Thank you Jeff.
