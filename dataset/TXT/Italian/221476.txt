SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg We had 10+ dishes.  We all liked seafood with linguine and most people liked lobster with gnocchi.  Both dishes were 4 stars.  Good ambiance.  All the other dishes were mediocre.  Octopus was too salty specially black couscous.  Sashimi dish was really...please take if off the menu.  $20 parking didn't help.  When I spend about $100 per person I expect more than mediocre food.  If you go here for the fountain view which is great, try classic Italian dishes like seafood linguine or pizza.
