anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg What can I say?  This place is the best of all scenarios.  Love the classic Italian/Vegas feel without it ever being outdated or "pretend".  The veal chop my son ordered was gorgeous!  I loved the presentation of the big, Frenched rib, which was only exceeded by the taste, yum!  My Oso Buccu was "melt in your mouth" fantastic!  Oh, and the crème Brule?  Oh my gosh!  
The only thing that might rival the food was the service.  Have you ever been to a place where they just seemed to get it?  They were there without hovering?  They seemed to anticipate your needs without making you feel you were being in the least bit rushed or a bother?  Ta Da!  Piero's does!  Hurray!  Worth every penny!  Again, Hurray!  Thank you for making my visit to see my son and his friends a wonderful success!
