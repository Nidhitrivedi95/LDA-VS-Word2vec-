Dishes were simple and allowed the delicious flavors of the seafood to be front and center. My two favorites were the citrus and star anise salt crusted sea breem served with a citrus olive oil sauce and the crab & langostino rigatone. I don't normally rave about pasta dishes so this had to be exceptional and it was. The wine they offered paired beautifully with each course.  Plenty of food to be shared amongst a large family of 8-10ppl. The only disappointing dish was the rissotto fruitti di mare which came a little under done and did not meet expectations.  I would definitely come again.
