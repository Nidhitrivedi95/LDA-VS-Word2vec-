yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg Salty canned clam sauce.  Thick overly capery veal piccata. Terrible cafeteria salad.  No fresh pasta to be seen.  This is college cafeteria Italian. Also, they wouldn't give us our free dessert because we didn't print the coupon. The manager was dressed like a  midwestern dad in sneakers and jeans.  The place screams "I can't be bothered" with customers.
