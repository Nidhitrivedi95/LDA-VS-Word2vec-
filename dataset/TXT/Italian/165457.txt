m6rffQy85HUq82DjLq-YJg Twisted Italian was such a pleasant surprise!! Awesome food but the prices were what wowed me! So incredibly reasonable, dare I say cheap, for such high quality, amazingly flavorful food! 

Michelle was our server and she was awesome! She made sure to accommodate all requests and she was ON the refills! (More Diet Coke please! :) ) She was busy too, but that didn't stop her from taking good care of us and always checking in at the exact right time. 

Tonight I tried the espresso martini, sangria, shrimp Fresca, Italian salad, eggplant Parmesan, and a cannoli. My mom had spaghetti and meatballs which was huge and she said was excellent! They really have a scratch made kitchen, don't let the strip mall facade fool you... no Sysco trucks here!! 

Overall I highly recommend for the food, the prices, and the service! A whole hearted 5 stars all around! I can't wait to come back to try the pizza, the pierogis, and the branzino! 

Also with mentioning that they have lots of specials! Tonight was 1/2 price bottles wine Wednesday and the place was packed! I highly recommend going early (bonus HH menu for the win!) or making a reservation. Definitely going to return next time I'm in town!
