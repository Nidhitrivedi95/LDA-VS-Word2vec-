rS3KdecMS-EF4H3VtmkxBw Horrible customer service! They took forever to serve us. We were sitting waiting at a table for 10 mins before we went up to the front counter to let them know we were here! And after they took our drink orders another 15 mins went by and no one came up to take our actual food order! Took too long to serve us. Never even got to try their food, and I heard such good things about their food too! Oh well, at least they didn't charge us for the drinks...
