j7yI3qYRsbGBUv9rShLCaQ Came here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday evening with reservations for a party of 8. The place had a nice ambiance and we were seated quickly. Seems to be a popular place for birthdays so I'd recommend making reservations for the weekend evenings. After we were seated, it took a long time for the waiters to get to us- no menus, waters, or bread basket for 20min. Even after the waitress initially came, the she took a long time to come back with anything. After ordering, the food came back pretty fast and it was delicious! I ordered the eggplant parm and it was amazing! Again, the waitress forgot to bring one of my friend's pizza and we could see that it was already done and sitting there getting cold. So for the service, I'm knocking giving this place a 4/5. They definitely need improvements in that area but otherwise, wonderful food!
