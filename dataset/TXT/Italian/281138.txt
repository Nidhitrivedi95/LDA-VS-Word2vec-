yrZrnWdBR4pE21vcgv8KHw I was here for a media event so everything was comped. Opinions, as always are honest. Lil Baci is changing up its image from a pizzeria in Leslieville to a family style Itailan gathering place midtown with more options on the menu (including veggie friendly options). I got a chance to taste many of the delicious things on the menu. 

VIBE 
I love that there is a place like this that is mid-market uptown. It's located between Eglinton and Davisville but closer to Davisville. 

The place reminds me of Sliced, actually. It's sleek and sophisticated with its white tiled walls and marble countertops but open and inviting with its floor to ceiling windows letting in a lot of light. I love the lighting here as well. 

If you get a chance to meet Mark Baci, you should be delighted! He is one saucy minx. A charmer, for sure. 

WE ATE 
Oh, we ate! A lot. I'll mention things that were particularly memorable to me: 

-The Beets - three kinds of beets in colour served with buratta. Are you kidding me?! Amazing. I could have eaten the whole dish by myself. This was a favourite across the board. That said, I felt at $18 it was a LOT expensive for an app but we were only getting a portion of it. I also understand how expensive buratta is. If you are in a group, get this. 
-The funghi pizza (which you can also get at Lil Baci in Leslieville). I love me some mushrooms dripped in truffle oil. 
-The pan roasted heritage chicken breast was moist and flavourful with drippings of olive oil, and topped with tomato and kalamata olives on the side. Rustic. Love. 
-The people on my side of the table loved the pappardelle with duck ragu. It was hearty. 
-The toscano style chicken liver mousse was decadent and rich. If you like a strong taste, this is a good bet. It's one of those things that can become addictive quickly. 
-the desserts were also a big hit. ---mason jars, etc 


OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Get your lil baci over here pronto. I hope this is a big hit in the neighbourhood. Again, much needed and I think it's a perfect spot for a group dinner or birthday dinner (they have a big table in the back as well to cater to a group). 

A note: in August, they will be serving sandwiches in the back of the resto called "Lil' Wich." (meatball, cold fried chicken, etc) for $4. You'll also be able to get a soup, salad and drink for $10. Great value and excited to check it out when that opens. 

It's nice to see exciting things happening Midtown.

AND PS I went back and had the beets and buratta; the asparagus salad and the pappardelle with duck. All made for a light and refreshing lunch, which was shared. Service was very attentive. Definitely my new spot in the Yonge and Eg area.
