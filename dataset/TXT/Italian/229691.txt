T7yKffTuhiIZclsgjfgowA I visited Pizzeria Via Mercanti (thanks to an episode of You Gotta Eat Here!) on a Thursday night and shared the Mozzarelline Fritte, Potato Chrocche, Ciambella Ripiena pizza, Pollo pizza, and tiramisu. The staff were super nice and they were very accommodating of my dietary restrictions. They allowed me to leave the sopressata out of the Ciambella pizza and replaced it with veggies (mushrooms, zucchini, and tomato), and let us do half chicken on the Pollo pizza. Everything was SO good, I have been dreaming about going back ever since. We can't wait to try the pasta! :)
