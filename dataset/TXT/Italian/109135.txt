G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Giada's was all that was promised -- and more. From their signature cocktails, to the appetizer, to one of the most amazing dinners we've ever had, to delicious dessert(s)...this place was phenomenal. Let's start with the wait staff: friendly, efficient, helpful, professional (we're running out of adjectives!). In particular, a big shout-out for our server, Fredrick -- great suggestions, great timing, a wonderful sense of humor...a real pro. And the ambience was so nice...it was more like being in a family dining room than it was a restaurant. We cannot recommend this place enough...and we will be back. One of the top restaurants we've had the pleasure of experiencing...period.
