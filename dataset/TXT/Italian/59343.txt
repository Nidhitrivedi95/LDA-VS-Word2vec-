ataRn8s6owt3SObGajp4KQ Service wise this place is TERRIBLE 
EVERY TIME u call they put u on hold for a good 5-10 minutes
You think it would be crazy busy but when u pick up ur food and walk in there is ALWAYS 2-3 girls behind the counter not doing anything. Owner OBVIOUSLY doesn't care bc he has a bunch of KIDS basically hanging out at "work" all day
Oh yea and take out food is ALWAYS COLD
DO-NOT-RECOMMEND
