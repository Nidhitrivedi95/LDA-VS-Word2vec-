_Z3XGVbiDn1VbgETp1pwLQ Ok so our first time attending this restaurant.   We are still trying to get to as many local places as we can.

When we got there, there was only us in the place.  Not sure what their lunch rush is like, but it was around 1130am.  The place is very nice. Small and clean.  Server was very friendly.  The bread and salad were really good.

I ordered the lasagna and my GF ordered the chicken Alfredo.  Overall the food was pretty good.  Lasagna had good flavor overall.  The Alfredo was also ok, nothing amazing but it did seem fresh.

Overall it was a good spot.  We may be returning.
