XT25YpQoNDuzAZHur-HZ8g Everybody! Please join me in welcoming Pizza Libretto to the Era of.....I dunno what to call this? Firstly, not a shot at the waiter, reservation takers (simply following orders presumably) BUT someone in mgmnt has decided it's perfectly fine to pre-qualify the duration of your stay?!!  In all my years having business lunches downtown  (over 20yrs stuffing my face in business district eateries) I have NEVER been asked "to leave because the table is reserved for 1:15".  The fact I'm  getting older may be that my hearing is going but in this case when I asked the young lady to repeat herself she triumphantly repeated herself loud and clear - stuff yourself and get lost Mr!!

Lets role play restaurant goers! We got approximately 1hr to settle in, order drinks, appetizers, mains, dessert/cafe and check out. Plenty of time correct? Unless your name has Hoover in it or you're romantically interested in indigestion not enough time. 

As for the food, meh. Good but not WHOA! "I gotta eat here again". You want thin crust, special flour that wont make your girdle burst and lets not forget its baked in some ancient Italian oven that is licensed by some authority we all couldn't give a hoot about! Oh! The maker of the pie prepped presumably by a pizza artist known only in their world (why would the average Joe know about a guy who can flop a pizza pie together?) So, ok ya, maybe I'm  jealous whatever. It's PIZZA people! Yes, better than fast food pizza but...it's  still ZAH!!!

Pizza Libretto - Join the line with the rest of the neo pizza joints popping up everywhere like it's some kind of privilege to eat.  ALERT! IT'S NOT.  Maybe now everybody is pumped to have a go at your stuff but with choice readily available in the downtown core, I have chosen to spend my business lunch money elsewhere. 

(Yes visualize me taking my soccer ball and going home leaving all yall to twiddle your thumbs )
