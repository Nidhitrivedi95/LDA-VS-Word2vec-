YiRhyhrKQNwgV43Sy0LlOQ I regularly go to Salumi Vino for different occasions. I really enjoy the food and am enamoured with the wine list and the recommendations that are presented.

My recommendations for lunch are the grilled tuna salad. For an evening meal I really enjoyed for appetizer the gnocci or scallop carpaccio (why not both!). For the main dish I either go for the Shrimp Linguini Fra Daviolo or the Black Cod dish.
