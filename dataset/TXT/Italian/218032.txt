rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ Wow, I'm so sad to write this update. I was a regular here, Jose Luis & Kathryn were amazing. I had a bad feeling when they sold to new owners, the food may go downhill. The new owners did make some changes, they are now open for brunch on the weekends, and they stay open later. We went for Sunday brunch today, the menu looked decent, I ordered chicken & waffles on a recommendation. When they came out, it literally looked like Eggo waffles with two chicken fingers laid on top. I was hoping it tastes better than it looked. Nope. It tasted exactly the way it looked. I tried my best to eat it, but it was really bad. The server ended up taking it off the bill for me because she felt bad. 

You can definitely tell that the kitchen is being run by a cook who came from running some shit holes downtown (Hennesey's and Mickey Finnz). The only thing I can hope is that Kevin, my favorite bartender doesn't leave. He makes amazing cocktails. I guess I can't go there to eat anymore.
