yGd87bkFijZ6YHrHtW5maA My go to for years merely due to location and decent food was Pin Kaow.  Lotus of Siam is always a good experience but kind of far for me. My recent love has been Nittaya's Secret Kitchen. Solid Thai food, beautifully presented and a intimate relaxing environment. But....I know I'm here to review Basil fusion so here goes. 

Probably the closest Thai food if you live in the northwest.  Merely chose this Bc I siri'd Thai food and this popped up. Not bad reviews and I wanted to take Thai food home without driving far. 

A first for seeing a Thai food place in a bar. Kinda odd, but hey I chose to give the food a chance. Do not recommend eating in, smokey and dingy, the patio is doable if the weather is perfect.  Doable for take out, barely, since picking up was in a back hallway where you feel like you don't belong. But they came out of the kitchen right away to acknowledge me and the Thai lady was very friendly. 

Now for the food.

Pad Se Ew with tofu. I agree with other reviewers about the noodles. I'd recommend this place not continue with these noodles Bc the traditional wider noodle is so part of the experience of Pad Se Ew. I will say that places that try to substitute the Chinese broccoli for American  broccoli really disappoint, but this place had the Chinese broccoli so it partially made up for the noodle. It was not bad overall.  Pad se ew is becoming a very popular favorite in Thai food, so they should really make some changes to make it right. Overall, 7/10.

Red curry with chicken. This was comparable to any other Thai restaurant I've been. Nice amount of chunky vegetables, chicken was tender and flavor was good. Overall, 8/10. 

No spring rolls so ordered Egg rolls. Could've done without, tasted like Panda Express egg rolls. 6/10.

I give this place a 4 star due to price, location, decent Thai food to take home and a friendly chef lady:)
