OhTGNPRRHkRuAmPUwaTTOQ I am not a fan of Pizza Hut but people I was with could not wait, so I did have any choice. 
We walked-in, and had to wait around for 10 minutes to order our food. We had to find clean table so we could sit. 

It took them 30 minutes to bring our orders. and waiter brought our foods he was very nice guy but he was wearing dirty shirt. I could not stop laughing. I asked for Veggie Lover with Mushrooms, green pepper, red onion, ripe tomato and pizza mozzarella I had much better pizza. 
My wife had Chicken Lover's with Grilled chicken breast, green pepper, red onion, mushrooms and pizza mozzarella it was okay recording to her.
