w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q This is such a classic restaurant. I love going here after a little Forum shopping. I have never had anything bad and the service is always excellent.

My favorite appetizer is the Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna and the Carpaccio of Beef Tenderloin- Delicious! I always get the Beefsteak Tomato Capri because it is my all time favorite salad. The Linguine and Clams Sauce is excellent if you are looking for a pasta dish. The Chilean Sea Bass is also a great choice for a light fish dinner.

For dessert the Key Lime Pie is a must. This restaurant will not disappoint.
