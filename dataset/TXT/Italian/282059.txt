YXvXE2p6xeg6a11SMIjQ3w I've been to Crust twice now and both times have been happy.  Their beer selection is good but not great.  They could certainly use a little more variety but they do offer several local selections.  

As for the food I've only had two items.  The garlic knots which are good and the ever so amazing arugula and prosciutto pizza to which I add a side of burrata cheese.  Yes this pie is sublime.  Perhaps the best pizza I've had in a decade or so.  While pizza is such an individual preference this pie has a lot going for it that should make most happy.  First the ingredients are top notch.  The arugula is fresh and wonderful.  The prosciutto is not cooked with the pie leaving the flavor and texture intact.  The crust is firm, yeasty with just the right amount of salt.  The sauce is excellent and does not overwhelm the pie nor inject too much acid int the equation.  Yes my fellow Yelpers.... you must give this thing a try as it is a work of culinary art.  

As for the location, parking is always a bit of a challenge.  Just dirt lot it and take a hike otherwise you will drive around like a jackass.  Note the back road behind Santan Brewery and this place is under construction making things even harder. if you know your way around.  The patio is pretty well set up and there is open air dining all around the place.  Great location for good weather dining.

Service is good but not great.  Our first experience was pretty slow despite it being relatively empty.  The second on the patio was better.  Looking forward to returning regardless and after a bit of tuning see this place as a 5 star contender.
