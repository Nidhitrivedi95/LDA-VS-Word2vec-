GnODIDJz09LecpudDoynCg Every business has what are known as "high maintenance customers." I get the sense that some reviewers below might fit that category.  After all, someone who reports that her service left her "sick to [her] stomach," as though she was "held at gunpoint" from a dining experience might have bigger problems than her waiter, and is probably not the best source for dining reviews. So I'll try to do this without resorting to such hyperbole.  I love the place, but it is still just a restaurant.  

You'll probably enjoy the Greenbush.  Its small and popular, so go there expecting a wait and a crowd.  Find your way to the bar, order a glass of wine for you and your guest, pay the bartender and have a conversation with the person you're with.  Before you know it, you'll have a table.  

Try the antipasto, spread some roasted garlic on some homemade bread, or some olivata or pesto.  Have a pizza, another glass of wine, then finish by splitting a creme carmel with a glass of cognac.  Thats what I usually do, and love it.

If you happen to like nice alcohol, this is your place.  Very few places have as extensive a scotch list, and no place is as reasonably priced ($5 for Macallan 12 year last time I was there!) Grappa, sherry, tequila, wines, good beer, it's all high quality at a great price in a non-assuming atmosphere.  

This is one of the gems that make Madison great.  And good news- the lady who felt she was held at gunpoint and is doing everything she can to get no one to eat there again?  She'll be in Middleton.
