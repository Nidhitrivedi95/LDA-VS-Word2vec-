Our 5 and 3 year old split a half order of a cheese pizza (4 slices) and it was the perfect size! And that disappeared like Houdini! 

My 14 year old niece had the Chicken Alfredo and I took a few bites and I sincerely enjoyed it.

I had the Linguini and Clams in the Rose sauce! Yummmm!! I cleaned my plate.

My husband had the special - grilled salmon on a bed of the double wide pasta with mushrooms and capers. I took a taste of that and loved it too! 

The freshness of the pasta was on point and would definitely come back to try something else next time!
