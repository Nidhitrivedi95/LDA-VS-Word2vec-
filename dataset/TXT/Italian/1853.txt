-j0CbYvlwuJ3Tfx__X38gA My husband and I went to this Italian restaurant for my birthday. We were seated at a comfortable booth. The crab ball appetizer had A LOT of crab meat in it and was a good price. The signature meatball appetizer was generously portioned, and I liked the taste although I am not much of a meatball eater. We enjoyed the toppings, such as fruits and nuts, on our house salads. My husband liked his shrimp scampi entree. My chicken parmesan was a large size, and I liked the tender chicken with crispy breading. The chocolate lava dessert did not have a melted, fudgy center as the menu said, but I liked its ice cream topping, as well as the candle that they inserted for my birthday. I felt that the business valued me as a customer. Parking is free across the street if you get a parking pass from the business.
