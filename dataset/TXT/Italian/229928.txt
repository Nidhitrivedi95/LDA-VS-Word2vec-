TAoN9nsibXOxsOnnG7Kd_g This place has adequate food but it is certainly not astounding nor worth the price. The house salad comes with beets that taste canned. It's just not all that great of a place in the food department.

However, I found the staff kind and generally willing to work with you on replacement sides. The restaurant is also quite kid-friendly (though there is no explicit "kids menu").
