7ZBh-3wWVQ5zkd6KZytW0g Don't quote me on this but I do have relative high standard in Italian food. Honestly, the winterlicious menu has not surprised me as much I hope. I ordered the grill octopus, which was a bit hard to chew and dry. I went with the trout dish for secondi, which was kind of normal/not wowing :-/ however, I love the dessert (I got the home made gelato, 5 stars quality though). On average, I will rank the food 3.5 star. 

However, this place got a impressive drink menu, great ambiance, beautiful deco. I would recommend coming for a drink rather than dinner, if you really care about whether the food is going to wow you or not. But, I have to say that it is indeed a not bad place overall!
