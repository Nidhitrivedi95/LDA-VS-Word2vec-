yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Overpriced but you get a lot with your dishes. Unlimited wine, cappuccino, soup or salad, garlic bread, some have pasta side. The decor was cluttered random interesting items. Staff friendly and prompt. Food tastes pretty good. Above your typical Olive Garden but not the best Italian food of your life. Garlic bread was a bit greasy so watch out. Cappuccino is sweetened, thin and hot! I enjoyed it but tasted more like a cafeteria hot chocolate
