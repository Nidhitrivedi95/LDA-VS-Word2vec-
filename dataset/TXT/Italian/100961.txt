fbLYRHIZAt3q839whhaBUg Service is usually decent, although I have had really good and really bad servers. Salads are huge so order appropriately! The garlic bread is just delicious - I don't get the cheese on it or the marinara on the side because they are both extra and frankly, not worth it. The pizza cookie is wonderful - don't forget that you can order two flavors in the same cookie!
