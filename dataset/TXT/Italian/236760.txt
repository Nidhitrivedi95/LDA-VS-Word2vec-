TWt-6EilZoSH99CheLPD2A My gosh!! what's going on there! what and why all these bad reviews, especially on the service!?

I went there yesterday and had one of my best dinners over the past months! I was to write that this place is a pure jewel lost in Lansdowne area!

Food is inventive creative and a hit. Cookers behind open-concept kitchen really look like they enjoy working and love food. I had very good home-ceasar salad, terrine with veggies, fabulous smash and bangers, beef stew "like at home when I was a child", hey! brew is really good. I was too full to have desert! 

Atmosphere, as already written in other reviews, is very homey with heavy wood tables and cozy cushions if you like that. So nice!.

Waitresses were really OK or perhaps that is because ours spoke French, and French speaking people are much nicer, effective and attentive than non French speaking ones (because speaking French is painstakingly difficult, thus you need to be into what you do!). It is not a fast food for sure (go to MacDo down the street if you are in a hurry!).
