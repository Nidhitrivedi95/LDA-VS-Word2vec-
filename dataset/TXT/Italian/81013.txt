dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw I had went to Fiamma for lunch between conferences over the weekend. Now, I am fully aware everything in Vegas is marked up 800%, but I didn't think my mediocre sized plate of spaghetti and marinara warranted a $21 price tag. The spaghetti was fresh and it was delicious, however didn't leave me too impressed. The Caesar Salad was also good. I guess coming from the east coast I've had better, for a lot cheaper.
