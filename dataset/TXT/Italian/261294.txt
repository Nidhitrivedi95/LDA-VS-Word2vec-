WpZkK951tqHONywmKLmhQw I got there at 5:30, did not have food in my mouth until 7pm! It's absolutely the longest I have ever waited for food  The pizza was lackluster and I ordered a margarita with pepperoni and they forgot to put my pepperoni so I told them and got a cup of pepperoni for me to put on top  and still charged me for it....really?! I was so so disappointed with this experience. To top it off I got sat on the cold patio with a baby ( I told them two adults and a baby) and there's no heat lamps, not cool. Probably not going here again, which is sad because it's so close to my house.
