JjkwArNO6OnCkwBemZzyNA I'm going to have to go with Elena and Liza on this one. I was so disappointed after reading all the great reviews.
The food was mediocre at best. The marinara tasted like it had come out of a can and hadn't even been doctored up with spices. The ravioli tasted like the really cheap boxed stuff you can get at a grocery store. I would actually put this place just under what I would rate olive garden or macaroni grill. At least the cooks there will put some spices on food. The decor was tacky. The waitstaff was good enough though. Also, the quantity to price ratio was high.
