UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Beautiful grille-great atmosphere for lunch or dinner. We were out playing 'tourist' on the strip, and found Brio on Yelp. Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised with our 'find' tucked in Town Square just off the Las Vegas Blvd. 
All of the staff including Asst. Manager Ashley welcomed us, making our lunch memorable. Spinach dip with homemade flat bread is excellent!
Generous portions, full bar, comfortable dining area. They offer outside patio seating, too.
