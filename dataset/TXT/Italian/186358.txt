OpNrObgtHgYijZYOU0yF-Q I probably had one of my worst restaurant experience here.

I just graduated from college so a couple of my friends and I went there to have dinner. Some of my friends wanted to order a beer and they ended up showing up him their passport. Since all of us were international students it was obviously an international Passport. He looked at it and was like Pennsylvania law states that it has to be an US issued ID (basically non Americans are not allowed to drink in Pennsylvania although they have identification clearly proving that they are over 21).

Since this was now a matter of principle, I pulled out my windows phone 7, went to the Pennsylvania state law website and proved it to him that international passports were indeed valid acceptable IDs. 

We would have walked out if it weren't for the fact that we had already ordered our food and places and it was getting late. He was rude to us for the rest of the night and it was a pretty bad experience for the seven of us who went there to celebrate graduating.

Never ever going back there.
