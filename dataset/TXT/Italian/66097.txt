BMR_AsSBzTQHqW-SQabI4w What the heck happened to cpk's food and quality? I've had fond memories of delicious dinner dates at cpk, loving almost all of their entrées from pasta, pizza to salads. I had lunch there today after over a year. The husband got what he always loved here, the pear & gorgonzola pizza and I got the veggie grilled sandwich with tortilla soup and Mediterranean veggie rolls for appetizers. I have to say, the food was nearly inedible. The soup was a thick mushy blend of something that didn't sit right with me every time I took a bite, as if they put whatever leftovers they had and blended it. The sandwich was soggy. The med veggie rolls were just baked tortillas rolled up with cheese inside and served with marinara sauce from a jar, and the pear & gorgonzola pizza also didn't taste fresh. Needless to say, we will no longer be returning to cpk...ever!
