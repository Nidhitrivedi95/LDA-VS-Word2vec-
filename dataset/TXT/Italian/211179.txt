QXR-YnHgV0qDyuUTckYeGw Bakd was a hit!  We tried the Detroit style with unlimited toppings and were more than happy with our food and service.  Cauliflower on pizza?  Yes, please!  And do not miss the balsamic vinaigrette.  Our server was thoughtful, witty and a pleasure to chat with.  Even the owner checked in on us to say hello!  Our daughter thought the world of her brownie dessert and we are happy to have a lovely leftover lunch of pizza for tomorrow!
