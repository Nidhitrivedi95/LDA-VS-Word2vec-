The bartender was really friendly and attentive.  Also my two slices came out relatively quickly and my drink was nice and strong.  I think I paid about $13 for two slices and a vodka soda...can't beat that.

The not-so-greats:
The pizza here was decent, but nothing to really write  home about.  For some reason the pepperoni was soggy, but the white pizza was good.  I don't think the flavors are really that strong, and it was all really greasy.

It hit my pizza craving, and I couldn't beat the price.  But I wouldn't make a beeline to this place if I visited Vegas again.
