Nkb9_PKgnVYZe8W1y_fBRg Dante quality food at half the price in a casual environment = Brunch heaven. That and the four different kinds of Bloody Marys on the menu! My friend and I split the crab cakes "Benedict" (sans ham) and the bagels and lox pizza. These combos of dinner and breakfast items (bagels and bennies with pizza and crab cakes), were so good! The crab cakes killed it; so much so that I ordered an additional one to go! The hollandaise sauce was perfect, the portions spot on, and the crab cakes were more crab than filling--always good news. We also ordered the potato tart which ate like a hash brown pie, crunchy on the top and bottom and full of cross hatched hash brownie goodness in the center. Since it was my birthday, I scored a free dessert that I don't know the name of but will be back to find out (and eat) more of! Way to go Dante. What a great way to rep brunch.
