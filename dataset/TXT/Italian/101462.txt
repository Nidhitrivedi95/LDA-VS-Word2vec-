FclR3tCyp3wPCZoxHXn_jQ I have been wanting to try this place since May and I am sad that I waited so long. I took my kids here for the first time Friday Night and we were not disappointed. The whole staff was super friendly and treated us like we were family. For me growing up in a full on Italian Family food is a huge thing. Every Sunday having those huge Italian dinners with the family is something that I miss. Coming here it feels just like that. The food is awesome the people are the best, what more could you ask for. My kids had the Cheese Pizzaiola and they loved it, I had the breaded steak sandwich and that was awesome as well. We loved this place so much that we went back the next night for dinner. The kids had the same thing again since they loved it so much and I opted to try the Chicken fingers and fries along with some cream puffs and fried dough. I have no complaints about anything and I will for sure be back in the very near future, I have many friends that need to try this place out! If you haven't tried it you should!
