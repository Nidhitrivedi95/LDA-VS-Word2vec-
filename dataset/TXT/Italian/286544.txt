zi_qqjCzkerE2dT-ViE2JA This review is just for the bar and staff experience along with the decor. According to the bar tender this church was converted to a bar / restaurant in the 40s or 50s and has been operating ever since. There is lounge / live music venue space in the basement with pews as seating that opens at various times according to the bar tender. The place uses little real lights and let's the light from the stain glass windows set the lighting before its gets dark with the help of candles every where. The interior is very cool and I totally love the theme of this awesome place. The interior is beautiful with its open space foot print and high ceilings but don't look too close at the ceilings because the look very dumpy compared to the rest of the decor. The bar was nice with some silly over hang piece in the center which I didn't understand, it must be a church thing. The bar tender was a nice and talked to us about the property and its history. The place is very cool and not very full around 7pm on a Saturday with tons of staff on hand like a swarm was about to happen or just over staffed. This is defiantly a must stop in Maddison wi and I will post pictures of this cool place. The bar hop must include a mix of divy and nice and this place is nice. Three straight and one mixed was not as much as I though for the coolness of this place. The food is Italian on the menu and there is a good drink menu to match. I would recommend this stop while in Maddison Wi.
