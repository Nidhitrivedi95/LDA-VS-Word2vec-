xmARZ_MuSfrQCXP4e8RQjg We love nello's, always have. Now we usually go to other locations(mainly ahwatukee). We came here because we were on this side of town. Got us in right away, greeted us right away, got our drinks super quick. (Guess I should've given 4 stars or atleast 3 1/2 cus everything was great except a couple things. Our server was great! I guess the only thing that was their down fall was their lack of a kids menu, (which we really needed/wanted), and then when we got our pizza... We asked the difference between medium and large as far as slices go, he said 10 slices on both sizes. Except the slices are bigger on a large. So we order half Hawaiian; half green olives, black olives, and artichoke hearts (medium). We get our pizza, looks like only 6 slices... We would've ordered a large if we were only getting 6 with a medium. We were pretty hungry... Start divvying up the pizza, and instead of half and half, we get two pieces Hawaiian, 4 black&green olives and artichoke hearts. So instead of what I thought I was getting (5 Hawaiian slices, I get 2!!) HUGE LET DOWN!!! I was the one who talked my wife into coming here even tho it wasn't our normal location and they didn't have the dressing she likes(white balsamic), and yet I get screwed and only get two pieces of pizza I wanted(Hawaiian). 

So... Yea... Pretty big let down. Was really I the mood for a good nellos pizza, been coming to nellos for the past 15 years, hadn't been to this location in 10 years, but I had confidence in this place still... Looks like I was wrong...
