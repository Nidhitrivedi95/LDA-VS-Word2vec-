527O5H26A0lFtCHO6zEh8w The place and atmosphere are amazing but the owner is a really bad person. He forces the servers to write good reviews about that place. He always tries to keep tips from the servers so if you want to tip the servers please do it cash and directly to them. The owner has already been involved in legal issues because of this. I think this place has the potential to be an amazing hidden gem if they were only going to change the management
