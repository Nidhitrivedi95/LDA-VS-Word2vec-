hgQOESYp7CF4LnNI90XEiw I had been dying to try 800 degrees at the SLS and finally had a free day to get there.  I was not disappointed.  the Pizza was perfect,  the salad was yummy and the service was fast and courteous and friendly.  

My friend had a pre-assorted mushroom truffle pizza.  And although truffle oil is not my favorite, her and other of my friends who like truffle, rave about it.  

I made my own, with the Bianca white base (I requested no garlic as I don't care for it).  The Bianca is olive oil, mozzarella, oregano and garlic normally.  Then I added, a raw egg, grilled chicken and fresh basil.  OMG it was out of this world!  Cooked perfectly with my egg just right with a little runny yolk to dip in, but no runny whites.  The crust was perfect blend of slightly crispy but soft, not burnt. 

I've eaten at Novacento several times and this 800 Degrees crust is 1000 times better.  its more fluffy and light and easy to bite.  The toppings also seemed fresher and lighter and they have more base sauce options.  

We shared the small $5.00 Gorgonzola salad.  Its quite large for a $5 salad and the butter lettuce and toppings of cranberries, feta, and walnuts were great.  The dressing was light and fresh and one of the best I've had.  

There was easily accessible nice glass plates and real silverware (not plastic), and pre-made to go boxes for left overs.  They thought of everything, for a quick, affordable nice experience.

My only tiny complaint is,  clean the empty tables faster so you don't have to select an open table based on what is clean,   and level the table feet on any tables that are wobbly.

When we were done, the pizza chef made a point to confirm if we were happy and everything tasted good.  

If you're a vegas local, one sunday a month is 50% off for locals.  A must do!
