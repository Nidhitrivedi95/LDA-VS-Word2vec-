llCxryWr8j1S39tusYCWxg Delicious! Cheesy and delicious! The sauce was great. Pauly's is authentic East Coast pie. Just moved here from Jersey/Philly area in July, and finally found something comparable to what we're used to. We'll be back! Thanks for the canoli Pauly! I'm giving it 4 stars because I'm waiting til I try the wings. ;)
