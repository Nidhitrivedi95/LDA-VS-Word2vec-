2bK1ng2mnRdtTh_BDNGmIg I've seen all the great reviews and figured I'd give them a try and I'm sure glad I did. Ordered delivery tonight and it was here 20min earlier than expected. We got wings, a supreme and half cheese/half Hawaiian and it all was fantastic. Awesome crust by far from anything I've had, reminds me almost of Metro but not as overpriced. Worth a try if you're in the area, lunch specials also look great and the portions are huge. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is that the wings were quite small but had great flavor and texture and also not overpriced. Easy online ordering is a plus.
