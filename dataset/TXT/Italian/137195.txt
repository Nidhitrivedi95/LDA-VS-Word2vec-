j1xqz2w3wjVpvxYJi3t5IQ We went on a Sunday night and it was not busy at all. The restaurant is huge so with only 3-4 tables occupied it seemed even emptier. 

Our service was really friendly and efficient. The restaurant was clean and the bathrooms were attended to. The food was ok, not bad, but certainly not gourmet Italian. We started with bruschetta which was good, lots of fresh basil. Not sure they used the right bread as it got soggy pretty fast. Since they don't have thin crust pizza, I opted for spaghetti and meatballs. Again, it was ok, not great. The sauce did not have much flavor and the meatballs were rather dry and tough. The spaghetti was just regular out of box. In the end, I was really hungry so the meal was not bad, but certainly not a place I would rush back to for the food. Prices seemed kind of high to me based on the quality of the food.

I am giving it 4 stars on the strength of the service although in reality it is a 3.5 star restaurant.
