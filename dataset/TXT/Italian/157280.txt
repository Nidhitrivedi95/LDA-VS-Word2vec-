lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ Its sad to see any restaurant get bad reviews but when we went, we did have to wait a bit to be seated but it was well worth the wait. The waitress was run off her feet. She was the only one there that had to be the bartender the waitress and the busser. Incredible! We ordered the Fruitti de Mer (seafood in pasta) and the Spaghetti with meat sauce. OMFG! First off the portions were generous. We got two large. And we demolished the seafood BOWL!. The spaghetti was so delicious. I have never had pasta that good before except for Anton's pasta. I'll tell you about that in another review. The sauce was exceptional. Its too bad management doesn't know diddly about staffing the restaurant properly. The food is so good I would go back regardless if I had to deal with the wait.
