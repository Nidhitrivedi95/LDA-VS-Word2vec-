pjpUOlJLlkIxBZ5BquA2PA After a couple of disappointing no go holiday parties at restaraunts downtown, we stumbled on this place. It looked like a place I had eaten in Rome and the pizza on one diners plate looked remarkably like the pizza I eaten while in Italy. 
This proved to be one of the most delightful surprises. From the caprese to the pizza, there isn't one thing I would change. What will keep me coming back? LASAGNA BOLOGNESE. Hard to make. Harder to find prepared well. This was it. Yum. Can't wait to go back.
