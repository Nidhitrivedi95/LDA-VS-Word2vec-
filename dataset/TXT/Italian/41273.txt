7NucoWCjPzZyRPjsVR28xQ Meh. This place is okay. The pizza is okay, not great, but not sucky either. Pricey though, but what do you expect when you're in Vegas. The only upside I can think of coming here is after a night of clubbing since it's open 24/7 I believe. Overall, I have had better pizza but it's convenient eating here especially if you are looking for some quick food.
