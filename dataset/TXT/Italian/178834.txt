nS6QENxe6YODNrQ45bpC-A The pizza was good. But the service...

I passed this place and saw an inviting sign on the window that read: "Anytime Special.  Any 2 Slices & a Drink, $5." 

Just what I needed!

I was greeted by a short blonde woman who needed to check if they still had slices. I understand, it was 3.40PM.  Sometimes slices are only available at meal times.

Her - Me

"Yes, we have slice's." - "Awesome!"
"Pepperoni or cheese?" - "Actually, I'd like pepperoni and mushroom with extra sauce"
"We can't do that." - "Really?  You don't have mushrooms or sauce?"
"We do, but the pepperoni and cheese slices are already made." - "ok, can you just add it before you throw the slices in the oven?"
"No" - "Really?  That's how lots of pizza by the slice places work..."
"Ok, we'll add it." - "great, thanks!"
"Your total is $6." - "But the sign says $5 for any 2 slices, including a drink?"
"I have to charge you for the extra toppings." - "But the sign says?"
"The sign is incorrect, we're in litigation with the sign vendor now." - "Ok, well can you honor the current offer?  Seems like you should, that's the whole reason I came in..."
::Lots of sighing and grunting:: "Ok, $5.50." - "Thanks!"

There was no mention of my drink.  Fortunately I didn't need one.

Like I said, decent pizza, but this confrontation was appalling.
