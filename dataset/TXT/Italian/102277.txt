FhVYpbvE8IQeUHAcwPPIXg Had a great dinner with the family and family friend. Started with the calamari and marinara sauce and the portobello mushrooms with dill dipping sauce both were great. I had a Brooklyn lager to go with my dinner. The salad comes with the pizza and you can order the house salad or upgrade to the Caesar salad for a little extra. Both were great. They serve the pepperonis, olives, and Munster cheese on the side. The garlic bread comes with olive oil with a lot of herbs mixed in. The pizzas are large enough to serve 2-3 people, we tried the clams casino, saprano, and Roma pizza. I also ordered the clams and linguini, which came with what seemed to be half clams in the shell and half liguini which is a good thing. The bread is delicious to dip in the sauce. My son had the artichoke chicken that comes with angel hair pasta, which he liked. We were so stuffed but we managed to try the Nutella cake. We had boxed up the remaining pizza for leftovers. The staff is friendly and accommodating. My 4 year old spilled his milk under the table and they cleared it right up and replaced it. The staff were quick to clear plates as we moved through the appetizers and salads. A definite upgrade from the previous pizza place this used to be, and a definite great alternative and step up from macaroni grill and Olive Garden.
