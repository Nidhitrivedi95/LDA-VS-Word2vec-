N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ What a great place! We found Biaggio's with the help of Siri (when we asked for best-rated pizza near us) and she suggested Biaggio's.  We didn't know what to expect when we pulled in since the parking lot and surrounding stores were empty, but when we walked in, there was a bustle in the air, laughter, and the sound of people having a good  time.  The man that greeted us with a smile and rose from the table to meet us ended up being Mr. Biaggio himself.  What a gracious host, I felt like I was in his home.  Our waitress was a delight, and we started our order with the garlic knots.. my boyfriend didn't like the last batch from Angelina's, so he was very skeptical.  The picture on the wall of the garlic knots got his attention and we ordered 2 orders (I love garlic bread!).. he ordered wings and then we got two separate pizzas, mine was the chicken with artichoke and olives.. I ordered with spinach instead of the chicken since I am a vegetarian and they were able to accommodate with a smile.  My BF ordered the Meat Lover's pizza and thought the meatballs were to die for.  The crust on our pizza was simple and delicious, bordering on flaky.. the color was even and cooked to perfection!  We even took pictures of our pizzas, they were so gorgeous.  And they tasted just as good!  Mr Biaggio sat with us for a while and was so very pleasant, even telling us some Italian cooking secrets (!).. (we love the carrot in the tomato sauce to reduce acidity) while he sat with us.  I got bad news by telephone while I was finishing dinner, and Mr. Biaggio even gave me a hug when I left.  How thoughtful and genuine.  What a dear man, I liked him very much.

There were lots of people who came and went for carry-out while we were there, so I know they are popular.. and they should be!!

Our experience was the BEST, and we will come back again and again!  Luckily for us, we live in the area, so we can get delivery!!!
