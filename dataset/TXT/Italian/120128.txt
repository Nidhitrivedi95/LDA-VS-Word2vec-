H3cMcV9KK3g2pi68lDNsng This is a restaurant that I have been wanting to check out for a while so I am very glad I got the chance to go. I went on a Friday night for an early dinner/ Happy Hour. My friend and I grabbed a seat at the bar which I was surprised wasn't more crowded. We were immediately greeted by 2 super friendly and helpful bartenders. 

It was a warm night in Cleveland in February so I went with the Bloom cocktail that had homemade lemonade in it. It was AMAZING!! My friend got the Simplicity and that sounded and looked great as well. My friend and I split the crab and salmon cake appetizer. It comes with 2 of the cakes so it's perfect to split with somebody. Crab and salmon are my 2 favorite seafoods so this was perfect. I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the romaine wedge salad with chicken. They didn't have just plain grilled chicken so it came parmasean crusted and this actually made it even better. Not as healthy as I was hoping, but way more delicious. The wedge salad came with prischuitto (which I overlooked) so it would have been great without the chicken. The menu had so many great options on it so I was sad to stick with just a salad, but I'm glad I got to try the chicken. 

The restaurant itself is small, quaint and has a vintage feel to it. There's a patio in back that I did not see so I guess that means I will have to come back again. This is a great spot in Gordon Square which is popping with all of the great new restaurants and bars.
