Q6Lp73mfUnb7_DVkbzijYA A very cute Italian restaurant on Baldwin. It wasn't very busy for a mid-week lunch, but the service was very slow! We waited almost an hour for six plates of pasta. I had the vegetarian pasta, which was very delicious, and topped with a nice asiago cheese. I recommend if you have time for a nice leisurely lunch - but skip if you're in a rush!
