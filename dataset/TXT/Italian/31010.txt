Love their exposed brick, wood floors, and big chalkboard menu on wall. Adequate seating inside or out. Quick and friendly service.

Had the Feta and Turkey Salad (hold the corn!) last Sunday afternoon. Was pretty scrumptious! My dining partners had thin-crust pizza that looked delish also.

I will def be back for more Sauce!
