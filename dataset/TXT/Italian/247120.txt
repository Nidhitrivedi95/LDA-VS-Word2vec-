V6MWAv-xv4dgSUrDU1qxaA I had another caterer back out the last minute for a graduation party I was hosting and desperately needed someone to cater our event.  I called Nothing but Noodles at the last minute and they came through!!

All the kids loved the pasta (Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp, Three Cheese Mac with chicken, Marinara and Meatballs) and I couldn't have been happier with both the food and the great service from Kristen, Rachel, and the rest of the NbN staff.  My personal favorite was the Gluten Free Alfredo. The food traveled so well and was still hot and tasted great after 1.5 hours.  I was very happy with the entire catering process and will order from you guys soon again!
