My friend and I went on a Friday night but the restaurant was fairly vacant (it didn't get busy until about 6:30pm). We wanted a booth, however, and they had all been booked. I ordered the gnocchi, which was not spectacular nor terrible. Service was great in the beginning, but our server was very slow in the end when my friend and I asked for individual receipts after she had brought a combined one. 

On the bright side, there's free bread (baguettes, I believe) with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. But I'm not sure the bread alone is worth paying a second visit.
