pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ OMG! This place was a desert oasis. Found it during breakfast. Best and freshest eggs in town. Met the owner Bradley. Turned us onto theatre ticks and came back for the gluten free pizza and pasta. Heaven and can I get an Amen!! Inside the mag mile planet Hollywood. Right across from V theatre. To die for!!  Thanks
