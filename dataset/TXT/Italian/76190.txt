CSaVK9wgqe2_tQuuCDINyQ We just ordered pizza last night from Frankie's and it was really really really good. Here is what My grandson thinks "It's 10 a out of 10" my other grandson Really loved it too .. and that's coming from a four-year.

I am not even sure where it is located but we will surely stop in sometime. 

Prices were good too actually! Hard to find good pizza in the Silverado Ranch area

One more thing, they actually cook the pizza thoroughly and well done unlike everyone else Who seem to think raw pizza  is a good thing???
