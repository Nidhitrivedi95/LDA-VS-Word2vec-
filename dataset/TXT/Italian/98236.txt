eVv6cnwhabK8ig5Di2hXQQ My family always enjoys eating at Florencia's.  Their crust is one of the best and they cook it to perfection.  Waitstaff is always helpful and polite.

My only little criticismsis the mozzarella does not have much flavor and the caesar salad dressing does not taste much like the caesar dressing I make and am used to.

Great pizza!
