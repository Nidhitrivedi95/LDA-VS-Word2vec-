pVntIctjRuspaO_ULf5zOA We came here for a company lunch. I was advertised to look over the menu on the website a head of time. Checked out the $10 menu and decided to have the smoked chicken risotto. 

The risotto was pretty good. Served on a large dish, the portion of the risotto was rather small. Some of my colleagues ordered the calzone and they were huge.

If you are gonna come here for lunch, i recommend you order anything outside of the pasta & risotto section.
