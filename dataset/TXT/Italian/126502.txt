hSU3MbB9Yu8MlybxfmABeg This place is delicious, authentic, and awesome for Italian food! I had a chocolate espresso martini to start off with and it was heavenly. The appetizers I tried were fried cheese, caprese salad, and calamari. All of them were ridiculously good. For dinner, I had lobster pasta, which was really rich and tasty. This place is also known for its pizza, but sadly I was too full to try any. Love the location in little Italy too!
