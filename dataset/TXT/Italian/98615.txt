ewEDv_q-K0fV0FepkHB8sA Love this place!  Atmosphere is great but couldn't hear any music Saturday night though? We sat at the bar in one of the booths and had a great couples meal. Shrimp cocktail and escargot followed by sharing a filet with Brussels sprouts. Everything was cooked perfectly and the service was excellent. My only complaint was no music. I wanted to hear Frank Sinatra or the rat pack or something.
