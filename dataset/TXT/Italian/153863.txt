KyzPvdGPb2ubVlXJrS2QPA I'm basically housebound right now with pneumonia so thought I'd order a pizza.  They had left a card on my door that afternoon so I thought I would try.  I can't remember who I spoke to- Brad or Brian?  I ordered a large 1/2 cheese 1/2 pep saus and onion with a Greek salad.  They had a coupon for $16.99.  He said it would be about 45 minutes.  No problemo- about 50 minutes later I was wondering and they called me!  The driver had an issue at a previous delivery and was running late but he just left with my freshly made pizza.  He took $5 off for being late.  

The pizza was awesome.  For $16.99 a 3 item large pizza and Greek salad.  The pizza was great and hot and the salad was fresh!  Will definitely order here again.
