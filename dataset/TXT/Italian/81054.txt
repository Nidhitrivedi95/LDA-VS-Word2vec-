Needless to say, if their free items were that good, I couldn't wait to try the main course. Lobster gnocchi was my choice, and at $31, it was a tough one indeed. The portions weren't that big (not what I'm used to anyway with all the other restaurants we've eaten at). Once the plate arrived, I asked myself if this is how true Italians eat--without stuffing their faces and eating themselves into comas like we Americans do. But then I asked myself why they were still so fat, so I concluded that it must be the butter. Either way, my friend got more lobster than I did, but it was still delicious. The gnocchi melts in your mouth like it should, so that was a plus.

For dessert, we had three flavors of sorbet, the doughnuts, and the tiramisu. Sorbets were a bit icy, but the doughnuts were great deep fried balls of delicious, especially when dipped in the caramel or hazelnut sauce provided. Tiramisu was smooth, but not that high in my book.
