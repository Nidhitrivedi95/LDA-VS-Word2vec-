-7d3UqQYYcBxbDH2do86sg I'm bummed because I've been wanting to try this place and it turned out to be disappointing. The Japanese pan noodles I had was a small portion and the flavors didn't jive well. My wife felt the same about the pad thai. The only saving Grace was the mac and cheese, which my daughter really enjoyed.
