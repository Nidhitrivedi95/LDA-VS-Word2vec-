Q4RSmF0s-AkaegrLFCLEbg Excellent shrimp alla diavolo appetizer; the oil with garlic, chili peppers, parsley had tremendous flavor.  The veal Marsala was also outstanding.  Service was very attentive but not over attentive.  Donatello's was strongly recommended by Ralph at the Marriott on Bay Ave. as the best Italian restaurant we could go to in downtown Toronto.  We wholeheartedly agree!  Thanks Ralph!
