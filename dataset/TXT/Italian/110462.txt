G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q My wife and I are huge fans of Giada so when we saw she was opening a restaurant a while back we knew we had to come here the next time we went to Vegas. We are celebrating our 2 year marriage! 

The decor and layout was nice. The chairs were super comfortable and I love the theme of the restaurant. 

The service was mediocre. Maybe our waiter had a rough day but didn't go over the tasting menu. Just gave us our water, then when it was time to order he said "Ready?" I prefer interaction with the waiter where they talk to us a bit about the menu. Especially at a place like this. 

My wife got the risotto and I got the spaghetti. We both loved our dishes. However, this might have been the first time where we both looked and said where is the rest of our food. Typically Italian restaurants are pricey therefore we rarely go to Italian restaurants when we can make it at home. 

I'd recommend this place just because we are huge fans and I did like my spaghetti. Did feel as if everything had lemon in it. We did receive a nice anniversary plate which made it special :)
