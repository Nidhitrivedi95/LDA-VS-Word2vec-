EUQoB_ph7_xIyj7JZGI3bg Wow, wow, wow! Giuseppe's on 28th isn't fancy looking but the food is absolutely wonderful. The place is small and so they clearly have high quality control because everything was off the charts delicious. The sign out front about being on the Food Network is a bit corny, but don't let that stop you - this is the real deal.

We started the evening with the squid in white wine and one taste had me thinking about building a shrine to its greatness. The squid was so fresh and tender, the tomato sauce had a deep richness and sharp spice, and the peas (courtesy of Tuscany) were a stroke of regional genius. You'll never eat fried squid again - this is the only way to go. We ordered the garlic bread to sop up every drop of tomato sauce.

We tried the bruscetta which is prepared on the most wonderful bread you will ever taste. My wife said it is from Willo? I'm not sure ,but I was thinking maybe heaven? You get 4 different slices - the one with prosciutto, fig and goat cheese was magnificent.Then the dinner. You must try the "as seen on the Food Network" Osso Buco. Oh my God - this was the best meal I've had in a long, long time. Parked on a bed of home made noodles was the most extraordinary marinated meat with a complex tomato-based sauce that could bring Michaelangelo back from the dead to declare his entire lifes' work a failure in comparison to this work of culinary art. Savor the beauty. My wife had the manicotti, which because of the fine tomato sauce and fresh noodles, was excellent.

We finished the meal with tiramisu. After one taste I laughed out loud at anyone that would give this place a negative review. That would be the definition of a shill. Giuseppe's on 28th is not the fanciest, but it is the best Tuscan-Italian food you will eat in Phoenix. Delizioso! We also thought it was pretty cool that the owner walks around and makes sure everything is perfect. It was!
