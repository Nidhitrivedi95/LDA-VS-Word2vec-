qZZ8VU1Bk-xCruEAZNwm6A Sainatos is in a great location, and should be a much better venue. Location doesn't cover up for "just ok" pizza, terrible acoustics, poor lighting, and bartenders who ignore you. The pizza wasn't horrible. It also wasn't the best that I've ever had. On that alone, I would have given three stars. However, the building's acoustics, along with the volume of music, make it almost impossible to hear your dinner companions speak. There is also a terrible glare that comes in from the windows, so you cannot see your companion's face if you are facing the window. The lights aren't bright enough to compensate, and there don't appear to be shades on the windows. Lastly, my friend and I sat at the bar a full 5 minutes and were never asked if we wanted a drink. We gave up. I don't see myself choosing to return to Sainatos.
