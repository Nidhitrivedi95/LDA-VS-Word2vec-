xoisXoqK68W2euSKbj5ybw Primavera is not located in the greatest spot, as though this street gets plenty of traffic, most are simply trying to get from Independence to downtown Matthews, so this little brick center does not get much attention as they roar past. Too bad, as there are several businesses within that probably deserve a look (and this is only one).

Once inside, the owners are very friendly, treating you like family almost as soon as you start visiting. Be warned, as you may end up washing dishes. Only kidding, I think. They haven't had me wash yet. But they are happy to come out and talk to you about the food, showing the care that they put into each one.

The pie here is not NY style, so if that's what you are looking for, keep moving. Instead, you get a light, flaky crust, almost pastry-like. Worth eating all on its own, and not the kind that you can chow down on. This is a meal, especially the Primavera - the vegetables on that one are piled high. In fact, they are piled so high that it's one that you're going to have to eat it with utensils (or pick the veggies up from the plate).

If you want something a little lighter - but still far from light - try the white pizza or the lasagna pizza, which you can eat with your hands, but which will definitely leave you feeling full, so you can head across the road for some bowling when you are done.
