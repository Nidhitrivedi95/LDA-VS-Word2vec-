EytLuPv39VGeQt_NJRJqYQ $8.99 for their lunch buffet which includes all you can eat pizza (multiple varieties), side salad and drink.  I can't really load up too much at lunch, so all you can eat places aren't really my style, but this is still a good deal even if you grab just two slices.

They have a unique way of taking the buffet order, almost like "the Counter" used to do it before it became "Cowfish," where you check off what you want and how many.  Easy.  Fast.  I chose BBQ chicken (good), Buffalo Chicken (ok) and Sausage (really simple but quite good).  Side salad was large with the usual ingredients.  Good, but nothing special.

Service was efficient and friendly.  In and out.  Perfect for business lunches.

The facility was MUCH larger than anticipated and definitely had a modern feel to it.  I read other Yelpers describe it as having "clean lines."  Not exactly sure what that means, but they're correct :)  Outdoor seating was surprisingly plentiful.  5 large flatscreens in the bar area.  

Summary:  Loved the facility itself, liked the food, liked the service.  I'm putting it in the lunch rotation.
