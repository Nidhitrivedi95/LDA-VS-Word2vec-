B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw I went to gusto last night with two friends. We were seated right away and promptly brought water. 

Our waitress asked us if we wanted bread to start and we said yes but it never arrived. We ordered the Bruschetta Guanciale e Taleggio and Tuscan Fries to start. Bruschetta was definitely a winner and was topped with a piece of bacon, and the fries were nicely seasoned and came with a spicy ketchup. We obviously took advantage of the $1/oz wine and ordered glasses of both the red and white between the three of us. 

For our mains I had the Fettuccine ai Funghi and my friends had the Ricotta e Spinaci Ravioli and Spaghetti Chitarra allo Scoglio. The Fettuccine was delicious with tons of mushrooms and a hint of truffle and was definitely a very healthy portion size. 

Overall experience was good, our waitress was attentive (minus forgetting the bread) and the food was delicious. The atmosphere is very rustic and warm and I will definitely be returning!
