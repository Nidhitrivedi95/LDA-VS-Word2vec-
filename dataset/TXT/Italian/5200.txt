_OAtYMzu_oOf2-HGVhrHVQ Food:
1) Spaghetti and meatballs were delicious. Pasta cooked very well. Meatballs plenty (even though cut in half to seem like more, there was still a good amount of meatball). Sauce also plentiful and delicious. Wish they gave some Parmesan cheese to top the pasta with. 5/5 stars on this item.
2) Wings. Sauce good. Got a tiny ranch dressing with 10 wings which was not bad, but it is a bit small.  They were overly fried on parts of each wing such that the meat was not soft, was tough, and hard to chew and eat.  Compared to other places, 2/5 stars on wings. But still on par with, say Native New Yorker.

Pricing:
1) Ordered online.  Walked in to pay an expected amount, about $17.  Ended up paying over $22 because they had "raised prices recently" and they did not even try to offer the online pricing that they had not gotten updated.  Not one iota of consideration to honor those prices. 0/5 stars on customer service/attempt to retain customers.

Returning?
No.  Price games, not honoring posted prices in real time on online ordering.  It's always so empty in here, are they raising prices to make up for lost profits?  Maybe going to close this location?  Raising prices is not a good way to bring in customers, especially with non expensive food like pizza, wings, pasta.
