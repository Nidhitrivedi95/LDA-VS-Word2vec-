a6SqJZTFMpSOR6Qb0STyFA Wanted to hit happy hour, but wasn't able to sit in the lounge area because my grandfather is big .... so we ate normal dinner.  I wished that they would have accomodated us on his size for happy hour prices.

The music was a bit loud even after we asked the server to turn it down a bit. I don't believe he actually did turn the music down at all.  

All dishes were nice but nothing over the top.

I'd like to try it again for happy hour, but I will not be going back for normal menu items.  A little costly and quality of food just was not matching up for me.  

There are many things on the menu to try though.
