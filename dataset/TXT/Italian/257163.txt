w2b0ve7xpuCQkwYICFIUOg Someone highly recommended this place to me so i checked it out. We were greeted at the door by the owner who gave us a little history of the place and showed us his wifes art work for sale. The waitress was very friendly and went over the specials with us. We started with a delicious artichoke, drizzled with parmesean and balsamic appetizer. I ordered the spinach linguini and my bf ordered chicken marsala; both were very delicious!  They gave me a complimentary birthday dessert and bag of fresh pasta. Everything about this place was great, the service,  the ambiance and most importantly,  the food!!
