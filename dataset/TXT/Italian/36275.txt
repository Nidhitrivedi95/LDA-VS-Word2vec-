6PqYwabO2g1r2ZB7eImOiw I got to the olive garden in the nw of las vegas. I really enjoy the warm homey feel of this one. It doesnt feel like your sitting out doors like some others. 

Of course the breadsticks are yummy. But the alfredo boat you can add to them makes them even better. What I dont get its, they often will an odd number of breadsticks when theres an even number of poeple at the table. But that isnt to big of a deal.

I used to add a ceasar salad because they were great. However they recently removed them. But wait its okay because you can have ranch on your salad. 

But heres the thing that bugs me. They added a new item, the pepperoni fettuccuni alfredo to the buy one take one. I asked for it the last visit. My server asked what item I would take home. I told him i dont want to take anything home can i just have the one I eat here. He said no. Why would you not do it? Im not asking to reduce the price, hell pick a second item and toss it. But why tell your customer they cannot try a new menu item?
Then to night on another visit this poor server is trying to explain the buy one take one and how its not just 12.99 there are up charges for different items. It sounded confusing to me.
