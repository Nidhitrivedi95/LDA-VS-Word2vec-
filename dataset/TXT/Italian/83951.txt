DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q I stopped by here to grab a quick lunch on a short layover after a 4 hour flight.  After doing a quick search on where to eat inside the secure areas at PHX, I walked by to see the place was poppin with activity, and I could see people at the tables enjoying some good looking sandwiches.  What drew me in though was the alluring case pastries!  This is one of those times I wish could just pack boxes of food into my carry on luggage.  They also make pizza!!

Anyway, I got myself the Cubano sandwich...delicious!  It had a good balance of ham, pickle, cheese and the right level of toast on the bread.  Service was pretty quick considering how busy the place was especially on a prime travel day (Friday afternoon, was 5th in line to order, I was in and out in maybe 5-6 minutes...Pro tip: they have multiple registers open, look around and don't get stuck in the longer line).  Prices were about on par with other airports.

I also got a cookie for the gf picking me up at my destination.  Ate some of that, and now I wish I had gotten one for myself!
