k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ I found this gem about 2 months ago and fell in LOVE!  Don't ask me how or why it took me so long to find this place.. but when I did I was in food heaven!! 

The meat, cheese and bread board was my new addiction.. The fresh basil was a delightful compliment to the meat and cheese..  I ordered this each time we went there.. We found ourselves going x2 a week for a while! The sausage, pepperoni and basil  pizza was the best! Again, once I tried it I was hooked!!  YUMMY..  

AND then it happened... 
..  I initially passed it off as maybe one of the waiters was having a bad day but then it happened 3 more times within a 2 month span.. Coincidence? Not likely.. Something has happened there.. Most of the wait staff is just plain unhappy and unfriendly.. 

To the Owners: 
If you continue down this path you will lose your customer base..  You just lost me..
