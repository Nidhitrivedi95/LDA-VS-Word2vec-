gjATEWAllTfxfxhGqJ93sQ Had a pizza and salad in in 2 separate visits.  The food was good.  Value was fair given it is a tourist area.  Indoor-outdoor seating.  The staff over all was nice but the first time we we were they they would not serve just a beer even though we were going to came back later for dinner.  Said that was the law but not so sure about that.  Still wound up going for dinner and the pizza was pretty good.  Next night got the salad.  It was pretty good also.  I give high marks for fast carry out.
