NFHlMOEyVsbqY_VQNJFafQ My thoughts on this place are as follows,
The service was kind of slow, but this was probably due to the large parties that came in and being short staffed. The live music was nice, it got a little loud to where you had to shout, to be heard.
My husband and I ordered:
the calamari fritti- it was good would be better if it wasn't cold.
Ceasar Salad- the croutons were really good, the lettuce was bitter and had wilted 
The pizza: actually pretty good, very similar to pizza in Italy. 
The linguine with meatballs: was ok, I've had better.



Overall I was satisfied. Was I blown away? No.
I will order pizza and pick it up next time, BC the pizza was good.
