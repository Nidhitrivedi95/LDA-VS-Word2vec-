qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA I have been here a couple times now and this might be my favorite Postino's location. The food, drinks and atmosphere are always great at any of the locations. However, the vibe here is great and if I lived out in the East Valley, I would be there at least twice a week. They need to open one up on the west side now!
