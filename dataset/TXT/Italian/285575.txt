zfDBAyCBPwvcK7ttj2f9sQ The worst resto experience I can think of!! My boyfriend called ahead of time to order wings. When I went to pick them up I was the only one at the counter with no one else at the resto. The two guys were just cracking jokes not paying attention. Eventually one looked my way and waved a box at me which were my wings. I opened the box in front of him and noticed just dry breaded wings in a box without parchment paper, when we ordered honey garlic. He went onto charge me for honey garlic dipping sauce. This is a franchise and there are rules to follow as a franchisor. It has always been that when you want dipping sauce for pizza OR when you want extra sauce you pay. You don't pay for dry wings and pay for sauce on the side especially when you ask for them tossed. The best part .... When I made a complaint to customer service, the location told them that I didn't pick up the wings and went on TO CRANK CALL me twice!! Get a life losers and learn to run an establishment!
