pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg Just came back from a huge meal at this fine establishment. This was our first main meal in Vegas and might I say it was the best. Not sure if anything could top that. The executive chefs Michael and Jeff even came out to the table as we were there with someone who knew them personally. We took our servers recommendations as we had never been there before. Went with the Carmine's salad to start, followed by cheese ravioli with a vodka sauce, and the lemon chicken with a caper sauce. DELICIOUS!!!!

The dessert was fantastic! We had the Titanic which was gigantic! This thick brownie consistency bottom, topped with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and then 3 scoops of chocolate ice cream. Bananas, chocolate cookie type things. AWESOME! We were so full by that time that we did not eat but just a few bites, but what we did eat was amazing!
Would DEFINITELY return here on my next trip to Vegas!
