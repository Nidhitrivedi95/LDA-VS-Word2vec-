Nqs4_gT6nKyeTOJ_rgu1mg Can't believe there is not a review of Frankie's in North Olmsted.  As a past Ohio resident I've been coming here since 1981 and it has always been a family staple!  Their pizza's are amazing and the sauce is fantastic.  The cheese they use is sooo tasty.  I am vegetarian now, and even just a plain cheese pizza is amazing.  When I was a carnivore, I always got a pepperoni pizza and it was also dynamite!  If you go, you must get the Frankie's House Salad, which is made up of lettuce (unfortunately it is iceberg, wish they would use romaine)  Frankie's homemade dressing and a pile of cheese on top!  I know pizza and salad may be a weird combo, but I assure you it is not!  Also my girlfriend is vegan and she is also able to eat here.  She gets the angel hair pasta with spicy marinara sauce.  Just ask them to make it vegan, not sure if it is on the menu or not?  It is somewhat pricey to eat here, but it is well worth the expense!  The taste says it all!!  Living in Chicago now makes me wish I had a Frankie's here.
