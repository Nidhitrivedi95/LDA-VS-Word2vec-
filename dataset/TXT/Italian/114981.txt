GnPXUkEvX5M0YR_PVGhWgg I hate to give bad reviews, but maybe the owners will read this and consider making some changes. It smells terrible in there. Pizza is supposed to smell good and it just smells like hot garbage in there. The ice cream was freezer burned. It is not hard to make ice cream good, especially if it's not made on the premises. I will say, however, the staff has always been very nice and they have ample outdoor seating.
