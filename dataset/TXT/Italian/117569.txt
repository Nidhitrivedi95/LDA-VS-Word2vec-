gyDTYm_NDWXEHBPGnL-oRQ really love the mac n' cheese with meatballs. almost too rich, but the texture of the (pork?) meat provides a nice contrast to the pasta & cheese. portion size is fine for any normal sized society. only gets (a somewhat inflated) 2 stars cause i'd rather just say no to their 'asian' dishes than be disappointed.
