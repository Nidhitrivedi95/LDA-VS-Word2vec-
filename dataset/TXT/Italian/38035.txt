7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ Got this place for takeout, I've never dined in but the pick up side of the restaurant is pretty cool. They have a large selection of wine and other things. 

I got the Gladiator pizza, added with free garlic and Fresno chilies! this pizza will leave you chanting, "MAXIMUS! MAXIMUS! MAXIMUS!" After you eat it! It was delicious. I wish they had a thick crust pizza because that's my thing! 

The interior is nice and I think this could be a good second or third date locale to grab a pizza!
