ARWLV46iIa3Dvt1y8-SPpA After a horrid experience the night before at the local ABC (fake Italian restaurant), Giuseppe's restaurant was an enjoyable contrast which left me giddy.

I ordered Eggplant Rollatini with garlic bread and fresh made pasta with the ribs parmigiana and it was perfect!

My date enjoyed the Cioppino with mixed seafood. Everything was exceptionally fresh and well seasoned and in very large portions.

The Tiramisu was heavenly. Yum!

I will return to Giuseppe next time I'm in town.

I hope that other restaurant owners in the area will sample this menu and use it as an example of proper food and service. 

B+
