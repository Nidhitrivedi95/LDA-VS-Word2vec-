pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw We were at Pizzaria Bianco on Sunday afternoon...wait was not too bad. I always wanted to go there and was happy to have the chance. We got seated and ordered, pizza's were good, but I thought a bit pricey...could overcome that, the ingredients were very fresh and good.

But....the service was something else! Started out OK, but when were were trying to finish our meal the server kept constantly coming and taking away our plates as she thought each person was finished....whether you were or not....the crust is great and some of us wanted to drizzle the olive oil on it, but we did not get the chance; the plates and the olive oil were whisked off the table in flash, no chance to dawdle! She even took the flatware from my friend WHILE she was finishing her plate! That was the last straw....I know you have to turn tables, but this was ridiculous. 

We will not return, not a good feeling, not a pleasant experience. I have had pizza just as good elsewhere in the Valley and had a much nicer experience and treatment...I did not know this was a fast food restaurant :(
