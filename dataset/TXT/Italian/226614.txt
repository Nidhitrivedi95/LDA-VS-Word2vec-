ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag I have been looking for a good wood fired pizza place in Cleveland for awhile.  I tried Vero Bistro last night and was happily surprised!  The ingredients tasted fresh and delicious.  I had the salami pizza and the fresh taste of the tomato sauce stood out and really was wonderful with the occasional bite of salty, cured meat.  Always a fan of an affogato espresso and gelato, I had an espresso with gelato.  It tasted great but it seemed that their selection of gelato flavours was a little narrow, and it looked slightly soupy in the display freezer.  But the taste was great!
