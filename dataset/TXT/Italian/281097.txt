yrZrnWdBR4pE21vcgv8KHw Lil Baci was a really nice little restaurant around Yonge and Davisville. Our vegetarian friend brought us here.
I had the tonno e fagioli salad for appetizer ($15) and the rigatoni with pork and beef ragu ($20). Both were delicious.
Our server was very friendly and helpful.  
We ordered bread and there was olive oil on the table but no other condiments. Our server brought us some balsamic vinegar when we asked. There was no parmesan or pepper but the food really didn't need it. The pasta was so good, I would definitely visit again.
Our friends ordered some vegetarian dishes. I tried a bite of their mushroom pizza and it was very good but I liked my pasta better.
The price is on the higher side of my budget but the portions were the perfect size and the food and atmosphere were great. I would definitely recommend bringing a date here.
