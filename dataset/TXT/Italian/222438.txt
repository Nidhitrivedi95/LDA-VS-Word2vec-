sHnN3JliwVWvGX76Odmlbw Loved this restaurant - felt right at home and loved how the owner was able to squeeze us in and be so nice about. The food was delicious - sooo fresh, I loved it. I had the cheese plate, which I would recommend, and the pastas were fantastic. They tasted as if they JUST made them in the back. 

Great atmosphere - very laid back and felt as if I was just relaxing at a friend's place.  Highly recommended.
