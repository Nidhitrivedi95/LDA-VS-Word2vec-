VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w *This review is for the Nightclub/bar area* 

It's 1230am and my group and I just got kicked out of Tao. Ok, so we weren't kicked out of Tao, but we didn't exactly get in. Ok, so we got in, but we didn't go in. Long story. 

Anyways, after Tao didn't exactly pan out.....one of the girls mentioned LAVO. We walked over to the other side of the Venetian to where LAVO was located. I was pleasantly surprised when I didn't see a line outside. (Why does that make me happy? I must be getting old.) We walked upstairs through a corridor of old Italian designed sinks to the dance area, where the club was located. 

At 1am - the club area was so crowded. There was no place for nine girls trying to celebrate a bachelorette party to dance around and make the bride to be do some tricks! The music and mix was great, but we opted the chill in the bar area down stairs. We chilled in the bar area, which had an equally good mix of music, wasn't too crowded. The decor was pretty nice. The crowd was also a little older than the groups hanging out upstairs. (God, I'm old....why does that make me feel better.) Plus the staff did let us chill in the reserved areas of the bar area. There was no one there and we were ordering drinks, so win, win! 

If I was just judging the club - I would only give it 2.0 stars. If I was only judging the Bar, I'd give it 4.0 stars. Let's do an average of 3.0.
