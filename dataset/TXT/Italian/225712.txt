Joanne makes an amazing cold, dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. She couldn't be sweeter. 

Paul is the entertainment director and plays the drums while they belt out Sinatra and Deano hits. He's dapper and quick with a smile. 

If you're looking for classic, old school Las Vegas this is it.
