fhcILBrz9r2vs8Y3l52hbg Funny story. My husband and I went in one day initially for lunch. We sat down and looked at the menu. It was a Sunday, so from what we saw the lunch type meals were not available. The bread bar was not open at this time either. The place was pretty much dead. We really didn't feel like having a full meal dinner-style so we left without ordering, but only to go back that same night for dinner! 

There are plenty of options that are interesting and delicious for DINNER, but I would not advise that you visit this resto for lunch on the weekend during the daytime, unless you are looking for dinner during the day. They serve breakfast I believe on the weekends and I have a feeling it's really good but we haven't been there for breakfast yet. 

The bread bar is a cool concept but it is only sliced bread that is offered which looks bizarre and renders you slightly disappointed. Assorted buns and rolls or some different types of bread would really make it great. The food was quite good I have to say, my husband was happy too. His steak was slightly over-cooked though. He asked for Medium-Rare but it was more Medium-Well. One other thing, the music was good but much TOO LOUD. 

Their birthday policy is applicable the day before, the day of, as well as the day after your birthday and you get your age discounted off your meal. Sunday was the day after my husband's birthday so he got 39% off his main meal. To take advantage of this be sure to bring ID because they do ask for it.
