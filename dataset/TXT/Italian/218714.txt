s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q Food and service were just OK.  There are definitely better choices for Italian fare on the Strip.  My mushroom triangoli was warm, but not piping hot as I was hoping for.   The "Spumoni" dessert had a funky texture to it.  If you're at the Tropicana, go across the walkway & eat at Biscayne instead.
