IkLAUX7lZIWqE9_YC66SRw Enjoyed a solid lunch and had the place to myself as nearly everybody had cleared out of the restaurant by 1:30pm. The slices of pizza were looking a bit lame though at that time of day, so I opted for a seat and table service. They have an all day Happy Hour menu and a free order of four knots for yelp check-in. I did enjoy the knots which were drenched in garlic and had a great marinara sauce for dipping. The main course was the $8.95 eggplant parmesan hero and this was clearly done NY style. The cutlets were nicely breaded and had a good amount of mozzarella cheese and that french bread was really good bread. There was a guy with a Yankees cap cooking in the back, so I knew I was among friends and people who can cook this kind of food properly....on this day at least.
