nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A We had Thanksgiving dinner for four at Buddy V's Ristorante.  According to our internet search for top Las Vegas restaurants for Thanksgiving dinner 2015, Buddy V's was showing a delicious menu including a squash soup to start and a main plate, all for $28/person.  When we arrived, it was $10 for soup and $29 for the main plate.  They explained that somehow, it was the 2014 menu and pricing showing online.  The soup arrived and it was way too sweet.  It should have been served as dessert, not an appetizer.  I barely had three spoonfuls and when  they took it away, they didn't even ask if it was ok.  The main course arrived and it was tasty, but cold.  We sent it back and asked for it to be hot.  When the second plate arrived 10 minutes or so later, it was still cold.  We hoped that the third time would be a charm, but it wasn't.  Half the plate was hot, half was cold.  I'm sure they must have microwaved it.  The really scary thing was that half the turkey and sausage was gone, so I'm still wondering if they served me my plate or someone else's plate.  We spent over $250 for four with a $40 bottle of wine, before tip, and were tremendously disappointed with the service, and the fact that they're incapable of serving hot food, despite several attempts.  The flavor was good, but that is not sufficient to give them our business a second time.
