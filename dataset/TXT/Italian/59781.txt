AuIiqDeL65kczmiFSkAWrA This Maggiano's location fits the bill! This is one of numerous locations that I've visited and it was packed with patrons. I snagged some space at the bar and got a beer. The service was great considering the number of drink orders coming to the window! 

Save yourself some time and order the Rigatoni D or Mushroom and Veal ravioli's. You can't go wrong with either. 

This Maggiano's should be here to stay, great location in South Park.
