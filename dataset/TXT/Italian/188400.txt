OwYpVa-JnVjfEz4iVZk3ZQ My birthday dinner this evening was terrific thanks to excellent service and good food. Our server was very fast and attentive to our needs, never letting our drinks go down and even giving me a special treat of ice cream with a candle, and rounding up the entire serving crew to sing with my family..on top of that he presented me with a cute birthday card signed by all of them. This is something I have never seen. I would say that our server Derek  was the best I have ever had in a restaurant, and I hope this prompts some recognition for his excellence. If there were 10 stars I would give that to him....Thanks for the great birthday....
