FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Love absolutely everything about this place. Incredibly friendly staff, impeccable service, great ambiance and delicious food. We brought our 95 lb. Pitbull thinking we would have to tie her up outside the patio - not only did they seat us in a more private corner so she could walk around a bit, but they were so sweet to her and kept refilling her water bowl. All the waitresses were so sweet and attentive. 

The food is SO good. I didn't expect much since their menu seemed limited, but the Bruschetta Board and Butcher's Block was more than enough (and I'm a nonstop eater).  My favorite was by far the Fig & Ricotta. 

By far our new favorite place on Phoenix. Wish they had one where we are in LA!!
