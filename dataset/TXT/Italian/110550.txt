G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q This was my second attempt to love Giadas restuarant and it was even more disappointing than the first 3 years ago. After all the bad reviews of charging up to $35 or more for 1\2 cup of pasta hasn't changed.  I ordered the tortellini with asparagus and artichokes. With the few items on my plate to make up the entire dish I thought I only had a couple tortellini.  When I questioned the waiter about it, he proceeded to pick up my spoon touching my plate saying "there's a tortellini, there's a tortilini, there's a tortellini...ok sorry there were 5 dime size tortellinis that looked to me like the 1/2 small tomato that was in the dish..I found that way of answering to be a bit rude.  (He did offer to make me another dish, which I declined but he insisted and did not charge).  We also ordered the "smashed" lemon potatoes which I had my first visit and was very disappointed to find they were no longer smashed lemon potatoes, but roasted fingerlings w/Parmesan cheese.  When I asked the waiter about the potoes he said they were the same...please...I loved them so much the first time I looked up Giadas recipe and made them myself..this was not the same dish. The desert man came by with his cart, he deliberately bent over to one of the people in our party to say "do you always look like your mad after eating".then walked away and never came back...who does that!!!!  I was hoping for a redemption dinner from my first expierence, but I won't be back and won't be recommending this resturant. If I'm going to pay these expensive prices I expect an amazing dish, one that exudes the talents of a master chef...this was less appetizing than the family Italian resturant we might frequent on a causal night.
