KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ We arrived on a Saturday night with a group of five. We asked to have a seat on the patio and they said they are only serving inside at the moment at 7:30pm... It was extremely dark in here to the point that another table was using the light on their phone to see the menu. The decor is a bit tacky with plates that look like they are 40 years old. My silverware was dirty and my plate had a noticeable chip in it. Out of the 100's of pictures on the wall I would make a guess to say that around 90% of them were crooked.

Staff: The hostess and waiter were friendly and attentive. None of our bread plates were cleared from the table the whole time we were there. The manager sat down at everyones table but ours. He was earnest with other guests explaining the menu but never once even acknowledged us. Being as we had the largest group in the room and one open seat he could of at least made an attempt. One of the waiters in a red vest was visibly drunk or on some type of drug. He was not able to walk straight and was smiling so hard while staring over our table it was extremely uncomfortable. An old creepy camera guy was walking around the room while hugging his camera?.. One of the staff was throwing a crap ton of silverware in a drawer which was obviously loud and disruptive with no consideration whatsoever. 

Food: The food is average and costs about $40 a plate. We were going to get a bottle of wine but once I saw that a $30 bottle was marked up at $80+ we passed. I ordered filet mignon and asked for it medium rare. It came out well done.

Conclusion: Pass. This is Vegas.. There are a lot better places for the price and service we received.
