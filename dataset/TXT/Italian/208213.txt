QnTguWLRKRK_reQ__8k7yw Ordered takeout here during a recent overnight stay in town. The menu isn't too extensive -- pizzas, salads, and "do-whiches" which are basically sandwiches made with pizza crust bread. The menu shows options of toppings and salad fixings so you can customize your own pizza or salad but also lists "favorites" that are pre-set options. 

My husband and I both opted for do-whiches. I had the Veggie that included roasted vegetables with mozzarella and pesto mayo and my husband ordered the Italian. They had me at pesto mayo, so I ended up loving everything about my sandwich. Fresh ingredients and a really tasty combo. Do Wood-Fired was a little far from our hotel so by the time my husband got back from picking it up, the bottom piece of bread had gotten a little soggy and the bread was only warm for a little while, but it was still good, even that way (this is obviously not something they can control -- I'm just noting that even under less than ideal conditions, I still think it was great). They're probably unbeatable as an eat-in item. Fun spin on a sandwich!

As I said, we ordered takeout so I can't speak too much to the service, but the woman I spoke with on the phone was polite and efficient and our order was ready on time.

We'll be passing back through again soon and I can't wait for another do-which!
