jluEI1ZDQDeJlbl-M3YH3Q Worst experience ever. Made reservations for winterlicious in advance. On the day of they claimed that they dont do reservations. Horrible service. Washroom is beyond ghetto, looks like a service stop washroom. Washroom smelled so bad. Only 1 out of 5 washrooms worked the rest were flooded. Food is not that great. There was a fly in my sisters water. Save your money. Go somewhere else.
