Tgc2dTcE1xOey2OUt_PvXA The service was horrible! I had to ask for everything, the server forgot to put our appetizer in, it was only when I asked her when it would be out she realized she never put it in. The order was given at the same time, not sure what her deal was. It took 10 mins to get a kid's milk, a diet pepsi, and an ice water. 

On a positive note, the food after waiting 60 minutes for it was outstanding! I had the shrimp scampi and my kiddo received pizza. 

Maybe next time we will just place an order and take it home to eat.
