hODnmsq1kK6eA0VLbFQOVw Bravo was a solid three stars for lunch.  We were seated right away, our service was prompt and food was good. Coming from an Italian family where "you don't eat red sauce out", I can't vouch for any pastas.  I ordered the Bravo! chop salad and a chicken, bacon spinach flatbread (which should be called hot spinach artichoke dip with chicken).  It was really rich and the portion was a monster (I only ate half).  I left full and had dinner for later.  It's a solid.
