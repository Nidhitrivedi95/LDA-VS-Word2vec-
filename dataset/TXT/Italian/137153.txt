j1xqz2w3wjVpvxYJi3t5IQ We had a team dinner with someone from out of town and had to find somewhere "near the office" to go. Well, if you're in the area you know the options are mostly chains, not a fan. Someone suggested Ciro's and we were all able to agree on it.

We had 6:00 reservations and I was surprised how busy it was in there. There must have been some kind of happy hour/mixer in the bar area, it was packed. Who knew!

Overall the service was stellar! We had someone extra joining us so they added an extra table to our table, no problem. Our waiter made recommendations and checked on us the perfect amount - I wish I remembered his name to give him a shout out, he was great. They were also really accommodating about special requests on people's orders - and everything came out right. 

The menu is huge - ranging from traditional hearty Italian (chicken parm) to lighter healthy fare (grilled salmon salad). Everyone seemed happy with their meals, unusual that no one has an issue when there are 9 people.

The table shared the Calamari, wow, great reco from the waiter! Just lightly battered and fried and very fresh (not chewy like it was frozen) yum! I tried the Chicken Lucia - sautéed chicken in a white wine sauce with artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes. Really delicious.

I will definitely stop by Ciro's again if another work dinner pops up. Impressed!
