XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q I had a terrible experience here and given the little time I spent inside, I will keep this review short and sweet.  What makes this visit so frustrating to me is that I was ignored.  I walked in seeing that the restaurant was busy on a Saturday afternoon.  I was seated quickly in what seemed to be the busiest part of the restaurant with two large parties around me.  I saw server after server brigning salad, bread sticks and sauce to all of the tables while all walked past me without so much as a look.  Then I saw a family come in, get seated, and have their drink orders taken right away.  Meanwhile I have been in here for nearly 10 minutes and I have not seen a server or anybody for that matter who would take my drink order.  That is when I stormed out and told the host up front that I had not even been acknowledged.  He asked if I would like to speak to a manager but I chose not to.  I just wanted to leave.  I went to a different Olive Garden and received superb service there.  Not to mention a good meal.
