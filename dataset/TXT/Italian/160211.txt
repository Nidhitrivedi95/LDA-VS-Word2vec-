LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw We ordered many things, but one thing that really bothered me is we had a 10 year old sitting at the table who really wanted dough.  I had to ask the server for dough.  She brought some really hard dough to the table and he could barely pull it apart.  It wasn't even on a platter.  I feel like it was old dough from another table.  We also ordered the zany ziti with the big rig sauce.   It came with NO big rig sauce, so we decided we would be nice and not say anything and order it on the side.  It never came.  We mentioned it, and the server told us she put it in.  It came as she was boxing our stuff up.  We didn't eat it because of this.  But she told us we could take it home, and she CHARGED us for it!!! We could not believe it.  I love this Oreganos, but the server took no responsibility for this issue, and she took complete advantage of us as nice customers.  I worked in the service industry for 5 years, and I would have totally comped it.
