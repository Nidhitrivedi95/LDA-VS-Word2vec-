=====================

Four stars is a great restaurant for me, but my experience here was truly worth five. We came here for my husband's birthday recently. There was nothing that I wish would have been done differently.

One of the most noticeable things was that every single person we had an interaction with on staff was so friendly. It's clear there is a dedication to customer service there.

We went on a Friday evening, made a reservation on Open Table, and although it wasn't completely full (no one was using the tables outside of the entrance), the back was fairly full. We did not feel cramped on other diners, though.

Our waiter was patient and attentive, suggesting but not pushing complimentary dishes to what we were ordering. He smiled when we said we HAD to try the meatballs! What blows my mind is how quickly the food came out. I truly don't care how it was prepared (I mean, of course I do), but it was LIGHTNING QUICK. We honestly thought it was for the table next to us. The runner who brought our food out made light of his job and made us chuckle by asking us, "Would you like some cheese on your cheese?" (Parmesan)

My husband had a full belly and loved all our choices: Beef Lasagna, Eggplant Parm, Ricotta Shells, MEATBALLS, Cabernet. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY THE MEATBALLS YOU PROBABLY HATE PUPPIES, TOO, DON'T YOU?! Wonderfully delightful. All these choices made for full bellies for two, for reference.

Next on my list: To visit again and try one of their desserts. We were just too full!
