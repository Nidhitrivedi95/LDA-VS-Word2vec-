zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g I shared the meatball sliders one afternoona few months ago. They were amazing. I loved their flavor. But then I had their pizza delivered (with BiteSquad). I ordered a half rectangle and I ordered a small regular type. I loved the thick crust square shaped pizza so much, that I order it probably once a week now to be delivered, and I don't eat pizza anywhere else. All other pizza is just, well, pizza. Their thick rectangular cut pizza is more like... Magic. Mmmmmmm... 

Eat Here!
