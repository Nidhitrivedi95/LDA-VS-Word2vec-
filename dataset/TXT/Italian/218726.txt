s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q Great inside atmosphere and good food. The service was top notch. The drinks were strong. The tables are spaced well do you don't bump into others. Our server Anthony was prompt, friendly and cordial. The host was nice.  The top chef was having her birthday and sat right behind us.

We had the calamari tempura as an appetizer. It was ok but I wouldn't get it again. If you love tempura you make like this. I enjoyed a key lime martini and my boyfriend liked the pomegranate lemonade. for my main course I really liked the seafood mix on the black squid ink pasta linguine and his salmon was good. The tiramisu for dessert was pretty good too. A bit too much cocoa powder on the top. The salad was very fresh.

I'd give five stars for service and atmosphere and four stars average for food quality.

You don't need to dress up to come here despite the fancy look.
