sKy8HkP6X-8dCKq_SzeIpw Horrible service!!!! Omg how hard is it to get napkins and the CORRECT food!!! My moms and my food came but my daughters meal didnt come until 10 minutes later. When i tried to get the waiters attention he just ignored me. My mom had to get up and basically follow him. 

Also the "music" they have outside their establishment SUCKS. Its noisy and not even real music!

I wish i could get my money back! 
Definitly not going to leave a tip...
