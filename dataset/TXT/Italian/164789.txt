LzYy9DdprXyI2zXNSP267g It took around 15 minutes for a waiter to even GREET us and introduce themselves. We weren't even told any personal favourites or specials. It's funny because I was asking my friends where our waiter was when she was actually right next to us, speaking to other customers. She even looked at me when I asked but decided to come 15 minutes later. How immature or her. The server was also very pushy and rushed us into getting our food. Speaking of food, it was TERRIBLE! Don't even bother wasting even a dollar here.
