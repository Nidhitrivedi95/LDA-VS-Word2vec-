GbcFCQp9VmgMaW_jaMAq_Q I come here with my sister for the nostalgia factor because we have great memories visiting growing up when this restaurant was in its prime. I don't think the restaurant has received any updates in the last 20 years. I love the Caesar salad dressing and the warm sourdough bread served with garlic butter. We were shocked to see when we visited last week that they sell glasses of wine for $2.50 and half carafes for $5.00. They don't list the types or brands on the menu, does it really matter at that price? Lol just pick red, white, or blush and you can get wine there cheaper than a soda at other restaurants. Get the toasted ravioli for an appetizer and keep in mind when you receive your entree that it's typical chain fare, do not expect anything more for the price you are paying. This is a great restaurant for a larger party because most tables seat 6 or more.
