Everything start to finish was excellent and this place is a must stop when you are in Montreal.  Menu is on a blackboard in French, but the waiter was great about walking us through everything.  We started with a Cauliflower appetizer and Brussels Sprouts Casino, both were great.  For dinner we had the Cheval (horse) and Duck which were excellent.  The toughest thing other than getting a reservation, was deciding what to eat, everything looked great
