pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Pizza is actually really good, but is it good enough to justify waiting +4 hours and spend close to $50/person to the wine bar next door and/or the Irish pub across, while waiting to be seated??!! Definitely NOT! Their new location on Camelback is a faster deal for sure, but the greeting hostesses and some of the waiters carry an attitude as if they are doing customers a favor by seating them or serving them! REALLY????!
