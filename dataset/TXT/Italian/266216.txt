X3-ZauIT8o2tcoBHjYUKFw Called in an order for two 16" pizzas (meat monster and Philly steak and cheese).  Arrived for pickup and lady handed me one pizza and a 12" Philly sub.  I told her I ordered the pizza which she argued with me that I specifically ordered a pizza and not the sub.  She then made the pizza while I waited.  While waiting, someone else came in to pickup a 12" Philly sub and she handed him a 6" instead.  He told her he specifically ordered a 12". She apologized and said to keep it and she would deliver a 12". The first reaction if a business should not be to accuse a customer of being wrong. Rather  fix the problem. When leaving she did apologize which was appreciated. Overall the pizza was thin,chewy, not greasy which is a plus, and lacked topping volume and cheese.  Meats were crumbled on top and this. After waiting for the Philly the meat pizza was cool from sitting. It seems no one in the south hills can make a decent hearty authentic gourmet Italian pizza.  It seems they all copy each other and the only difference is the business name and location. Pepperoni's had a pretty decent pizza but unfortunately the went out of business.
