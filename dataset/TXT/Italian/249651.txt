vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw We have been in the Phoenix area for a couple years and I have wanted to try Oregano's for quite some time but we are never close to one. We have been watching the location in Goodyear being built and I couldn't wait any longer so we drove to Glendale specifically to eat here. I am happy to say that our experience totally exceeded our expectations. 
We had a bit of a wait when we arrived around 4pm. I was surprised at how busy it was at that time of day. I was hopeful that was a good sign. 
Once we were seated we were greeted by our awesome server Jeff. He was very welcoming and gave us some great suggestions. We ordered garlic cheese bread for our appetizer, pepperoni and olive pan style pizza and the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream for dessert. 
I honestly could have just had the garlic cheese bread and been totally satisfied. It was delicious and tasted so fresh. The pizza was amazing! I can't wait to try more of their pies! The dessert was soooo good. Even though I was full I couldn't resist the dessert. 
On top of the delicious food our server Jeff was fantastic. He could not have been any more friendly or attentive. If you decide to stop in ask for him and I am sure you will be delighted. I can't wait for the Goodyear location to open and I hope the service is as good as it was at this location.
