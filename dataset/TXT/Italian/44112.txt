Pizza: thin crispy crust, but they were dripping a bit too liberally with oil. Flavour was good, if a bit salty. Priced about $12-16 I believe.
Gelato: very nice. The dark chocolate sorbet was exquisite (the best chocolate frozen dessert I've ever had), and I also really enjoyed the Bailey's flavour. However, their pistachio&almond gelato were a bit too oily.
Food vs price: 4/5

Servers were ok, but it was busy so I can't judge. It's a nice, sunny space though, and the manager is very sweet. 
Service and ambiance: 4/5

I will come to kick back with friends on happy summer days.
