q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Excellent place to go on a date. Food is a little pricey but well worth it. I had the Chicken Alfredo and it was the best Alfredo sauce i have ever had. Plus if you go on tues it two for one. Service was extremely slow but was made up for by good live music. Make sure you make a reservation.
