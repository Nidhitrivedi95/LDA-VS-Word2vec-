hh-N1r9O1JpvzGw1mp0bKw Great little place to frequent if in Vegas and need some great food and good on your spending budget. I had the Born on the Bayou (ok Jambalaya) and it was spot on from what I get in Louisiana.  The Chef will make it as spicy as you like it. While here we talked to him and he was friendly and happy to make sure we had a please take experience. 

One thing for sure, I will definitely be back here to try out the other great items in the menu.
