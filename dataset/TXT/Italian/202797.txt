q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ For me to be giving this place 5 stars, it's gotta be good.  A) Because I don't give out 5 stars very often and B) Because I'm not the hugest Italian food fan.  My friends from San Diego were in town and wanted to go here, so I obliged.  So glad I did!  The place is a dark, gangster like joint where they serve some amazing food.  I wanted the ravioli, but they were out, so I had their special - swordfish.  The best swordfish I've ever had along with the best risotto I've ever had.  Red sangria packed a delicious punch, too.  All of the salads were amazing as well -- how can you blow me away with a salad?  All in all, a great experience, and a friendly staff as well.  If you go, ake sure you go on restaurant.com first and buy a gift certificate at a discount!
