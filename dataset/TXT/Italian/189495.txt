The sauce is amazing. You can taste the delicious basil.
There is real real bacon in the Cesar salad...very yummy.

They unfortunately do not have a drink menu. So it's either older style alcohol choices to make a drink with, pop, or bottled water. I am against bottled water so that was disappointing. 

However after giving it a second try, the tasty pizza has made up for the disappointment I had previously left this place with.   
I am now a fan.

Thank you for the authentic Italian pizza
