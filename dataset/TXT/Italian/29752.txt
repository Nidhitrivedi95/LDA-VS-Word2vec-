5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g I will be honest, I thought this place would be better than it actually was.  I had the half chicken, which I had heard was a must try.  It was a must not order again though.  It is not that the chicken was really bad, it just really lacked any flavor was was not very weel cooked.  It was that... "Is this done?" type of pink.

When you walk in the place looks great and I was hoping for more than undercooked food and horribly slow service.
