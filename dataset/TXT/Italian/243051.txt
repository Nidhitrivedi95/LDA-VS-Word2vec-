uOJ87zqbU1MtShCSHDkiyw I'm always one to give my god honest opinion, so here it is..

Upon arrival to Va Bene, we were greeted by a lovely hostess who was more than helpful confirming our reservation and seating us.  A shorter italian man filled our waters immediately and blessed us with the most amazing bread and butter.  Kudos to this guy, his service was the most superior.  Then we met our waiter, he didn't seem to have a ton of knowledge of the menu, specials, or wine.  I asked for a sweet white (moscato) and it took him a minute to process, nevertheless, we continued forward.  We ordered calamari for the table, and it was pretty tasty.  I had the gnocci alla vodka and my partner had the shrimp alfredo.  My dish was less than satisfying, too much tomato and not enough parmesan.  After it was all said and done, we had plates stacked on the table so I didn't feel right ordering desert because I didn't feel like holding the plate.

Work on your service and it'll make up for the food :)
