m6rffQy85HUq82DjLq-YJg Outstanding food, service and decor. Owner Mike was our server. Calamari was fresh cut strips, lightly breaded. No tentacles or frozen stuff, not over cooked. My dad had Alfredo with sausage which was all home made, great flavors. I had chicken Parmesan sandwich. Once again great flavor, lightly breaded topped with bruschetta and served on very soft roll. Will definitely go back when I return to AZ.
