G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q We dined at Giada last night. Had a lovely table in the garden area overlooking the strip. Though we had reservations when we arrived that the hostess told us it would be about 10 min. Not complaining,  just want to make you aware as the bar is very crowdedand the space is not conducive to stand around the bar. Too much traffic from the kitchen. One thing I really liked is there is a free old fashioned photo booth in the reception area though the printer was not working so the only option is to email or post the photo. Strike two.
Cliff was our  waiter and was excellent. He was very professional and courteous. He even brought us a complimentary aperitif we had inquired about when he noticed we were waiting an exceptionally long time for the sommelier to bring the bottle of Rombauer Chardonnay we ordered. Plus one for Cliff -3 for the rest.
To add to this without being ridiculously lengthy here. ..we waited way to long for our food. It was a Wednesday night. Can't imagine how crazy this would be on a weekend. When our dinner arrived the flavors were wonderful but my shrimp was over cooked to the point of being rubbery. There were only two shrimp on a $34 plate of pasta making this even more disappointing.
Nonetheless we enjoyed our experience here and will give Giada another chance. She is really onto something and the energetic vibe is great but the place needs better kitchen management and more staff to improve quality and experience.
