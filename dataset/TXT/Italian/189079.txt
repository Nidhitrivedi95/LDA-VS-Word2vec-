OYaL_-uxBCgrE94uNQ4VCA First off there are two different Lino's location, we have only always gone to the one on Tenaya. We have been ordering from here for about 7 years. We are picky about our pizza as my husband is from NY and we have to have good dough. If you like spicy their Giardiniera sauce, (Italian condiment) is a favorite of mine. We order from here a couple of times a month.
