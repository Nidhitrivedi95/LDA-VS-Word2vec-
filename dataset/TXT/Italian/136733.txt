A simple pizza by the slice fare.  I have found the Pizza pretty good.  Last night I had a Med Salad that was pretty good, not too creative (romain lettuce, feta, banana peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes (no olives)).  

The atmosphere is nicer than a quick fast food pizza by the slice joint and they did have a wide selection of beers.
