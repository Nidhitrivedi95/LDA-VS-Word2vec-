nsw3tlB-hwz4KbPYcuaSww Novanta is a perfect example of the awesomeness of Yelp. While on a trip to Madison, Wisconsin I had a few hours to kill and was looking for some good eats. I came across Novanta and headed over here for some pizza.

It's located a little outside of the city in small cluster of other restaurants and stores. From the moment I walked in, the service was outstanding. The owner came over to introduce himself and explain how everything works. There are a list of pizza's to choose from or you can add whatever toppings you'd like. Also, the pizzas are personal size. The best part of all? All pizzas are cooked in 90 seconds due to the 900 degree wood fired oven. 

I went with the margherita pizza. Once I ordered, I had a seat and a few minutes later the pizza arrived. It was thin crust, steaming hot and delicious. It was so good in fact that I ordered another one, this time with pepperoni... Even more delicious. While I was dining on both pies, the owner stopped over to get my thoughts and see if there was anything else he could do. A true gentleman. 

I could not have been more impressed with this place. Delicious pizza and excellent service to go with it. Definitely a must try if in the Madison. Well worth the 15 minute Uber ride to get here.
