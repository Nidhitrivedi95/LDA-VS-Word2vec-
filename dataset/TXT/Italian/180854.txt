nY2oBwH3s5sKox1mERIoVQ I've been to this restaurant twice now, and don't have anything negative to say.  It's a nice place with a LOT of options at a decent price point.  The food is good, but not fantastic.  I love that you can get half fries and half salad with your meal, because although I do like feeling like I'm being healthy by getting a salad...I really love fries.  And very good portions too!  

My first time there I had a coupon, and the friend I was with was getting a tattoo a couple of doors down so it worked out just perfectly to stop in for lunch.  I had a wrap (with half fries and half salad) and he had a pasta.  Both were very tasty, and I really enjoyed their fries so I was glad I'd had the chance to try them.  It did seem like I had a much larger portion than my DC though, since his didn't come with sides, and they were about the same price.  

Last week I returned to meet a friend who had just moved into the city, and was living in the neighbourhood - she hasn't quite mastered the TTC yet and begged for something easy to find.  So I decided to give Epicure another try!  This time we both ordered burgers, me the Orleans and her the California.  Again, very good portions and good food.  I enjoyed the mango chutney and the unexpected kick it brought my burger.  I was a little disappointed that we realized at the end of our meal that there was a rooftop patio where we could have been sitting and enjoying the summer air.  Oh well, maybe next time!  

All in all, decent food at decent prices in a decent neighbourhood - a solid choice when you're looking for something cheaper but still tasty!
