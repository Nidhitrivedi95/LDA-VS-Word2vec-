j_PL_u4SWW1LoEd2dCu0Iw Of all the pizza joints I been to in the area Bambini's is by far one of the best!  Their garlic knots are amazing and they make a great pizza. Their margherita pizza is our favorite, with fresh basil on top. For dessert I have always had a cannoli and it is just like grandma made years ago.  The place is usually packed and the service is great. If you are looking for a great tasting pizza with an award winning atmosphere, then try Bambini's.

UPDATE - March 21, 2014

The food is still amazing, but the wait staff is rude and gets pissy if you ask for a plate or utensils, cheese and red pepper flakes, or a second glass of water.  They are unbearable and should not be in the service industry.  This is not just an isolated problem.  Been there 5-6 times in the last few months and have had a least 5 different employees like this.  I asked for a fork and you would have thought I just punched the waitress in the face.  Another time we had a party of 6 and asked for separate checks (3 checks), and the comment was "are you kidding me?"  No I'm not kidding its a simple process, but took her 25-minutes to do it!  Food also takes a very long time to be served.  These are some of the reason why in my opinion Bambini's rating went from a 5-star to a 3-star business.
