C63sF-wG4f1doMIMv2qvOg I want to love this place, really I do. The ingredients for the pizzas are top notch, but there are two things that bother me: 1) the crust gets too sodden in the middle and 2) not enough toppings. In regards to 2, I don't mean the amount of toppings that you'd find on an Americanized pizza, a la Pizza Hut, but with a margherita, for example, there should be a bit more cheese and certainly more basil. In addition, the last time I ate there, the basil was added before the pizza was cooked so it was charred to a crisp when served. That's not right. On the positive side, the mushroom pizza is pitch perfect and the sausage would be great, but the there needs to be more than 4 small blobs of sausage on a 12" pizza. After eating great pizza in NYC, I'd been led to believe that Cafe Porta Alba was in the ballpark. I'm really not expecting NYC quality in Madison, but so far the pizza here is still in the parking lot. I'm going to give them a few more tries and hopefully I'll be able to bump up this rating.
