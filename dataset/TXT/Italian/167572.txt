Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw Got the white pizza, garlic knots, and a cannoli when I went here. The pizza was a thin crust and had amazing flavor. The garlic knots were not as big as I had hoped but I will say the flavor was spot on and the size of them actually worked out because I wasn't too full to eat my other things. The cannoli was delicious and was perfectly crunchy and not chewy. It was expensive but
I would say it's worth it. If you want amazing pizza I would recommend this place. Also the shop has many authentic Italian goods to buy.
