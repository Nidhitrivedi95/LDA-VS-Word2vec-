mT28BMqq4HK-E6Bxr6o1PQ Food was very tasty!!  I only had the porchetta twice, both times the meat was soft, tender and flavourful!!!  I would like to try the steak panino next time.

Edited:
At the 3rd visit, I decided to try the steak one.  OMG! The steak was much better than the porchetta....I think I will stick with steak from now on!!!!
