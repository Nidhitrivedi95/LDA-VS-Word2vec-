HpgBVYnLQRRBPLxEdGe1Hg Many a time I've been accused of being a little too fancy for my own pants when suggesting me and my flat mates order a Parma-ham and Rocket pizza from Delicious Italian. Alas, I managed to dampen their mocking by presenting a freshly prepared Pizza liberally covered with the best ingredients which blows the usual 'Papa John's' or 'Dominoes' generic crappy Pizza away.

Having used to live just across the road to Delicious Italian I became a frequent customer and loved watching the friendly staff cook/assemble my pizza in front of me.
