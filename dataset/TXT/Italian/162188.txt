lNh_U1fEfxtcLRpT1RpX8g Delicious dinner last night with 6 of my friends from high school. We are planning the Avonworth Class of 1968 50th reunion. We had delicious dinners and  will be having it at Cafe Notte. I had the chicken Parmesan and it was delicious. I also had the best Caesar salad I have ever had. The service was excellent.
