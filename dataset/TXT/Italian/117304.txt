GXDRFAunLh0aRao6ERnM4A My husband and I stopped in here to grab a quick bite just to hold us over until our Cirque show was finished.  Hubs got a piece of pepperoni pizza and I got a fruit salad.  The fruit salad was good, very fresh with yummy pineapple, strawberries, blueberries, etc.  My hubby's pizza was a greasy mess!  It looked so nasty, I can't believe he ate it.  He did use several napkins to blot the grease, but that didn't seem to help.  The crust was also burned to a crisp so he almost chipped a tooth on that!  All in all, if you don't really care what you're eating, go for it.  If you want a solid piece of pizza, look elsewhere.
