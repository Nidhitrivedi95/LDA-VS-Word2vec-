BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA Where do I start? I've been coming to Spiga Cucina since shortly after they opened. Lunch, Dinner, and special events through work. All have been great experiences with amazing food. Nothing beats their house made pasta except for the service we received from Heather English. Wow...so attentive, without hovering. Exactly what I would expect from a server, but rarely find. She is proficient with the menu and her selection suggestions were right on the mark.
My suggestion to you is to try Spiga for the great food, and you'll become a regular if you ask for Heather, as she will guarantee to make your experience just that. An experience worth repeating!!!
