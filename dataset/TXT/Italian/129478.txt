I5RoKagQjGYCWgY4_fK_rQ This is the closest my husband and I have come to NYC pizza in Vegas. The crust was thin enough, but next time we may as them to make it "well done"...we like it crispier.   Great tasting sauce. Good amount of cheese and toppings.  The only thing is that, I prefer loose sausage pieces over the sliceable sausage meat.

Seems like a family owned place. The staff was very nice.  The decor is tasteful...way more inviting than other pizza joints. I like that each table has its own TV.   They don't serve alcohol.

Coming back for sure...
