yc_5xqXkGTRKlFzN7o2CQQ This place will continue to be one of my favorites. The menu changes frequently and will vary from the first to the second floor, so it's quite hard to grow bored of this restaurant. You have the pleasure of choosing depending on your craving. As expected, this place is high in demand on weekends and during summer. So be sure to reserve. For those who are vegan, don't be shy to mention it and they will accommodate. Small note, you can ask for the upstairs menu at the bottom and vice versa. *wink wink*
