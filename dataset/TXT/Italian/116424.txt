GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA My fiance and I went to this restaurant for the first time.  We are foodies and we definitely appreciate good food when we taste it.  We went straight to the bar because we are simple and want good food fast.  The bartender, I believe it was Eric, was very helpful and suggested a seafood appetizer right off the bat when i couldn't make a decision...the octopus.  Ive had Squid a la plancha, squid asian style....but this was the most tender, well seasoned dish; the most perfectly paired dish I've had in a loooooong time. For the entree, we split the pappardelle bolognese and the pasta was cooked perfectly; the sauce was delicious and well seasoned....BUT....the overall dish was too salty for my taste.  Apparently they cook the pasta in water that is supposed to taste of the sea....which individually was divine; but together with the sauce the whole dish was salt overload.  However, the cocktails that we were served were the most unique and eclectic drinks we had EVER had....no joke.  My fiance is a gourmet chef and I was a bartender that fiddled with mixology.  The whole experience was refreshing and enjoying considering its hard to go out to eat without finding something wrong with the place.  We would definitely recommend this restaurant....the price isn't too outrageous and the food/cocktails are well worth a special night out....ask the bartender Eric about Szechuan berries!
