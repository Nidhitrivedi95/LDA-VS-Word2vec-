epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ What a fabulous little restaurant!  We were in Cleveland for my open heart surgery and I picked Mia Bella for my night-before-surgery meal with my wife, parents and best friend.  We had a reservation, which I recommend because this place is hopping. We were greeted warmly and seated promptly.  All of the food was excellent, but the hit of the night was the spicy cheese tortellini with added sausage.  Two of also had the lobster ravioli, which was very good, and the meatballs are fantastic as well!  All of left fat and happy and my surgery went great the next day.  So good, in fact, that I was released from the hospital on my 4th day post-op.  Well, I probably shouldn't have, but Mia Bella was so good that the first day I felt able to, 2 days after my release, my wife and I went back.  This time we were both thrilled with the marinara and meatball combination, me on the pasta Mia Bella and her on the cheese ravioli.  We ended with the most delicious and cute little cannolis for dessert.  Now tonight, our last night in Cleveland, we decided to give another place a chance, big mistake.  After being ignored for an hour at the place down the road, guess what?  Yep, back to Mia Bella for round 3!  Once again, she did not disappoint us.  We were welcomed warmly and tonight discovered one of the best bolognese sauces we've ever had, absolutely divine I say!  So if you want great food in little Italy, make a reservation at Mia Bella, it's fantastic!
