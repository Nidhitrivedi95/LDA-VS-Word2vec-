KY8J9dIOKD2vL0jdzUiuhg The hubby and I decided to walk there for dinner this evening. We had been wanting to try it out for awhile. We sat on the patio and more immediately offered complementary sangrias.

My husband had the halibut with artichoke hearts that was on special that evening. I had the lamb chops that were on special. As an appetizer we split the fried plantains and cheese. With his dish my husband chose the yucca as his side. He came with the most delicious garlic sauce to dip them in. The sauce was also good when the fish was dipped in it. 
Totally totally worth the price we paid. And we definitely want to go back.
