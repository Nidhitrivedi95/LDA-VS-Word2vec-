h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ Very nice atmosphere when we walked in. Muted lighting ,yet was enough to see the menus. The music was low enough to be able to talk to each other. We had the specials. We had the Mezzo Sampler for an appetizer for 22.00...a little expensive but nonetheless very good. I had the the seared Shampagne Chicken with angle hair pasta in a champagne reduction and my husband had the Veal Scallopini with brandy sauce and risotto. Both meals were excellent and worth the price (22.00 and 27.00). The service by Michelle was excellent and the owner Sean came by to check on our meal/service. I did not expect to find a restaurant as good as this in a strip mall on N. Rancho, but I recommend this place very highly. My husband and I will definitely go back.
