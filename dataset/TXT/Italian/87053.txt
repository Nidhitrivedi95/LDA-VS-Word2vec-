duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ Checked into the Four Seasons on Thursday after a quick drive from So Cal.  Didn't feel like driving anymore and the front desk suggested Verandah.  They described it as Italian fare.  I had the prix fixe menu which included huge tiger prawns appetizer which was spot on delicious.  I picked the fish entree which was done correctly which was also great.  I picked the mousse desert what a way to unwind from a long drive.
