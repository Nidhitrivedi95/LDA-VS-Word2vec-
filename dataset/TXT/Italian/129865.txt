i7NqPkLgLEBApeoBsPNvyA Nonno's is a fabulous restaurant.  It has everything you would want in a nice restaurant; beautiful ambiance, excellent and friendly waitstaff, delicious food, nice sized portions and reasonable prices.

We have eaten at Nonno's many times and it is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. They graciously remember us whenever we come in for dinner.
The garden salad is inexpensive and comes with healthy greens, cucumbers, carrots and tomatoes.  The bread is yummy too.

There is an extensive and creative selection on the menu, and everything we have eaten is out of this world.  To name a few: farfalle rustico, veal parmigiano, chicken marsala.

The owner is a very special and lovely person.

I highly recommend this restaurant with 5+ stars.
