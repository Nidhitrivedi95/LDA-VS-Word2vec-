The bad: You cannot make it out in under an hour. Hopefully it is just because they are new, however each time I try to go for lunch the line is out the door. I waited once and it took almost 40 minutes. The next time I tried to order ahead online around 12:15, but received an error that due to heavy volume, my order could not be ready until 1:30 - over an hour!

Bottom line: Good food and friendly people, but not conducive to the working crowd or the Oakland lunch hour.
