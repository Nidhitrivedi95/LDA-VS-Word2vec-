0xzmIBsJQc5eUNLucFrZ0Q FABULOUS dinner!  The basil pesto that comes with the flatbread was a perfect start.  My husband and I shared the calamari, which is perenially one of our favorite appetizers, but this was particularly flavorful and the accompanying sauce was zippy without being overwhelming.  I ordered the goat cheese salad, which had plenty of fresh corn and avocado, while my husband had a caesar salad.  For our entrees, I had the sea scallops (very good) and he had the linguine with clams to which he added some shrimp.  

It was a good thing we had reservations because even on a Tuesday night, the place was packed.  The service was excellent; they were very attentive without being overbearing.

Highly recommend!
