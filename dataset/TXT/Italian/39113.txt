7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA It's almost 10pm on a Friday night & we just ordered delivery~ we were told it would be approx one hour & that's just fine bc it's worth the wait.  
You can take my word for it bc this is prob the 50th-75th? (totally guessing) time we've ordered take-out from Pizza Heaven.  One off our neighbors turned us on to PHBistro about 10.5 years ago when we moved into the 'hood.  
The employees who take your order over the phone are SO friendly and NICE ~ as are the people who deliver.  
And... oh by the way... the food is really good.  We usually get a pizza (or two-if we have friends over) ~sometimes I'll get pasta.  :)   
We've never had a bad experience here.  
***at a time when you should NOT believe every review you read on Yelp~ you CAN absolutely believe this one is real.  NO ONE paid me, I was NOT compensated in any way, nor has anyone ever asked me to write a review for PH.  After 10+ years I think it's about time I wrote one! ***
