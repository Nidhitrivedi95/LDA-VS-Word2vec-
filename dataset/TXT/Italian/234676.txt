ttRnQ4PYIuR_ptgaTT2g_A It's taken me a long time to warm up to Athens Pizza. I've had their pizza a few times before and thought it was ok.  They are the winner of the West Park pizza bake off. Some of their specialty pizzas do seem good if you're a meat eater, but I'm not.  However, when I got their veggie pizza recently, I was amazed at how many veggies they put on there!  It was LOADED.  Tons of crisp peppers, olives, onions, and tomatoes.  I could barely see the cheese.  It certainly made me feel better about eating an extra slice since there were so many veggies. As long as they keep throwing on the veggies, I'll be ordering pizza on lazy dinner nights.
