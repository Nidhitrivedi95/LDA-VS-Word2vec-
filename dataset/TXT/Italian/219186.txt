s7XVRYnDgohSDlwtta5euQ Finally reopened in new location in No frills plaza beside south side burger.
Ordered a medium house special well done. Same fresh ingredients.
Crust is great. Just the right amount of cheese.
Great service ready in less than 15 min.
Lots of parking.
Have an espresso while you wait.
Hands down best local pizza.
