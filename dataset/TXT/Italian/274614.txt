Y6ujotEhfTZd2JPZmsQ-Ow The food here is affordable, and the burger I got was gigantic. However, the burger the bun, and the french fries all lacked seasoning. The service was quick as well. However the building is in an industrial park and very run down. Overall not a bad experience and very affordable and quick for lunch. Don't go out of your way to go to it, but if you're in the area and need a quick bite this isn't a bad place to visit
