oUvqwPJkorOnYZFKRt0oEg Wow! This was the best Italian food i have ever had.  Our server Steve was amazing.  He was very attentive despite the fact that he had several large parties he was waiting on including our party of 7.  Chef Albert is amazing.  My Veal Parmigiana was cooked to perfection.  The portions were huge.  We drove from Surprise to Mesa because of what we saw on Check Please Arizona and it was way better than expected.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone.  Excellent job Baci!!
