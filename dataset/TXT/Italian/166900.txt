MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg I am always looking for good Italian places and i happen to come across one! Plantone's puts a lot of thought into their food and decor. I order the caprese salad and add prosciutto on the side. They make their own mozzarella! They make fresh pasta for their pasta of the day! Fettuccine was the pasta of day and I had it with bolognese sauce and added meatballs. The meatballs were tender and flavorful. They didn't skimp on the sauce. They just open in December and i hope they are here for awhile. Next time I am in I want to try their antipasto board.
