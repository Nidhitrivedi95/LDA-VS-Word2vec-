cOWXtCz7F9GQhPIks8gm6Q Went here with my daughter and used a Groupon that I had purchased. We went right at 5:00 and sat out on the patio. I liked the atmosphere and the Long Island Iced tea I ordered was pretty good. (For those of you that know me - I am very picky about my LIT!) I am not going to be able to give you the exact names of what we ate since the menu online is not the same menu that we had but I will try and remember what I can! We started off with an appetizer made of acorn squash and it was amazing! That and the dessert were both of our favorites. For our entrees we ordered the Salsiccia sausage pizza (with goat cheese added) and an entree made of ricotta dumplings and braised beef (Gnudi?). Both were pretty good. The desserts again were amazing. Our favorite was the Pumpkin Budino. Absolutely delicious! I was also very impressed with our server because he was spot on with all of his recommendations!
