MNTk-rTtwiKiUSBIz58Pzg Went in just for coffee  unusual choice but the nearby Costa was completely full. Noticed the cappuccino sign on one of the over window awnings so thought why not try. Coffee was taken in the bar area. Americano ordered came with a mini biscotti. Coffee taste was okay. Dark roast, bit bitter. Not skilled barista so results are probably hit or miss. If you're looking for just coffee go to Costa but as a cafe emergency stop gap contingency Frankie's is OK.
