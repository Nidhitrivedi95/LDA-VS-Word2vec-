HYhbeLznSWEl6JIYTllVUA My husband and I had wanted to try this new Chandler restaurant that moved into a spot formerly occupied by Grimaldi's. We went in and were greeted promptly by a pleasant young man who asked where we would like to sit. We chose the outside patio since the weather was nice. Our waitress came over quickly and greeted us. She showed us the happy hour menu and let us know about the reduced prices on food and drinks. I was pleased that happy hour prices were  good outside, not just in the bar area - nice. Our waitress told us about the wines by the glass and which ones she particularly liked. We ordered wine and four different bruschettas to start. The bruschetta was very good; each section is cut into three pieces - a fun item to share with wine. We also ordered a 12-inch Godfather pizza. The pizza was tasty. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. We will go back soon and try some of the entrees. We really liked sitting on the patio. There was background music, but nothing intrusive.
