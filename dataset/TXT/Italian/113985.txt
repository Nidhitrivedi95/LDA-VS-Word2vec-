gjATEWAllTfxfxhGqJ93sQ Most everyone loves great pizza but can't always agree what that is.  Il Focolaio meets most of my basic pizza must haves.

Crust that leans to the thin side but retains some thickness and texture.
Quality ingredients and a balance of sauce. 
Over 50 choices from anchovies to escargot 
Crisp, fresh and lightly dressed salads large enough for two as an accompaniment
Quickly cooked in a wood fired oven. 
A wine list that is fairly priced by the glass or bottle

In addition Il Focolaio has waiters that know what they are doing and are eager to accommodate their customers.

It can get a little to noisy inside but when everyone is talking about the great food - that's to be expected.
