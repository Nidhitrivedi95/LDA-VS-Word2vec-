We opted to stop here Saturday morning because we saw the build your own Bloody Mary bar. The service was prompt! The wait was short. The menu at least for breakfast isn't very extensive and personally I think it's overpriced. The petite flapjacks and the bacon were great the fingerlings tasted like overlooked potato wedges. The Bloody Mary bar was good but $12 per one I thought was a bit much. Maybe bacon is a southern thing but it always goes good with a Bloody Mary so I thought that should have been part of it.
