wsmVIHJEi9J_38dXx2qLKA Interesting experience with Bunky's. First trip here was AMAZING. Had Tina's Pasta and thought it was as good as pasta dishes I had in Rome. My wife had the ravioli of the day and that was also delicious. Second trip - not nearly as impressed. Particularly my wife's dish which she sent back. Seafood was freezer burned tasting and like it'd been microwaved. Haven't tried their Mediterranean yet though.
