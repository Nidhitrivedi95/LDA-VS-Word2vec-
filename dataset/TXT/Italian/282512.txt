YzMUZjUMcgI-NSGu48-nIQ While there wasn't anything terrible about my dinner here, there wasn't anything terribly memorable either. I went for a date with my boyfriend on a Monday night after purchasing a Groupon. I enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms and my rotolini, and my boyfriend liked his veal. But nothing jumped out at us as amazing. Over all, we were very glad to have purchased the groupon, because otherwise we would have been very unhappy to pay the seriously over-priced bill. The service was about the same as the food....not terrible, but lackluster.
