We only had 3 choices for dinner, and when asked if there was another vegetarian option they added a vegetable lasagna with no questions asked. I had the meat lasagna and it was excellent. They all ready had a pianist there, and he was sure to dedicate a tune to the newlyweds so they could get their first dance in. It's really a great place to check out for any meal, and for any occasion too.
