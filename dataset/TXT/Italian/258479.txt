wAw6033yHZdBaqAYDuus3w Almost every weekend, on our way to visit my in-laws, we take the longer way just to stop here for the sugar donuts and the custard tarts. These are the only things I get here. The donuts are huge, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It is not very sweet and quite addictive! We used to buy like 6 for ourselves but being deep fried dough, i imagine it can't be too good for you. *sad face* there is a version with bits of carrot in it. I will try that one next time. 
The custard tart is delicious as well. The custard is sweet and the shell is nice a flaky. I love the ones that are a bit charred on top. 

Around $8.50 for three large donuts and two custard tarts! Pretty good! 

There is lots of seating available with a coffee bar and two rooms with tables. They serve breakfast from 7 am. I haven't tried it, so I can't comment. The patrons eating in are mostly seniors
