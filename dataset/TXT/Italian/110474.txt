G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q We travel several times a year and we are no strangers to nice hotels and great food.  Overall, we had a positive experience and the food was good.  

If I could offer a constructive comment - There seems to be a conflicting style in the restaurant.  When you walk in, you see a rustic chic style, then you are greeted by a reception staff in black dresses that are to short and to tight - more like young girls on their way to a club.  And then, there is the photo booth.  On to the dining room and you have well dressed waiters trying to provide a five star experience.  To many personality styles and it presents a confusing experience.  Management should come together to provide a more consistent experience and deliver a more consistent message.
