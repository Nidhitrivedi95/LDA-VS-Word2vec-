Abruzzo has never disappointed in taste, presentation or portion of their meals over the years. The portions are very generous so expect to have some of your meal leftover for take-out (trust me, you'll want it later).

The options are endless but recurring favourites happen to be the lasagna ($13), a generous layering of soft, cheesy goodness, the panzerotto ($8), a large doughy turnover with an explosion of flavour, and, of course, the pizza ($10-20), a thinly crusted canvas of quality dough illustrated with your favourite combination of flavours. Based with tomato sauce and cheese, choose from a variety of other delicious toppings to decorate your pizza or panzerotto with for maximum satisfaction. 

My personal favourite: mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and pepperoni.

PRO TIPS: 

- Ask for chili flakes in your pizza, panzerotto etc. if you like it spicy
- Get the meat sauce and use it to dip your panzo/pizza or even to have with your lasagna!
