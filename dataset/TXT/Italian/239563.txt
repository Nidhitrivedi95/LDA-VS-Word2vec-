u9R0_pvEkl7QGPJYH3j1sg Everything here is home made. (Well restaurant made but you get the point ) sauces are delicious and not some canned  stuff you can get at any chain restaurant. Fried mozzarella as appetizer is fantastic and will ruin all other fried mozzarella for you. I have had the lasagna, osso bucco and chicken something or other entrees. Every one of them was outstanding. Their cannoli's were among the best I have had. Overall, if you are looking for a non chain that is great- this is the place for you.
