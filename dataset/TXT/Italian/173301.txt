N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg I am pretty sure this is the best pizza in Az, from Chicago I think they bring the water here from Chicago and it's traditionally served with the sauce on top of the pie. The line is usually an hour + ++ long but when you arrive at the table the ZA (short for pizza, how the cool kids do it...) is brought to the table usually within 5 minutes of sitting there.
The butter crust is out of this world and quite frankly addicting. Highly recommend this place to anyone who likes an out of this world ZA!
