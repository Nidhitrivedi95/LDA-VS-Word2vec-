kHWSO8fV0Mp-M3J-w1ma7A Great food in general.  We ate here a few times while in Edinburgh.  It was around the corner from our hotel and easy to find seating during busy evenings when we didn't make reservations.  Their pizza was so good.  It had the right amount of sauce and cheese with the perfect amount of crunch to the crust.  I have to say I was very glad I found this place our second day of visiting.
We were greeted and seated pretty quickly and our waiter was actually our waiter each time we visited, but I think that was just a fluke.  LOL.  He was spot on.  We didn't have to ask for anything for the most part.  He was there and refilling glasses, taking orders, and bringing napkins.
If you are near the Royal Mile, stop in.  I am sure you will not regret it.
