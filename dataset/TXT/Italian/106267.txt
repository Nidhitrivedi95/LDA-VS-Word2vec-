fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg Just popped my Cherryblossom tonight... what a treat.

Was greeted and seated promptly. Hostess had a side pony. Hip as ef.
Sat down and met our server as he brought waters to the table. solid.

Place felt a bit crowded but still cozy and sexy like my favorite onesie...

The spicy Korean beef plate was littered with beef. So good it made it on my shirt as well... than was taken to mouth sex Ramen cove with a big bowl of the TanTan-men... lots of heat in my body was producing at an almost swampy rate and maintained till the last drop.

Only thing i see that can improve is knock down that silly wall that divides the two different rooms for seating (more viewable space will make it seem less crowded i promise). Also unless your a Village inn or a bakery you shouldn't have a dessert display? hope that is not just me thinking that. A bit cheesy and the servers I'm sure would love the extra room for service purposes. Maybe a new expo window??

Will be back soon. Like tomorrow.
