Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg First, let me say that I grew up on Long Island with sauce on Sundays in addition to the best Italian restaurants in the US.

I've passed by this place several times and always saw the parking lot full - and having been here a year  I have yet to find a decent Italian restaurant......Walking in - I loved the decor and thought I hit the jackpot finally.........I was wrong.

I am not sure what the rave is here.  We ordered angel hair with meatballs, ravioli's with meatballs and for an appetizer fresh mozz with roasted peppers.  The sauce? VERY bland.  The meatballs tasted funky.  Like the meat they used wasn't good.  The mozz was great - but that is not saying much.  The roasted peppers came WHOLE.  It was like someone roasted the pepper and put the whole thing next to the cheese.  Any decent place would slice it julienne style.  It had way too much oregano and the skin was still on it.  I was given 2 whole loves of bread.  But for $51 bucks?  Never again.
