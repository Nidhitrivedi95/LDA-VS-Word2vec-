VutzmcU-hZt_WfgMkEuiFA The food here is very good and the service is great, too. It's not a fancy place. It's in a gas station parking lot, and used to be a donut shop years ago. The inside has been redone of course, and it's nicer than you might expect. Not formal, there are TVs on the walls, more of a great neighborhood restaurant.
