pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Pizza options are unique and anything you choose will be perfectly wood fired.  The wiseman has smoked mozzarella and smoked onion which made the onion a wonderful mild flavor.  The true champion is the fresh bread served with olive oil.  It's basically magic in your mouth.  My only gripe would be price, but for a downtown spot it's quaint and delicious. Without the complimentary bread I probably would have given Pizzeria Bianco a three based on price and lack of options for anyone picky.
