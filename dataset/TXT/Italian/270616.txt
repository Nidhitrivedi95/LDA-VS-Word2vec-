XmxRXzCFkzQK23kkHgUgLA Service was awful! After reading some wonderful reviews, I was so excited to try this place. There were only 2 other tables in the place, but our server couldn't be bothered to take out order. He sat in a corner table, talking to his friend and completely ignored us. When we got up to leave, he chased us down and claimed that he was busy doing dishes.  First, he insulted us, then completely lied to us. I will never come back here again.
