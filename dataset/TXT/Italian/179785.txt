nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A What a fun place to dine. We went for lunch. The service was amazing and fast. All employees were very nice. We ate off the lunch express menu which was more than enough. Sangria was delicious. Bloody Mary was good but a bit on spicy side. Would highly recommend this restaurant especially if looking for a place Away from casino. Loved it! Don't forget to go across the hall to Carlos bakery. Get there as soon as they open!
