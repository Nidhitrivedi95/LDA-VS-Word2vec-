4EfiNcKSsafogIhAjwv0gg I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it. The size of the food you get is a huge plus especially when added to the fact that the place has priced its stuff really well. Love the service. It's a pizza place! it really shouldn't be hard and so many places are just so badly done but Sunset is one place I love for its attentive costumer service, fast execution of orders and never an issue with anything. Been here 5 times and am now leaving a review because I feel that they deserve a shout out! As an added bonus, they accept BITCOIN! finally more businesses taking it!
