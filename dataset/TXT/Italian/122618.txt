hh-N1r9O1JpvzGw1mp0bKw WOW! That's what I have to say

Came here the other night (maybe it's been a week already? dunno) with my mom. She was worried  that because it was close to closing time they wouldn't be warmly receptive. Boy was she wrong.
The owner's are extremely friendly & nice. 
I consider this place very Bay Area-esque yet in the heart of downtown Las Vegas, YAY  
Really fresh food. 
Fresh fresh salad with absolutely KILLER homemade dressing. Completely exceeded my expectations, I want to go back & try everything on the menu. 

Can't get over how flavorful my pasta dish was, man their food is so delicious!
Lemon bar just unreal. The flavor! don't know how to describe that, you have to taste it, was much more intense in a good way than any other Ive ever tried before.
And quite big, it was twice the size of what I've seen before (that's how I got to try some because I got the chocolate cake myself. Yum, super super moist) 
Small but very clean, very cute place with absolutely GREAT food, professional, caring nice owners, good prices for really good food! 
Cant go wrong
p.s.   .   .   .   .   .   .   my mom has come here several times, she said they are ALWAYS that sweet to her, said everything she has tried is to die for & that she wishes there was one closer to her house lol ;o]
