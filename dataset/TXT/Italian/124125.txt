hODnmsq1kK6eA0VLbFQOVw My friend and I stopped at this establishment for the first time tonight after a shopping trip to Ross. 

The first thing I saw was the bathroom. No paper towels. Urinal was clogged and there was toilet paper all over the floor. Not a particularly enticing first impression. 

Moving on to dinner. I ordered a glass of Chardonnay, received my glass and there was something stuck on the glass that I had to wipe off (it was on the inside and gross). 

Now the food. The food was actually very good. Better than I expected. I had their signature pasta bowl with mushrooms. 

The only thing that deserved five stars was our waiter Lucas A. He was attentive, kind, knowledgeable, and fun. He made dining here a delight. Keep up the good work, buddy.
