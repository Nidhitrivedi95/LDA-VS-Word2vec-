5ykOWYZ44sUvu9qxD8rPeg I have always had a great experience at this understated restaurant. The first time I ate here I ordered pellegrino and I was impressed that they make their own sparkling water. This set the stage for everything being made from scratch with fresh ingredients. The gentleman who I presume to be the owner, wearing a plain white t-shirt, and the staff were all very welcoming and non pretentious. The appetizers (meatballs and veggies) and pizza (Adriana + a few extra toppings), were excellent. I have been here both on dates and with my kids (ages 5 and 7) who like to sit at the bar and watch the pizza cooking in the pit. There is a small TV that sits in the corner by the bar which is convenient if you want to see the score of a game, and much more appropriate than an obnoxious big screen on the wall.
