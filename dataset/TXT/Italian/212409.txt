r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA My fiance and two of our friends went to Defalco's for dinner tonight. I ordered the Meat Lasagna (half portion) which came with garlic bread and let me tell you..it was quite possibly the best lasagna I have ever had! The sauce was fantastic, perfectly seasoned. My fiance ordered the Pesto chicken sandwich, which I sampled. The bread was wonderful,chewy and slightly toasted, not like those terrible deflated buns at most sub shops, that they somehow manage to make shatter due to over toasting when bitten into. The bread itself was amazing here, coupled with juicy chicken and an almost floral fragrant pesto. Worth every bite! 

Our friends ordered the Vegetarian lasagna and Pasta Alfredo. The Alfredo was buttery but needed pepper, which was fine since a lot of people don't like pepper and there were salt and pepper shakers at each table so the customer could decide if they wanted it or not. I didn't have a chance to sample the veggie lasagna, but by the pace at which it was eaten I assumed it was very good. All our orders came with a side of garlic bread that was absolutely fabulous, I would come back here just for the garlic bread. 

This place is also a grocery store and so I couldn't resist but buy a jar of Puttanesca sauce and an order of tiramisu to go (which is sitting in my fridge as I type this), which I must say, sounds like a marvelous breakfast. Overall I really recommend Defalco's, they have an extensive array of wines, cheeses, meats, pasta and other products, particularly gelato. Don't miss the tubs of gelato in the freezer section in the most delectable flavors. I didn't buy any this time but definitely will the next time I go here.
