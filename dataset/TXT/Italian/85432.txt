The owners are from Palermo, Sicily and add that friendly, Italian touch to the excellent service.  They were so patient with me as I practiced my long-forgotten Italian  language with them!  It's a comfortable, very clean, relaxed atmosphere.  This was our first visit, but it has now become our go-to place for Italian cooking.
