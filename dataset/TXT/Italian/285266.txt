zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g I had the Di Fara Pizza at Dom Demarco (Round and Thin not Square) and it was incredibly similar to the actual Di Fara Pizza on Avenue J in Brooklyn, except for the ambiance which was infinitely better. We had a Cannoli for desert which was excellent!  The service was very good too.  The Pizza is excellent and I would drive to Vegas from Los Angeles to have it again!
