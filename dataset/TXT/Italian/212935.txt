r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA i might toy with the idea of maybe giving this place another shot and trying one of the pizza's or pastas...

i just was not impressed. Waited 20+ min for the sandwich and when they finally brought it out it was on white bread when i asked for wheat. So right off the bat i was peeved. i didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for a damn sandwich so i sucked it up and put my big girl panties on and ate it anyway. it was alright, honestly just another sandwich.

However they do have a considerable large choice of meats, cheese, pasta sides etc..i am a girl who likes choices. The atmosphere was also interesting as well, ya know, the whole Italian grocery store thing inside a restaurant is pretty creative.
