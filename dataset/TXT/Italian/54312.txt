aadG1TzULt-ezzUJZUSSJQ I made a last minute reservation but didn't really end up needing it... (A word of advice -- reserve over the phone rather than online if possible. The online form is not very intuitive.) That being said, it was a great experience! The décor of the store is fantastic, with a real theme, and the food is great value for the price.

The Summerlicious menu was delicious. It was simple but well done, and very reasonably priced. The perogies were a little on the under salted side but nothing a little salt can't fix. The salads were hearty and appropriately filling. The bread pudding was an incredible way to end the meal -- although a smaller portion (three small cubes of bread pudding served alongside strawberries and ice cream) -- as it was rich and soft on the inside with a crispy exterior. 

The food was served slowly with some gaps between courses -- unexpected as per my Summerlicious experiences so far -- but gave us ample time for conversation over the meal. 

Would definitely like to go back for the regular menu!
