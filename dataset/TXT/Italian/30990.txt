5nZVVPO_cYH9aQeClTP9zA This location has gotten much better over time! I like it better than when it was a fox concept! Food is always good, fresh, and high quality! In also a huge huge fan of their tea--way to go on choosing passport tea in green, red, and black varieties. Love having the chance to get a good salad (my fav is chicken and pine nuts) and a delicious green tea at a reasonable price! When you add in Costco having discounted gift cards this place is a must!
