Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A I want to like Pomo , I really do. My coworkers brought me a Pomo pizza to go. My office is only 1 mile away.When the the pizza got here it was piping hot, but the crust in the middle was under cooked. There wasn't a whole lot of flavor going on , even with the onions, roasted pepper, mushrooms and sausage. I little disappointed. I rather eat at Grazie or even sauce for that matter.
