6D4L8YpkhAh_YwaLmhoMNg So I get to go from here occasionally on my way home.... I order at the bar and have some wine while I wait with a nice male bartender.  No issues.  However, this last time I was told by the female bartender that I had to place my order at the to go counter.  Well that's fine I guess.  However, the poor to go girl is swamped.  It took 15 minutes for me to place my order.  The whole time I am standing there I make eye contact with multiple servers and two managers.   No one comes to this poor girls rescue.  The phone is ringing.  She doesn't have change.  And no help.  When I get back from placing my order... My bartender is indifferent... "Got it all figured out?" She asked.... It's too bad the staff is so apathetic about the convenience of their guests.   The servers here are 100% independent contractors.   Work on the team building and they will give great service overall!  Consistent food, uninvolved managers.
