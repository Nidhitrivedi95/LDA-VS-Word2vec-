FcXGZFrVPaKfe3wJZibfCw I had high hopes for Caffe Davio. You know where this is going to go, don't you?

It's a very casual place. You get the feeling breakfast everyday hosts a lot of regulars. Our server was not the friendliest. You know when you get one of those servers that you think hates you... for no reason other than you came into the restaurant and sat down. That was her.

I was going between the lox and cream cheese bagel and the salmon omelet. I went with the salmon omelet because I really wanted to try a side of chocolate chip pancakes, since you're allowed to order a single. I wasn't really into the omelet though. I understand the smoked salmon is salty and adding in the capers made it extra salty, but it was just too much for me. The homefries were also disappointing and not crispy enough. I did enjoy the chocolate chip pancake though. TONS of chocolate chips! I should have just been bad and went with the good, ya know?

If I went again I'd just go for the lo and bagel combo... or just dig a deeper hole for myself and get the pancakes!
