n9BrA1zIwlbiP1hLAc24jg I was on my way to another eatery but it was closed. Tosto was close by so I decided, "Why not?"  The atmosphere is very lively so I knew this was a trendy spot. Simple black and white menu and nice variety of options.  The norma was great although a bit bland (I had to doctor it up with some seasonings).  

Otherwise it was a tasty, hot meal on a cold, frigid day in some wonderful company.  Good on you Tosto!
