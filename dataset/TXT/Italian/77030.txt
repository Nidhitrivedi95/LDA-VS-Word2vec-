cXgXRqB40CGHEMKQgxLDTg I have eaten here a few times and it's always been pretty good. However, this time I ordered the same basic pizza tomato basil. I got home with my pizza and there was so much cheese on it, that it was flopping over the side and the flimsy crust couldn't even hold it. It was gross.
That's not the worst part! The worst part is I got an intestinal virus from this pizza. I'm thinking it was the cheese no doubt!  I don't even want to describe stomach issues I suffered.
It is a shame because I was a big fan of this place.  I don't think I will be going back. this was the only thing I ate that day so I know it was the pizza. Of course it is possible to get sick from any restaurant and that's why I can't stand eating out! Try it if you dare!
