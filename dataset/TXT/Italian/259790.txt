wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg Great food, great service and nice atmosphere. The portions are quite big and most pastas I've tried were very good. The goat cheese salad is just awesome and so is the Varese salad. Very similar to the good food you can find in local restaurants of Florence.

They don't take reservations so go ahead of time. For lunch, you can usually find space. From what I remember, there was no private parking so I parked across the street but I may be wrong on this.
