M1hEQVMiND1rbiT8mo2j0g BONANNO'S....WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY! It's seriously become a favorite of ours and will always go back when going to Vegas. The service was INCREDIBLE and the food..SIMPLY amazing! We went here because of a Groupon we got, and let me tell you it was the best decision we've EVER made. Jerry was our server and he is the nicest person you'd have waiting on you. He explained how the Groupon worked and what is available to get and told us we won't finish all our meals because of how big the portions were....let me tell you we need to-go boxes! Each meal was designed to perfection and whoever the chef is/was...you are amazing at what you do! The waitress came and filled up our ice tea's every 10minutes or so...and if you are like me, having a FULL drink at all times is important. Jerry, thank you solo much for giving us an amazing experience and being so kind to us! BONANNO'S  GIVE THAT MAN A PROMOTION!
