DOzHUh8KO8JA-wx4j21V3A No frills choice for Italian food in the area. 

Layout is straightforward, solid metal chairs and tables,  stainless steel order counter at the back with a hot table. The menu can change daily (check the ink board), but you'll find the basics from sandwiches, pasta, pizzas, and salads. 

This is a retail part to their catering they do. Most customers are the lunch crowd in the surrounding industrial area. 

Food is authentic and house made. I've had gnocchi, penne, chicken cutlet on past visits. Portions are ample.
