Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ That was some awesome deep pan crust!!! I was just a Pizza Hut fan before cuz that's what I grew up on. Here's a place that beat the taste! I'm veering away from my habitual choices I guess. Change is good, yeah.

I saw this place when I picked up Pink Box donuts the other week. I was due to spend time with my Vitug famz so I brought up suggestion of this place for grubbs. No hesitations- we met up here.

Pizza came out to the table after about 15 minutes from ordering. I wish I took a picture of our 9 piece square deep pan mushroom-pepperoni-sausage pizza. I would've wanted to show how crispy the edges even looked, just as it tasted. And the cheese! All stretchy gooey and yumz! I don't think the flavor was only in the toppings. It had to have been in the crust too. Whatever is in their secret recipe made us kill that pizza. Satisfyingly hit the spot and we were super hungry.

They have pinball games and some kiddy games. The interior is fun looking with all sorts of state representing posters. The walls in the pick up window area for to-go orders is done up with license plates. The dining experience is kick back casual. Really gives a no-rush atmosphere.

I've tasted Chicago and New York style pizzas. It's a first for me with Detroit style pizza. They appear to be the only one in this area with this to offer. I'll be trying other pizzas for sure. I'll be ordering from here too when family is in town. I'm glad I decided to try them. And they're close by. They deliver too!
