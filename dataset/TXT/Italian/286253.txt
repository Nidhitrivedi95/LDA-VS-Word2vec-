zgGoxOsThXKAcs2lAgC9yg Ok, I've never been a fan of this place. I've visited 3 different locations nationally. I came here tonight for my brother in laws birthday. We waited forever to be seated. They were, by no means, busy. Then, they did not have place settings out for us. A young man eventually came and took our drink orders and we explained how we wanted the checks to be split "that side of the table and the couple over here are separate." Then another server came and did the same thing. They young man went to tell her what we ordered and she just said "I'll do it, again, myself." We re-gave the orders and waited about 20 minutes for drinks. The our order was screwed up. Again, never a fan of bland, over-priced Italian food. The food was as expected. We had to wait for oil and vinegar, wait for cutlery, wait for napkins, wait for bread plates. Then the checks came and we, the couple, were given another members check and were embarrassed to say, "this is with the other patrons." And then, my sister in-law reminded the server, again, that it was my brother in laws birthday. We were the only people on the second floor and they announce to all eight of us it was his birthday. They clapped and sang and no type of dessert was offered. We waited another 20 minutes for the dessert and they said, "oh, we don't do much for birthdays. If you sign up for our club you will get a brownie next year." There was no, "Have a good night, thanks for coming," nothing. Not getting the checks right,nor not getting anything right, especially when you spay $22 dollars for a bowl of pasta, is unacceptable. It was nice to spend time with family but I hope to God I never have to go to this place again and I would never recommend it. Olive Garden, overall, is way better.
