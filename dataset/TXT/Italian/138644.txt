jcasci3gjbsSuTEVzvDQKg Mama Ricotta's is consistently flavorful with good service. Normally, I'm here for lunch and get the pasta primavera. They are generous with the vegetables and portion size. The meat option to add to the primavera is not worth it, as I find the chicken as well as the shrimp to be rather bland. Additionally, the wait it never long and the staff is friendly. For $9, this is an economical lunch option.

During dinner, the line isn't usually too long. The food is delicious and the pastas are very hearty. I recommend the lasagna, as the portion size is filling. My favorite appetizer is the goat cheese and mascarpone dip. If you're not sharing, this could be a meal in itself. Best part of any meal are the garlic rolls. 2 bites size, warm, soft, and garlicky of course.
