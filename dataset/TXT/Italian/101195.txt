fbZKVUec4oNGmPRXzWGpxQ I went to Bar Napoli with two other people from my work, one of whom usually has very specific ideas about what she likes in a restaurant, however this place was a hit with all 3 of us.


 We went for lunch and took advantage of a deal they had on which was 3 courses for £4.95, an absolute bargain in my opinion!


 For the starter I had breaded mushrooms which were delicious. The other 2 had soup which was also good.


 For the main myself and one other chose pizza, which I thought was good and I got to watch the chef prepare it from my seat which was fun!


 As part of the lunch deal the dessert was chosen for you already and on this day it was apple crumble which is a favourite of mine. All three of my party enjoyed this and we almost licked the plates!


 After finishing and asking for the bill we were already discussing a return visit to Bar Napoli.


 I think the decor and the atmosphere would suit people of all ages and tastes. The one thing to be aware of however is that they share a toilet with the Restaurant next door so be sure to exit from the door you came in!


 Overall a lovely eatery and a great place for a lunch, especially if you have limited time as the service is extremely fast and we had all 3 courses in under an hour.
