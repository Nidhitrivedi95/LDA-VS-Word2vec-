SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog I love this Italian restaurant. The speed and quality of the food is great. I'm a fan of Rigatony's for life. 

With exception to their salads, it's better than Olive Garden; but not nearly as upscale as Cafe Boa. Good stuff. 

They offer authentic Italian dishes that are favorites. You won't be let down.
