6I715CbaGgu1Wu16ahmm8A The servers are so friendly and attentive here!! The prices are reasonable too. I went with my gf and ordered the grilled octopus, caprese salad and funghi pizza. + Bottle of red. The food was fresh and the octopus wasn't chewy but grilled perfectly. The lighting is good at ur table- that's how you know they dont wanna hide the food. I'll definitely go back!
