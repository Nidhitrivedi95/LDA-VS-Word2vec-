CZY3743GpOOhdDJu6UmPBA Brunch was excellent!! A great brunch for all foodies that would appreciate the finer nuances of the dishes that would be served here. 

Everything on the menu is made to share. They didn't mention how many people to share with, so our ravenous group of 7 might have done better with 2 of each dish - but we ended up with a good taste of everything. And surprisingly, with about 6-7 dishes, we were completely full at the end of it. 

The menu is divided into sweet stuff, savoury stuff, and panini like, foccacia stuffed sandwiches (which I noticed were also on their to go list). 

What we ate:

- Uovo Strapazzate - one of 2 egg dishes - fresh farm eggs with truffle oil. Like an omlette, but flat served on this pan. It was full of truffle flavour, but a little salty.

-*Uovo Rosso - duck eggs served with rock shrimp. Similar to the egg dish above, but infused with lobster. I think this would be a better choice, if you were to choose only one. 

- Ammaza Fegato - the offal sausage - it doesn't present itself very nicely, but it was good - and salty. Offal refers to a variety of organ meats ground into a sausage - so it's a unique taste.

-*Migliaccio - the tuscan blood crepe served with figs and chocolate - this was something really unique a treat. The crepe is made with pigs blood and it's mild savoury taste goes well with the chocolate and fig. 

- *Crepselle - must get. It's small, but there are 3 small hotcakes covered in cannoli bits and served with maple grappa - I don't know how they got the outside so crispy with the moist insides on such a small pancake. 

- *Carbonara schiacciata - get one of these sandwiches and you will not be disappointed. The crisp foccacia really made the dish. 

- Bobolone ($6) - we got this to end the meal on a sweet note. I don't know how I feel about this. The doughnut itself was great, and covered (and stuffed) with this apple cream. I think there was too much of it, and it was very sweet. Made it a little difficult to finish. Another option would be the pastries ($12)

Price wise, it was all of a very good value (and I usually hate tapas/sharing type places). Even the take out sandwiches were about $10-12 (and a generous portion). With everything we ate, it was a surprisingly $18 per person include coffees, and I expected to spend a lot more. 

Would I come here again? Maybe, but not in the near future. The dishes are quite rich, and although I loved it, wouldn't be a regular place for brunch for me, unless they changed up their menu. I would love to come and try dinner here though.
