0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q Terrible, will never go there again. For being in a premiere hotel in city center, management should be fired. We sat for over 20 minutes before our server even gave us menus. Once we ordered it was an hour later before we ate. I don't normally lash out at restaurants, but this one is by far the worst one I've gone to in years. Don't waste your time because the food isn't that good either. If you like crappy service and food that is fair to midland at best, then by all means enjoy. Overpriced, horrible, I repeat, horrible service and shotty food.
