-7d3UqQYYcBxbDH2do86sg Came here tonight for their soft opening which was awesome because the food was all free. The place was pretty packed but the service was pretty darn impeccable considering how many people were inside. The place is very casual but very clean and nice and upscale.  I would definitely come back soon to try the pesto pasta dish. I had the steak stroganoff and it was awesome. We also tried the chicken noodle soup which is very good. You can tell the pasta is cooked perfectly and the sauces are really good.  Can't wait to come back with a normal crowd, I'm certain the service will be great as it was tonight already.
