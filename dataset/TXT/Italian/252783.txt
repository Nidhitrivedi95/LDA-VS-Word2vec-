VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Valentines dinner was amazing. We had a very friendly waiter and buser. Meet a very nice couple who was seated next to us. I've waited my entire life and I'm surprised I've never eaten here. The grilled octopus is amazing. And of course we had to try the 20 layer peanut butter and chocolate cake.
