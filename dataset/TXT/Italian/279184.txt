yNp0ybYo07JQWlmdz1K4Cw i saw a lot of really great reviews about this place and wanted to check out the venue with my girlfriend.  i made a reservation and arrived a bit late, and i was aware of the time but hopeful that the restaurant would at least accommodate us in some way.  

we walked in and the greeter was less than enthused to see us.  he said that the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes, which i really expected.  however what i did not like, was that there was no offer to sit at the bar, no offer to accommodate us at all.  furthermore they promptly canceled my reservation no sooner than 10 seconds from us walking out the door.  

ultimately i do overstand the time constraint but i felt the attitude and service, or lack thereof, was poor.
