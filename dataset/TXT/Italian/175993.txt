NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ I've tried a lot of Italian restaurants looking for the best, and while I still love to try others, Montesano's is by far my favorite. 

I have tried different things each time I've been there and every dish has been wonderful. I've never been disappointed. My all time favorite is the Cavatelli with Broccoli Rabe, a must try. The pasta melts in your mouth and the best way to order it is with a combination of sweet and spicy sausage. It is truly incredible. If you have enough of an appetite, with the incredible garlic knots that automatically come to the table, order the Stracciatella soup. It's so good and if you want to save room for dinner, you can eat just a little and they will put the rest in a container for you to take home. It's great for lunch the next day! Of course, you cannot skip dessert. Everything is great. We sometimes get a plate of assorted cookies, Tiramisu, or we'll bring home their Spumoni. 

The service is always great - very welcoming, friendly and they never rush you even though they are always crowded. Speaking of, since it is such a popular place, expect a wait. It's worth it. We decided order their pizza tonight and eat at home. Again, incredible. Best pizza we've had in Vegas. Oh, and got the Crumb Cake, which was like a strawberry cheesecake type/crumb cake combo of goodness...and assorted cookies too.
