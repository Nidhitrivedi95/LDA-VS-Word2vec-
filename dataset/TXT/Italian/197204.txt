ppT0Rbx0-_W0W8DqY2fPiA Ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and was totally dissatisfied and couldn't even finish it - It cost $12 they threw it in a tin - with 2 tiny meatballs that I would have sworn were store brought - It was cold and you can tell it was sitting around and NOT FRESH - A total waste of my time and money - They are known for there Pizza which Ive had in the past, my husband ordered 2 huge slices tonight and they were cold and old - A true disgrace to Italian Food sorry to say....Get it together! Especially when your serving people from NY and NJ who know good authentic Italian Food.
