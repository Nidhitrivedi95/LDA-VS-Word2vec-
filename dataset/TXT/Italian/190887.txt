PcfFrGL6NgS0gqneNE8R0A Have only been twice.  First time was wonderful.  Heather our service was exceptional and the food was wonderful.  Second time, service was incredibly slow(not Heather), food was good not great.  Possibly a different chef.  Also, seemed like the owner had family or close friends in town and it kind of felt like you were sitting in their kitchen.  Sometimes this is nice and quaint.  Depends on your preferences.  The owner, although I have yet to meet him, comes around to the tables to check on patrons.  Nice touch!  Will definitely go back again!
