JH3zKlfslbSVeA_KsAaRRQ Wow!
We heard that they were closing at the end of the year so we decided to book a table for our 16th anniversary. 
For those who haven't been it's a 12 course tasting menu. We added the wine pairing for an additional cost. The menu does not list what the courses are so each is a surprise. What we had was amazing. From popcorn made in bacon fat and scallop powder to caviar, sashimi, venison and 2 desserts. Each paired with wines, saki, beer and cherry. At the end they give you a bottle of 12yr old El Dorado rum with thier own ginger cranberry mix. And yes you can have the whole bottle but good luck at that point!
The service was excellent. The Chef,the sommelier all came by the table and they even gave us a happy anniversary card signed by everyone! 
Not cheap but I feel we got great value for what we spent.
Go before it closes!
