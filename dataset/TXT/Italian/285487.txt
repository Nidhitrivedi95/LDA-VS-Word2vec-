zEHx5n8C8kK6927i1_wWqw I had such a great experience here tonight, and am already wanting to go back again! The food is so fresh and flavorful, and I highly recommend the risotto ala pescatore. The sauce was delicious and the seafood was well cooked and fresh. Everyone in my party enjoyed what they ordered, and we all ordered different things. I recommend making a reservation though before you arrive, as the restaurant is quite small with limited seating.
