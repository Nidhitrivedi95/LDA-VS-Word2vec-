7ejOvDfwY2P2D8TMXTe_Ig I've been here a few times with the extended family and friends. I think we always choose Bar Roma because it is very family-friendly and have a quick and easy menu. The food comes out within 15-20 minutes and is really tasty - if maybe a tiny bitty bland. I always have spaghetti Carbonara here and it is one of the better ones. Whenever I order carbonara I always leave about half of it on my plate, but they have the perfect balance here.

The staff are great too, the kids always love them and they have a great sense of humour. Overall, it's a brilliant place to go with big groups and families!
