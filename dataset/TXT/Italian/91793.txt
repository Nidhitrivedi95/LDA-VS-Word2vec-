EGIJ7sfXa5ha89fBxJsTuQ I've searched high and low for a place in New York that makes a cappuccino comparable to this one, and come up empty. This is the #1 must-visit for me every trip to Montreal, best coffee and best old-school atmosphere around bar none! I get one cup to stay and soak in the scene, then another one to go. I unknowingly came to town right on their 60th anniversary, and was honored to have a chance to pay tribute. Salute!
