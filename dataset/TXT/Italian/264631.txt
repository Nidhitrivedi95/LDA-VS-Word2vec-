Appetizer: Caprese burrata was very bitter, drenched in oil, and was not worth the price. I would definitely skip this.

Pizza: Tried the margherita, which was good. I liked the crust a lot - not too thin, not too thick, and cooked well. Toppings were fresh and nice.

Drinks: Tried some wine and beer. Prices were fine. Selection was fine. Nothing extraordinary.

Ambiance: Once again, fine. This place is probably good if you want to bring kids and/or a large group. Maybe not the most romantic restaurant if that's what you're looking for.

Service: Good. Our server was always attentive and polite.

Overall, I don't think I would ever be in the mood specifically for Humble Pie, but if my first choice restaurant was really busy with a long wait, I think Humble Pie would be a very solid backup that I would be happy to dine at. Given how good the margherita pizza is, I am hopeful the other pizzas are good too.
