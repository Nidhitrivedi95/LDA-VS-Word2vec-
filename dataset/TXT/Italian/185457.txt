oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ Came here for my birthday had a few sangrias and chicken linguini in a pesto cream sauce. The pasta was amazing, I don't remember the last time I had such great pasta. The pesto was so fresh, and chicken was well flavoured. My friends had the chicken Parmesan and seafood pasta, which they both loved as well. The desserts were good, I can't recall the exact names but it was delicious not too sweet. Only minor compliant is that server could have been more intuitive as food, dessert and bill took a while to come out and they weren't busy at that time. I will definitely go back again and would love to try the salmon pizza.
