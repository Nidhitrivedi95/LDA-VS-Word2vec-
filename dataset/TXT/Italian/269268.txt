xjjxHavx4RIiW6zS6rasGA Pleasant patio. Staff well versed and friendly. Liked: the Zinn braised ribs and gnocchi. The beef rib meat was thick tender. It was "fall apart" perfectly cooked. It was tasty, but needed more sauce that stuck to meat vs runny sauce given. The gnocchi was a little starchy filled with asiago cheese and spinach. The filling of gnocchi tasty. Not Liked: the risotto with artichoke tasted over cooked, starchy and uneventful. Deserts are made elsewhere and topped with inexpensive whip cream. The fig mule drink was not all that. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain
