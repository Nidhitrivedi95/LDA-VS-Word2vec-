aLOxANYDp66y-kLAJ0Gdxg Have only tried their pizza and salad so take this review with a grain of salt...

Pizza - I mean...it's alright, I've had a lot better but I like their variety.

DO NOT go near the caesar salad (ok,ok...I know you don't go to this place for the salad) but AT LEAST put some effort into it, or perhaps more lettuce? The container fit in one hand, was half full with about 10 pieces of lettuce, 4 croutons, and renee's dressing. My co-workers were astonished when I came back with this $5.65 salad that could feed a starving ant who would continue to starve upon completion of the salad. 

Service is meh - but I get it, they're busy during weekday lunches.

Overall, I'd go back only to try the paninis or pasta...but never ever doing a salad or slice again.
