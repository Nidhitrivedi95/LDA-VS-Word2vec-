2i0dDzxLuQQAwzxDZVR-1g Oretta is a new Italian restaurant with 3 sections  - cafe, causal dining and private dining. 

The place is beautiful, service is very friendly 

Price is very reasonable as other reviewer commented. 

My friends and I tried quite a number of pastries and pizza from the cafe. All are tasty and price is very reasonable. I would definitely come back for more. It would be my to go place for Italian pastries. 

The Cafe entrance is a little hidden. That is the alley  on the left side of the main restaurant entrance.

My friends are already planning to go back to try their lunch/dinner at the dining area.
