8xIWCN6PlW8E897gFgyFeg I ate here with a coworker from New York. He said it is so close to New York pizza it's unbelievable. We have a large cheese. Which was more like a extra extra large cheese due to must restaurant standards. It was good, greasy. Reminded me of the pizza they use to serve in grade school. I won't mind eatting here again. Just not something I would write home about.
