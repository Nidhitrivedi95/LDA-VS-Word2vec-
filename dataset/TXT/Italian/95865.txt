eQCYur0033RkZdh5VjbF8A The gff always bugs me to leave the house for brunch on weekends, and last weekend was no different. She selected the newish Oliver & Bonacini Café Grill, which serves brunch until 3 pm (on weekends only?)

This location is absolutely huge, with three separate glass-encased patios. The west patio offers a variety of seating options: banquette, high tables, bar, standard (?); and is laid out with plenty of room between tables. I can see this area getting rammed with post-work drinkers. The interior is stunning, has a lot of intimate booths, and the individual washrooms each have a Dyson hand dryer. 

Our fantastic waitress was attentive, and recommended the Savoury Smoked Ham Crêpe. Gouda, mushrooms, and ham, wrapped in a crêpe, topped with poached eggs and hollandaise? Yes please. It was delicious, and I appreciated being able to consume hollandaise on something other than Eggs Benedict. My brunchmate did order the Eggs Benedict, and enjoyed them. We both prefer a hollandaise with more lemon, but she felt the spices dashed on top of the eggs, and the cheddar scone base (!) more than made up for it.

Free refills on coffee.

I'm disappointed to see the lackluster reviews on the dinner experience, but brunch was more than enough to get me back to this restaurant again.
