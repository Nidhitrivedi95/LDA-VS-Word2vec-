OPctv7y27uf5cRvChC2sKw We need a little diversity in South Phoenix.  Seriously, we have a lot of chain restaurants. And a lot of Mexican restaurants. Little of anything else.   So we would welcome a little Italian food into our mix! 

Despite my 2-star rating, I do have high hopes for this little Italian establishment and in all fairness, they were only 11-days old on our visit yesterday. 

They don't' yet have a liquor license, but you can bring your own bottle and they'll uncork it (for no fee). 

One of the servers started us off with a complimentary meat and cheese plate. The problem was, he set it on the table and there was no explanation as to what was on the plate. I also think if they had plated the selections on a smaller plate and added a touch of parsley garnish, it would have been more impressive. As it was, the compliment was more of an eyesore.

The food was mediocre. The dishes were either too flavorful, as in my "zesty" marinara, or unflavorful as in the "God Father" sauce. In either instance, the menu may benefit from some more descriptive adjectives and perhaps some background on the region of Italy the flavors derive; doing so may help manage our expectations. 

We did order a desert. We asked if the Canolli was made on-site, and they said it was. But even that, seemed a little blah. 

I felt like the place has potential with atmosphere and a sincere owner that wants to deliver a positive experience. But, the waitstaff needs a lot of help and the kitchen needs to work out some of the kinks in flavors. 

Give it a chance, but don't go with high expectations.
