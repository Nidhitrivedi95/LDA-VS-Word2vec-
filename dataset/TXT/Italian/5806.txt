_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw Ok now the first thing I thought was,  "oh great all we need in downtown Gilbert is another Italian eatery" And do you know what? YES WE MOST CERTAINLY DO! This restaurant has some of the most delicious pizza you will eat in Gilbert. And for dessert we had tiramisu. Now I'm not a fan of tiramisu but this restaurant knows what they're doing when it comes to dessert as well. This restaurant it's a wonderful addition to downtown Gilbert.
