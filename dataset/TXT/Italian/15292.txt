The toasted sesame crusty roll is really tasty and it gets a tiny bit of black on the edges as some of the images suggest. It adds great flavor. Price is very reasonable, had terrible sandwiches for much more. I think I'll ask for extra tomato next time but that's the only thing I'll change. Interior is quaint, rich wood all over, maybe 10 tables inside. Didn't check out the patio. Not much parking but I was there after 1 so it was after any rush and no issue getting a space and getting back out. Will definitely be back!
