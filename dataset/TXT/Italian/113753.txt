gIOpptgl57KGrOAFw_ViIw I went there around 5:15 pm to order takeout and left empty handed by 6pm. I had ordered small funghi pizza because I heard amazing reviews about it but was disappointed about the wait time. Not only did I have to follow up with the cashier, Mariam, twice, she informed me from the start it would take about 20 mins. So 30 mins passed and I went to ask how much longer and she said "it's coming". As the restaurant is getting busier, I understand the orders are piling up so I waited another 15 mins before going up to inquire again. This time the cashier went to check on the ovens and came back to only tell me another 10 mins. 
This is when I got upset because not only did she misled me into thinking it would be be around 20 mins she also wasted my time. At that time I just told them to cancel it and give me a refund. To make matter even worst, when the manager came by to give me the refund, not only was he not apologetic, he said it was my fault for not giving them my name when it was never asked to begin with. This is by far the worst customer experience I have encounter in all the levetto location and I will never step foot in this restaurant again.
