ijNQXC2cBhbkf6iB6D8OJw The food is here OK, nothing spectacular that would WOW you, basically just good bar food. The customer service is TERRBILE. I ordered a fish sandwich, which was supposed to come with cheese but it DID NOT. Most of the ingredients that the sandwich was suppose to come with where left off, and when I questioned the waitress she replied "I have no idea what's suppose to come on it". I had a horrible experience here and wont go back.
