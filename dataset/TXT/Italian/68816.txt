BtLDbNfpwdwHSmyBJF2-RQ Came here for my birthday on a Tues night and it was a pleasant experience.

Note: their menu has changed - so their online menu is no longer up to date.  This was a bit disappointing since I really wanted to try the zuppa di pesce.

For appetizers, we had 2 dishes:
1)  the grilled calamari - a bit chewy and over charred, I don't think I'd order it again  
2) polenta fries - delicious and hot!

For mains, we had:
1) Spaghetti - I changed the pasta from linguini to parparadelle - the pasta was delicious and the shrimps were large but slightly overcooked.  The sauce was creamy but a bit too heavy.  
2) spicy ckn and mushroom linguini - the noodles were very al dente.  Again, the sauce was very heavy.

Service was amazing!  The servers were quite attentive and I got a bday tiramisu from the restaurant.

Overall - I felt the ambiance and service was great, but the pasta was a bit too heavy and overwhelming.
