DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw Ferraro's delivered $10 lunch coupon's to our office and so we decided to use them!  Anything on their menu will then be $10!  Wow!

We started with: 
Fritto Misto $9
Fried calamari, shrimp, fennel, zucchini

- The calamari was delicious and the red sauce that comes with it is so yummy!  It was a huge plate... enough for 3 people to have a great appetizer!

For the main courses:
I had: 
Salmone Checca $14
Grilled salmon, fresh tomatoes, basil, fresh garlic and kalamata olives

- I feel like there should have been more kalamata olives for more flavor.  Don't get me wrong, I ate the whole thing, but it didn't have alot of flavor.  I think if they added maybe some more salt & pepper it would have tasted even better.  I would order it again, because it was light and I think could have more flavor next time.

My friend had:
Pollo Parmigiana $14
Chicken breast, mozzarella and tomato sauce served with a side of pasta

- He said it was good... but wasn't sold on it.  It looked really good!

We sat outside on a beautiful day and had excellent service!  They let us each use a $10 coupon for our main courses!  I can't believe it!

I would like to come back for dinner and wine next time!
