lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ The pizza was just aight. I had a slice of pepperoni. The pepperoni was definitely a step up from most pizza joints. The sauce was okay, a little salty. If I had a beer with it I think it would have been perfect. It could've used more cheese. The crust was crunchy how I like it. It didn't come out all that hot either. I would have felt better paying $3 for slice but it is in Mandalay Bay so enough said.
