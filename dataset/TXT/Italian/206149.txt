qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA During a recent trip to Vegas my husband and I were looking on Yelp for an Italian restaurant that was in walking distance of our hotel. Upon seeing the reviews and pictures about Trattoria Reggiano we were both sold. I wasn't thrilled that it happened to be located in the Venetian's Grand Canal Shops. I don't like that hotel and I don't like malls. However I will endure a lot for good food. As predicted walking through the Grand Canal Shops in search of Trattoria Reggiano was beyond unpleasant. Vendors and merchants were harassing us and when we paused to consult the directory/map an employee dressed like a Carabinieri offered to show us where the restaurant was. He walked us back towards the direction we had come from and pointed to the WRONG restaurant. Major fail. We ended up walking in a giant circle before Trattoria Reggiano nestled off in a side enclave near a Coffee Bean and the Houdini Shop. 

The waitors here are all older Italian gentlemen. They notice customers  and announce how long the wait will be. There is no hostess or sign up sheet. We were told it would be a few minutes as a couple tables paid and got bussed and exactly a few minutes later we were shown to our table. The inside area seats about 20 and there are small tables outside too that probably seat another 20. It's very small compared to the Cucina across the way that was EMPTY!
