iYowuARFZa6erbdjRT9HmQ I have had the pleasure of dining here twice now while on business.

Nice outdoor terrace with a view of historic buildings of old St-Laurent. When the weather is nice the cover is rolled up. Inside seating is comfortable and classy.

Service, from greeting all the way until we exited the restaurant was warm, friendly and impeccable. I think we were the last to leave one night and no one ever made us feel rushed. 

The group I was with covered an erray of menu choices from veal, tortellini, pizza, mussels, calamari. Ceasar salad was a bit heavy on the sauce. 

One of the guests orderd a bottle of spanish wine, not very tasty but not the fault of the restaurant. They have a decent wine list, we chose poorly.

Overall a very enjoyable experience. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
