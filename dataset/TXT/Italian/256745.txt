w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q I've been a regular at the Palm in NYC for a while now. While in Vegas, I thought we should try a Western outpost. 

We arrived about 10 minutes before the kitchen closed...Tommy the bartender was made us feel like regulars right away. He hooked us up with some Prime Time Bites, which were great. The drinks were made perfectly, can't go wrong with bleu cheese stuffed olives in your martini.

The Palm - Vegas is by far one of the few places that meets the hype.
