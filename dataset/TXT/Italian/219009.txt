S5Q8AMyU9Jf7G7Pq2Y2HNQ DiSavino's is a great little restaurant in West Mississauga. I usually go there for lunch when I am in the neighbourhood during the summer.  I find the prices here to be quite good and the pricing on daily specials is very good! For instance I believe that they may still have kids eat free on Sunday, and 49 cent wings on Wed.  (Ie. tonight)

Tonight I tried the spicy sausage penne.  The noodles were done perfectly, and the sauce and sausage were very spicy true to the dish.  I have had the Paninis here as well as the spaghetti and meatballs and both were very good.

The servers are always very friendly and have helpful suggestions.  Overall this is a good laid back place to go for good foods, good portions and at a good proce.
