I have lived in Madison for 20 years, eaten at nearly every Italian restaurant over the years (except this one), and thought I'd give it a try with my wife.  The coffee we ordered was cold, and it took 20 minutes to get our waitress' attention to get it refilled (Note:  There were literally three other tables occupied on this particular Thursday evening at Bellini, so it wasn't slow service due to a dinner rush).  I want to note, however, that our second cup was much better.  Anyway, onto the food.  The garlic bread florentine was quite good...but that is where our satisfaction stopped.  My wife got the fettuccini giovanni, and the white wine cream sauce was like eating processed cheese sauce over noodles-heavy, salty and overbearing.  The sausage was cold in the centers and had an off-taste to it as well.  Furthermore, the presentation with the prosciutto was as if the cook simply threw a couple of slices randomly into the dish along with a handful of hot-dog cut sausage circles-nothing even close to the well-presented pictures posted on their website.  My dish, the pollo parmigiana, was unimpressive, with the fettuccini noodles being tough and in a terribly watery marinara sauce base that simply flowed off the noodle through your fork, leaving plain noodles per bite.  The chicken breasts were flavorful and well-prepared, though.

Now, this was our first visit, and I hope we simply caught them on a bad day, so I am giving them 2 stars rather than 1 in case this is the reason for such a disappointing meal not worth the $18/plate it cost.
