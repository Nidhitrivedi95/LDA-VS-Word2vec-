eVv6cnwhabK8ig5Di2hXQQ I love Florencia. It is my favorite pizza place in the area. The pizza is light but still tends to fill you up. They have really good flavor. For the health conscious, they have low-fat cheese, if you ask for it. And now, on weekends, they offer whole wheat crust. We tried this, knowing that wheat substitutes can be hit or miss. In this case, it was good. It didn't lower the overall taste of the pizza. 

Like many good pizza joints, they can get busy, particularly on the weekends. But they do allow reservations, so call ahead!

For families with small kids, they don't have crayons and coloring sheets. So, plan ahead and bring something for the kids to do.

This restaurant is a regular in our rotation and I highly recommend it.
