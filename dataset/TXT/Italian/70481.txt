C-DGZG8ClR_dOMwYB19vMA I have to start by saying I love to give new independent businesses a chance, but I should have went with my gut on this one.  After trying over a dozen times to make a reservation by phone and never received a call back I personally went there to make the reservation.  The ambiance is lacking but thought the food might make that up.  We were the only ones in the place on a Saturday at 6pm.  Then, to find out the chef wasn't there that night, and we would have a "chef in training"  Well, he needs a lot more!!!   We had to ask for water, the silverware was dirty, we were given our own corkscrew to open our wine.  We were told to go with family style since they only had 5 burners.  (who says that??)  So, since there were 8 of us, we went with that.  We were given ice cold plates for our dinner. The chicken was not cooked and fatty, the pasta was cold.  We ordered tortellini and when it came out it was penne.  This wasn't even addressed, so I questioned it.  I was told they ran out of tortellini.  How did you run out when we were the only ones there and they just opened at 4pm?  We should have been told prior to this and ask if that was o.k. The calamari was overcooked and like rubber.  The only good thing I have to say about this place was, the water was good!   

I had read all the other reviews and decided to give it a chance.  So wrong!!  With so many other great restaurants popping up in Pittsburgh, don't waste your time or money on this place!!   For the same price we paid, we could have had a great meal 5 minutes away at Amels!!!   Oh, and last but not least, they only take cash.  At no time were we told this, or was it posted anywhere.  

To sum it up in one word-awful.  No wonder why his other restaurant didn't survive!
