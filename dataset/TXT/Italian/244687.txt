UutHMmZx1CQcjiyfmVa_7g Definitely not bad. I like the sandwiches quite a bit. They have a good selection of deli salads. They also sell their deli meats and cheeses by the pound. The marinara sauce is really good so I would recommend any sandwich that has marinara on it. The owners are very friendly and very appreciative for anyone's business. Eat here to support local business!
