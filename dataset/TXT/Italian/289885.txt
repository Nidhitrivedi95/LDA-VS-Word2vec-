zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA Sitting at the bar on a Saturday night, listening to Billy on the keyboard (always loved Music Box Dancer), chatting with Cody who I'm told does a fabulous pour (I don't drink), devouring a Caesar Salad, Fresh Jalapeño White Pizza and an always creamy and layers of flavor tiramisu - makes me wonder if I'm in North Beach. Love this place.
