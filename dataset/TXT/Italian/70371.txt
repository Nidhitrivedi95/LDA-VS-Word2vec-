BzerEVgnPcQPr0iFzIO8Aw Made the trip for 15 member family gathering, seated in the bar area with our reservation.  

Drinks menu was decent, got a malbec which was quite good, a few italian and other beers, nothing too surprising.  Complimentary warm fresh bread was a highlight - we were hungry!

Bruschetta was middling.  Of the 4 pieces, 3 were crispy and soft, almost perfect, but one was soggy from tomatoes.  The house salad was very good and nice that there were 3 size options.  Linguine tutto marre ringed by mussels when it arrived, had a nice flavor with mushroom and light garlic sauce, but skimped a bit on the quantity of seafood.  Porcini and truffle cappellacci (mushroom stuffed raviolis) were tasty.  But both entrees were heavy on the salt, pushing our boundaries as salt-lovers.  Passed on dessert but did taste test the chocolate cake, which was huge and good enough.  

Around the table the portions were gigantic; there was plenty to take home.  The service was attentive, thoughtful, and friendly.  The atmosphere sitting in the bar was festive but allowed us to still talk to one another without shouting.  It was a nice night; having higher quality food and more creative options would have made it nicer.  This was a solid dining experience but nothing to get excited about.
