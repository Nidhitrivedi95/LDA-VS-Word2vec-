tBnkwWamzdO6X25sfV0Fyg Complete disorganization behind the counter. I ordered the pepperoni slice and waited in line to pay. Once i paid, i had to stand off to the side and wait for them to take my slice out of the oven. When it finally came out the guy called out the pepperoni slice and i went to grab it, but he gave it to the woman paying who grabbed it before i could say anything and then the cashier looked up at me and asked me what slice i got. I told him Peppeoni, and he rung it into the cash register. I had to tell him that i had already paid and he had rung me thru about 2 minutes ago and the previous lady pretty much took my slice. After way too much time and hassle, i finally got my slice. I like the brand, but i will hesitate to visit this location again. This place needs much better management.
