zY6f_cFY8HTI3hLlJj3SOg My family and I have been ordering from this restaurant for a few years. Most of the time it's good but lately food and service has been deteriorating. We ordered a pizza and a sandwich. The food was delivered. When we opened the pizza it was cold.  We called to complain about the cold pizza. We were told that it couldn't possibly be cold and basically we were lying. The person who answered the phone would not give his name and was extremely rude. I will no longer order from there. Rosati's will now get all my business.
