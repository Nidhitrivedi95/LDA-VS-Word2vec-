zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g Good pizza. Dog friendly. What more do you need?  

We take lunch dates here every now and again because our dog can tag along. She posts up under the table (when she is not trying to sneak a peak at the other pups) while we enjoy a nice outdoor meal. They even brought her out a bowl of water. Sufficient shade and misters for a sunny day.... and heat lamps for the cooler evenings. 

Definitely worth a visit.... with or without your pet. 

Tip: order the garlic bread with cheese on top and a side of ranch. You're welcome.
