KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg They do not accept reservations! Came here on a Friday evening and it was hopping! They let you leave a number that they will text so you can walk in the area (and Bang bang ice cream is just down the street...dessert should be first!!) service was good and friendly and the ambiance is dark and romantic, albeit very loud. 

The pizza and crust are delicious. 
- The capers, anchovies, black and cheese-less pizza was underwhelming and too salty
-the featured salami, basil and cheese with a maple glaze was amazing! A nice combo of slightly sweet with the salt of the salami and cheese

The calamari had an amazing sauce under it and was super crispy and a lot of it

The beef carpaccio was good, but nothing too special

The meatball is VERY DISAPPOINTING and not worth ordering at all 

The summer salad is delicious with a fried egg, zucchini, frisée and a vinegar+mustard dressing (make sure you like mustard and vinegar if you order this)
