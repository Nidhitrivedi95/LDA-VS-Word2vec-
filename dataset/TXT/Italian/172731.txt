n8fGqb4CCheGyWtr9KM6qw This is my family's all time favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  We celebrate all of our milestones here - both good and bad.  The restaurant is family owned - and the family is delightful! They make you feel welcome from the onset of your visit.  The staff that is not family 'by blood' might was well be family - it's that jovial an atmosphere.

My husband is hard of hearing, and has problems in most restaurants.  No matter how busy they are, they allow us to sit in a quiet corner of the lounge and eat our supper, so we can actually talk.  

However Roma Garden is more than just a friendly place.  The food is fabulous!  One can order from the menu, from specials, or, if they have the ingredients, one can have something special concocted.  This is my go-to place when I have picky eater friends and family in town - everyone gets what they want - and everyone is happy with the food!  My husband hates zucchini and they always remember to fix his veggies sans zucchini.

The ingredients are always fresh; the meat is first rate, as is the fish.  They cook vegetables to perfection.  Their rice is fluffy and flavorable.  Their sauces are subtle and tasty.  Food comes to the table freshly prepared and hot, followed by either the owner of the staff with fresh pepper and fresh parm if one wants to embellish a bit more.  I love their veal chops, and their pasta dishes, but quite honestly I  have yet to taste a dish here that I didn't like.

My husband adores their salads.  I don't eat salads, but I can say that their desserts are delightful.  The Tiramisu is light and creamy and not oversweet like at chain restaurants.  With a cup of their excellent coffee or a glass of amaretto, it's a great way to finish the meal.

I can't gush enough about this place, or the folks that run the restaurant!
