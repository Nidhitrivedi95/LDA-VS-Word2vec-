I have eaten at Oggi's at least a dozen times. I try something new almost every time I go and everything I have tried has been wonderful. The service is great! Lynn has waited on us several times and she is always fun, nice and and an excellent server.
So far, everyone I have taken to Oggi's, has not been disappointed!
