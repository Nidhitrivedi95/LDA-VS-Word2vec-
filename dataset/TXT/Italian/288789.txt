zs-T0uqKSHhYWSEok6oouw Ordered a pasta with arrabiata and a pizza. We were placed right next to the door which would open on a freezing cold freeze and not being moved despite asking.  When the arrabiata came it had meat on it which was not marked properly on the menu. When I told the staff, they were unfriendly and did not care. They refused to replace it despite my repeated patronage and severe allergy to  meat. I had to share the pizza my friend ordered. 

I was overall not impressed with the service at all. With so many choices for good pizza in York region and maple, I would recommend Abruzio or another place.
