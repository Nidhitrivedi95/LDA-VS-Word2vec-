Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A Tasty food, friendly staff, I can recommend Brunch, especially on Sundays. Wow Sangria half price, what a deal!

The 3 bruchettas recommended by the waitress were deliciious: proscuitto, tomato and ricotta.

I also had the peach jelly crepes, very light and lovely. Maybe a little too much jelly, but tasty.

My friend had the polenta brunch dish and enjoyed it.

Sat outside and it was very pleasant. Towards the end they turned on the music which was a little loud. I was there to catch up with an old friend and it made it a little hard to hear.
