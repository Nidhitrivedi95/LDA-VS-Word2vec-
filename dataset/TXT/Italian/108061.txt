FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A Truffle baked mac - 4
Mac and cheese with delicious prominent truffle flavor.
Crunchy awesomeness parmesan atop entire tray.
I'm a spice lover so I added red peppers.
Gooey heart melting cheese.
Pasta not overcooked dry.
Hot outta oven - dish served over another tin tray.

Broccoli chicken pesto - 2
Noodles were hotter than the chicken.
Chicken seemed possibly heated up in microwave then mixed in with penne pasta and pesto sauce.
Only their broccoli and chicken portions, and flavor were good.

White sangria from Spain - 3
Purchased entire bottle.
Was fixed up in a carafe with slices of orange, lemons, and cherries on ice. 
Served in two glasses.
Nice presentation.
Ice watered it down.

Only if I have visitors that particularly want gluten free and/or pasta would Mac Shack be a future option. This place was on Nessa's bookmarks. Not generally the type of food I crave. I'm glad I enjoyed at least a couple things here.
