7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw NoRTH is a great place to go for lunch or happy hour if your near Kierland. This is one of the better Fox restaurants with great food, fantastic service with a somewhat trendy northern Italian decor.  We miss their location on the west side on 67th.

They offer a lighter side of Italian cuisine with an emphasis on freshness. This is not the place to go if your looking for the heaver side of Italian with loaded meaty sauces and carb-o-roma items galore.  They offer some classic carb loaded dishes and pizzas. But for the most part they offer several wonderful dishes on the lighter side with loads of fresh grilled seafood, chicken and veggies.  

Their zucca chips or bruschetta with prosciutto and crescenza cheese are great starters with a glass of wine. The baked ziti bolognese with spinach, ricotta & mozzarella cheese is delish,  The pasta with butternut squash is also very good.  I always order their grilled chicken sandwich with a side of seasonal grilled veggies or their ahi tuna salad which is devine.  

Their happy hour is fantastic with bargains on drinks and several apps. They have great service and will accommodate most special request for those with special dietary needs.
