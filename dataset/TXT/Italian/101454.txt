FclR3tCyp3wPCZoxHXn_jQ 2nd visit to Papa Geo's 

Ordered the meatball sammie w/cheese, pizzaiola w/cheese, onion rings and a soda ( free with coupon ) - total cost $20.50 

The high's - the pizzaiola was very good - thin sliced roast beef with au jus ( not sure if the roll was dipped or it's simply from the drippings within the meat - my guess is it's dipped on the face ) , some peppers and a little cheese. Very generous portion of meat, tender flavorful but might be a little too salty for some. 

The meatball sammie -three decent sized meatballs - tender, nice flavor, generous portion of tomato sauce. a little miffed they charge extra for the cheese - who gets a meatball sub w/o cheese?! 

The lows ( besides the extra charge for the cheese ) - the onion rings ...can you say...ORE-IDA . Really ? Why not make them fresh ? 

Again, good service, and a decent vibe to the place. 

Will return for a taste of the chicago dog and the sausage sammie
