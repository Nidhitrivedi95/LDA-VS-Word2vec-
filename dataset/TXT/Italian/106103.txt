fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I like how the menu crosses continents.  It's nice to have options.  My husband ordered the ramen.  It's definitely tasty comfort food.  Nothing like the packaged stuff were used to.  I ordered jap chae.  It was a little salty do I marked them down a star.  It would have been nice if my noodles weren't swimming in soy sauce.  The waitstaff is nice but it took a while to get our check and I was starting to get bored since we already ate all of our meal.  To leave this review on a couple of positive notes, I liked the warm bread and sweet baguettes they bring out while you wait.  And the eclectic style of the restaurant was cozy.
