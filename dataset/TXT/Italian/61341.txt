aYjZc-3aVbPIPaJgGiUK_A I've tried Nostrano twice - once for dinner about a month ago and once, this week, during Restaurant Week, for lunch.  Both times the service was inattentive and slow.  During the dinner experience we were very disappointed to find issues with the food (capers where there shouldn't have been any and surprise pistachios in the salumi/pates - an issue with my allergic dining companion).  We were even more disappointed by the slow service.  A simple dinner took all night due to 20-30 minute delays between courses and a server no where to be found to redrinks, etc.  My experience this week for lunch was more of the same.  A lunch with reservations turned into 2 hours away from the office and we had to leave before being served the dessert.  What I've been able to eat I've enjoyed but I will not be back due to the experiences I've had with the service.
