0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw This is my favorite place to eat!!!! their garlic fries are to die for & they have the best chicken tenders i have ever had!!!!! i honestly wish they had one in ahwatukee because i would go there everyday!!

The only downside is during certain times, the lines are way too long! they either need to make ordering for efficient or have more cash registers.
