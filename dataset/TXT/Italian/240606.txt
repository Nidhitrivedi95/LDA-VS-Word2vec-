UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ These reviews are cracking me up. They must be family members who are trying to keep this place in business. Please, do not go here if you want anyone to take your order or even acknowledge your existence. And more importantly if you want to enjoy a good pizza. YUCK! I have never seen employees walk in as miserable to be somewhere as I saw them walk into this gross, smelly, boring restaurant. The dude answering the phone at the bar actually rolled his eyes at the person trying to make a reservation for 14. We went out of our way to come here; what a waste of a pizza night!!  Awful experience, and even worse food! So bummed we spent any money here. Won't happen again.
