aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw Our hungry party of 6, looking to be wined and dined Vegas style, were thrilled at being able to get a late night reservation via our bartender at Parasol Down in the Wynn.  What started out well, ended with two words....very disappointing. 

The single biggest problem was that it took way too long to get everyone's food. Two of us opted to splurge and go for the ultimate dining experience ordering the special Top Chef menu selections.  You would expect the Bravo Top Chef Menu @ $175 per person to blow us away right?  I wanted so badly for each dish to reach the Top Chef mark and be better than anything I've had the pleasure of savoring before, but it just never took me there.  

As each course was brought out, I could see the anticipation of the rest of our party, but because it was portioned for 2 we could not share the wealth so to speak.  Instead everyone else got filled up on bread and drinks by the time their entrees were served. We'd been promised "gifts of the Mediterranean", but at the end of the night it turned out to be the longest, most expensive journey on our quest for food perfection. It did not live up to the Vegas hype.  

I don't know who to blame for a lackluster and well below par Las Vegas dining experience.  Initially, there wasn't going to be any compensation for having our group of 6 wait for two plus hours for the main courses, but after speaking to the manager they comped 4 meals and only charged us for the 2 Top Chef menus.  

There were too many courses to mention and only a couple of stand out dishes.  Was the food fresh? Yes. Were the dishes authentic? Yes.  However, far too few pluses and several irking moments make it highly unlikely that we would return or recommend this restaurant when there are so many other great options to choose from.
