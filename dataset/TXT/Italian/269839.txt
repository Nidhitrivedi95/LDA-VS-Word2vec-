I ordered a pizza, my husband the spaghetti and meatballs. My pizza had no flavor, the crust was so chewy my jaw hurt half way into it and to top it off it was a $12 pizza. Maybe if it was cheaper it wouldn't have been so disappointing, but it left me wishing for a frozen pizza. My husbands dish was no better. As he twirled the pasta around his fork, watery sauce dripped everywhere. It looked like they didn't strain it enough and once they added the sauce it was just a runny mess. I saw the same thing happen to another man with a pasta dish a few tables away. Maybe it was just off night in the kitchen, but Charlotte has too many amazing restaurants for me to waste time going back here.
