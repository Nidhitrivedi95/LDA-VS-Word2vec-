lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ Forewarning, I am an Italian American, who had high hopes for this restaurant. The environment of this restaurant is cozy and unique. However, the food is comparable to cheaper restaurants, like Olive Garden ( I prefer Olive Garden). 
My shrimp and pasta dish (shrimp Florentine) had extremely small shrimp, that tasted previously frozen. The Alfredo sauce was bland with my fettuccine Alfredo as well.
The waiter was rude, didn't offer napkins,refills, or even bring us plates for our food until several minutes later. We had tipped him (over 15 percent) yet he didn't bag our "to go" food for us, which we saw him do for other customers. Disgusting. 

Overall, I will not be returning for the lackluster "Italian" food and subpar service. The only reason this establishment receives 2 stars is because the mozzarella sticks were good and the tiramisu was decent.
