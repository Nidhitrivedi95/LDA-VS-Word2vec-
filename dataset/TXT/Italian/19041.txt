2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg Glad we discovered that place. They have a very particular menu, very untraditional. I loved their strawberry champagne salad with chicken. It was amazing and very healthy. The coffee was very good too and they refilled it a few times. The service is quick and accurate. But the best part is the view. You can hang out at the patio and enjoy this beautiful Vegas weather. 4 stars because the place doesn't have its own restroom. You have to go outside and use a public one.
