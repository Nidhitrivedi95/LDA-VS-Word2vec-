OpNrObgtHgYijZYOU0yF-Q There's not much special about Joe Mama's, especially considering that it sits in Oakland among a lot of other average restaurants with lower end prices. I've been here several times due to its location and convenience, but I probably would not make exclusive plans to come here. Its food is supposed to be Italian flair, and it does have options ranging from salads to sandwiches to pasta, but I always felt that they are quite simplified, and their prices reflect that. I do like that their pastas are half off after 10pm though, which is nice for college students. The drawback is that they are so greasy that I wouldn't want to eat here more than once a month.

They have some neat mixed drinks, so they have that going for them. Also, it's a much calmer and quieter atmosphere than Fuel and Fuddle, so that may suit some people (although admittedly Joe Mama's bar isn't too impressive).
