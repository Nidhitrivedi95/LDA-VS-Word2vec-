ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag First time wife and I ever tried this place, we came for dessert after having a nice dinner. Waiter didn't ask us "dinner or dessert" just sat us. There were about 8+ open tables, server came by and we mentioned we only wanted dessert, she said we could move to the bar or we could eat at the table until she needed it. Completely insulting. 

We left.

Heard the pizza is good, will never know.
