sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg I've been here twice on Friday nights, once on the 1st floor to try the meatballs, and again on the second floor for pizza, pasta, and cured meats. Both times, we had to get on a waiting list for "45 minutes," when we could see that there were multiple tables open for 2. After 10 minutes or so, they call you up. They encourage you to use some app for getting in line, but I'm not sure why they give such an overestimated wait time. So, don't be discouraged if they give you a ridiculously long wait time!

The atmosphere - it's pretty loud, but you can have a conversation if you talk loudly.

The food:
1st floor - The meatballs are OK and reasonably priced. I got the spicy pork meatball slider and the beef meatball slider. Both meatballs were a bit dry. I liked the flavors in the spicy pork meatball - the beef meatball was a bit average, nothing special. I'm a bit curious to try their doughnuts, otherwise I won't be coming back here.

2nd floor - They use a lot of salt here. I tried a pizza, pasta, and the cured meats. I wasn't impressed by the cured meats, but the pasta and pizza were great. I wish they weren't so salty, but I would definitely go back to try more of their pasta and pizzas. TIP: the half pasta dishes are actually pretty substantial! I'd definitely get the half pasta for just myself. For two people, a pizza should be satiating enough, but you'd be full sharing a half pasta and a pizza. I'd love to go back with a group of 3-4 girls and to try a bunch of the half pastas together.
