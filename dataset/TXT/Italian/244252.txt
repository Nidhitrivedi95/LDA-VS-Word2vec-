USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg This was the third or fourth time we've been here and it was to celebrate our tenth anniversary so it was kind of a big deal for us. Every other visit has been nothing short of all around excellence but, this experience was not very good.

Starting off the service was not as good as it's been previously. They have always struck an excellent balance of letting you take your time but arriving right when you need something. Last night was a bit slow though. No big deal, maybe just a slightly off night. It happens. 

The food was excellent as always, no surprises there thankfully. The elk chop was fantastic as was my wife's grouper and lobster. The beignets were excellent as well. 

The wheels came off when a giant palmetto bug (that's a nice way of saying roach) ran down the window ledge next to our table. Now I should clarify we are inside the house, not on the porch. A bit off putting to say the least. In their defense there had just been a heavy down pour that apparently washed it out of its hiding place.

We quickly flagged down a waiter who tried to grab it with a napkin but, missed and it scurried down between the table and wall. We were promptly relocated to the bar with our drinks while we waited for the check and told "it's just a palmetto bug. The rain drives them out."

We then waited for a pretty long while for someone to come get the check. Finally I got up and took it to the bartender. He asked if everything was ok and I told him a giant roach just crawled down the wall at our table to which he replied "oh... it's a palmetto bug". We got our check and we're told "thanks for coming in, hopefully we'll see you again." And that was that. 

I'm not one to look for something for free but, really? A restaurant of this caliber and that's how you handle this? Very disappointed.
