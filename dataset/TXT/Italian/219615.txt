SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Great cow and service.  The dirty martini I ordered was pretty bad tasting. I should have sent it back but didn't. My mistake, but that's why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. In spite of the bad drink, I plan to return as the cow was wonderful.....and after all , that's why we went there in the first place.

Be sure to check out their Happy Hour pricing.  It's not just bar snacks...it's 1/2 price on many....if not most....of their menu items.  They have HH something like 4-8 PM and again after midnight.  I know the details are on their site, so check it out....and enjoy your meal.  It'll be a taster.  The place also has a low key Vegas retro vibe about it too.  Makes it a fun atmosphere  to go along with the excellent food.
