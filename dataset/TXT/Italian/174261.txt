nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g Went to Terroni on a Thursday night. It was busy but we were able to get a table no problem. 

Had the duck confit ravioli and affogato for dessert. The ravioli was super. My favourite part was the mushrooms. It was advertised as having butternut squash and figs , but I did not detect these flavours whatsoever. 

The atmosphere was lively and lovely

The service was seamless

The dessert ( gelato with espresso and chocolate) was the perfect light and refreshing  end to the meal. 

It is a perfect place to go if you find yourself downtown and craving carbs!
