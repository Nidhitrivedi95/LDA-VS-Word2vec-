UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ I've come here many times and have always had a great experience. However this time was a bit different. We ordered our food from the server in a timely manner and waited for the food to arrive. When it did one of the items was incorrect and I pointed this out to the service staff but was told no this is the item you ordered. After checking the menu it clearly was not. That was quite frustrating. No one checked back to be sure we were enjoying our food. When we were done eating we asked for some to go boxes. The server brought two boxes but nothing for the pizza. We waited 20 mins for the server to come back. We asked him for another box and the check. We proceeded to wait another ten mins before we were paid out and ready to leave. Very slow service and frustrated with incorrect items ordered.
