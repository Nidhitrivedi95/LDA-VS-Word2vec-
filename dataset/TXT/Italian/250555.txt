vOWLaMmDjvPLwqMh7_noHw One cut above basic diner grub, large portions, excellent value for money. We had three mains: Pork and chicken souvlaki and penne ala vodka. Everyone enjoyed their meal and the souvlaki was not soaked in oregano and oil, as can sometimes be the case at places like this. Never really understood the Greek tradition of two carbs [rice and potato] on a plate, but it certainly was filling. No room for desert and glad we didn't order appetizers...they could make more money with smaller portions, I believe.
 The layout was a bit odd; one big box in which the sound traveled easily. The service was prompt and polite, although I personally found it a bit disconcerting to see the owner/manager sitting at the bar checking out the diners and the waitresses...involved boss, I guess. The waitresses were all young, blonde and pretty...kind of reminded me of a Seinfeld episode where Elaine wondered how the waitresses in the cafe got their jobs. In the episode, it turned out they're the owner's daughters...maybe the same deal here?
