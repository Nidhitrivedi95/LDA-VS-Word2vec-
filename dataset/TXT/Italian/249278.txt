viji5rHhNlsy9w-JmUhyaw Typical Olive Garden. Not real Italian food, but definately tasty still. Love the soup, salad and breadsticks to go for lunch. I do wish that all Olive Gardens didn't use bagged lettuce and used fresh. Their chicken gnoochi soup is delish as well as their minestrone and pasta fagoil. Breaksticks are always fresh at this location. Staff is always nice and I love that even tho they don't open until 11, they are there to take your to-go order early so it is ready for pick up at 11 :)
