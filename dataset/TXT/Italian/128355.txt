HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA Our first visit was, unfortunately, terrible. They had a bunch of people call out sick and we ended up waiting over an hour with no food. Luckily, their owner contacted me after seeing a negative review and went out of his way to make things right. Now that I've tried the food, I'm thoroughly impressed. The crust was probably my favorite in town and the only thing keeping it from 5-stars is my personal preference for a bit more sauce on my pie ... it was just a bit dry for me.
