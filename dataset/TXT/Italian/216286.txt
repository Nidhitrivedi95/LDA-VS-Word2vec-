rsjrcxOIJm9VdkSNpkXZ9Q I was somewhat of a regular here since it opened, and this place has always been a hit and miss.

The cook and wait staff is constantly changing, so food quality, taste and portions are inconsistent.  I am not suggesting the food is not good ... just unpredictable, a gamble and inconsistent.

The service is always bad - rude staff, impatient staff, weird ordering system.  Sadly you have pay before you get your food/service, so tipping becomes very hard (so I give just 10% instead of the customary 15%).

I had complained once a year ago (on their FB page) and the owner/manager/staff/? responded by saying s/he will get back to be shortly.  S/he never did.  So I stopped going.

Recently my friends started saying good things once again, and after a few months I went back last Sunday.

Bad decision!!  I won't be back ever again and I decided to write this review on Yelp.  

Last Sunday my usual dish (Brocollini, Sausage and Penne) was overdosed with oil, and it tasted markedly different.  I also pre-ordered/pre-paid for an espresso and asked for it after the meal, and I had to ask 2 further times before I had to confront the staff one final time by threatening to leave.
