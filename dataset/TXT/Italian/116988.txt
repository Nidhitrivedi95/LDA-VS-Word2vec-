Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A I was in charge of "babysitting" my dad on a recent Friday night when my mom was out of town, I don't mind because it usually means I can score a free meal out of the deal, and this day was no exception. When I got the call to go eat, my dad wanted me to pick a place, Pomo is near my house and I had yet to try it, and my dad's last meal on earth would be pizza, so I thought it was a good choice. 

I got there at about 6:30 on a Friday night and the place was packed, but I was told I could be seated on the patio right away with a heater, so I opted to do so. Let me just say, that was one of my best decisions. The restaurant seating is very close together and with the high ceilings, it is very LOUD! I was at a table on the nice, quiet patio, near the door and the sound from just opening and closing the door was obnoxious, I don't think I would have even been able to have a conversation with my dad if we were inside, so my advice is to sit on the patio! 

Our server, Cricket, was very informative and walked us through the menu. While the menu isn't' that big, it does have quite a few items that are not normally on menus, so she was happy to explain. We both ordered pizzas, I can't remember the names, but I don't think it matters, because what made these pizzas was the crust and the cheese....and those come on everything! The oven cooks the pizza in just 90 seconds, and you are left with a crisp, chewy crust that is just divine! The mozzarella's freshness shines through, and the tomato sauce is just right. We both really liked our pizzas, and sadly had no room for dessert. 

I would definitely return to Pomo, but it will have to be when the weather allows for outdoor seating....otherwise, I will just have to stick to take-out! The owner Stefano, came over and chatted with us, it is always nice to see the owner in their restaurant, it really made us feel welcome, a true gem!
