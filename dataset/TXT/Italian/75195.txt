CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA Although this place isn't how it used to be, it is still one of my favorite pizza places in the valley. You can sort of tell when a place is getting commercialized and losing its touch and that's what I feel is going on here slowly but surely. I'm just going to ride the Venezia's wave until it completely fades. Still pretty good pizza....for now at least.
