0s1DqJlSSgR1Ftg9Q_HEOg good food, but bunch of cheapskates, they charge 50 cents for a refill! only on the strip you can get away with that! The son is rude, he doesn't bring my slices to me, he leaves it on the counter for me to pick it up when im dining in and just talks to his mommy, instead of improving the business, theyve been in business for 20 years but theres a reason the place is never sold out! A pizza oven should never be empty!
