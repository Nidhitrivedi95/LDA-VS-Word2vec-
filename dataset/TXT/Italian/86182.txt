The food is good - not spectacular, but consistently good. Personally, I find their apps/salads typically shine brighter than their entrees, so I usually will opt to just split a few apps with the table if I'm given the option. Service at the bar is always excellent, service at a table is always just okay. Overall, the cocktails and the vibe make Isabella's a must-try.
