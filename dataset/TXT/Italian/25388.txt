4IdcT63iE5fNrVzayZtKEw Valentino's is my favorite pizza place in Little Italy.  They use quality ingredients; the cheese and tomatoes are fresh and taste great.  The owner is very nice too, one of the times I went there he gave me a free slice of pizza while I was waiting for my pizza.  The subs there are also good, and a good value too.  Their large subs are good enough for two meals and are under $8.  All in all, good service, and good food.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
