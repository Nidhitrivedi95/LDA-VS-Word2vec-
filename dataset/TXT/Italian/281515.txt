YV2UPfovJZVKSEQjgTdbpA First visit and I will be back the next time I'm in town.  I asked the waitress which entree would bring me back for another visit and she recommended the pork chops. They offered these blackened.   These were presented over a baked potato covered with mushrooms and a gravy that was fabulous.  The pork chops were cooked to a perfect temperature and the seasoning brought my taste buds to life. 

Great job tonight Chef!
