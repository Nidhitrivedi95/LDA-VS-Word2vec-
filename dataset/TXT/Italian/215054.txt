RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ We did not have a reservation on a busy Saturday night but the hostess graciously found a table for us. The semi circular booths are not comfortable!
Our server was delightful and attentive throughout. Cocktails were good and reasonably priced.
So that's the good part.
Appetizers, Arancina was cold and tasteless. Crispy Calamari was not crispy. We were delivered a little pizza that we didn't order.
Caesar salad was good, We asked for anchovies on the side and for four diners, received four slivers.
And then the bread came?
Entrees. The flaming vodka was nicely presented but the gentleman pushed the cart away from the table so we didn't see 'the show'. Truffle pasta was so bland and veal dish, well I won't go there.
Here's the point. There was no seasoning at all. No herbs, no salt, no pepper. Just dollops of unseasoned and characterless food.
don't waste your time or hard erned money if you want anything remotely authentic.
