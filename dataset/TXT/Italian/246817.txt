v3AS5LGeV2Si4nOHZ7lgxQ I was a fan of Glass Nickel until this last experience. I ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu and upon eating the last piece my teeth crunched into something hard. I thought it was a chicken bone, which is understandable, but it was instead a piece of metal. Glad I didn't swallow that bite whole! 

I called the store that delivered the pizza and the staff apologized for the incident, even offering a credit for next time, which was good, but I wasn't confident in her follow-up for investigating how this happened, so I want to be sure it's not just covered up. Thanks Yelp!

Albeit I was probably unlucky with this, it still ruins this pizza chain for me. 

Advise to management: focus on improving practices in your ktichen so don't serve your customers metal-filled pizzas in the future!
