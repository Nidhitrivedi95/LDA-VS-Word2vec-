B9gUwTS1_Yzj2vajjC7Vmg been twice . recently went with my father and brother. for 3 of us, including service of £5, but with only 1 shared starter and no alcohol at all it was £90. it was airy, well presented, good sized portions, lovely desserts, but very expensive. agree with other reviews - dont go if you want romance, its too loud and open.
