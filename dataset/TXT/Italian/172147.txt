N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ I stopped by to get a couple of slices and a drink... I'm happy I did! 
This is simply the best tasting pizza you will find anytime soon. The crust had a crispy almost crunchy texture, the sauce was homemade with no added sugar and the entire pizza was cooked perfect. 
We went again today and tried the meatballs and also the Philly. The bread on the Philly was fresh and toasted, the meat was not oily or dry and the whole sandwich was very good. 

The meatballs... Don't tell my wife, (she is Italian and loves to cook) but they were better than homemade. They were moist and you could actually taste the Parmesan and the garlic...delicious! 

UPDATE: 3/20/2011 
We returned here because we were craving a great pizza and it appears there have been some changes at Biaggio's. Here's the skinny: 

1. It appears they are acquiring their crust from a new source. Usually, the crust is rolled thin and cooks crispy and has a good flavor. This pizza had a crust that appeared to have been rolled, and waited too long rising to be made into a crust. It contained excess amounts of flower which made it taste burnt even though it was undercooked. I also ordered a calzone just to sample how it was prepared. It turned out to be simply another over flowered too thick pizza crust that was folded and pinched on the ends. Again, it tasted burnt and appeared burnt, even though it was under cooked as the cheese was not entirely melted inside. 

I am only downgrading my rating from a 5 to a 3 instead of a 2 because the staff is very friendly, and the dining area and bathroom was clean. I know Mr. Biaggio can do better. It was great the first time we were there.
