l-Zjik0MbpabQPv-nNp9YQ My fitness pal says California sandwich and San Franciscos veal sandwich are over 1000 calories I don't think San Remos is that high. And I hope their Apple fritters aren't   I'm going to have to run a long way for this. It's worth it. If your gonna cheat this is the place to do it.
