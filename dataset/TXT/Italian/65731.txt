bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw Upon entering, my eyes scanned the restaurant. WOW! The interior is decorated with class and upscale taste. It is spacious, has perfect lighting, and displays a great balance of colors and textures. The upstairs area has its own bar, lounge, and patio with a fantastic view of Uptown! 

The staff are very friendly, attentive, and help make your experience feel VIP. I appreciated the friendly greeting from as early as the valet to the hostess and then to the server. 

We were invited here for a social gathering of wine and appetizers. The server was very helpful by describing each item. Delicious! The food, company, and atmosphere was a perfect combination for a lovely evening. 

To top it off, the bathrooms are made for one, spacious, and clean. Not the best lighting for touching up your face, but it is consistent with the rest of the ambiance. 

Great experience! Plan to take someone you want to impress or to pamper yourself. I will return and bring my favorite friends!
