KqxJcRmPEdiUTXHwsZcOZw It was our first visit to Annie's first impressions are good, we sat outside on the patio as we would like to bring our dogs here after a good walk, plenty of shade and lots of space (read tables are not stacked on top of each other)
The Caesar salad was very good, not too much and not drowned in Caesar sauce, they even came out on a chilled plate which to me makes a huge difference.  
Jason our waiter was great, very attentive even though he was the only one working the lunch schedule and you could see he was running to keep up.
Our main meal came out and I had the shrimp scampi over angel hair pasta, I must say the shrimps are huge and you get four of them in a serving, they were perfectly cooked too.  However the pasta was a little bland for me, after adding some salt it tasted better, but shouldn't the salt be added during cooking, I have never had to add salt to pasta, even at Olive Garden and I don't go there that much.
My wife had veal piccata over pasta and she said the same thing about the pasta needing some salt, her Veal was ok but she said she had had better.
I'm giving it three stars until my next visit and try and give them the benefit of the doubt.
