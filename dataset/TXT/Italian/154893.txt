I'm happy to say that Olive Garden seems to have redeemed itself. The breadsticks and salad taste like breadsticks and salad. They're now doing a 2 for 1 dinner special where you get one order of food at the restaurant and another full order packed in a to-go box. I opted for alfredo on site, and cheese ravioli to go. Happily, both were excellent. The alfredo sauce was garlicky and the pasta was cooked correctly. It even managed to stand up to microwaving the next day. The ravioli fared great and was delicious the next day as well.

The place was busy on a Saturday night, but the service was efficient and they looked to be holding up just fine. This place was LOUD though.
