Good view of the St Marks Square statue performances but pasta too salty to enjoy. 

Just realized that this was a pizzeria, so my review is one star higher considering we ordered pasta. 

FOOD
Had the Spaghetti alla Chitarra, Penne all Norma, and Broccoli. 

The only thing going for the spaghetti allá chitarra is that it had a bit of a kick. Each bite was a mouthful of sand, I don't think they even rinsed the clams. I think I may have chipped a tooth (jk). This was extremely salty, even more salty than my review.  Had we not been famished from exploring the strip all day, we would not have eaten it.

Penne allá Norma was decent, but not particularly memorable. Ingredients tasted fairly fresh. 

SERVICE
Friendly, attentive staff is the primary reason for the stars given.

ATMOSPHERE
Good place to catch the performances throughout the day, but Mercato della Pescheria next door has a better, unobstructed view AND a happy hour menu.
