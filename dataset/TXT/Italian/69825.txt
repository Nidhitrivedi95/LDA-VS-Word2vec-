By2DQwaG2EiOxsuHnS8FoA I really like this spot, it's too bad it's really only a weekday place given its location.  Love the chic decor.  Would say it's a great high end lunch spot if you're so inclined.  Usually where pitches or deals get struck  Drinks after work --- absolutely.  On Thursdays, especially (in the summer) but don't expect happy hour prices.  It's one of 4-5 Bay Street watering holes that have gold digging types trolling for minnows.  But what about the food?  It's a go.  Had the fish stew this week - very tasty. I only wish I had ordered 2 portions!  Definitely give it a try for lunch / dinner on weekday...especially in the summer --- great patio in the heart of Canada's financial hub.  +ives: decor, service, food; -ives: furthest from casual
