Went in today with a co-worker and placed our orders to eat there (that way I could make sure that my order was correct). Food was warm not hot when delivered to the table, not a great sign.....  Although it wasn't hot it still tasted good. When we were almost finished with our meal, I went to the front to place an order to go for a co-worker and the gal who took my order (Claire) wanted my name which I told her what it was but that I just wanted it delivered to my table since it was for a co-worker. She said so you want to eat it here?  I said no it is for a co-worker who is not with us and I told him I would bring him something back. She then said oh ok I'll bring it to you when it is ready so he can eat it here.  Seriously!  No ma'am I need the order TO GO because he isn't with us, I am taking it back to the office for him since that is where he is. Finally the lightbulb went off and she understood.  

Order was delivered to our table and I checked to make sure there was ranch for the salad (container wasn't even half full). There was no parmesan or red peppers for the slice of pizza and no napkins or silverware.  So I went up front and asked for these items and some additional ranch for the salad. Needless to say I won't be going back to this location (Raintree and 101) because they need some major training.

Went in today for the lunch special to go, placed order and then a group of guys came in and placed their orders to eat there. They all ordered lunch specials as well and I'm patiently waiting for my to go orders and these guys started getting their food delivered to their table. I saw what I thought was my order sitting under the heat lamps and nobody is even looking at them. Finally I was asked what I was waiting for and I told them the lunch specials I had ordered 15 minutes ago so they start scrambling to find my orders. Low and behold it was exactly what I thought the order had been sitting there for at least 5 minutes. The styrofoam for the garlic knots was melted and I'm sure the pizza slices were cold. They offered to reheat my slices and I told them no thank you I would like a new order completed so the food would be hot when I got back to the office. No problem they would do that right now. So finally it gets done and I leave and get in my car, the manager rushes out and hands me a card for a free lunch combo which was nice of her to do. I get back to the office and my pizza slice was WRONG. Not happy with the service received and probably won't even go back for the "free" special because they will probably make that wrong too. Very disappointed.........  Maybe it is my fault because I didn't check the order before I left, but come on they already had the order completed before so they couldn't double check it?  Wow!
