9Jn6MJZMz2R6rcszqmXDqg Went for a date there with Groupon coupons. Took me a while to figure out what to order with the deal's conditions. The maitre d was a really nice lady who explained repeatedly what options we had. Quality of food was excellent, wine was exquisite (the date picked the bottle) and service was pleasant. The only thing, which is kind of my fault anyway, Luci is quite a formal place and when I went, there were mostly established folks, so if you think about getting a table - call ahead and dress accordingly. Wish I wore my dinner jacket and tie to enjoy the experience completely, but hey, can't complain when a date goes well.
