UirWbEXBYqw9cE63Ph-Png This is the best Italian restaurant in the entire world.  I have never been to Italy but I assume if I do go, I will say "This food is great, but not nearly as great as Jimmy Daddona's".  I've been a patron of theirs for a long time - before they moved to the Enterprise Parkway area - and I will continue to be a loyal customer until the restaurant closes or the world ends, whichever happens first.  Why?  First, the garlic rolls.  Second, the Italian house dressing.  Third, the garlic rolls dunked in the house dressing.  Fourth, the aglio e olio white pizza.  Fifth, the veal aglio e olio.  Sixth, the chicken parmigiana.  Seventh, the fettuccini alfredo.  No eighth - I'm drooling.
