aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA A short review for Ian's. I've been coming here since before they changed locations. It's been consistent, it's been good.

Ian's is one case where I think less is more. Normally, I love to get outside the box and try the weird things on a place's menu. Here, though, their normal slices are painfully underrated in favor of their mac and cheese pizza.

The mac and cheese pizza is overrated, guys, it's tired. It's just not that good. Sorta boring.

Okay, I'm done beating up on Ian's, I swear.

The sausage with cheese is where it's at. Their pepperoni and mushroom is great too. Ham and pineapple is always a classic, too.

Don't get me wrong, their more eclectic offerings are always tasty. I remember a baked potato pizza they did once being one of the most interesting things I've tried, and the reuben pizza is always good too, when they have it (although you could make anything reuben flavored and I'd eat it right up!), the brisket and tots pizza is another fantastic option. but I really recommend not overlooking the less unusual offerings too, because they really can hold their own in Madison's sea of cheap pizza.

The end.
