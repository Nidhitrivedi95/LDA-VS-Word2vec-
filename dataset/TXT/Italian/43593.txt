81mlHKogQMh8E6f0r6AYTQ We've now eaten at Times Square five times for both lunch and dinner. The food is always very, very good. We've had pizza and cheese steaks for lunch, both very good. For dinner, we've had chicken Parmigiana, and several pasta dishes. All the food is very good. The service is my biggest complaint. Either they don't have silverware, or make a mistake with our meal. Any other Restaraunt that makes a mistake will either replace it or not charge you for their mistakes, not this place. They treat you like it's your fault. If it only happened once then it would be fine, but there is a service issue every time we eat there. Like I said, the food is actually very good, but the service is really bad. Will probably start going back to Bella Luna because the service is equally as good as the food.
