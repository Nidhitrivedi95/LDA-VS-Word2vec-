I ordered the calamari (It was PERFECT. breading. Not too greasy...) served up with marinara, a spinach salad (substituted the gorgonzola for feta), and a spinatella soup. Really enjoyed all of it, especially the soup which was an egg drop type of soup with lots of garlic and spinach. Yum!

The best part was that all the servers there were very friendly and attentive. Can't beat pretty good food and excellent service!
