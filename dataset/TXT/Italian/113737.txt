gIOpptgl57KGrOAFw_ViIw Considering I have never been to any of the Levetto establishments I had heard good things from my friends that it is a place to visit.

We walked in and there was NO GREETING what so ever. We didn't know if it was a seat yourself or a order first place, so we sat down at the first available table. That is when a waitress had come by and gave us menus -- when you guys are ready just go over there to order. Interesting interaction I must say.

Think about this. Three females, two pastas, three pizzas a salad and a bottle of wine. I must say we definitely wanted to try everything out! The gentleman who took our order was very pleasant and helpful. His input was most definitely appreciated. We ordered: Panzanella Salad, Bucatini, Carbonara, Patate Pizza, Funghi Pizza and the Affumicato Pizza. (Keep in mind we did it "family style" and we had the pizzas in a small size)

The best dishes based on our opinions were the Panzanella salad and the Funghi PIzza. They were both something I would return for because that would be a craving for me. The other dishes were just meh. I understand the pasta is made fresh *based on the video that had been playing on the TV) however I guess I may have had a bigger expectation. Please don't get me wrong, this is based on my own personal opinion (obviously) I just felt there should have been more flavour. I have had pasta downtown and there is definitely a difference. The pizzas were very underwhelming for me. The Affumicato literally tasted like a deluxe pizza that you can get a Pizza Nova or something. 

Overall, I would only go back for the two items. The waitress just seemed annoying if we asked her anything. For the reason I had to walk up and ask someone else for takeout containers..
