G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Excellent dinner event here tonight with 14 people in the private room. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. I have also dined in the main dining room on another occasion and also enjoyed the food, service and ambiance.
 The pasta is superb.. love the tortellini in the Gorgonzola cream sauce.  Everything from the antipasta to the final dessert was very tasty and cooked to perfection.  Our guests tonight said this was the best meal she had ever had.
