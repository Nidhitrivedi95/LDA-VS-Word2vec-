Sm2k1ijcnK17Ro5paN2_qQ Service is wonderful! The pizza is a great thin crust pizza. The cheese was def my favorite part, melted but not gooey!  Bonus the pizzaioli is a woman that clearly takes pride in her art! I love hole in the wall spots and this place looks one from the outside but the inside is cool. Def coming back!!
