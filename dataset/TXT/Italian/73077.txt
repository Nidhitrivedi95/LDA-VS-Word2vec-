CJvN2k3gjR7JspTx21icTQ We strolled in at 8:40pm on a Saturday night and staff was nice and friendly. I didn't feel the annoying eye rolls of us coming in so close to close. We ordered a medium four cheese pizza on regular crust and it really hit the spot. Delicious from the bread to the cheese, to the oil, to the spices. I'm kinda bummed that I've been in Cleveland for a year and a half now and I JUST found this place. Ah well, I'll make up for lost time!

I wanted to go back today for a sub, but alas, it is Sunday and they are closed.
