XxmziAeRqMKwsDjyyjVgeg Food: we tried the ricotta noodles and we were disappointed. It tasted like bland uncooked dough. We appreciated that our entrees came with shared bread and a salad on the side. However, it was a cheap/cold baguette, like you get from Walmart, while we were expecting it would be made from scratch in the kitchen. The salad had too much seasoning and was made with vegetables that were most likely coming from a can.

Atmosphere: we sat by the gas fireplace which was pleasant. However, we found the decoration ugly and messy. Guns, swords, skulls and pirates on the wall were clashing with the rest of the decoration.

Service: Worst service ever. The waiter was pushy and kept watching us. When it was time to sign the check, the waiter was standing next to us telling us how much we should give him as tip (seriously?) He checked what we put as soon as we stood up.

Avoid yourself the trouble, try another restaurant. Also check the pictures I posted with the menu for Friday night. Quite overpriced IMHO, with the cheapest entree starting at $21.
