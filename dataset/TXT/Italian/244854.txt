uwT7CppiYkek-Z-661sndQ Had lunch here in the summer and I've been meaning to go back ever since. I recently went for dinner with a co-worker for dinner and we both enjoyed our meals. I had a pizza and really enjoyed it - loved the chewy, crisp crust! My co-worker had the papardelle and said it was delicious. We also had a couple glasses of wine, which were well-priced and very enjoyable. 

I was very impressed with our server as he was extremely polite and knowledgeable about the menu, which I expect at most places, but don't always get. Will definitely return.
