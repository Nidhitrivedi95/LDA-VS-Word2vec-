GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA As with all my reviews, I go with what I actually experience and am not influenced by hype, name or any particular band-wagon of opinion, positive or negative. 

I loved this place. My wife and I were invited to a friend's event in Las Vegas and we had considerable time to explore different restaurants. This place was one of our favorite stops for dinner. The service was excellent but the food was exceptional. 

We started with the Roasted Kabocha Squash and Grilled Octopus. I can see why some may not be blown away by the squash dish - it's flavors are more delicate and I would describe it as an elegant dish. If you've grown accustomed to overly spiced or salted foods, this may not wow you, but I really enjoyed this app. The Grilled Octopus, however, was hands-down the best I've ever had. It had the most tender consistency, almost like swordfish and rather unlike the rubbery fare I sometimes encounter, even at highly regarded places. 

The Pork Trotter Ravioli was very good and my wife only let me steal a little, but I was happy to get what she shared. 

My dinner included an order of the Orecchiette and the Short Rib "al Barolo". Our server assured me the short rib would be so tender it could be cut with a spoon. He was not exaggerating. It was every bit as good as my mother's, which I have never been able to duplicate in the kitchen myself. 

Our dessert included an order of Spiced Bruciato and Limone di Torte, which was a fabulous end to a fabulous dinner. Worth. Every. Penny.
