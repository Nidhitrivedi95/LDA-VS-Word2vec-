LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw We have been here more than a couple of times, actually we were making it a Friday must for a while. Food is always good, from sandwiches to Lasagna. Wait on a Friday after 5pm is at the least an hour. Only complaint is that recently there has been a lot of new waiters/waitress's that aren't  as knowledgeable about the menu as we are...not a good sign!
