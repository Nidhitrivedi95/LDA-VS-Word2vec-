8ZaaUqIp_h__jUIoPfuVKA The food here is amazing, and the service I had on the particular night I was there was equally great.  I ordered the chicken parm and it was cooked to perfection.  Good wine list, with a lot of true Italian choices. I get that the atmosphere is not for everyone, tables are close together, and it is a little much on the decor, but I would hesitate to relate it to Buca-di-Beppo (which is pure garbage).  Our server was great, he even fetched a cab for us in the pouring snow, walking down to the nearest cross street to do so.  Not sure many other places would do that.
