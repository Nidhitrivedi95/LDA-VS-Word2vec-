cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ We've been wanting to try this Italian restaurant for months; and finally went there for dinner on a Friday night! The food was so stunning and FRESH! We ordered the organic fava bean salad, which came with blueberries and apples. The salad was so fresh that the staff literally sniped the bean sprouts from their own garden, and brought it to our table. We also shared the charred octopus and bone marrow scratched-made fusilli pasta, albeit it was not a original recipe (I believe the original creator of this dish is from Michael White's New York's Marea Italian restaurant), but it was tastiest and most stupendous pasta I've ever had! For my main entree, I ordered the traditional organic chicken Francese, and my husband ordered the Grouper special, both dishes were delicious! 

Chef Marc came over to our table and chatted with us, and what an animated and amicable character he was.  Most of the staff there (including the bartender, our server, the male Asian expediter, and the host) were immensely warm and FRIENDLY! We are looking forward to a future visit again.
