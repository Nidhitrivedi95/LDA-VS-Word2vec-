sByhyN_S2FgNnPl5pqY0Ow I hate to have to give, only 4 stares. All in all, the pizza was great. Wings, really really good, but..... , they were very small wings. Size does matter. Plus it was a one hour wait, for the delivery. That came from, just up the street. Time wise, a little excessive. But after all, it was still a great meal. And it was worth it.
