Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA How I didn't know about this place two miles down the road is beyond me.  Went tonight with a large group and was taken aback by this gem!  

I had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Portion was huge and took slightly less than half home.  Got to try all three desserts - I'm not a pudding fan so I won't comment on that particular one.  The doughnuts were HOT and soft inside like a pretzel.  Cobbler is normally not a fave of mine, but I could tell the berries were fresh.  Pleasantly surprised. 

Heard rave reviews at the table about the lasagna, but portion size was a little skimpy.  Also heard on past visits by others at the table that the pizza is phenomenal.  Will try next time!

This brings me to my last point: service here was excellent.  Genuinely friendly and overall great job.  Only reason I don't five star it is they never brought my side salad.  (Also no bread.  Pasta and no bread?)  Forgot to check the bill.  Hopefully it was left off.  

Make your way to this place if you've never been!  Great ambiance and a relaxed crowd with a little wait for a table by dinner time.
