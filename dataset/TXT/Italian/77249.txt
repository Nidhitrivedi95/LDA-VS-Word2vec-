cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA NOT GOOD. Service was awful, food was awful, disgrace to call this place Chicago style pizza. Manager had no idea what was going on, servers had zero experience or just didn't care. Almost every table around us was having the same issues. Maybe because they are new, but i've been in hospitality 15 years and this was just sad.
