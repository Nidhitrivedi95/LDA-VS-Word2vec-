GnODIDJz09LecpudDoynCg Went on a date here last night. The food was A+ and so was the lovely pregnant bartender, but our table service was subpar. First, as we headed to the bar, the hostess stopped us and said "table for 2" when we were obviously trying to have a drink. Her demeanor was just a little odd. Then, after we had drinks and were seated, we were forgotten about until we flagged someone down and asked if we could get a server (15 minutes?). Then, our meat antipasto came without meat until we asked. Odd experience to say the least.
