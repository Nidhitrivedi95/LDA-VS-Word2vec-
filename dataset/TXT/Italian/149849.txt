KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ We were at Caesar's already, so we figured this would be a good place to celebrate my brother's birthday. Our group of 8 was quickly seated in a friendly manner. Our server was very friendly, attentive, and sounded just like I would have expected a server at this place to sound. We all shared some of their famous meatballs, which were good, but nothing to write home about. I ordered their famous lemon chicken, which turned out to be perfect. The flavors in that chicken were so unbelievable, I made everyone at the table try at least a little piece. Others at the table ordered the Steak Gorgonzola, the Salmon with Lentils and Tomato Sauce, and the Chicken Scarpariello (chicken with sausage and bell peppers). The sommelier was very helpful, even with our apparent lack of vino sophistication. 
Everything was very good, but again, apart from my chicken, nothing to write home about...
I may have built this place up with all the research I had done on the Rao's in New York, so perhaps another visit will settle it...
Expect good food, great service, and a comfortable setting.
