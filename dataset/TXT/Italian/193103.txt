pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ First time at this place, and it is so close to one of the offices im sure I will show up again. We will start from dessert (the end) and work our way forward. The cannoli they make there is very tasty, so much I would be happy just coming into this joint for cannoli and coffee. 

I came during lunch so I took advantage of the lunch menu, and although when the dishes came out things looked small, they were far from it. It reminded me of strega nona and her endless pot of noodles. I ordered the spaghetti and meatball (1) for 5.99 and was truly satisfied.

The bread is tasty they bring out, nice and garlicky and full of butter. The server for our table was the bartender, she was very attentive and took care of us well. 

The other people in the party ordered veal parm and baked ziti, everyone was happy. :)
