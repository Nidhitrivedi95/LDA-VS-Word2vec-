7ZBh-3wWVQ5zkd6KZytW0g Came here for Sunday brunch with my family. Really enjoyed all the different food stations and food was quite delicious. 

We started with omelette station and breakfast food downstairs to worked our way to the lunch food upstairs. 

Overall the service is good. Had waive the staff down a few times to gets water refill. 

It's also missing a star because it's a bit chaotic on how/where to get food.
