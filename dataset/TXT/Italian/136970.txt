J1qzIVBt3lGpiz-8UdjhXg This was my second time eating at OSF, the first being about 7 years ago, but I had good memories so I was pretty excited. We had a group of about 60 going out for dinner after an event, and after two other restaurants couldn't take our reservation, OSF popped into my head as an option, and luckily they were able to take our group on a few days' notice. 

I talked with the managers a few time to figure out what would be the best plan of action for our large group, and we decided to do the family style dinner that was a flat charge per person, with bread, salad, pasta, and ice cream for everyone. We were seated in the banquet hall which is pretty nice at 3 long tables, and we had to wait a few minutes but they started to get everything rolling out pretty quickly. I have to say everything tasted great, by far better than a similar deal at *cough bucco di beppo cough*. I think everyone got their moneys worth and then some. 

The only reason I have to give them 4 stars instead of 5, is because when making arrangements, I was told that we would be able to have separate checks. Well, at the end of dinner, we got one check that we had to split amongst everyone, which ended up being a minor pain. But the servers were super nice and did the best to make the process easy and painless. I'll definitely be beck
