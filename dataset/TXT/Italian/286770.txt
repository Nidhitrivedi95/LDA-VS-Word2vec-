zINKP9rtvo2IUKTZoYJUvQ Everything was very good about this restaurant from the food to the ambience to the wait staff. It was all outstanding. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the issue with the bread. Every other Italian restaurant I've been to, the bread and oil is complimentary. Here, they charge you $3. Now, I'm not complaining about the price, but just the fact that they actually charge a fee.  And the bread is just OK, at best.  Also, because we had to pay for it, we felt the need to devour all of it, which is something we usually don't do. But that aside, we really enjoyed the restaurant and will most likely be back.
