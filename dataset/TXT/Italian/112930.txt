Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg Being in TV Production means working excrutiatingly long hours and often terrible food. After 12 hours on the job and one shitty meal under the belt I started to crave pizza. Wanting to do right by my crew I ordered 10 pizzas from Metro for my hard workers. We got everything from the sausage lover, pepperoni, to the crazy spinach one, and MAN, did people scarf up those pizzas like it was their dying meal. 

We did that 6 nights in a row and it never got old. It was so delicious that I'm salivating right now thinking about the pizza all the way from Los Angeles. I will say that the one pizza that didn't impress was the margarita. It was very thin and extremely dry/crisp. All the other pizzas were fabulous, fold over types, like true NY crust. 

For once I really wish the old adage wasn't true:  "What happens in Vegas, stays here." Please come to LA. Period.
