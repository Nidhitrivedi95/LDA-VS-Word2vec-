aal0SiXVRmUoM20A1m7xDw Ginger beer.... did you say Ginger beer.  OMG!  The specialty cocktails, while are limited, are damn good.  I love the Moscow mule which contains vodka, ginger beer, and some other good stuff.  I would go back to this place purely for this.... but wait the food is actually pretty good too!  The DH and I went here with a group of friends, so we ordered quite a bit, and shared everything.  So I'm pretty sure this place has some good food, and I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews?  We ordered the Shepherd's Pie, Fish And Chips, P.E.I. Mussels, Roasted Beet Salad, Scallop's, and Crab Cakes.  Each dish was better than the next.  My favorite was definitely the scallop's and the fries on the fish & chips entree.  The only thing I disliked was the batter on the fried fish, it was not crisp!  For shame.  The place is very unassuming, you would never think that they serve such fantastic food.  Give it a try!
