epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ I was really looking forward to visiting Little Italy and decided to try a new place. I got a parking spot right on the side of Mia Bella and sat down at one of the outdoor tables on the sidewalk. They bring me water and the menu. I am ready to order when the stuffy Hostess comes over and says "did someone seat you" I said "no I sat myself" shw said "I'm sorry we only have opening at the bar" I said "I wanted to sit outdoors" she says "we don't have enough wait staff" yet there were customers sitting 2 tables away. So I walk across the street and sit at their outdoor tables. 10 minutes later Miss Stuffy Hostess sits a couple at the table I was just at. I had a great pizza across the street and the owner came out twice to check on me.I won't be back to Mia Bella anyyime soon. But La Dolce Vita has earned my business.
