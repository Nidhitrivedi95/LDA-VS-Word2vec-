(I really like it!)

I had passed by this place for 6 months, never really thinking about going inside.  It was date night and our FAVORITE Italian place (where they called us by name for the last 14 years) had closed and we were really craving REAL Italian, not Americanized, chain food.

We were not disappointed!
We always try the Caesar Salad, love a good one, and will leave a so-so one to wilt.  Theirs was packed with flavor, intense but not over done- we enjoyed every last bite!

The bread sticks were soft, and would accompany a soup well, but not really dip-able for olive oil and balsamic.

We each ordered the Linguine with shrimp, roasted red peppers, and scallops in a cream sauce, something I hate to do because I love trying different flavors, especially from a new place, but it sounded good and was SO OTTIMO (FANTASTIC)!  The shrimp popped, the scallops so tender, but the cream sauce was really the star of the show!  So well developed, rich and smooth!  The portions were huge and even though we kept taking bite after bite, the bowls looked full even at the end.

On top of it all you have this amazing view of the Strip, so unexpected, but along with the soft lighting and the friendly waiters, was just great!

About $80 for the two of us.
