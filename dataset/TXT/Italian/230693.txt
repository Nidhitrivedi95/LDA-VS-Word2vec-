TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag We went to Buca on a Monday night, it's a favorite restaurant for both of us. I have never had worse service anywhere. Our waiter got a bigger table and pretty much ignored us. He never brought us bread, he didn't even bring out our food. When the food did come out, the waiter almost dropped both of them until another waitress helped him and then slammed the plate down on top of my phone and wallet, with no apology, and walked away. We still hadn't gotten the refill and water we asked for at this point. Our original waiter decided to make an appearance and my boyfriend asked him to finally bring us our bread that we should have gotten 45 minutes earlier. We asked for the check and he forgot to apply the $10 discount for the coupon I had given him. Then when he came back to box up our leftovers, he dropped the entire plate on the table, shattering my wine glass and pasta flew all over the place. He was very apologetic, and then brought out our check again. After horrible service and shattering a wine glass and having pasta spill all over, he didn't even comp us the $2 side of Alfredo sauce my boyfriend asked for. Absolutely ridiculous.

UPDATE:

After reading this review, I was contacted by the manager and received THE BEST customer service ever. Craig was extremely apologetic and just an overall sweetheart. He offered to send us something in the mail for our next visit to Buca and we accepted. The next time we're in Vegas, we will be giving this Buca another shot, just because of how awesome Craig was. Thank you Craig for your great customer service!!
