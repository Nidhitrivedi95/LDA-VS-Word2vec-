SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg The food at lago is quite exquisite though their hostesses could use better training. We made a reservation for a group of four two days in advance and when we got there we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated though the place really wasn't full (we only stayed because we'd heard good things). We decided to order a bottle of wine while we waited for our table and what an ordeal that was! The hostess took us to the bartender who then said we needed to wait for the wine server, who just came out with an iPad full of wine selections that they actually didn't have on the premises but they will have at some point. Eventually we did find a bottle of Riesling after about 4 tries and then we were seated at our table. Everything was good, I'd like to give it another try when their service is together.
