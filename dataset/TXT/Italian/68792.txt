BtLDbNfpwdwHSmyBJF2-RQ Slowly making my way through the fine dining restaurants around Aurora/Markham/Richmond Hill areas.  Sarpa was definitely one on my list. Had a birthday celebration dinner with my family here last night.  The place was very cozy and definitely a nice place to come with family and kids.  To start off, they served us warm toasty bread that was very flavourful.  I had the sea bass fish fillet and it was very good  - perfectly grilled served with mashed potatoes and vegetables.  My mom ordered the lamb chops and she said it was delicious.  I also had a tasting of my daughter's dish, creamy chicken mushroom pasta, Pici Toscana which was very tasty.  However the other 2 dishes my family ordered, the veal parmigiana and the beef tenderloin was only okay.  Throughout the evening, the service was excellent and we had a great time.  We will definitely be back.
