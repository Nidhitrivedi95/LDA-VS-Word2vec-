WPV0ucYjnb2HOrNxSopv6A I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Hawthorne's.  It's the perfect place for a meal in the springtime because of their massive patio.  The salads were fresh and the pizza was great.  You get a lot for your money.  Also, while I didn't get a chance to try the garlic knots, they looked awesome! I will definitely go back.
