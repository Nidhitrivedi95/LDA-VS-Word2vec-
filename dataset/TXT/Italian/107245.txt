Fw7gmmKiHVbBBjJ00mN0WQ Of the various Pizza Huts I have been to, this is probably one of the poorer branches. The quality of the food is pretty standard across the chain in my experience - you know what you are getting, and this is the case here as well.


 The main issue that I have had with this branch, however, is the the quality and speed of service, particularly for the takeaway side of the restaurant.


 You can usually expect the amount of time taken to get your food from the takeaway to be at least double the standard 15 minute wait that you are usually quoted when you order.


 This would be forgivable if the staff were rushed off their feet but they seem to to spend an inordinate amount of time chatting in groups.


 On top of this they have 'lost' our order on more than one occasion and I have seen it happen to others whilst I have been waiting.
