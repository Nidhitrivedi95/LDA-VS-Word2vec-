xjjxHavx4RIiW6zS6rasGA My first dinner here: Chef's Board Artichokes, Marinated Olives, Italian Salami, Parma Prosciutto, Fontina & Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella 12
Zin Braised Short Ribs Asiago & Spinach Gnocchi 20
The chef's board is huge! That should be shared with 4 people. The short ribs were moist and very delicious! We shared both and were very full! I could've just done away with just the entree. They also had live music :)
