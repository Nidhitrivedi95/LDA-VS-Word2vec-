5nZVVPO_cYH9aQeClTP9zA Today my brother and family came in for a quick birthday lunch. The food was excellent, but more importantly the service was particularly noticeable. Perry, who took our order, delivered our food and quality check us and brought boxes. It's refreshing to have attentive and consistent service at a place where it's unusual order and take a number. Very impressive. Thank you so much for making it that much more special!
