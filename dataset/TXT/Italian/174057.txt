nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g Being a former court house, the decor of this place is amazing. It's like a baby of an interior designer and Italian chef. Unfortunately we did not have a good time here. It was dinner time, we understand it's busy but the noise was through the roof. At the same time, service had hit rock bottom. It took 30 minutes for the waiter to come get our order and another 1 hour and 30 minutes to get our food. The table beside us changed 3 times while we were there. Food was not freshly made at all. Compare to the Queen St. location, my husband and I were utterly disappointed.
