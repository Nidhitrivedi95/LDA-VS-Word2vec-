fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w Straight off the plane we were headed to the High Roller only to realize that it didn't open for another 30 minutes. So we stopped in here for a bite to eat and the food was awesome! I had the M.O.A.B. Burger with bacon on the side and waffle fries. My husband had the Lamb Gyro Cheesesteak which blew both of our minds! He also had the truffle fries which were really good. We sat at the bar and the bartender who's name I have forgotten was very nice, chatted with me about football and baseball and was all around very helpful. If you're nearby definately check this place out!
