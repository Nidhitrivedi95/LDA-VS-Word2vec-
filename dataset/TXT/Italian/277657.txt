YIW9EccX6isxy5NE6D5wSQ For only $8 I got one of the biggest portions I've ever received of penne in a rose sauce. On top of being incredibly cheap, the food is beyond amazing! Everything I've tried is delicious, the pizza being my favourite, and the whole atmosphere is pure Italian! The owner is very sweet and says a friendly hello whenever I'm in there. My only complaint is that there's no website so I never know the store hours and I always seem to call when they're already closed. Also they don't seem to be open very late which sucks when I want to order a late night pizza.
