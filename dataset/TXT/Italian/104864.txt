fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ I gave two stars because our server was nice and we were seated immediately. The service was extremely slow. We had the Pasta Milano and the Chicken parmigiana. The Milano was bland with little sauce, so it was dry. The chicken parm was OK. They pound out the chicken so when they cook it, it becomes overcooked. There wasn't enough sauce. The roasted potatoes were pleasant, a little salty for my personal tastes. I just don't think its worth the money they charge.
