iJpTpE9A8WDWvUlvUcFZuA It was a beautiful afternoon in November, who could say no to eating outdoors?! Went for lunch. I got the Mediterranean pasta. The portion size was good and the quality was delicious! My husband got the crab cakes. We're not familiar with crab cakes, but the people we were with said they were the best they've ever had. The rolls were sourdough, my favorite! 

This was my first time eating in Piedmont Row. We ate out on the patio to enjoy the sun and watching all the other people doing the same. There's a great fountain in the middle of a variety of restaurants...makes it feel high end. Atmosphere was beautiful. 

The service was great! It made for an easy afternoon and I could have stayed there all afternoon. 

Bathrooms were spacious, clean, and private.
