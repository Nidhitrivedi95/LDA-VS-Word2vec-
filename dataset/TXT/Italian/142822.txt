JS24kvJ0I5fWWEuplEiZjg The soup was fantastic today hearty and definitely not from a can.  I especially enjoyed the garlic bread. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and was promptly warned that it would be 10 minutes to get it since it would  be made fresh.  My wife ordered the caesar salad and said the dressing was good but thin. The Ravioli that my wife ordered sadly was not well drained so the sauce was a bit thinned down which was a bit dissapointing. The Fettucini Alfredo was good but it did not knock my socks off. The noodles were a bit more al dente than I would prefer and the sauce was was less creamy than I have come to expect. Overall the service was good and I will be going back to try other dishes.
