3eeAyVgdYTO2w5owlbTnVQ A charity function was held at this place. I will say they do have courteous staff. I dont think they were expecting the amount of guests that were confirmed (100 plus?). Their Pizzas are ok, The salad looked good. The waitress did mess up our orders, but luckily she gave us a discount. If it wasnt a function, I think the service wouldve been better. I needed a refill of my drink and I basically got the refill myself. 
They do have a good variety of foods. The only negative of this place is No Dessert. After the acidity of tomato sauce, I was looking for something sweet to neutralize it. 
Hey theres always DQ, right next door to them.
