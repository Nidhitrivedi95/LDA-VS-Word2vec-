1ogvimeoaaGcQswzX-90dQ Went to dinner with some friends and was not impressed the drink prices were good but the food was not as described and not worth what they charged got the burbon glazed salmon it was 18 bucks came with a salad which was the best thing of everything. The salmon looked like I went to aldi got frozen pieces of salmon cooked it and put spicy BBQ sauce on it . My gf got a chicken dish which said it was rolled with cheese and baked sounded like it would be a whole piece of chicken rolled up with cheese and pancheta with pasta . Instead it was more chopped up chicken mixed in Alfredo with bacon not even close. Someone needs to go back to cooking school sorry can't pawn things off for what they aren't
