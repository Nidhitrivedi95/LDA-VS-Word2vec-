K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ I actually accidentally stumbled upon this place post-dinner and mid-gambling. When I walked by it was only 8pm ish so Hyde was still a lounge. The GM (I'm guessing) spoke to me and seemed quite friendly. He put me on their guest list after a small conversation and welcomed my friends and I back for free as long as it was before 12. I was also able to walk around inside (during this lounge period) to survey the environment/atmosphere. I'd say Hyde is a very pretty/classy/upscale-esque club but on a small side. The lounge has a view of the Bellagio fountains which I thought was so romantic and beautiful. I'd def come back for an intimate night here with my s/o or a small group of friends. It's not a very go-crazy-wild club I feel like....
