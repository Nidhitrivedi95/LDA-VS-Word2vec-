3yMmo1sERpks50quoaA8PQ Ate there  sat nite with my mother.  Very dissapointed!  Server acted like she was bored, food barely mediocre!  Ordered stuffed mushrooms  they came swimming in some sort of Alfredo  cheese sauce,  we expressed our dislike of the mushrooms and our server looked at us as though  something was wrong  with us! Instead of offering to remake  them to our liking or offering to bring us something different she just took them away. Main course was deep fried veal steak again smothered in tomato  sauce on a bed of spaghetti noodles not very appetizing. The server asked if I was done 5 min after I received  my food!  My mother had ravioli which she found  not to her liking.  I guess the one bright spot was desert, we had creme brulé. And coffee it was pretty  good, but not enough to make up for an over all poor experience,  A waste of $68 , the server was lucky I left her $5  Do yourself a favor  and look for Italian  food elsewhere.   One star is too much
