Y6WzOH0Zv8vu-H78_b6ghQ This was my first and last time ordering from here and I am very disappointed.  I honestly think the owners have friends, family, or themselves write reviews for them on this review site and others. This place is not glamorous nor are other small restaurants that I've ate at that has good food, so the appearance isn't most concerning to me. Now the food is another story.  The only good thing from this visit was that the lady over the phone had an attitude when I was asking her about how many flavors you can get with sertain quantities you order.  I was looking to order 100 but her attitude changed my mind and I order 50. Man did she do me a favor!  Wing sauce make the wings and as long as you dont under or over-cook them actual wings your good.  I assume they fried the wings that morning and maybe flash fried them again when an order is placed.  The wing sauce taste like standard bbq, etc sauce you buy from grocery and rolled around in sauce after fried.  I ordered 50 for a small gathering for Superbowl Sunday and about 40 was uneaten and trashed honestly.  After they tried one they put the rest back...just horrible!!  I should of requested a refund but the initial attitude from the lady on the phone wasn't worth the hassle.  I'll take it as a lost. They are normally not opened on Sunday but they did for Superbowl.  I would say to anyone that dares order from here to try a small order of 10 or less so you don't waste too much of your money.  Their wing prices are reasonable, but wings are not.
