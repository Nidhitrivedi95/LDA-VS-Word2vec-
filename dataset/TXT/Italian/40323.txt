7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Went here for my 22nd birthday dinner with four friends. We were excited for a night of Las Vegas's magical cuisine. This place really delivers!

The waiter were so knowledgeable about everything being placed on the table, in or around us. It almost became to much, when explaining specials, their presentation, and suggestions they were very long winded. I guess I felt like when deep in conversation with close friends, give us some space. But really, I'd rather have a wait staff over doing it than under doing it, so I can't complain too much.

The restaurant is huge with really expensive looking art and furniture. Dark toned brown leathers it felt grand. Deep red paint covered most of the walls and creme linens lined the tables. I felt comfortable with the table set up and comfy chairs. It was exactly how I imagined dinner with Tony Soprano would be like. This Italian steakhouse made sparks fly for me. 

For entrees I got the beef carpaccio and the fried calamari. Everyone enjoyed those tasty dishes. I ordered the Filet Mignon, The waiter said it was hormone and antibiotic free, sounds even better I'll take it. When my Filet finally came out I was starving, I didn't wanna fill up too much on the super bread! Oh heaven's me, I was on cloud nine. It was perfectly seasoned with their own blend of sea salt, pepper, and rosemary. I will always come back.
