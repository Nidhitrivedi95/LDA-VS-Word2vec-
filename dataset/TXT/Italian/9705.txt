0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg The boys and I had a very good, relaxing meal here last Friday night.  Very nice restaurant in Cosmo restaurant row. Place is classy but not the least bit stuffy. Like everyone mentions, the bread selection is great. Mini Stromboli's w/ sides of marscapone, tomato/garlic...really good. Went through several of the pasta dishes for the table to begin. Duck and Foi Gras Ravioli, Risotto w/ short rib and Short Rib and bone marrow angolotti all good to excellent. Nothing better than home made pasta. Polenta w/ truffled mushrooms might have been even better that the pasta dishes...must try! I had the Veal Loin and Pork Belly. The loin was a bit dry, but flavorful..the Pork Belly was spectacular.  Friends had steak and halibut, all were very happy. Wine list is amazing..tons of Italian wines...pricey! Found a good bottle for around $100.  Overall, pretty reasonably priced meal for Vegas.  Good stuff Scott!
