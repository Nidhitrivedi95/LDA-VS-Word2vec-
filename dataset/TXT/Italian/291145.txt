They would do fine just sticking to pizza but a while back they had veal parmigian on the menu and It was recommended to me by the waitress, she said all the pastas were amazing. It was terrible to say the least, an obvious microwave meal. It was floating in some watered down sauce I told my waitress immediately and they did nothing about it. I still had to pay for it too, no one gets a pass with these guys. There's to many places to choose from to waste your time here.
