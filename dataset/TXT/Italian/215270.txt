RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ Took a chance and tried this place out last Saturday night. Made a reservation on Open Table and they easily accommodated us on a holiday weekend. Upon arrival our hostess was very friendly and gave us a nice booth big enough to accommodate four but there was only two of us. That was fine with me as I enjoy sitting in a roomy booth. The dining area is really pretty and calming. Although we did not sit at the bar, it looked like a place you could sit and enjoy a nice cocktail before dinner. We were greeted promptly by Brandon and he quickly brought us water and took our drink order. We viewed the menu and both of us ordered the gnocchi. This is a dish which I find to either be really good and or really bad. I enjoyed a mediocre caesars salad as side. As for the wine by the glass, what a let down!  I originally ordered a glass of Sangiovese, and my friend opted for a glass of Cabernet. When I tasted my wine, I immediately sent it back. I consider myself to be a pretty good judge of wine and this just didn't measure up to many other Sangiovese wines I have enjoyed in the past. Brandon was understanding and brought me a glass of the Cabernet. Once again, not real tasty but I drank it anyway. I understand that a lot of times when you order by the glass, the wines are usually not the greatest but their list is truly a disappointment. Ok, on to the food. My gnocchi was ok, a little too much sauce and not a lot of flair. My friend ordered the same dish so I have no additional opinion to offer on other dishes. We did order a sample plate of their desserts which came with biscotti cookies, sugared donuts in a nutella like sauce and a delicious sorbet. We could not finish the whole thing so I brought it home for the family. I cannot complain about the service. It was extremely on point. From the waiter to the bus boys, everyone was hustling and keeping people happy. If I return, it would be because of the service.
