6rjqU2x9A6BErUxh6THz6A We were ISO cold meat sandwiches and found Vinny-Boys via a Yelp search. 

My partner ended up with a hot dog, but I selected the Italian sub. Vinny's uses Boar's Head meats & cheeses ensuring consistent (if not always high) quality flavors. The small Italian-style sub roll was fresh, chewy, and not huge. The sandwich was high on vinegar flavors and low on oil. Otherwise the quantity of toppings was perfect. They are feeding average eaters here, not Olympic-style all-you-can eaters. I like that. 

The deli, which also sells beer, wine, Italian imported dry pastas, locally made frozen pastas, canned goods, oils, cookies, etc., has several tables for dining-in--giving the place a neighborhoody/familial feel. I liked that too.

As a matter of fact, we were greeted by a gentleman who I assume was the owner. He chatted us up a bit as we made our choices for lunch. This interaction was authentic and welcoming. I especially liked that.  

We left with full bellies and several pantry items including a little jar of fresh pears soaking in balsamic vinegar. 

Visit Vinny-Boy's and pick up a Tastykake...I totally forget to get one. I Did Not like that-doh!
