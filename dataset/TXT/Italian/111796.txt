G8vo5r543nQyTC24VNpBIg Had to revise.  We ordered delivery while packing.  Finally, after two hours of waiting I called the store. They claimed it was just going out? What. The. Hell. It should not take two hours to put together some spaghetti and a ham sandwich!

By the time it arrived, it was two and a half hours late. The delivery guy called said "Uh, lady there is no third floor apartments here". I said "yes there is" and hung up on him, I was so mad! Finally he knocked on the door, handed me the food on it's side, and dripped runny red sauce all over my new rug.  His response? "Lady, there is red crap dripping out". SERIOUSLY???

The food would've been good, but it was icy cold and congealing together. Not one apology was given. I will NEVER order from these food f*cktards again.
