BgZQzQlK5XB0hflgTl-3uw I'm a sandwich fanatic, so I had to try Penn Station. This place has fantastic bread, which is certainly a necessity for a sub shop. It offers a nice variety of subs - even two vegetarian options, a grilled veggie and a grilled artichoke. I really enjoyed my grilled vegetarian sub and my husband enjoyed his chicken parmesan sub.

All of the employees were friendly and helpful, seeming happy to be there. One of them even recommended that my husband and I share a medium order of fries instead of each of us getting a small, so that we could save money. That's not something you see often in an industry that loves to upsell.

This location is too far to go for lunches, but I'll absolutely go to the one on South Boulevard.
