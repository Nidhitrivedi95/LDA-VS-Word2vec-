pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Expect to wait. Sunday at 9 pm room about 45 minutes for a table. I gave waited up to 3 hours! 

Was served bread and oil immediately and the bartender was awesome!

Best pizza in America according to many including Oprah! 

Menu is basic my favorites are the marghertita and sonny boy but I have experienced the entire menu and love them all! One pizza has a TON of great meat.

I love this place
