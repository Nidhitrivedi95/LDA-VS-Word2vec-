y1esDY2vFyaTMf1YlRT7ZA We didn't have the pizza so I can't comment on that it did look good though. 

The only reason we went here was because of a $15.00 off deal and even with that it wasn't worth it. 

The ravioli was cold, the meatball was like warm as well. The flavor on both were very bland. 

The rigatoni was also bland, and the meat included with it was very dry. 

The staff was great on the other hand, just the food was in no way there.
