vQWVP7MtpgXFwUMvxCj9Tw I was famished after a day of playing tourist and stumbled into the Ellis Island Casino, where in a little corner, you will find this Pizza place.
I had heard from the shuttle driver that the pizzas are yummy and yes, that is so!

Thursdays are buy one slice or pizza and get one free. Same thing on Sundays too. I watched as dazed gamblers would rouse themselves from all their slot action and stumble over to Metro and grab a pizza slice and beer. There is a little area now with three booths that the under 21 crowd can chow down at. Otherwise, a sign does warn that around the corner is 21 and up only. That's because there are enormous vats of beer brewing right behind some windows. I guess Ellis Island brews it's own, which is brewing sustainably. 

The pizza's are DELICIOUS! I had the Supreme slice and it was loaded with every good thing! In fact the piece of pie was so top heavy with ingredients that I could not lift it up to my mouth to eat, so I rolled it and thought to myself, I am going to get a heart attack from this, but I will die happy! I also ordered a 16 oz. cup of their brewed on the spot light beer and it only cost $1.75 for a cup. Also had the antipasto salad made on the premises and it was unholy good too! After pulling out the onions and peppers, it was full of slices of meat and cheeses with a wonderful Italian balsamic dressing.

Deducted 1 YELP STAR for surly service from the bored-looking cashiers.  But forget about feeding the sluts... I mean slots.. at this Casino. Just go for the pizza action!
