AheA5X4tjY9Amih0yQ8wIw I came by for happy hour, so I can't speak to the entrees.  Not a bad overall vibe to the place.  There's a good decor, nice bar, and the value is there.  For $5 they have various happy hour appetizers and the frequently mentioned burger.  In addition, there's $4 drinks.

We tried a few different items and most were pretty good.  I'd recommend the potato croquette and the bruschetta wasn't too bad.  I'd skip the artichoke dip variety though as it was a little too creamy and not hot enough.  There were some other things ordered I wasn't blown away by anything.  

In regards to service, the bartender left a little something to be desired.  He kept walking away after we'd order one thing.  For instance, I'm trying to order two appetizers and he beelines away after the first item is mentioned.  Maybe stick around and see if anything else is needed.  Maybe it was a short term memory issue and he needed to go put the order in before he forgot.  In that case, that's sad but he just get a notepad a la "Memento."

Everything was good overall and I look forward to coming back to try out some of the heartier kitchen options.
