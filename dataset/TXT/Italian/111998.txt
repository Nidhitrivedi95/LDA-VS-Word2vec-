g9iIBuh-g4ld3w3kUWLMqw my girlfriend and i have become regulars here, coming about 3 times a month. servers always recognize us, even remember our order! for an establishment downtown that sees so many people this is amazing to me.  
the pizza is always great and i'd kill someones mom for the alfredo fries. highly recommend
