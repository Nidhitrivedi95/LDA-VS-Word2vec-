G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Giada's restaurant was very disappointing , the service was terrible because the bartender was in a bad mood because his coworker didn't show up, basically I paid $15 for "what looked like" an once of cheese which wasn't even served with bread!!! When I complained they said that the bread cost more money and they tried to please me with a pita cut into four slices!! The I ordered the olives-that's all you get I don't mind spending $90 for lunch in Vegas if it's worth it and this place isn't when I walked out of this placed I cried because I was so sad
