bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw I was really excited to try Vivace after being in Charlotte for almost three years.  We were a little underwhelmed.  First off the prices and menu are slightly different then the one online.  I'm Italian and cook spaghetti for Sunday dinner every week so I know the cost of homemade spaghetti.  Online the price was $12 dollars which is a healthy price.  At the restaurant it was $17 dollars which I find a bit high when it was about $2 dollars worth of noodles.  There was also lot of pumpkin on the menu, which I find to be more of a fall ingredient then spring.  We did LOVE the white bean spread for the bread.  We had a vegetarian dining with us who ordered the Pumpkin Gnocchi but was given the regular meat version of it and our server never apologized just said she would fix it.  Luckily a manager came over and apologized and brought her another very quickly. We also had reservations but showed up only to wait close to 30 minutes for our table.  The had a big party of younger people who they sat in the direct center of the place creating a very loud, almost yelling atmosphere.  The food quality was really good, just other things overshadowed the actual food.  Not sure we'll be back with other great Italian options here in Charlotte.
