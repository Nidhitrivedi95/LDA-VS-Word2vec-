JBrBsKpw0bbXK5nlrXVOYQ Food is ok but a bit pricy.last time we were there with another couple the waitress began taking our order she seen we each had a Groupon and told us if we wanted to use them we had to set a separate tables.i told her we are paying on separate checks and the tip would be the same.she left and she said the manager said no.i wanted leave but our friends drove a long way so they set at a table behind us.we have use Groupon at other places and they never care as long as you pay on separate tickcket.dont think we will return
