18NP-qL3VIJEBJGpns7aTw Normally go to Barros at 83rd Cactus - Awesome place.   I can't even call this a Barros in comparison. In at 1pm for lunch, 20 mins in line with only 2 in front of us.  Slices out, everything 20 min wait.  Horrible service, lukewarm pizza, premade sad salad.  So glad we live Westside.
