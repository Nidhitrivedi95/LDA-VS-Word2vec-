OMf69ePEdHXvaqAlCCI01A We happened by this place recently. Yes, the place seems to be run by 20-somethings. Our waitress had a memory problem too. Forgot a few things, even though we were the only ones in the place. Then after 20 minutes, she told me that they were out of what I ordered. The food WAS good, but what I noticed and what bothered me was the fact that it was dirty. Floor was dirty, the counter up in front looked like it hadn't been dusted in weeks...for me that is a deal breaker.
