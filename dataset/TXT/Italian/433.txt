-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw Husband and I went here today on a whim. Hungry for any lunch and driving down Scottsdale Rd. we found this place by accident. Never heard of it before and if the menu wasn't appealing, we were going to go to Sol for Mexican food. The menu had Lobster Bisque and we were sold. 

The inside is vast and very open, with high ceilings, enormous "chandeliers", and draperies. Everything is burnt yellow and pale orange colors with simple artwork decorating the walls. It was nice, but not my favorite. Looking around, I think we were the only diners under 30 - except for the one baby. Everyone else was either in their 40s or much older. This didn't look like our typical lunch crowd, but we didn't feel out of place.

I ordered the crab and shrimp cakes with roasted vegetables and hubby ordered the soup and salad - lobster bisque and Caesar. A bread basket came out, with half a mini loaf of sourdough and 3 pizza slice sized crackers with miscellaneous spices on top. Sourdough was good - hot and fresh. Hubby liked the crackers, but I didn't try - too messy.

The food came quickly afterwards. Mine was really good - especially the crab cakes. Only two cakes came on the plate on top of sauce, but there was a heaping vegetable portion. The cakes were soft and moist - the crab and shrimp very apparent throughout and delicious. Hubby's bisque was good, with visable chunks of lobster. Certainly not his favorite, but he said he would eat again. 

Overall, the food was good, but it wasn't spectacular. Also, later we found out Brio is a chain restaurant and for the most part, we try to avoid those and eat locally. If in the area again and have a craving for lobster bisque, we'd eat there, but probably won't be back.
