CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA Venezia's is our go-to for pizza. We find the price fair for their combos, and as a New Yorker, I do see the resemblance to our famous pizza. You will find the pizza greasier than Slices brand, but it's nothing a couple of napkins can't fix.

For wings we always get the sweet red chili (bone in)
I consider the heat mild and it's pretty sweet and sticky. I also find these wings crispier than other flavors. They give you a lot of ranch for them but not a lot of vegetables. 1 container could easily go for two orders but the vegetable portion is more like half a serving.

I really enjoyed their White Slice one time but I can't remember what day it is on. I wish they just had all the slices they offered out everyday.

I'll tell you one thing though a lot of these pizza places claim that they are New York style pizza but I have yet to find a place that offers baked ziti pizza or Penne alla Vodka Pizza and even chicken Parmesan pizza. So if you know where I can get some message me!
