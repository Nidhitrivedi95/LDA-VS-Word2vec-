ZrtROjmux0QieMkwqlnnTA A New Year's Eve we'll never forget!  Nino, Vince & Frank took us in like family, for an exceptional Italian dinner--course after course of deliciousness, delivered with spunk and charm.  Just before midnight, we wandered down Notre-Dame to the fireworks, then back for desert and dancing.  Beautiful food, beautiful people, beautiful night.
