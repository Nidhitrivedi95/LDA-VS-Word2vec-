OJ6zfenoK-eBNI7vvNrOsg I love this restaurant and my father is used to invite the family here for dinner. All the dishes from grilled vegetables to pasta to desserts are delicious and served in large portions. The waiters are very friendly and helpful with suggestions. Recommended for a group dinner if you have the money to pay for it. The price is definitely justified.
