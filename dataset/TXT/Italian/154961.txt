l0aaLW6ZdDXWjUegUECSxg My husband and I went here tonight with the kids. As usual the food was very good.

Right now they have a special deal going where you order two entrees, one to dine in and another entrée to take home. My husband and I both got this. I got the Italian duo and decided to take home a shrimp dish my hubby got the Parmesan crusted chicken and took home the spaghetti. 

Our server did very well and took care of us (and sometimes that's not easy with two young kids!) I don't know about he rest of you but I prefer male waiters, they seem to do a better job, just my opinion.

Anyway, we go to this Olive Garden all the time and we only had a bad experience one time so that's pretty good. I know the Olive Garden gets a bad rap among italian restaurants but we really like this one!
