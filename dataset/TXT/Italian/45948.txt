8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA In town from Northern California... We have some really good pizzeria's in Northern California but Amore Taste of Chicago is the best pizza I have ever ate! The deep dish crust is phenomenal, & the sauce is amazing! 

I ordered pepperoni, onions & bell peppers and the way they were layered on the pizza were perfect. I can't tell if the onions & bell peppers are under the sauce or in the sauce. Then cheese & pepperoni on top. 

This pizza will be missed when we go back home.
