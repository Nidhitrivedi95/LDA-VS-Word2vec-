Don't waste your time with the salads, but they do have a few other things on the menu that are worth while like the egg rolls. When dining in be noted that the flow of this restaurant is lacking and sometimes people seem confused as to where to stand when picking up take out, waiting to be seated, and purchasing ice cream. All in all however the pizza is well worth it and the management is very kind.
