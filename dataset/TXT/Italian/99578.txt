F4VS-6xnpDoNBRGPoLrtjA So happy to have Chef Marc in the neighborhood!

The quality ingredients for your custom pies are fresh and abundant and allow for many, many delicious combinations. The dough is a tad chewy, but still handles well. Who doesn't love a fresh thin-crust pizza made to your liking and delivered to your table in minutes? The beet salad was also healthy and hearty. The decor has an industrial feel that is comfortable and casual. 

The ordering and checkout process was rather clumsy. There was confusion among the staff about who was ordering what, what to make and where you were going to sit before you paid or even turned around to look at the seating. This caused a bit of a back up as more diners arrived. This wasn't just my order, but the with the group in front of me too. The cashier asked if I wanted any gelato, but the desserts were on the other side of the room. It's hard to decide without seeing anything and not holding up the line. Maybe next time. Hopefully, these logistics will iron themselves out soon, but otherwise a wonderful food experience.
