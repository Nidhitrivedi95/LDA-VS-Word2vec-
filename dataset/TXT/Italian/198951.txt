The interior is charming but small. We thought the service was great & ordered ice teas before figuring out our pizza choices. I was surprised that they only serve sugar...no sweeteners, but that was ok. During our 45 minutes in the place, they refilled water and teas repeatedly. Next came absolutely delicious bread and very very potent olive oil. Yummy!

We ordered one 1/2 margherita/sausage and 1/2 pistachio red onion and parm. The other pizza was a plain margherita. The oven is so hot that they came in no time & were they ever delicious! The pistachio was very odd, but very compelling. The Italian sausage was the best I've ever eaten...so flavorful! We loved every bite. The crust was delicious as was the sauce on the margheritas.

Best pizza in America? I think that is just too subjective. Certainly one of the best. Don't miss a chance to go to Pizzeria Bianco!
