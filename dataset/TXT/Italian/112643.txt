gdqFSUw1vOI9lIQyZTYWAQ We are done with Bruno's! I was just accused of trying to get a free pizza! Their food has went so far down hill, and the owner is a jerk! Our pizza had such a scant amount of cheese the toppings couldn't stay on. I politely called to tell them this and the owner yelled at me and said I was trying to get s free pizza. We spend plenty of money there and tip  much more than necessary. Also the lettuce in our salad was brown and the onions were translucent with age. There wings are the worst I've ever had and their ravioli are canned sauce over Costco frozen ravioli. Straighten up Bruno's!
