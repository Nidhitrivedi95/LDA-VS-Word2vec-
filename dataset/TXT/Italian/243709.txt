usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA At last, Yelpers! I've finally had the pleasure to experience Piccolo Forno! I should get a badge just for that! ;) 

We arrived on a Saturday night and only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. I was amazed by how awesome the customer service was as the hostess was extremely friendly and offered to hold our wine for us since it's BYOB (My fav! $5/bottle). They call you when you're table is ready.

The place is relatively small, but it gives you a very intimate and cozy feeling. At times it seems a little crazy, but you can still hear the person across from you without having to yell. Tables are far enough away as well so you're not hearing conversation from the couple next to you. 

Our server was very polite and made us feel very welcomed. She explained the menu to us and was super cool about everything. She suggested some good items as well. 

The food was incredible. We were undecided on what to do for an appetizer and after seeing all of the amazing pizzas come out we went with that. We ordered the Bianca which was just a plain cheese and tomato pizza. I don't know how something that is "plain" can taste so good! It literally melted in your mouth! Not something you hear too often about pizza. We devoured it. Next up, I ordered the Rigatoni con Pesto as my entree. Heaven! What I thought was so interesting was the fact that there wasn't too much sauce on the pasta, yet it was so flavorful! A little truly goes a long way here. It was the perfect blend of not too dry and not an overkill with the sauce. The pesto taste wasn't overwhelming either. Bravo! 

My only complaint is that the portions (specifically with the entrees) are a little small so I do recommend ordering an appetizer. Four slices of pizza and my meal (... and of course a bottle of wine!!) was plenty to fill me. 

I can't wait to return and hopefully bring some new people along with me! I love showing people awesome gems like PN!
