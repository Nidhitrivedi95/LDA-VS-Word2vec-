K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ I attended a private event here and I thought we would have the whole club to our self instead we had to share it with regular customers too which seemed really weird.

When I checked in I was given a special VIP pass and told to have a good time.  I was also told that there were special VIP areas for me that I had full access too.  The problem was that all areas were roped off but I had no idea which side was VIP and which side was not VIP.  I found it kind of funny because with my VIP pass every velvet rope was lifted up for me.  Yes that is cool but what side should I be on.  It was a little confusing.

We also had passed apps and the staff serving them were really nice but it was some of the worse food I have ever had in my life.  I honestly could not even call it food...Costco samples tasted better then this stuff they were serving us.  I would have expected more from a location in the Bellagio.

The bar near the windows was also really packed and I could not get the bartenders attention to get a drink.  I then spotted a bar way on the other side and decided to see what was going on over there.  I had to go through two Border Patrol check points (guys with the velvet ropes) to get there and still had no idea if I could get a drink down there.  I asked the bartender and she said sure...okay things were starting to look up.

I will tell you that seeing the dancing waters from the backside was unique.  It is also a closer vantage point then standing on the street.  My two stars are for the five star view.  The only thing I hated is that the non-VIP party had taken all of the best viewing areas and were clinging to the window where the water show was at.
