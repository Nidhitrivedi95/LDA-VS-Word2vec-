l-Zjik0MbpabQPv-nNp9YQ One of the best Italian bakeries around. I have yet to try any of their hot dishes but their dessert section is so tempting. I came in to pick up my sfoglia cake and walked out with that and a box of pastries. The almond cookies and cannolis were my favourite. The sfoglia cake was good but there was too much custard.
