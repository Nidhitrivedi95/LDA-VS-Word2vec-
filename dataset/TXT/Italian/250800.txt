VPSgUyHuxUXhYTcPgGjiDA I enjoy this place a little more each time I visit. My only two critiques: my wings needed more sauce on them, plus they tasted a little dry. Second, the bar area is kind of small, so don't plan on meeting a bunch of friends at the bar.

Other than that, the food is good. The service is nice and professional. Plus there's plenty of parking.

**UPDATE**

I've ordered the wings a couple more times since my previous review and they tasted great! Hats off to the chef for cooking them properly.

Again, this is a fun little bar to hang out at and watch an Indians game with strangers. You'll probablyend up making new friends by the end of the evening.
