kp9IG_6UDGFn8HxlIDBusQ Very disappointing. Our waitress was rude. We had a large group and we were celebrating an event. Our waitress seemed put-off. It took a while to receive our food, drinks weren't refilled so we asked for a pitcher of water at our tables. The waitress didn't check on us and salad bowls and some dirty plates were sitting on the table. Someone asked if she could take the dirty plates...she asked if we wanted hot food or our dishes cleared off the table. They were slicing pieces of cake and handed someone a piece and she said you get the messed up piece (even though we had 1/2 a cake left). The leftover cake was thrown in the to-go containers and completely trashed when we opened it. The food was average, a couple of the meals were cold when brought out (and not due to the dishes being cleared off our table). The waitress really ruined our experience there and a number of people in our party were upset but didn't want it to ruin our celebration. Other waitresses seemed pleasant and cheerful to guests, but ours was downright rude from the moment she came to our table (and she barely came around except to take our order and deliver food). We won't be back.
