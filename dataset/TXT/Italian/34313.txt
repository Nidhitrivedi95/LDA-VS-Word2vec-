6ByLcHHPTXepgDg7mx3A0A I went to the Continental for lunch and ordered half a pepperoni pizza and half an Italian sausage pizza for $10.  The pizza was top notch!  It was truly outstanding.  The Italian sausage left a lot to be desired.  It wasn't as hot (temperature) as I would have liked.  I might have said something about it but my server was pretty slow.  He seemed sort of aloof and too cool to really take care of me.  There was another waitress there that seemed much friendlier.  I guess the luck of the draw worked against me this time.  I'll go back, but will hope for a different server.  I wish I could grant 3.5 stars.  I have faith that it's better than a three star so four stars it is.
