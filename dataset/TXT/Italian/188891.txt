OXrFWgoz533T8tMRemkiww Where do I begin... we were told there would be 15 minute wait. Well an hour later still not seated, so we asked the hostess how much longer the wait would be, she said another few minutes. We waited another fifteen. Meanwhile looking around the restaurant empty tables everywhere. The hostess stated they were for reservations, now previously in the day I visited the website only to see that they did accept reservations so that rubbed me the wrong way. I wanted to leave but the group I was with wanted to stay. Finally we asked the hostess how much longer? To which she responded "just sit them some where" . Which mean me feel totally awkward and totally unwelcome. The food was mediocre at best and expensive. I will never patronize  this establishment again, due to the way I was treated. If you take reservations let people know on your website and treat people who want to come your restaurant with respect.
