mq0V3VURCEA4mfEhPi6FZw Awful service, had to wait at the front for awhile for a cashier to come. The cashier was rude and actually got our order wrong - I was not given a receipt and only realized once the food came that it was a different kind of pasta then I ordered. The service was very slow, we waited 35 minutes for Caesar salad and garlic bread and 1 hour for the (incorrect!) pasta. The Caesar salad was thrown together and drenched in too much dressing and the garlic bread was cold. I ordered the pomodora pasta but they gave the Norma one instead. At that point it had taken too long for the food to arrive so we didn't say anything. The pasta was drenched in sauce, which was too acidic. It is supposed to come with eggplant, olives, mushroom, tomato, basil, leek and garlic oil, but it had only olives, tomatoes and barely any eggplant. Will not be returning
