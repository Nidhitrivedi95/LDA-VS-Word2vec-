Pwb0tGwDCa-Z7Eg2zqfhXg DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!! Chicken club pizza was bland and boring, fries and honey mustard were pretty good. Service was the worst part.. Drinks were empty almost the whole time when I did ask for refills they only brought 1 and there was 2 of us. After our meal we sat there for 10 min waiting while there entire staff was standing around just talking. We got our bill and they asked if they could box up the pizza and after a few minutes we saw our waiter sweeping the floor. He tossed our pizza he was supposed to box up. Now maybe I could forgive some of these things if they were swamped but there was only 1 other occupied table in the place!!!
