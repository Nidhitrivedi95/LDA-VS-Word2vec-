OXrFWgoz533T8tMRemkiww We were asked if we wanted to be seated in the Wine Bar area, and said "sure, why not."  We didn't even realize this little area was there.  It was a bit chilly at first, but as soon as more people were seated, it got warmer. 

We tried the fried meatballs and arancini as appetizers.  Both were delicious, and the marinara was delectable.  Quattro Formaggi pizza was excellent and just enough for two to share after eating appetizers.  We still splurged and shared a cannoli for dessert.  It had the perfect amount of cinnamon, and was not overly sweet.  

I will definitely be visiting again! :)
