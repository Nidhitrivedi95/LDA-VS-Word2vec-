iAD5r5vNOzc1AP6UA5yFiQ Excellent food, service, atmosphere and of course the best Gelato (on par with what we have had in Italy!) the owner Mosen, manager Juan, Mosen's son Elliott all absolutely wonderful!  The diverse menu makes it a place for all but don't pass on the gelato!  So many flavors and all out of this world, even sugar free gelato.  Be sure to taste them all!  Don't pass this place by! Live music is an added treat in the evenings on the weekend!  There is even outdoor seating in the back which is the best kept secret. Enjoy!
