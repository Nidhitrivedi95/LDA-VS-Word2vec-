JsUprRhyzQyukZmAhcOg0A We will call this Strike One. It's hard as busy parents with 3 kids to get a night out.
Came here on Friday night, Expecting it to be busy. We were told a 30 min wait for a table for 2. After about 15 mins we received a text message (great idea and system) to let us know our table was almost ready. We returned and checked in at the hostess stand. We were told we would be seated in the next 5 mins. After 30 mins had passed and everyone else waiting had been seated the hostesses overheard my wife and I discussing the wait time. Then one of the hostesses came over and asked what our name was. We told them. They went back to their screen. Then they asked us if we had checked in with them as if we had never existed. (Pretty much looking at us like we were no longer in the waiting que.) At this point it had been 45 mins since our arrival, but 30 mins since we were told we would be seated shortly. They looked at each other like we were not going to be seated anytime soon. As the 3 hostesses looked at each other like "uh oh what do we do" we said we will find somewhere else and we walked out.
