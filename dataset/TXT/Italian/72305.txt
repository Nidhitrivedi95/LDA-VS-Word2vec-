cDz_5MwEZV1LIkJiIFDpoQ Dropped in on a busy Saturday night for them. 

Waited 5 minutes until hostess greeted us.

Waited another 10 minutes until waiter came with the menu.

Service was very slow for the duration of the meal. Although staff was friendly.

Food was pretty good. For a mid-price restaurant though, they should be providing better service.
