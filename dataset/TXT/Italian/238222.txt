Love the bruschetta planks and the vibe, but, I soon tire out of sipping my glass of Merlot standing and fighting for that tight high top table only to wait longer to get that food coma inducing prosciutto&fig bruschetta.

Four stars because, I say this, and promptly go back as often as I can. Things good food makes one do!
