pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw OK I figured this whole thing out.....after hearing all the hype about this place I finally got to go here. We showed up at 7 (hungry) and did not get in until 10:00 pm. After 3 hours of waiting and drinking wine next door we got our pizza ......you could have put some caned sauce on cardboard and we would have thought it was the greatest tasting pizza in the world, not to mention after 3 hours of drinking we were just drunk and willing to eat rat. 3 hours wait for pizza is beyond stupid IT IS PIZZA FOR GOD SAKE!!!!! Get real people ....The pizza is foo foo and trendy fitting for Scottsdale but not in Scottsdale.....it is good don't get me wrong but worth a 3 hour wait? I THINK NOT...if you wait 3 hours for a pizza you are a FOOL!    I will not return.
