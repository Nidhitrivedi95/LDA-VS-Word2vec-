Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A the hubby took us here after his graduation and it was delicious!! we each got a different pizza and they all tasted delicious! we got the Semifreddo Alla Mandorle for dessert and that was really good as well but i wouldn't get it again. id like to try something else. it also didn't take that long to get the pizzas so that's always a plus. staff was friendly and the location is great. we were able to take some pictures of out 20 month old daughter near the fountain by the shopping center next door. will definitely be coming back if we are ever near the borgata
