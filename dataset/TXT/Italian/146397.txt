k7WRPbDd7rztjHcGGkEjlw Excellent restaurant! I am a McKeesport native now living in another state. On my all-too-infrequent return visits to the area I often try to stop in to Tillie's for lunch or dinner. I find that it has consistently offered one of the best dining experiences in the Pittsburgh area or anywhere else! It was a Christy Park institution when I was growing up, and it remains so today.  The food, from pizza to more high-end traditional (and authentic!) Italian fare, is of high quality and typically in ample portions. A wide range of selections are available from a variety of styles, each with its own merit. Service is typically very good, even when the facility is full and quite busy.  The location is neat and clean and comfortable, quite appropriate for the nature of the business. The adjoining lot offers ample secure parking.  For a restaurant to attain and maintain such a consistent, high quality level of service for so many years is impressive!  I look forward to future dining opportunities at Tillie's!
