If you are gluten free, forget about being able to eat as the unhelpful waiter will tell you he doesn't know what GF is and has to ask the chef.  The "helpful" chef will not put chicken on your $ .15 worth of Costco organic greens, but suggests you purchase the $27 chicken entree, ditch the sides to put on your purchased salad.  
My friends ordered steak that looked like hardened hockey pucks with overly salted string fries.  Steaks were medium rare when my friend ordered medium. Our waiter was so unaccommodating  that it wasn't even worth it to complain 
We had been here before and had a different experience. The management is either uncaring , miserable or both.  We will never return to Central Bistro. No do-overs here.
