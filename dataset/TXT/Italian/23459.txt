3qTSOuJ-ZyU1L7o62KHSIg Was here last night for NYE ~ table for 8.  It was absolutely delish (again).  The menu was great, the first 2 courses were bite sized portions of the most delicious things they have on their menu every day, and the we had a choice of 6 mains (I think).  I had the rack of lamb (yum).  One of my fave things is the butternut squash crepe.

It was tasty, and left me wanted to come back for more!
