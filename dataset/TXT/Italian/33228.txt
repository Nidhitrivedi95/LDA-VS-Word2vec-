5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA When eating here you should allow for time from your order to come to your table.  If you are on a romantic evening that can be fine as the appetizers and bread are quite good to bide your time.  The food is quite good even for a jaded New Yorker like me, I have never had a bad dish nor my fellow diners. 

 I just had lunch here and that was pretty good as well, although expensive .  Cole slaw with Gorgonzola cheeze  was a tasty side with my Sausage and Pepper sandwich.
