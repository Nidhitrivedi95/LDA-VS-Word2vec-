zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g Needed a bite close to home and craving pizza.  My usual spot was closed so I dropped into Dom Dimarco's.  A nice pleasant surprise.  Started with the tomato and burrata. Wow some of the best mozzarella ever.  I followed this with the big apple.  Great crust , which I find is the most important to pizza.  Right amount of sauce and toppings were top quality.   Service was good and decent wine list.  I did find the wine list a little pricey.  Maybe beer next time.
