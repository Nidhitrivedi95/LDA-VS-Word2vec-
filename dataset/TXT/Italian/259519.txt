WlINkrwGmUzyR-hoG-pIlw Came here with my girlfriend last night. We were staying in the Distillery District and were looking for a cute, romantic dinner date place, and ended up having one of the best dinner dates we've had yet!

The staff was so incredibly friendly and genuinely cared if we were having a good experience, from the music to the water to the food. We got the prosciutto and provolone pizza to share (because we've each got tiny appetites), which was delicious and got us stuffed, but when they suggested we try the bruschetta as well, there was no way we could say no to any of their incredibly sweet servers or even the sous chef, who came out to make sure the food was ok!

You can really tell when the people at a restaurant are genuinely invested in caring about providing a good meal, especially when it comes down to the little things. Would definitely come back with friends or with my girlfriend for another date -- if she lived in the city it could easily become one of our regular spots. 

Pizza + bruschetta + two beers (+ complementary dessert!) + tax + tip = just over $50 for two for a really beautiful night out.
