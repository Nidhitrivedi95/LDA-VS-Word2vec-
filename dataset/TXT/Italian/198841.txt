pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I give it Four stars as a whole. The pizza's are 3-4 stars. I did  like the resturant and the lounge nxt door. Not worth a 3hr wait. If you have time to kill at the louge then ok. We ordered all the pies on the menu.
The pistachio was the best. The Margeritta with pepperoni was nxt. All the others were just okay. The Crust looks Great , But needs work.
I've had better pizza's when i do business in San Fransico.
