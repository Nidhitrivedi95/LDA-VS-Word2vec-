ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA My husband and I live and work in the central Phoeenix area, and Ocotillo is a welcome addition to our local scene. We stop by the O-Togo coffee bar for espresso fizz and fresh baked scones at least once a week. Service is spectacular and the coffee is amazing! The main restaurant is beautiful inside, with a stunning marble bar and lots of windows for light. Recently I tried the pork steak on the "small plates" and was pleasantly surprised. The meat was tender and juicy but the flavors were fresh and bright. I could eat this everyday!! Paired the pork with a glass of the red sangria, heavenly! My husband loves the house made pastas, his favorite is the creste de Gallo. The outside patio is spectacular for a nice date night with beautiful lighting and cooler to make the Phoenix nights more enjoyable.  Five stars for food, service, and atmosphere!
