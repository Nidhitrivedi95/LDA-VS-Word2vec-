5RzR64HqnLRHo-MpZ129mQ A co-worker recommended this place to me, so I decided to try it for lunch last Monday with another co-worker. It was pretty busy when we came and pretty much packed except for a few small tables. Immediately upon entering, we were greeted very warmly by the people working in the restaurant. You can tell the people there are legit Italian and are super super friendly. Bread is served "Italian-style" with olive oil and vinegar rather than butter. For my lunch, I ordered penne de golosone (penne in a rose sauce with smoked salmon, black olives and asparagus) and thought it was pretty good, although the salmon was just a tad on the salty side. I'm usually not a huge fan of olives, but I thought they complimented the dish well. I was very tempted to order a cappuccino or espresso after the meal, as I noticed they had a machine in the restaurant that also looked very legit. Would definitely come back if I'm in the area to try other things! Service was pretty attentive and very friendly!
