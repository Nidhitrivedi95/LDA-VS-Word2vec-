64o_nYvzIKwHFOSYSEm-qw I wanted to like this place as I heard pretty good things about this location.  Having been my first time here last month, I was excited to take my son here as his favorite food is PIZZA.

One of the good things here is they do sell pizza by the slice.  They have an assortment of pizza made and will heat up your choice in their oven OR you can have them make a pie to order.  My mom had a slice of the hawaiian, I had a slice of the mushroom and pepperoni, while my son had the pepperoni slice and garlic knots.  As we sat down and waited for our order, the couple next to us took their slice back as we over heard that there was a strand of hair on one of their slices. Can I just say YUCK! and what a way to spoil an appetite.  I debated whether my family and I should request for our money back or just wait and eat our food.  When I saw that their slice came from a different pie, we just decided to stay since we were really hungry.

The slices are generous; however my mom's Hawaiian was soggy!  She couldn't even pick it up to eat it.  She had to use a fork.  When I told the lady at the counter about it, she merely stated that it was due to the slice actually coming from a Pie that had just been taken out of the oven...ummm ok but I do recall having pizza to order and it not being soggy and thought to myself, ok if thats her story and she's sticking to it...so be it...LOL!  My slice was just ok and my son...well he oved his garlic knots and just took one bite of his pizza.

I will end this with, I've had better and will most likely not be returning to this place.  I'll stick to Grimaldis or Metro pizza.  I would put this place in the same category as the pizza places inside a mall's foodcourt.  Nothing fresh and/or special about it.
