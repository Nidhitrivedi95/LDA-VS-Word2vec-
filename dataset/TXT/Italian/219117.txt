Made reso for 2, hostess at the front sat me down at the most awkward table in the middle of everything. So much foot traffic! And there were so many other empty tables.... asked to be seated somewhere else, she said all tables were reserved as well. Moved us to another table that wasn't as bad. 

Food was mediocre, our server was super friendly though. The tables that were 'reserved' was still empty when we left 2 hours later. I hate it when hostesses lie when its so obvious. Who the hell are you saving those tables for? Probably never going back.
