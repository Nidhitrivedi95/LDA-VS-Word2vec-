Q1L_Nb1QsD0S9pbng5-kMQ Stopped by here the other day, trying to kill time before dropping someone off at the airport.  I have a real soft spot for Italian, so I am always endeavoring to find a really decent spot that will supply my stomach with Italian goodness.

Started off a little rocky since I am unfamiliar with this shopping center.  I think I was in awe of the mixed residential and businesses below apartment setup they have here and I totally drove by the parking lot.... we ended up parking "in the back lot" in between the Fintastic and Portofinos and the spaces were a little tight.  

We were greeted warmly and it was early Sunday afternoon... so we got seated right away.  Our server was pretty friendly... we felt a little rushed, even though we were one of the only tables being served at that time.  Still, our server got our orders correct and kept our waters/teas filled.

I ordered Portobello mushroom ravioli with Alfredo sauce... yes... I know, not the healthiest choices, but it was just what my stomach and tastebuds wanted that afternoon.  Next time I come here, I will definitely order pizza.  It looked very good from the distance.
