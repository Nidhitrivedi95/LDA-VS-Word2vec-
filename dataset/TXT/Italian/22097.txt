3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A Toronto has such a plethora of eating establishments I had a hard time just picking one place to go.  I wanted a good meal without the high-end atmosphere and it appeared Enoteca Sociale fit the bill.  The house-made foccacia was a favorite all around - soft, moist, and chewy, not dry as it can be.  We had the sea bream, sausage, and arugula as our starter, and we liked it very much.  Even my mom, who I consider to be the ultimate chef on this planet, was very impressed by how the sea bream was pan-fried (almost like Asian-style) to perfection.  The sausage and arugula salad provided a nice balance to the fish.

Now the pastas are all made in house with a few expections.  I had the spicy octopus and sausage pasta while my brother got the pork and fava beam rigatoni and my mom was adventurous and went with the chicken liver fettuccini (well, given that we eat pork liver time to time, perhaps chicken liver isn't that adventurous to us Asians, hehe...).  The flavors were different for all three of our pastas, and we could definitely taste the quality of the house-made pasta.  My only quibble is that the portions were on the small side, so we had more of the foccacia to fill us up.  Nonetheless, a solid choice to enjoy some delicious Italian food.

On a side note, I made a reservation at 6 pm and there were only a few tables occupied when we arrived.  And when we were done, the place wasn't filled up.  I had asked for a later time, but they said they were all booked.  So it's a little odd, but perhaps that's how most restaurants operate nowadays.  Additionally, the restaurant is easy to get to on the 505 tram from the downtown area.
