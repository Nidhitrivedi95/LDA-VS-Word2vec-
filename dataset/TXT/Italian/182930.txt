OBG1j517k7aZRNC1HAL0TA First time I encountered Fabbrica was at the end of a long bicycle ride. So of course I was starving. We got the meat and cheese platter and then a conundrum. Did I want the braised rabbit or the braised short rib pastas. No problem they said you can have a bit of both. Lovely staff, great service and I love the environment. 
My friends and I have been back loads of times since and tried many of the menu items. 
I love Fabbrica, Missy and the kitchen crew do a fabulous job. I get fabbrica cravings, check out the funghi pizza, the meatballs are insane, the ricotta donuts are a great light option with your coffee. The fritti is my fave fish, yellow perch. I find at many places you get barely there filling in your ravioli. At Fabbrica you get Nonna's ravioli big plump over stuffed and a lovely sauce, I'm always stuffed  when I leave and I loooooooove the braised short rib pappardelle. The pasta is fresh and perfect and it's not over sauced.  Will always be a favourite go to place. Love you guys.
