t59EjJ_flqR75Mk2RWILAg I ate at Fratelli's on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. It was very quiet, but the service and food were excellent. I ate the chicken piccata which was the perfect portion size and very tasty. My lunch date had the meatball sub which was also very good. The prices were excellent, I will definitely be returning to Fratelli's in the future!
