7d3tmP0XIFdjdqQ6hBRA4Q This is what you look for in a Little Italy restaurant....cozy with an old world flavor and great food. Mix that with the exuberance of the new owner Eddie and the culinary skills of a new chef and you have a great dining experience. We asked the chef to create something for us and surprised us with a fantastic ravioli appetizer. Each course that came out was better than the last. We shared lamb chops, pasta, fillets and mussels...all perfectly prepared. Eddie, the young owner, works the room and makes sure everyone is happy. The customer service is top notch. There is a new and young feel to this place. You won't be disappointed, I highly recommend.
