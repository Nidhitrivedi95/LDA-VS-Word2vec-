qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ Fantastic meal, great hospitality from Tony. Family and I stopped by for dinner of lasagna, Alfredo and meatball sub and were very pleased. The lasagna was full of fresh tasty ingredients and covered in a delicious marinara. The Alfredo was very rich and tasty. The sub was delicious with more marinara. A side of garlic knots to start and Italian style beignets (don't know the proper name) to finish and we were quite happy. My only disappointment was no liquor license for a glass of chianti.
Thank you Tony!
