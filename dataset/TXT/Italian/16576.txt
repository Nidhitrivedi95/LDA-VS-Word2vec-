1Z9rGyR3Ld2mtnOTE4pNcg First impression: 
It's a bit of a shit hole inside. I  won't lie about that. It's not the kinda place you go to for the interior. It was also chilly. Lots of mounted tv's on the wall ...  It was full of families sitting around, quickly shoving food in their mouths, while watching tv. 
I'll sum this up by saying it's a very casual restaurant. 

What I got:
- Veal sandwich w/cheese and mushrooms.
Notes: The mushrooms are kept whole (and they're NOT CANNED!), which provides an extra boost of flavour. My mouth enjoyed it, a lot. The bread was on the soggy* side, but the veal was tender,  so well seasoned, I barely noticed the soggy-ish bun. 
I also liked that it didn't all squeeze out. It was a nice compact eat. 

*I did get take out, so the food sat for a good 30 minutes during my ride home, prior to eating. 

Panzerotti- cheese & pepperoni. 
YESSS!! This was really freakin' good. Mine was made to order. it was a 15-ish minute wait. 
Super fresh. Super yummy.
And it's super huge. 

I happen to be a big fan of the dough they use for the panzo, so it goes without saying I thought it was delish. 


As a word of Caution: 
The washrooms. Yeah, I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
I learned my lesson.
