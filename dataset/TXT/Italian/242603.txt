UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w Delicious food! My family ordered garlic bread, calamari, hot wings, and pizza. ALL of it was great. I really appreciated that they brought out the food in a timely manner. It's a small place but nice and clean. the service was excellent. I can't think of anything to complain about.
