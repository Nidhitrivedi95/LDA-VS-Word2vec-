cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ From the minute Luccio greets you at the door until your double expresso is finished this restaurant hits all the Marc's (pun intended).  We started with the borata and the meatballs as an appy.  My wife had the pasta (Caceo e Pepe) which is a cheese-lovers delight.  I had the chicken parm, and we shared.  Outstanding.  The service is attentive and professional.  When Luccio stops by to see how everything is it reminds me of Italian restaurants back East that take pride in their service.  Was our first time, won't be our last!!!
