pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. I love that it is local and not on the strip. I have been here many times and will be back for many more.

The service this time was good. Nothing out of the ordinary but nothing bad either. 

They start the meal off with garlic bread. It's so good it can be hard to stop eating it. 

This time I started off the meal with a resiling. It was good but very sweet. I was kind of surprised because it was sweeter than I though it would be.

I then decided on angel hair pasta with vodka sauce. I like getting thin pasta because it makes it less filling and rich. I really enjoyed it. The portion was good so I was able to take it home for dinner the next day which I always consider a plus.

For dessert we decided to get the tiramisu. I had never had it here before and was so happy we finally decided to try it! It was amazing and I will need to continue ordering this in the future. 

In the past we have also tried the peanut butter martini. If you like to drink your dessert then omg you have to try this! So yummy and satisfying. 

This is a must try in Las Vegas!
