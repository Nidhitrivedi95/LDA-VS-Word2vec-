cA9LmSotIsN3C8zCI94--A Since we've been living in the area, we watched this space transform from a bank to a wrestling school and now the West side branch of Queen Margherita Pizza.  They have done a remarkable renovation to the interior!  It's open concept with high ceilings and everyone has a nice view of the tiled pizza oven in the exposed kitchen.

We made last minute reservations online as we feared a wait.  I had walked by several times and saw line ups for hungry patrons waiting at 5pm for the doors to open, not to mention a packed dining room on weekends.

Arriving around 6pm, we were seated immediately in a half full dining room.  Our server came to take drink orders.  We decided to go with a 1/2 litre of the Norman Hardie riesling ($32) on tap at our server's recommendation.  I'm not usually a riesling drinker and found this particular one to taste too much like alcoholic apple juice.

Pizza order - we went with the Calabrese ($16.95) and the Capicola ($17.95).  Pizzas came quickly.  The Calabrese had a nice spicy sausage on top while the Capicola had prosciutto with mushrooms.  Both were tasty and I enjoyed the thin crust.

Service was friendly throughout the meal and we never felt rushed even though we lingered at the end of our meal to chat.  I wished that the tables were spread a bit further apart as our neighbours probably got an earful of our conversation.

Queen Margherita Pizza will do well at this location catering to the Baby Point and Bloor West/Junction crowds.  There are no other eateries quite like it in this area, while Buddha Pie Pizza at Runnymede and Annette is probably feeling the pinch.
