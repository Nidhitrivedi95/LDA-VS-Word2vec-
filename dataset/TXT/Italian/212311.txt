r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA Yes the sandwiches are better than most in Phoenix, but this is a terribly organized establishment.  35 minutes for 2 sandwiches to go?  Please.  We've been to lots of delis and italian grocers that are more crowded and have less personnel, and they all find a way to run smoother than these guys.  We won't be back... food isn't that good.
