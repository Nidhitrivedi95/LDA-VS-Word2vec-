0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg *EYE ROLL* Hostess had us come back in 15 mins or get a drink at the bar "to be ontime." WELL, it was 1/3 empty when walked in on a Fri night.

My fish was awesome! But, my fellow diner/payer was disappointed. Nothing was terrible, just idk, maybe we got the "wrong things"? Nothing extraordinary in comparison with other Vegas/NYC estbalishments.

PS View was pleasant - but why is the window sill right on the eye level of the Bellagio fountain?
