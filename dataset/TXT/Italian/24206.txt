46JVW4pwLDRIye4gYJboSw We are locals in Vegas, and Terra Rosa is our favorite Italian restaurant off the strip. They don't do everything perfectly, but you don't pay the prices that ensure that. The bread basket and antipasto appetizer are good, but I would absolutely upgrade the type of bread. Ciabatta, faccacia.....same old thing. Not bad, just dated. The calamari is the best in town. Huge portion, lightly breaded, and served with a good size cup of marinara on the side. It's worth going there for this alone. The thin crust pizza is just that, the thinnest crust I've ever had, which can present problems when you try to pick up a slice and it immediately wilts. 6 people dined for $200 plus tip. Not too bad for the decent quality.
