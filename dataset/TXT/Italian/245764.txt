UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Came here for the late night happy hour last Monday, which is from 9 pm to close, and no surprise it wasn't very crowded at all. We had mostly drinks but ordered a couple appetizers too including the margherita flatbread. Everything on the happy hour menu is priced between $4-$6 and the drinks seemed decently strong. The flatbread was nice and crunchy and a pretty good size. Service was efficient and our server kept coming back to check on us the entire time we were there. Our food and drinks came out pretty fast. I was impressed and would definitely come back to check out their full menu
