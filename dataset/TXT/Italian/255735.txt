vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA I just returned from a trip to Vegas. While we were there we ate at Carbone. It was awesome. Not only was the food excellent, the ambiance was top notch, and the staff was super friendly and fun. When we arrived, the kitchen was five minutes from closing. We were never rushed or felt pressure to power through our meal. In fact, we ended up staying several hours. I highly recommend Carbone!
