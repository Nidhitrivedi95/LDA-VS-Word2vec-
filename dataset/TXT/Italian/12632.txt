This is a very nice Italian restaurant at the Aria Hotel.  Front of the restaurant is a more casual bar like atmosphere, and then the inside is the more formal area.  Definitely need reservations.  Full menu and the prices were what you expect for a fine dining type Italian place.  I had the Linguine with clams.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't something that I went WOW over.   And the beef carpaccio... eh.  No flavor.  However my friend ordered a veal carpaccio... it was on special.  Now that was pretty good!!!    The best part of the meal... DESSERT!   All of the dishes we got were oustanding!  First a chocolate souffle... amazing!  Then there was a coffee panacotta.  Excellent too.  And Fried chocolate.  Yes, fried chocolate.   It was little fried chocolate balls.  Essentially, breading on the outside and gooey chocolate on the inside, served with a berry sorbet!  To die for!!   All in all, a nice place.   But I've had better Italian.
