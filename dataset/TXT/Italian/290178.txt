Zuwzb89m5JfOGyPgknSbCQ Nice little italian restaurant, the pastas were good.  The antipasto appetizer is a very nice size with a good assortment.

Service was a bit spotty - she was nice, but we waited a good 45 minutes for our main to arrive after apps.  And we were the only ones in the restaurant.
