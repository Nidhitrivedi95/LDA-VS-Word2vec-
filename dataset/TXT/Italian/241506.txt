ui8KERxCwlx8B5vWvpXxqg First time at this location for lunch today. Not too busy. Selections on the menu were plenty. Prices fair. We were fortunate to have a lovey waitress (wish I remember her name) blond hair braces who took amazing care of us. She was on top of it. Drinks always full and real nice to our small baby. Will definitely return and highly recommend.
