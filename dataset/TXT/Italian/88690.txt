E_jLyf_YuGgMP_rw8tvNSA Great pizza and great service. We got the cowboy pizza which is like a Hawaiian with sausage and barbecue sauce, which was amazing. The dude who made it for us was super nice and told us to spread the word because business is slow, which is why I decided to write this review. Definitely give nikos a try sometime, you won't be disappointed
