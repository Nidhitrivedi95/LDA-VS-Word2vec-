pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg Perfect for big groups and the food is so good! I went with 13 people but the wait staff suggested way too much food. The servicing a are huge and family style. We got 4 appetizers and 6 entrees for 13 people and we had so much food left over. It was ridiculous. But everything was so good! Highly recommend the Italian salad and penne!
