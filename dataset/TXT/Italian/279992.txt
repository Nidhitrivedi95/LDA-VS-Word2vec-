yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w House white and red wines included! The food wasn't excellent, but it wasn't disastrous. The plates look small, but they fill you up! I had the cheese ravioli, and the ravioli was big.. not like the Old Spaghetti Factory kind. The best part was the cappuccino.. mmm It's not really a hole in the wall either.. in my opinion. If you want pasta, just pasta with cheese or meat sauce or whatever, price is either 18.95 or 20.95. Meat.. is more obviously..24.95 and up. Not bad, considering you get the bread, salad or soup, the meal, cappucino and of course.. the house wine.
