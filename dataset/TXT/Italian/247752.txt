VcGyezSNtkNBr2HidcaM1A I ordered a pizza for myself to go. I ordered a small 10" with pepperoni and jalepenos. I ordered a 5 and might try the 4 next time. There jalepenos are pretty spicy. The dough was different and didn't weigh me down. I liked the sauce too. I will eat there again. The women that helped me may have been the owner- she was also friendly.
