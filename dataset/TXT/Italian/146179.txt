K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ Honestly the most gorgeous venue on the strip for so many reasons. The Club is smack dab right in front of the fountains and when the windows are especially open .. it's an extra a beautiful spot! The vibe is cool too cause the crowd seems to always be slightly older (I mean no early 20s raging out which is ok too lol) . The only thing I would say is though if you're looking for a massive Vegas club experience it's not that, aside from that It's one of my go to spots with amazing djs/music.
