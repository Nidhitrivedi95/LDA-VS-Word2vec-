UzjCvrNuK4crxi0IS9Jp5A As a somewhat regular since I have lived across the street from Maya since it opened a few years ago, I am absolutely stunned reading the bad reviews on this wonderful place. But, when I look at some of the reviewers other reviews, they seem to have the same complaints about half the places they go. Maybe that should tell you something...?
As for what I can say...
I have never once, in the 50+ times I have been there, have had bad service or bad food. Staff comes and goes as it does at every restaurant, but a few have been there for quite some time. Get to know the owner "Moose". He really is a great guy that cares about his customers. 
There is never a cover charge for fight nights, they has live entertainment, karaoke, comedy... ALWAYS something fun to do! The pizza is delicious, salads are enormous, The pasta dishes come with amazing meat sauce, everything is so good!
And the wings.... Ohhhhh, those wings. Try the Golden Spicy, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Huge, meaty, succulent wings that must have been taken from angel chickens!! Taco night on Tuesday is also top notch! Do yourself a favor and try this place for yourself.
