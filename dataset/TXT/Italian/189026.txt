OXSN9Jrp5JeF5VnXpDNHpg I wanted to let you know we just ate at the Galleria Mall in Henderson and the gentleman who served us, Tim, the general manager, really did great with taking good care of us! He was very apologetic for the other store and he was very friendly.  I even tried to tip him but he refused. The food was yummy! Thank you.
