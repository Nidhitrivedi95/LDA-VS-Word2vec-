pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw First Timer!!!!!

I had heard about this place from so many different people that I felt compelled to try it. It is situated nicely off to the side of the Science Center courtyard. Upon entering, you no longer feel like you are in Arizona. You have an overwhelming sense of walking into the neighborhood, Italian family owned pie shop. The building itself is quite small and does not seat very many people, but it gives you the cozy, comfortably crowded feel that so many New York pie shops deliver.

Now if you are lucky enough to get in right away then my hats off to you. More than not, you will have a wait time of 30 minutes or more. Lucky for the wine drinkers of this city, directly next door is Bianco's wine bar. It's a casually romantic set up in there. The wine list is more varied than I thought it would be (happily surprised) and the value is not bad either. The prices are not pretentiously overpriced which is refreshing in this town. I recommend the Scarpetta Barbera... those who know this wine, you know why... those who don't, you'll know why after you drink the bottle :)

Now, back to the food... pizza! The menu does have more than just pizza but honestly, why would you go to a pizza parlor for a salad? The varieties of pizza on Bianco's menu are quite impressive. There seems to be one for everybody: the meat lover, the vegetarian, the health nut or the pizza connoisseur. We ordered the Margarita pizza and the Proscuitto & Arugula pizza. And let me tell you... wow! The flavors were so great and the ingredients so fresh! I cannot believe between the two of us we went through all the pizza... we just could not help it I guess :)

The only reason I cannot give this place the full 5 stars was due to the wait staff. Unfortunately, she seemed to be insincere, inattentive and very caddy. Oh well, you cannot have it all I guess. But that one piece to this complex and delicious machine will not keep me from coming back... see you soon!
