uDb1lOfDhl_VLmAbYvp-vQ Ok, as it's been stated, the slices are ridiculously huge... so I'll comment on the pizza of day ...chorizo and Queso...great flavor and an appropriate spread of ingredients, it's the type of slice you either need a knife and fork or you fold in half and devour., I went the latter.  It's all good.  It's almost worth the show of when they bring out the pizzas from the back room, you will say OMG.  Enjoy!
