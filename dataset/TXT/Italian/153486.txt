Kykw3ho8wHtLV6gr9qbWTg For a place that has "vegan" on the cover of their menu, this place is doing it all wrong. First off, Picazzo's has changed. Their menu includes far fewer vegan items than it used to. Now, if you want something to be vegan, it has to be gluten free too. They changed their bread so that it is not vegan. Pretty bizarre for place claiming to be vegan friendly. Especially when bread is typically vegan. They were not willing to make cheese bread vegan, when they have vegan cheese and flatbread they could use. And all of their pasta has egg in it, which is just disgusting. It is so easy to make normal semolina wheat flour pasta. Why is the only vegan option the gluten free rice pasta? Gross. For a restaurant claiming to be sensitive to people's dietary needs, they have no grasp of how the world works. Vegans are largely not gluten free. They should not be lumped into the same category and left with dry cardboard pasta as their only option. I used to love this place. But now that they have nothing decent I can eat, I'm pretty close to done with them.

Other than that, the food is generally good. Service is mixed, depending on the night. I do enjoy the vegan options they have available, I am just severely disappointed by the changes that have been made and the backwards step this restaurant has taken in the vegan direction. If they didn't advertise themselves as vegan friendly, this would be a different story.

If management reads this, please consider offering a vegan pasta that is not gluten free. A linguine or spaghetti would be nice, as that's what most of the pasta dishes are designed to be, and they don't work well with penne. It is so easy to get vegan pasta. I don't understand the obsessesion with adding eggs to things.
