E_jLyf_YuGgMP_rw8tvNSA Finally! A great delivery spot in Vegas! Fresh homemade ranch are you kidding me?! This is unheard of. We spend a mortgage on dining out each month and it's unbelievable the bad service and quality of food you get. The food was here in no time and was hot and delicious. We will be a long time patron to this restauraunt. You can tell how authentic it is by not only the accent but by how genuine they are with how they talk to you. Come on Vegas! Step your game up and be more like a place like this. A pizza place showing up half the $100 a head restaurants here in town. Gratzsi!
