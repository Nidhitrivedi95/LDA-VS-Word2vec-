zYb4kj2R54R2YPeNm829BA Had such a wonderful memorable experience here on our trip to vegas. I am a huge walking dead fan, and our hotel did not carry the AMC Channel, so, omg, what's a girl to do? Internet to the rescue! Turns out Sauce hosts a watching dead party every Sunday night, lucky for me!
We arrive shortly after 8:00 pm and we are each given a ticket for a free drink, Score! There are different vendor tables, comics, figurines, t-shirts, etc. I bought an awesome walking dead T-shirt for 8 bucks, another score, and now i am decently attired for the event. There was also a woman doing free zombie makeup, and the results were incredible.
The cast from evil dead, the musical, hangs out with the crowd during the event, which adds to the overall theme of the evening. Lots of TV's throughout the restaurant/bar, all tuned into the walking dead, so you never miss a moment of the show.
During commercial breaks there is a trivia contest based on what has been on the show so far, so pay attention to the little details while you watch. The prize bags are different but oh so fun to win. We won a Merle zombie collectible figure, so stoked over that win!
Service was super great, despite the crowd. We opted for pizzas and a Caesar salad. Delicious, but more than we could eat, so we shared with the table. Our glasses were never empty and everyone that worked at the restaurant was super friendly.
Overall, this was one of the highlights of our trip. I highly recommend!
