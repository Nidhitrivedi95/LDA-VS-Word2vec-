Fig pizza was really different, but it worked.  Dessert; pineapple upside down cake with ice cream was sweet and tender.  Chocolate mousse and lemon tart were nicely done.  Conversely, the waiter was not very helpful when it came to ordering wine.  He made no attempt to help suggesting anything, he may not have known the wine list?  They have an extensive wine list, which should have a knowledgeable staff.  Our waiter was no student, he just didn't care.  Also, he rushed us to put in our dinner order, and the food came too quickly.  The place was not busy, don't know why this happened.  Perhaps it was because I was a female.  Often, we get treated differently when dining without a male.
