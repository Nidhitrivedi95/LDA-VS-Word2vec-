XxXJat55Oep1BMzQ9yJJhQ What a cute place! Stopped in here while running errands and had a great lunch. The herbed bufala ricotta definitely lives up to the hype, and is perfect for a steamy summer day: cool, lightly herby, much fluffier than your typical ricotta cheese, and served with an ample portion of perfectly toasted bread. Yum. I had the pork loin with their Italian barbecue sauce, which was good though the pork was slightly dry. It could have used a little cheese, but really, what couldn't use a little cheese? ;)

The biggest drawback to Negroni is the noise. It really carries in there. Even though the restaurant was barely full, there was group of 6 women with two infants, and between the babies squealing and the loud squawking of housewife chatter, it became too cacophonous in the restaurant for me. I can only imagine what the noise is like when the restaurant is full! It'd be great if they could do something with the acoustics to not make the noise bounce so much. 

Regardless, it's a damn fine sandwich. I'll definitely be back!
