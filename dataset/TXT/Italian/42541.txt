7Uti5EeAwm3drG14KVrE3Q The grilled squid is a Yorkville must. No Yorkville attitude. We were squeezed in on a Friday night, and got a great table in the front room overlooking Yorkville next to the window.  The room was completely full, which gave a nice lively buzz. Cozy, warm atmosphere and savory Italian food. Completely satisfying. Service was debonaire.
