RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ Cheesy heaven. Had read about this place online and heard about it from various people I asked for good pizza in Pittsburgh. This place did not disappoint. Parking is a bit of a problem, but once inside it just smells good, too. They also deliver frozen pizzas anywhere in the US, because it really is that good. Anything less than 5 stars would be a crime.
