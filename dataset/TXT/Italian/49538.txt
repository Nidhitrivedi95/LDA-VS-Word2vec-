You can sit inside and enjoy the quirky artwork or you can sit al fresco and enjoy the beautiful AZ spring weather. I read reviews about the pizza and wanted to try it. Unfortunately, I arrived here for lunch and pizza is only served for dinner. Fail! But I was pleasantly surprised that my spinach salad was so tasty! It had candied pecans, fresh strawberries and grilled shrimp. Tasty!
