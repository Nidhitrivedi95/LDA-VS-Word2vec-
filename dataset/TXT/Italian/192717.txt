pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ I came here on the recommendations of friends. The place is modern and not old school vegas, which I prefer. Really? if you go to an Italian restaurant in Vegas don't you expect to run into a few former members of Capone's gang?  So I appreciated the live music on a Sunday night and was hopeful. But the lasagna was run of the mill and a frozen lasagna at Trader Joe's would have been just as good. My suggestion is to pass up this place because there are better alternatives.
