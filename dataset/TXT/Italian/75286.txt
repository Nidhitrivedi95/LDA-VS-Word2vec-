CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA Love it! 
We had our favorite pizza place then we moved to tempe and had to find a new one. Venezia's is perfect, we ordered it based on other reviews and fell in love. 
It's always delivered on time and piping hot! It has the perfect ratio of cheese, sauce and crust. In short we are now lifetime Venezia's fans!!
