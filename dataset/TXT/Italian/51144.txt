If you've ever wanted to know what it might feel like to be invisible, visit Scaddabush on Yonge and Gerrard to find out.  The service here was horrendous, no other way to describe it.  We were seated and weren't even given water for 10 minutes.  When our waitress finally made an appearance, we put in our entire order for fear we may not see her again for another 20 minutes.  Our appetizer beat our drink order out (which was brought out by the hostess).  After we finished our meal, we didn't see our waitress again for another 18 minutes.  When we asked for the check she apologized for the poor service but still looked shocked when she received a 10% tip.  After service like that, I can't believe she expected anything more.  I can't gripe about the food, it was very good, but the service really soured us on the entire experience.  Don't come here if you have anywhere to be in the next 2-3 hours, otherwise sit back and enjoy the invisibility cloak.
