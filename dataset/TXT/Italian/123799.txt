HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q I went here a couple times while staying at Palazzo. The first time was for breakfast. I got a berry crepe ($12/$13) and it was hot and fresh but had way too much chocolate inside. Next time I'll tell them to go easy. Recently, we went for dessert and got a double scoop of cheesecake gelato. It was good and I like how they put graham cracker crumbs in the ice cream, but it was also really rich. I only go here because it's convenient but it's also very overpriced.
