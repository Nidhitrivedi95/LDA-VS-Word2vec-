8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg I'm seriously glad my hubby and I decided to come back here a second time. 

I was surprised for my birthday with a stay at the Monte Carlo and tickets to see the Blue Man Group. My husband loves Italian food, so after the show we decided to give this place a try. I feel bad because our waiter told us he was new and it was only his second day on the floor. But he was seriously the only waiter there and there were more tables occupied than just ours. It took way too much time for him to bring us drinks and take our order and to bring us our check. When it came time to charge our meal to our room, it took him 20 minutes to do that. Service was below mediocre and the pizza I ordered got me sick that night. It was extremely heavy and crust was tasteless. My husband raved about his linguine with pomodoro. I noticed that the portion was incredibly small but the price was high. When I say small I mean it was portioned enough for a kids meal. He didn't seem to care because he said it was that good. 

The next night my husband said he wanted the linguine pomodoro again. I hesitated but decided to go for it. I was so happy that I did! Our waiter was awesome, attentive and was quick with ordering, bringing bread and bringing drinks/refills. My husbands linguine pomodoro looked a lot bigger portioned this time, and I ordered the chicken parmesan. It was amazing! The pomodoro sauce has pieces of roasted garlic in it. What's not to love about that??

We will definitely be back the next time we stay at the Monte Carlo!
