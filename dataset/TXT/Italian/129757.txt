i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw I've been here 3 times now, and will be back many more. This is the real deal - a true "deli", not some chain operation with crappy bread, supermarket cold cuts sliced paper thin, slapped together by some kid with an attitude. No, this is what I remember as a kid - a "real" sandwich, with excellent, fresh ingredients, served in fair portions, and tasting 1000x better than the chain stuff. I particularly like the hard baguette bread option, and most recently I tried the penne pasta with Bolognese sauce and meatball, and it was absolutely SUPERB! Lots of other options on the menu to explore too. Can't wait try more stuff.

I have one suggestion for the owners - please lose the fountain-dispensed iced tea, and brew your own. Costs less and tastes far better. Other than that minor detail, you're hitting it out of the park.
