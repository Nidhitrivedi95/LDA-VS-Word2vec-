G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I love the decor of Giada's new place.  Wide open space, great views from the 2nd floor of Caesars, Bellagio and the construction going on at Bally's LOL.  The restaurant is very homey and welcoming.  The smoke of the wood burning oven adds to the ambiance.

If going, I would recommend going for dinner as the lunch menu was limited.  I wanted to eat pasta, this is Giada's place isn't it, but no pasta on the lunch menu.  The lunch menu consisted mostly of small app, salads, pizza's and sandwiches.

We had prosciutto, olives, meatballs for starters.  All were very good and tasty.  Our party had 2 lobster roll, grilled cheese lemon pesto sandwich and lasagna.  The lobster roll was excellent.  I had a bite of the lemon pesto sandwich and it was good to.  My friend loved the lasagna, although it was quite small of $24.

This place is not cheap, for what seems to be a casual lunch. Apps and entrees (no desserts) came out to $200 for 4 of us.

I definitely want to check this place out for dinner.
