FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q Food is good ...it takes longer time than most places.
If you don't mind hearing the bus boy toasting silver ware  all night long ... he seems like him can't even speak.
BTW 2 visits same shit empty room not friendly environment
No wondering that place is empty.
It most be the reasonwhy thy look so miserable... no motivation no costumes no $$$$ well 
Food is expensive for the location n decor.
