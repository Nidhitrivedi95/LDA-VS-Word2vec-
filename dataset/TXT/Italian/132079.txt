ijNQXC2cBhbkf6iB6D8OJw This place has gone way down hill. I ordered the steak hoagie and my friend ordered the buffalo chicken hoagie and both hoagies barely had any meat on them. I told the waitress about it and she brought over the manager who told me there was nothing he could do about it and that the meat is proportioned out beforehand. 
They also charged my friend $3 to add lettuce and tomato to the large hoagie ($1.49 +tax a topping). 
Unless you want to eat a bread sandwich and overpay for toppings, I would try a more reasonable hoagie place.
