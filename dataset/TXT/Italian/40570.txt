7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Oh Mario Batali, just when you made me hate you with your awful Enoteca restaurant at the Venetian, you make me love you again and want to give you a huge hug with Carnevino.  

This was one of the best meals I have ever had, so special that it gives me a warm feeling inside just thinking about this meal.  Corny to say but it is absolutely true.

Let me preface by saying that I rarely, if almost never, order ribeye cuts of steak.  The rich marbling gives me a tummy ache and I find that most restaurants serve it a little tough.  But Mario Batali's ribeye for two completely changed my opinion on ribeye, and since this meal I have only ordered this cut of meat at restaurants.

My entire experience at this restaurant was positive, so much that I felt like I was eating at an old friend's house.  From the moment we walked in, we were taken care of from one of the best servers I have ever had.  He was intimately familiar with the local farmers market scene, and especially the Molto Mario Farmer's market, where he is a volunteer.  He was able to talk about the specific elements of dishes and drinks that were obtained from specific merchants from that market.  Since I frequent this market, I knew exactly which products contributed to each dish.  It was pretty cool to witness the whole farm to table concept in action, especially in a town like Las Vegas.

This is one of the few dining experiences that have been super expensive, but I have not felt like I was ripped off.  Yes, the price of the dinner was high enough to give someone a heart attack, but it was totally worth it.  I've now been to most of the high end steakhouses in town, and none have been able to justify their prices as much as Carnevino.  It truly is an original gem and I plan on going back frequently.

One negative thing that I won't ding them on - they no longer offer the locals discount.  Weaksauce!
