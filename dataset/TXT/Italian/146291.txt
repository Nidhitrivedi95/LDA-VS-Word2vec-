K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ Current rap/hip hop music. We didn't stay long enough to give a review on a whole night here, but it was obviously not the club to be at. We did get to bypass a long wait with our Club Crawl group, even received free drink tickets. But when I got my drink- cranberry and vodka- it was cranberry with a tear drop of maybe some really cheap vodka (if there was any at all). There were a lot of lounging areas, sofas, couches... not sure where the dance floor was because every time we stopped to dance where a crowd was, some bouncer said, "keep it moving." And I saw a few people dancing alone up on these tables or the railings. We ended up finding a couple from our group who were not having fun either so we all booked it out of there.
