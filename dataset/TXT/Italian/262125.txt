wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg Love this place! The service is great the drinks are good and the food yummy and all at a very reasonable price. The patio is great for dining and they showed tonight they can do well with a large group. The scallops were a little over seasoned but well done you must have the beet salad!!
