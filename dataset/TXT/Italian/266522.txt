x4aHNNo1osWNCB75q_PijQ My born and raised Italian family decided to go here for dinner one night. We went here for a surprise birthday dinner for my uncle. We sat outside as we were a big group, waiting for his arrival. The misters were on, but it was more like taking a shower than a gentle mist...to say the least. We then ordered our food and drinks. The pizza dough was soggy and didn't hold it's shape (or the toppings for that matter). The food was over priced for its "quality". Hopefully his next birthday will be something he'll never forget. Never making this mistake again.
