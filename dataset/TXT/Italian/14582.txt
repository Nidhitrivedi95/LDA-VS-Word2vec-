1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag $9 Cesar salad - my plate should've been stuffed with croutons and freshly shredded parm cheese.  Nope: I got a plate of romaine lettuce.  I would've sent it back but I felt deprived of salads during my trip, plus, the dressing was creamy and delicious.  Still not worth $9!

The Italian food served here matched well with the prices: ave entree was about $15.  Decent food, decent prices.  We weren't fond of the dip that was served with the bread (our guess was that it's spinach in olive oil?) but the waiter kindly gave us plain olive oil and parm cheese on the side.  Great service :)

I wouldn't go back since I'm sure there are better places to visit on the strip.  But it was nice to have a relatively cheap and nonsteak dinner in Vegas!
