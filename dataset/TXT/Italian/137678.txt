J5puhDnVL9WetWnWWDMhQw The food was great and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. Small venue but didn't feel crowded. The price is fair. We went on a Saturday night and the food was ready fast. The food is fresh and authentic Italian. We had bruschetta to start The owner tended to us and he has five star service. 
The only reason I gave 4 stars is that the blonde female  waitress who served us water at first also offered us bruschetta in a way that was insistent even when looked resistant to it. And when we hadn't finished looking over appetizers.
