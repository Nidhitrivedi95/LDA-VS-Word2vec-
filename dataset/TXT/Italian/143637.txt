Had an opportunity to spend time talking with Brenda the wife of Emery and she is a real Asian foodie too. Our server Tiffany was wonderful and caring.

Being that it was a Thursday,  the restaurant was calm and both Brenda as well asTiffany were able to spoil us. On Fridays and Saturdays, when it's reservations recommended, all bets are off that the waitstaff can do the same. Interior restaurant colors are New Orleans with the purples, green and yellow. Ambiance is suggestive casual but serious Italian cucina presence.
