15YuEFO59yXd7BTO5NZgYw We went here last night, overall it was ok. To start, our waitress had the quietest voice and with a screaming baby next to us, she was difficult to hear. We had the traditional bruschetta and the meat stuffed mushrooms. Both were ok, I've never had bruschetta with feta cheese before (not something I'd recommend). My husband ordered the fettuccini Alfredo with jumbo shrimp. His meal was delicious and the jumbo shrimp were actually jumbo sized! I ordered one of the chefs specialities, blackened chicken on risotto with sautéed spinach. The chicken was delicious (probably the only good thing on my plate). The risotto was bland and under-cooked, so the rice was almost slightly crunchy. The sautéed spinach was so bland, even some salt and pepper would elevate it. Would not order that again. The other annoying part of our meal is that once our food was served we never saw our waitress again. We all had empty drinks and had to flag down another server to bring us refills. It was not busy while we were there so I don't understand the sub-par service. Overall, I wouldn't return here.
