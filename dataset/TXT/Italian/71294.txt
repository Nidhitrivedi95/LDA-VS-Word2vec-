C63sF-wG4f1doMIMv2qvOg I'm sure the group I was with had something to do with it, but I had a ball last night at Porta Alba.  Good wine, good company, courteous service, fantastic pizza, and nomnom deserts.

I had the Capricciosa pizza (mushrooms, olives, artichokes) and added prosciutto on top.  I was expecting tiny tiny pieces, but I certainly got my +$2 worth!!  Huge pieces draped over the pizza.  This heavenly creation also cemented my belief that pizza should always have artichokes on them, it is simply sooo good, especially paired with olives and ham.

Other people had the mussels and they looked pretty good, though the sauce looked super thick like others have said (just an observation; it's great for mopping up with the flatbread).  

For dessert? Chocolate gelato with an espresso shot over it (affogato).  Why get anything else?!
