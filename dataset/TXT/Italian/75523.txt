CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA Great pizza, toppings, and wings. The price for the special (2 slices and a drink) has gone up which doesn't it make the stamp card worth while anymore, but I'm fine with water. The slices are large and two easily fill you up. Definitely my goto place since I am located in Tempe, as well as in my top 5 pizza places in the valley. They also have a food challenge here which entails eating a party pizza (5 slices each) with another patron. Some dudes supposedly took this down in 7 minutes, I don't believe it.
