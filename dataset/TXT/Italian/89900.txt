I guess I can start with the great service you get at this small but wonderful restaurant. My boyfriend and I love going there for lunch since it's near work and their food is great. We arrive and the waitress knows exactly what we're drinking and makes sure our glasses are never empty. Oh how I love personalized service!

I've had several of their soups and sandwiches and have never been disappointed. Their Chicken Cutlet Hero is so good! You have to make sure to get a side of their marinara sauce to dip it in. I also love their Chicken on a Baguette special. I always add avocado to this sandwich to make it even better. If you go, make sure to try both their potato salad and their pasta salad. They are both delicious! My boyfriend and I disagree on which of the two is better.

You must try Fanny's if you find yourself in the Henderson area. I have yet to find another place like it in town. It's a true gem!
