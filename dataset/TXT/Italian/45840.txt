8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA A close friend took me there today for the my very first time.  If the soup would have been hot, I would have given the place 5 stars.  The angel hair marinara was prepared perfectly.  The service was excellent!  I will definitely return.  I can't wait to try other menu items.  This place is a winner!
