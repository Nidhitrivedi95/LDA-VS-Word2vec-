qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA This place is a little misleading.

As you walk through the mall at the Venetian, it looks like an outdooe cafe, but that is the place next door. The hostess ushers you past the bar into an elevator and you are then greeted by a life-size statue of Pavoratti! Most of the second floor of the mall is occupied by this place!

We were seated and waited on by a staff of no less than five waiters. It was a little early (5:30 on a Monday) and after the long drive from Reno, it was nice to have the whole place to ourselves.

Dinner began with a salad made from orzo pasta, barley, basil, cucumber, olives, parmagino reggiano  and tomatoes with an orange juice vinagrette. One of the most unique salads I have ever had!

I had their take on lobster fra diavolo, which was not as spicy as I normally would like, but consisted of a 2 lb lobster, shrimp the size of small dogs, scallops as big as my fists and an assortment of mussels and clams.

By 6, the place started to fill up and as we were leaving, it was packed with a 90 minute wait.

Arrive early and don't freak when the automatic 15% gratuity hits your bank statement. It drops off after a few days unless you're a tightwad who doesn't believe in tipping.
