vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw My family and I have eaten at Oreganos several times. The Italian sauces have an excellent flair and are very tasty. I prefer the marinara sauce. It is rich, red and spiced perfectly. The staff is always courteous and helpful. There are several locations throughout the greater Phoenix area, and we have eaten at three of them.  Our experience is the consistency of all three is very good. The pasta has a fresh home made taste. The breads our fresh and very tasty. They have an adequate selection of reasonably priced wines. Oreganos is far and away much better than any other chain Italian restaurant we have ever eaten at. They have an extensive menu with a great variety of choices. For everything you get, we also find it very reasonably priced. Adequate parking also. Make sure that you try this place if you enjoy Italian!!
