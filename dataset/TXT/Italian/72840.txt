cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ Oh. Em. Gee!!!!!! Fantastic Italian cuisine. Super friendly staff, and Chef Marc makes you feel special and recommends based on what you like. My husband got the Veal Chop Tartufo, and I got the Filet Mignon El Chico (medium rare). Both were the best Veal & Filet Mignon we've ever had. My husband didn't stop with the fork and knife; decided to say "screw utensils" literally chewed down to the bone with his hands. Hands down a new favorite, and cannot wait to come back!! 
Special thanks to Chef Marc for the Anniversary Tiramisu,  the best!
