OlvsH2r5A82qVVP1eSDNDQ Q: Who makes a really good Chicago style deep dish pizza here in the Valley besides (some) Rosati's? 
A: This place does!

I ordered a deep dish to go - it smelled and looked so good, I ate a slice right there and took the rest home. It was absolutely delicious. He uses quality ingredients. It's not dissimilar to my good experiences with Rosati's, but it does have a fairly unique flavor profile. It somehow tastes a little more Chicago. 

I can't eat deep dish pizzas all the time without becoming a giant ball of lard, so this will have to be the occasional treat for me. I'm definitely coming here again though. I'll probably have to try their thin crust as well.
