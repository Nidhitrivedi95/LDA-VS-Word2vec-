pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ Let's face it, if you're in the shops by Planet Hollywood, food choices are a bit limited.  In need of drinks and a little something to eat, we landed here on a Sunday afternoon.  Pretty much had the place to ourselves.  We chose the bar as we didn't want a full meal.

Husband enjoyed his Manhattan and I had a nice Chianti.  We shared a perfectly delicious sausage and peppers pizza.  Highlight was the awesome complimentary bread and beautiful trio of nice olive oil, parmesan and balsamic to dip into.  Yum!  

Atmosphere is a bit dated, but the food, service and drinks were just what we needed!
