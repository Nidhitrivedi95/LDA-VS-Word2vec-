The call center messed up the phone number so when the driver took it to my hotel, they took it back because no one answered for it.

The call center said that if I would go pick it up I would get it for free because of the mess up.

Once I got to the pizza place, "Tony" was extremely mad he had to give two pizzas away for free. The driver should me the receipt and my number was incorrect.

I got my pizzas and I asked for cheese & peppers. Tony gave me literally 3 total small packages. I asked for more and he gave me 5 more so I had a total of 8 packages all together of cheese & peppers for my two extra large pizzas. I asked him for more and he said he's already losing money with the free pizzas, he couldn't give me more cheese & peppers.

This was the worst experience ever.
