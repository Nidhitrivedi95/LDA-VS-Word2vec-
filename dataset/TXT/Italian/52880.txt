a-Mo7Ipu_c5y21mmg0-F7g High end Italian food, in an unassuming tratorria style hideaway.  You'll feel at home whether in jeans or business casual.

The korean born, italian trained chef, was totally hands on; from the welcome, right through to the finish. 

We had the five course prix fixe meal for two; which for $45/person, had an abundance of choices and substance to tease the tastbuds and satiate our appetites.

Recommend you check it out, before word of mouth makes desireable reservations difficult to obtain.
