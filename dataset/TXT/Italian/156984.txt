lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ Buca's not the best Italian food you'll ever have.  It's not the best Italian food you can get in Vegas.  But, my friend Daniella is from a very Italian family and they come here all the time so it can't be that big.

If you've never been here, the first thing to note is that everything is served family style.  As such, I've found it's much more enjoyable to go with a BIG group of people so you get a varied choice of a bunch of different things.  I went last night with one friend and we got the gnocchi and chicken marsala.  And, while the gnocchi was good, you can really only have a small portion before feeling like a dumpling yourself.  The marsala is different - it's much sweeter than what I'm used to, but still very good and is served with big, plump mushrooms.

Their salad with prosciutto and gorgonzola is fantastic, and we ordered a $10 tiramisu wondering what a $10 tiramisu looks like.  Well, we found out.  It came in a giant bowl and 3/4 of it is still in my fridge.

No, you can't have any.  It's all mine.
