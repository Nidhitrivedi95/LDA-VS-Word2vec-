soLU5qCw1otTHge9J2MQ1A The food is wonderful - as authentic as you can get this side of the Atlantic. The atmosphere is charming and comfortable. And the service feels more like stopping in at a good friend's house for a meal, very warm and inviting. Exceptional restaurant with excellent Italian food, at reasonable prices.
