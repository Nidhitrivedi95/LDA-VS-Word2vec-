d1_Ko1DQ4QyB9BjnCFjVLw I have never left a review on Yelp before but I was inspired to download the app just to warn people about this place. I wish I would have looked at reviews before I came here today. I used to make the drive from north scottsdale, all the way over to glendale just for this restaurant when I was 16 to let's say 20. I am now 30 and decided to mix things up with my girlfriend and try my favorite from when I was a kid. This place has gone down hill in a hurry. I laughed audibly out loud when I read the review previously written saying they think it changed hands. I had just done a Google search on my phone to see if they sold out. The owner must have gotten a new manager or food provider. The food made me sick. I ordered whole wheat pasta with the reduced fat marinara and it came out like a bowl of soup. We tried the 4.50 portobello mushroom appetizer and that was like a hot sponge soaked in vinager. The bread is soggy and nasty. I was embarrassed to take my girlfriend here.
