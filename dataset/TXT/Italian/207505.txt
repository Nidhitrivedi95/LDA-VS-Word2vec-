qKButPdfAkVWBMM9oPMU4w My folks grew up going to Elio's - so it's been around a LONG time, and is still owned by Elio's family. Luckily for me, my parents shared this gem of a restaurant with me  years ago :)

So first, don't expect fancy decor because I don't think they've redecorated since they opened the restaurant 30 years ago. This is a really traditional, family-style restaurant with no bells and whistles. The focus is on the FOOD. If you get there past 5pm on a weekend, you can expect a line-up.  That said, you can call ahead to order takeout.

In my opinion, Elio makes the best pizza in town. They're not cheap on the toppings, and I find their all-dressed to be a well-rounded mix of pepperoni, bell pepper, mushrooms and cheese. The crust is perfect - not too thick. I also appreciate that their crust is never wet like some places!  Their pasta dishes are equally good, with my favorite being the cavatelli. I'm not sure if they make their own pasta but if not, the guy they get it from does a real good job of giving me that illusion!  Elio's sauce is so good that I never leave the resto without buying a jar or two. Yup, Elio stocks the front fridge with sauce and a few pastas for those of us who want to bring some home. 

Elio offers a few different pastas and sauces that you can 'mix and match' if you like. They are very generous with their portions, so you'll leave there with a Buddha belly and quite possibly, a doggy bag. As well, their prices are super affordable. 

What are you waiting for? GO!
