wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg First time here tonight and it was Father's Day. The service was great here and the food matched! The ambiance was perfect for the occasion. Nice family place and great for big gatherings. I was lucky enough to meet the chef. I informed my server that I was gluten free and it was an allergy. She assured me there would be a dish that the chef could Make for me. It was a great touch to have the chef come out and take my personal gluten free order. He made sure I found a Dish that was suitable for my needs. I ordered pasta and it was AMAZING! Best gluten free Italian dish I've had. My picky daughter even ate the pasta and salad. My husband was very happy with his special day and experience and wants to go back asap. My only wish is that Maggianos would provide gluten free bread/flatbread. You have gluten free pasta, why not offer bread??
