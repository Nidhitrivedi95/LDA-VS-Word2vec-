qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA My friends and I had brunch here yesterday and had an amazing experience. We were visiting Tempe for a music festival and I'm so disappointed that there are no Postinos in California. 

I ordered their mimosa and french toast, which was delicious. My boyfriend got the plate of 4 bruschetta: smoked salmon, salami, tomato mozzarella, and BLT. After seeing his plate, I kind of regretted my decision of getting breakfast instead of lunch, but at least he shared. I even ended up ordering one extra BLT bruschetta--so good!

My friends and boyfriend shared a few pitchers of beer, which comes with enough beer for 2 glasses (I assume around 32 oz). All pitchers of beer and wine are $5 before 5 pm! We were very impressed with their drink specials and their yummy food. We probably would have come back here if we stayed another day in Arizona!
