KcIalceIg6PSPONvLlI4-w Sud Forno is bliss. Americano was decent. The Nutella Doughnuts are unreal. Small for $3, but filled with delicious Italian imported Nutella. Their salted caramel pudding is also to die for. They just released a new pudding made with pistachio which I will try next time!

Come around 11-12 for fresh pizza at lunch. A+ for tons of seating upstairs at a large communal table. They sell Terroni's hot sauce (next door).

Grab a Nutella doughnut, pull up a bar stool, and watch the well-dressed Queen St W pedestrians walk by the window.
