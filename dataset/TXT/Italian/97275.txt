EtLmuDIMsBCmqdgpysz60Q Went here with two colleagues while on a business trip. Inside was deserted when we arrived (7 pm) but a few more tables filled up after awhile. Server was harried and a bit inattentive.  I ordered the lamb chops and they were decent, slightly fatty, but ok. Would probably go next door to Nola next time. The owner was there and stopped by to say hello and inquire about the wine we were drinking, relatively good Malbec at a pretty decent price. They were playing rock music/pop (Ice Ice Baby, etc) which seemed odd for an Italian place. Then as we were wrapping up, opera music came on WAY too loud. It was weird. Overall, decent food, somewhat decent service. Just ok.
