OOXUDZVOREgjwrLiwr3Spg Now ive eaten here before, and its nothing special- although it is a bowling alley so its to be expected. But the service is the worst ever!! The server we had was rude to us throughout the whole experience. She gave us this attitude when we told her we wanted the check split in half.  The bartender didn't even know how to make the drink we asked. We asked for Ameretto and they had no clue what it was. After which we had to wait forever to get a round of drinks and had to order from 3 seperate servers because they kept "forgetting" our simple order of 2 jack and cokes, and 1 ameretto and whiskey. Worst and slowest service ive ever had. After getting our drink order wrong twice they gave us the check.
