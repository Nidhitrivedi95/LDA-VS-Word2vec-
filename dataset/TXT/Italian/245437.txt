UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ I was brought here by a friend for happy hour. supposedly there were hot chicks here.

The food SUCKS bangladeshi taxidriver assholes. If you want to know what a bangladeshi taxi drivers asshole tastes likes...please try brio.

Brio is basically the mcdonalds, or wendys of italian food.

The crowd here is on the trashier side. The one at tivoli has the same shitty food, but with a more prosperous and much older crowd. The good news is tivoli has live music in the summer. I will probably be going there for *drinks only* whenever they have music.
