epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ BEST ITALIAN JOINT!

We had a wonderful dinner in this legendary restaurant in Cleveland's Little Italy. We started with the evening's special appetizer of Crab Crostini and they were delicious. For the entree I had the Frutti di Mare Piccanti (excellent) and my wife had the special Middle Neck Clams with Linguini (also excellent).

No room for dessert!

Five stars all around.
