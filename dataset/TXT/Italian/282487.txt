YzMUZjUMcgI-NSGu48-nIQ I have passed this place on multiple occasions and based on the strip mall appearance would never have stopped.  We were invited by friends and I am so glad!  This place is an absolute gem.  Inside is cozy and warm.  Great for dining with friends or for a romantic date.  I ordered the shrimp and spicy tomato sauce with black linguine.  The pasta is freshly made and squid ink used to dye the pasta.  It gives a nice subtle salty taste.  I also had a taste of the gnocchi dish that is carried on the menu and it was fabolous.  The texture was just right- not dry or overly chewy.  I could have eaten the whole plate.  We got the toll house pie and it was also amazing.  For two meals, dessert, one glass of wine, and a couple of beers our bill was under $50.  For the amount and quality of food, I felt it was a fantastic value. I will be back.
