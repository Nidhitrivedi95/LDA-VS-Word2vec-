7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ One of my favorite spots in Phx. Parking can be frustrating, so the weekends you should consider valet. 

All the salads are solid and for pizza, I'd recommend the Avocado Pizza. It is a spin on the standard margherita adding a splash of a freshly squeezed lemon and then topped off with a fresh sliced avocado. For the record, LGO buys the best avocados I've tasted. 

Another tip buy your bottle of wine in the attached grocery side of LGO for no cork fee and prices aren't bad for bottled wine. 

Great casual upscale dining atmosphere. Jeans, t-shirt, and great food.
