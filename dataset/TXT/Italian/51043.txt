9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg Quite a busy place - came here with a group of 14 for a friends birthday dinner. 

Server was very knowledgeable about the menu but was too thorough. She highlighted everything on the menu, which means that it was hard to actually distinguish what was good. Appreciate her helpfulness though. 

We split the penne pollo and the Sophia pizza - def get the pizzas or pastas as that's their specialty. They have really cool pizza cutters too. The food is definitely above average and authentic Italian food. 

The bills took a while to get as the servers were slow. But all in all, it was a good night.
