sbm0jmhWui8YrvFgxnJ4kQ Glass NIckel Online Ordering System For Sun Prairie Store: "Oh, you want to get delivery, huh? Well the minimum is now $20 for delivery, sucker!"

Me: "But that isn't even the price of a hot sub sandwich and side of french fries or tater tots. And I've ordered for less than $20 before. Even says 'Minimum $10 delivery' on the main Glass Nickel page."

Glass NIckel Online Ordering System For Sun Prairie Store: "Well, that doesn't apply to all stores as all stores are independently owned and operated."

Me: "Then I will independently avoid all Glass Nickel stores and franchises in the future. Your food is overpriced and overrated anyways."

So, yeah. I'm done with Glass Nickel Pizza for good. It's not worth it when there are competitors who only require a minimum of $10 for an order, and off the top of my head, I can think of two in Sun Prairie that have better pizza too.
