Tf13Wexrt6WmNw-CDW5Gyg My wife and I ended up here by complete accident and I wouldn't have been sad if we never went here at all.  I'm not a big fan of Town Square as I feel the restaurants are overpriced, much like the Strip.  The Meatball Spot is no exception.  Our server was okay but he seemed more interested in his iPad way of taking our order than actually taking our order.  

As I said, it was an accident, because the movie we wanted to see was sold out.  Not wanting to waste a babysitter we decided to grab a late afternoon drink and a snack.  I had a $7 beer that seemed like it was an 11 oz. pour and my wife tried to play it safe with the Sangria.  Someone must have been playing a mean joke because it was the worst Sangria either of us had ever tasted.  Sour, sugary, with not a hint of booze, and it came in right around $8.  Awful and undrinkable.

For the food portion we decided to share the Apple, Pecan, Gorgonzola Salad and it was pretty tasty but was small for what we paid for.  We then decided to share the 'Daily Special' Chicken Meatballs which weren't too great.  Three Meatballs, a little sauce, and a tiny piece of bread.  The meatballs were moist but way too spicy, in a Spanish way, as was the sauce they were in.  Our afternoon drink and a snack set us back around $45 and I could have had a better meal at Sweet Tomatoes for less than half the price.
