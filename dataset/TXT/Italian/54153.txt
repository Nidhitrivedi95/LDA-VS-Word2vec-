A8CbZwWOPsd_9wrJlv94Lw My husband and I passed by this place dozens of times, but today we decided to stop and have lunch.   Wow!   They had a special of a medium pizza with one topping for only $5.99.   So I got that.   Really tasty ... almost as good as back in New York/New Jersey.    My husband ordered a small calzone for $7.95 .... it took a while to bake (about 30 minutes).   I couldn't believe it when they brought it to the table - it was HUGE!!   I'm there "that's a SMALL?!".   Two people could easily share it.   I also noticed a sign that showed daily specials .... if you like calzones it's only $5.99 on Saturday for a small!   We'll definitely go back.
