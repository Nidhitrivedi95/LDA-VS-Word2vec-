nY2oBwH3s5sKox1mERIoVQ Here's a place I've passed by a thousand times but finally tried for a dinner.  I loved it!

Relaxed, cozy atmosphere (the back of the restaurant has a bit more character though, with its exposed brick walls and art posters).  Light classic jazz in the background makes it conversation- (and eavesdropping-) friendly.

The food was amazing.  We had the pumpkin ravioli,which seems to be a favourite.  It's unique, and refreshingly not swimming in oil.  The seafood pizza sounds outlandish but was also delicious, with quality ingredients.  Solid dessert and coffee too.  Can't wait to try more of the large menu here.

Unlike some other Yelpers, I think the prices here are perfectly reasonable (and I'm cheaper than your grandmother!)

The negatives: mediocre bread, and the service was exceptionally slow and neglectful (and I usually give restaurants *a lot* of leeway in this department, so you know it's bad!).  Excellent food made the absent service easier to overook, though.
