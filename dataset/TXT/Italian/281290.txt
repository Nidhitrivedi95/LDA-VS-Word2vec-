YstdDnNa6h_ms3Ys7Pz4uQ The experience I had today at Carrabas Italian Grill was worse than any other I had ever had here. First we placed our order online. We made a 20 kinute drive to the restaurant only to find out the carryout waitress had forgotten to write down our order! We then waites another 30 minutes while she tried to figure out what had happened instead of simply giving us our food so we could be on our way. Worst. Experience. Ever
