GzYAIjVULpRrFV2dQMKDog I love little unassuming eateries tucked away that pleasantly surprise me.  My husband and I moved out here from Chicago a little over 2 years ago, and we miss the little Italian deli's and restaurants we were used to back home.  We were running errands and found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try for lunch.  

Simple little place, mostly carryout, but room for dining in.  Small, family run business.  The chef, (the owner's father) has been cooking Italian favorites for years.  The food was delicious and the hosts are a sweet and gracious family that made us feel as if we were guests in their own home.
