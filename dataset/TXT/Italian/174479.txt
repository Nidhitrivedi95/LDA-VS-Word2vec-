nDfN1RkA40anfzjFGRO8qQ Very unassuming from the outside, Bella Luna is actually located at the end of a Safeway shopping center.   However, everything else about this place is great.  I've eaten here 4 or 5 times, trying something new everytime and have not eaten one thing that hasn't been great.  The wine list is rather large for a smallish restaurant.

The service at Bella Luna is also top-notch.  The wait staff is attentive and flexible to requests, and the owners (a husband and wife) will often swing by during the meal to see how everything is.   

Prices are also reasonable with most entrees running in the $10-$18 range.

The only drawback is the size.  It's not a huge place, so call ahead or come early.  

I suggest:  
Veal Saltimbocca-  All of their meat is very good.
Tournados-  Will usually only appear as a special, though the chef can usually make it for you if requested.
Lasagne al forno-  Just like home. 
Tiramisu-  Fantastic.  Not too coffee-ey.
