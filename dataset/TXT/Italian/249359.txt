VIP5_HoBm98wcJPwz0lZjg I enjoy their shrimp pasta. Their salmon pasta, on the other hand, hardly has any salmon in it. Their desserts are pretty tasty too! Especially their nutella moon with cheese. Yum! 

So why not 4 or 5 stars? Because I value people keeping their word and communicating honestly when they can't. When I ordered through Just Eat, they told me that I will always get a discount if I ordered directly from them. So I started ordering directly. The minimum order is/was $25 for delivery. Everything was fine until one day, out of the blue, they said I had to spend $35 minimum for delivery and that they would not give me the delivery discount because, for some reason, the food that I had been ordering from them which is still on their menu was suddenly not available for delivery. I heard a number of other excuses which didn't make any sense because I had just placed the very same order as recently as the day before and yet, they just wouldn't take that into account. Odd!
