zBsAx28cbiUgqWGjKOGucA I was not expecting a pizza to be this good!! 
(Well, partially due to I was not a pizza fan to begin with, so my review may not be as critical, just a heads up :p) 
But the pizza from this place definitely changed my taste preference and view towards Italian freshly made pizzas!! 
We came for company lunch, all of us ordered different pizza pie. I had "slow and low", which turned out to be my favourite amongst all. It's mixed with BBQ sauce n pulled pork, what can possibly beat that!!
The pie is thin and crispy, the topping (at least mine) did not soak the pie nor made it mushy, so the combination flavour was a perfect touch in my mouth. 
I will definitely return for the same pie more often, and hoping for consistencies in the perfect slow and low pizza every time!!

Good work!
