gzOjboYojl0RfUDiETdGXA Three of us went during summerlicious 2012 and loved the overall experience. We made a reservation the day before without issues and were seated right away when we got there. The menu was great, lots of choices. 

I started with the arugula pear salad, it was delicious! My friends both had the bruschetta and they both enjoyed it (8 pieces). My main was the Italian sausage ravioli with a cream sauce, it was the best ravioli I've ever had! One friend also got it and agreed. The other friend had a stuffed hen and said the sauce and flavor was superb. For dessert we all got something different, I got the tiramisu and found it great, perfect texture (I've made it before, this version destroyed mine). One friend had chocolate cake and she said it was better than sex, the other friend had a cheese cake and enjoyed it too. 

I love this place and will visit again, great staff, great Italian beer, great selection.
