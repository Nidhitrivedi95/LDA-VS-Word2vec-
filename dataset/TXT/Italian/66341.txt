BnuzcebyB1AfxH0kjNWqSg Enjoy Carrabbas very much. Excellent Sangria (Blackberry a favorite) We have had nearly 100% superb waitstaff, friendly and accomodating. It can get confusing because as the food is ready, other waitstaff may bring to the table...so you often see multiple people in a short time. Love the lasagna, very generous portions, And the House salad is always fresh and the Parmesan dressing wonderful. Chicken Bryan, Lobster MacNCheese, and a seasonal pork medallions with a fig sauce all excellent.
Wish they had  Apple Crostada year round---kind of like a free form apple pie but so much more...And please keep the mini desserts on the menu year round. they are perfect size!
