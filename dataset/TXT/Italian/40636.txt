7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Lance is by far the BEST waiter we've ever had. My boyfriend and I went to Carnevino for his birthday dinner and were from Chicago and to be honest have been to some of the top restaurants in the city that have boasted about great service, but Lance was the best we've ever had. He knows everything about cooking processes, food, wine etc. he makes you feel comfortable and taken care of without bothering. He takes care of you from start to finish. Great experience, oh and food was phenomenal. Best steak ever. Octopus was to die for!!!!
