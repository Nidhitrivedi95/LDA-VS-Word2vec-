SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog Reminds me alot of Cucina Tagliani (a small chain of Italian restaurants in the west valley).  Went here for a friend's birthday.  The bottom-line:  If you go home hungry, its your fault.  They'll do their best to fill you up on bread and salad, but save room cause dinners are huge.  I got the deep dish lasagna with marinara.  Tasty stuff.  There was enough of us that we shared the entire dessert menu.  None of the desserts really stuck out to me.  They were good, though not out of this world.  Servers were friendly and gave us a laundry list of specials to choose from that night.  Very family friendly place as there were kids everywhere the night we went.  Overall, a good decent neighborhood Italian spot with reasonable prices.  Won't knock your socks off, but gets the job done and there's a better than 50/50 chance you'll need a box for your leftovers at the end of your meal.
