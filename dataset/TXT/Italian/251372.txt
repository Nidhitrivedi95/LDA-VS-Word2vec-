VraSwdw04w1LASF1xRBkdw I love this place! Awesome outdoor atmosphere, delicious food. I've had the buffalo chicken pizza and a basil something pizza from here and they were so good! Pepperoni and cheese are just as great. They also have awesome garlic knots.

I've only gotten take out and never eaten inside, but it looks really nice and roomy. Also super nice staff.
