tQBTBxZyM3OarBffqafu4w Ordered for take-out.  Was pleasantly greeted on the phone and my order was taken down promptly.  When I showed up, the restaurant was pretty quiet and I was able to pay for my food and go in about three minutes.  I payed $10.45 for a large cheese pizza.  The pizza was nice and hot, but was mediocre in taste.    I ended up having to jazz it up at home with some basil, crushed red pepper, and garlic powder.

There was a sign outside advertising the lunch buffet for $6.99, but I don't know that it's worth the money.  I can tell you that based on my the pizza I ate, I won't be ordering from them again.
