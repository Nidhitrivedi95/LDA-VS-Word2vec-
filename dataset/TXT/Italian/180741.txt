I wouldn't say the food is excellent, but it is what you'd expect for the price. The service when we went was incredibly slow, though friendly. There was barely anyone in the restaurant, so I'm not sure why it was so slow. The atmosphere is an odd mix of a sit-down restaurant and a sports bar, but I guess they were trying to appeal to the Vegas crowd (though it's nowhere near the strip). I'd go back if I had to but I wouldn't rush in.
