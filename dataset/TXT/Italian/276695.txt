I came here for dinner the other day (they are only open for dinner), I really enjoyed my dinner here. Like other reviewers said, they have this old country club type ambiance. Reservation is highly recommended as they get busy.

Their wine list is extensive, I enjoyed a nice glass of Italian red with my meal. 

We started with a couple of appetizers. When a server explained to us that their burrata was home made, I had to try it. It is so soft, it melts in my mouth, together with tomato and olives, it makes as a perfect refreshing appetizer. 

Escargot was okay for me.  It wasn't bad but I had one better somewhere else. 

For my main dish, I really debated what to do. I ended up having tortellini, this one caught my attention first, although there were several more I wanted to try but I couldn't walk away from tortellini. They are home made... How could I resist homemade pasta? My intuition was correct. They were very good. Texture, flavor, portion, everything was perfect.

I tried their tiramisu for desert. Very large portion, good size to share.

So, 4 star service..., obviously it was my first time there and most other customers were in their retirement, and many seemed to be regular there. I just felt they received more attention and personalized service than my table.  Perhaps we looked really young in the crowds.  They were polite but they weren't attentive to our table.
