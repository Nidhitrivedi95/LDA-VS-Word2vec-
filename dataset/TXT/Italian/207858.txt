qlg2QMEErgseygqs_MQETA A group of us came here two nights ago for drinks and dinner...I have never encountered a place where the staff is so rude.  First, the hostess was nasty.  You cannot have a good service experience if the first person you encounter is rolling her eyes and cannot seem to stop her nose from scraping against the ceiling.  No greeting, no smile, nothing.  She looked like a zombie.
Secondly, the server was okay.  Flustered and curt, however, she was overworked, so we tipped well.
Thirdly, the food: I had calamari and it was disgustingly salty.  The marinara accompanying it was cold and also tasted like a salt lick.  No one was impressed by the food, at all; you would do better eating Stouffer's from your local grocer.  It takes a special skill set to be able to screw up a deep fried appetizer.
We were eager to try this place and we were prepared to drop a considerable amount of money on alcohol and apps...needless to say, we were unimpressed.  I was unaware that Italian food could be this gross.
