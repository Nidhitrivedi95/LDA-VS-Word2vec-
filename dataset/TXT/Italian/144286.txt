JZwPJyoJnqlfjCsrnSUmNw Everything I tried was great! I couldn't bear the thought of only trying one thing, so I went with the Pick 2. I got a chicken panini (no menu option is boring; this one had tender chicken, portobello, cheese, and chipotle mayo), and a toscano side salad. My DP got the pulled pork with a side of spoonbread (a baked corn thing). All four items were very high quality, and I'd be glad to get any of them again...but there are many other items on the menu I'd love to try too! Reasonable prices too--her pulled pork sandwich and my salad were especially large for the price, so if you go with that combo, you'll be very full for $8.50!
