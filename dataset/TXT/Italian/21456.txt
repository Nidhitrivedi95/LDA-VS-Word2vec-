What makes this place standout is the kitchen. Not just your typical sports bar fare. In addition to some huge burgers, the kitchen whips up some terrific pasta dishes and a whole lot more.

I had the Fettuccine Bolognese and it was as good as I've had at any Italian restaurant. We started off with some mozzarella sticks too. Not the typical ones that you get in a bar or a chain restaurant. These seemed like they had been breaded by hand.

Add to all of this very friendly staff. Definitely a spot I would come back to if here again.
