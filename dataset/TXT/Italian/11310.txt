I particularly like the chicken Marsala and the Alfredo linguine.  Someone with us got a butternut squash soup to start.  I tried it and it shocked me how good it was.  Diverse flavour profile and just a enough cream.

I was also able to take advantage of Yelps check in deal.  My wife also used hers and our table got two orders of crispy ravioli.
