6We2O5X62J_gduXU7jvf8w I ordered by phone and service was friendly, Pizza was a custom Large Pepperoni,  Onion and mushroom which was great and arrived hot, The garlic bread was good but I wish there was more for price. Delivery guy was professional and quick having plates and condiments. For your regular pizza fix Spinatos hits the spot.
