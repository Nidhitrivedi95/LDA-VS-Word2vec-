_e3rChyednoh47n2cjGv2w After reading reviews and seeing the star rating, my sister in law and I decided to try it since we like to support local places.  It was not very crowded for Friday lunch time, we ordered and I received eggplant parmigiana and it was soggy and cold and tasted terrible.  No crispness, nothing.  I told the waiter and he said if remade it would be the same bc of the cheese and sauce!!  Not sure how since should of been crispy to start and baked in an oven, but whatever.  The sauce tasted ragu like and so I didn't want a different meal so I decided to eat tiramisu, I think it would of been good if it did have the refrigerator taste.  Overall not a great dining experience!
