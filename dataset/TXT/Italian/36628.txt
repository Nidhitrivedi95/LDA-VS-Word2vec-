6We2O5X62J_gduXU7jvf8w Spinatos has some of the best pizza in the valley. This location is always extremely busy so we almost always order carry out. We've tried almost all of their combinations and have never been disappointed. Some favorites include: get meaty and the roasted Fennel and Italian sausage. Salads are good, but nothing spectacular. Haven't tried any of the other dishes or deserts. If you are in the mood for pizza you won't be disappointed coming here!
