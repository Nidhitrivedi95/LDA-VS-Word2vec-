pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg What a wonderful experience! The good was delicious (absolutely HUGE portions that feed 4-5 people each) but the service was even better. We celebrated a 91st birthday and a 34th wedding anniversary at Carmine's and couldn't have asked for anythingn better. They were attentive, friendly and made the special occasion more special in their own way. I would absolutely recommend this place on these two qualities alone. Adding in there were 15 of us and for everything we ordered it was more than reasonable!
