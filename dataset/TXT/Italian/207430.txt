qisbqK1wxuwp6GumMrwB2Q This is my favorite Italian restaurant!!  The pizzas are delicious and the Pasta is amazing. The owners are great and help us out with anything we need. This has a small town feel, the owner and employees get to know you and treat you great! We had a memorial service there and the owner and his wife were great beyond words. You will not be disappointed if you go to Bottega, you will have a great experience!
