iFGC7CIcVKWdIKjIO7w6Tw My review is mainly for Umami- because it's simply my favorite and the best. 

Don't get me wrong, the pizza looks delicious- but it's the Raman that we come back weekly for.

New to Ramen? It's not your $.50 grocery staple- you will fall in love with it- don't be afraid to mix it up.

I love adding in corn, butter and a soft egg to a Spicy Shenjo, but their are multiple offerings. 

Ambience is a lot of fun at night- I have great nostalgia for my college days.
