1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag This restaurant is located on the lower level of Palazzo hotel. It's an outdated restaurant. Chairs and plates are very old. You can see all the chair are well faded even in a dark environment. 
Service: is extremely slow for a NOT busy Sat night. The front desk person was rude (short / dark hair lady); we apologized for the changes of total party; she looked away and being ignorance. She gave us the same attitude when we said "thank you" for her helps (3 times) . She also made us waited while she was busy talking to other gal and blamed that the server is not ready when we asked if our table was ready. 
The restaurant was emptied when we walked inside and servers were sitting/ standing around ( and the receptionist said server was not ready). It took them 30mins+ for our food. 

Food: only -1 star for the food. I have never try any Italian food that taste salty as this one. We ordered special pasta, seafood pasta, seared salmon, steaks and salad. 
-Salad dressing smell like rotten food. 
-Special pasta looked like they just throw everything on it then topped w cheese then in the oven and on the table. 
- seafood pasta tasteless and seafood wasn't fresh
- the salmon was salty and the sauce came with it was weird and sour. The only thing I was good was the grilled potato that came with the order. 
- steak was so dried : we order well done but never expected to be completely dried like that . We had steak and ordered well done before but never expected a dried play-dough on a plate at this restaurant. 

Overall: this restaurant doesn't reserve even 1 star but i will give it to them for the server who has no smile but tried to accommodate us.
