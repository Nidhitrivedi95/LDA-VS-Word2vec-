64o_nYvzIKwHFOSYSEm-qw I got screwed.  I pointed out the error, when I was picking up my pizza:  I had ordered BANANA peppers; not peperoncini.  SOB at the counter, walked away, then lied to me; saying that he got it wrong, that is was really banana peps.

I should've gone to Papa John's.

What "shits"....
