The service was good, although it did take a while for our food to arrive, especially given it was lunch time and not very busy. 

The food itself was to be expected. I had a Focaccia Salsiccia with sausages, mushrooms, peppers and onion, it was a bit dry for my taste (no sauce of any kind on the focaccia), and the focaccia itself was rather dry and heavy - not the traditional light mouth water fresh focaccia I was expecting. My fiance had a seafood risotto which he enjoyed, the shrimps in it were excellent.

As others have mentioned they tried to up sell us on the water (flat or sparkling) and when I asked for a pitcher of tap water they said they didn't have pitchers, given it was the middle of the day and 35 degrees out I would have really liked a pitcher of ice water. Although the did do a good job of keeping our glasses filled as we drained them like fish.

All in all it was a pretty average meal - nothing inherently wrong but I wasn't leaving singing it's praises.
