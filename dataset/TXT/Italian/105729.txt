fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I really love this spot. It's small and intimate. I had the Ramin with bbq pork. The flovor of the broth was amazing. There was a decent amount of pork and it was shaved so thinly it practically melted in your mouth!!
There will be a wait during high time so go at off times if you want no wait times.
