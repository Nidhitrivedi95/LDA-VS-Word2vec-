fXBZsZYPFDDhYk5ySJJQFA Palma pasta had been my go-to when i need a quick dinner for family and myself. The meat lasagna is great and the large portion can easily feed 6-8 people. The lasagna has generous amounts of ground beef, and sauce. Id wish there was a bit more cheese but i cant complain.

Make sure to come early during the day as the larger size dinners can be sold out by 6-7PM! Its also very busy during holiday times so make sure to go early.
