yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg This recently became my favorite Italian restaurant ever for so many more reasons than the food. 

We walked in and were greeted by who I can only assume is the owner (an older Italian gentleman wearing a Yankees jersey) and seated in a booth. Frank Sinatra was singing and we were surrounded by pictures of past and present Yankees players (The Yankees are my AL team because I have a need to be severely anti-Red Sox). 

Our waiter, Brandon/Meatball, was super friendly and never let my water glass get anywhere near empty. I love that. 

So now on to the food, which was absolutely amazing... My mouth still waters just thinking about it. Our app of choice, garlic bread, was some of the best ever. I had the Chilean Sea Bass special - the fish  was cooked perfectly (and I'm not usually a fan of cooked fish) and the spinach ravioli it was on top of was amazingly delicious. 

The only way this night could have gotten better is if I had been with a date who was drinking so that I could have drank as well. A nice white wine would have complimented the fish wonderfully.

As we were leaving, Steppenwolf started playing. How can any experience associated with a "Magic Carpet Ride" not get 5 stars?
