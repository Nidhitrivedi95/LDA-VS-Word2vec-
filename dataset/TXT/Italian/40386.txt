7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Came here this past weekend and it was anything but sublime. Also, came here several years ago when I was not aware of Joe Bastianich nor Mario Batali and I remember leaving dissatisfied and robbed.

This time we thought it would be much better since we opted for the beef tasting menu ($150pp) since it showcases their specialties in all aspects...but every dish was bland, uninteresting, and disappointing.  

Total waste of calories and chee$e.
