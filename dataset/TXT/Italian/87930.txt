dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg I was so sad to see this amazing place close. But then, I ran in to Chef Marc a few weeks ago! He said he is planning to re-open near Sahara and Durango by the Outback Steakhouse. Stay tuned yelpers! Update 10/26/15: the location is under construction and due to open in 3-4 weeks!
