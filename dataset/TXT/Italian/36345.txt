6rl2DTYflL0t1_oL4KudYw Ordered delivery on Sunday night was told it would be 45 minutes to an hour. It took an hour and half to get here. When it did arrive both my pizza and calazon were cold. Pizza was to behalf pepperoni with extra cheese pizza did not have extra cheese. Very disappointed tried calling but it rang a number if timed no answer. $38.00 on cold food and not made right. That's a lot of money for me.  Wish I could have talked to someone to fix this issue.
