Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A Yum <U+203C> high quality, modern and fresh Italian food. The atmosphere is casual to upscale and you can have a nice meal out before a concert or after a walk around the new and improved downtown Tempe and river walk areas. 

Most of the Pastas are made in house. The Agnolotti (mushroom ravioli) with pink sauce is my absolute favorite (and has been for decades). The lightly breaded calamari is a must- it's perfectly flash fried and not rubbery.

Besides the House of Tricks, they have the best Bar and Wine selection in the area. But Here, you get to sit inside when the heat is too hot. 

Yes, the restaurant went through some "obvious" growing pains and staff issues a few years back--but those days are now firmly behind them and only a foggy reflection in the rear view mirror.

The prices are reasonable for the quality of food and atmosphere. 

Happy Hour at the Bar offers some very great deals if your looking to save a few bucks.
