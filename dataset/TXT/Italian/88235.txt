I guess I'll start when you first walk in. It's EVERYTHING NY pride! LOVE IT!!!

Being from NJ and living there for 17 years, I miss the east coast authentic pizza as well as cheese steaks. I CRAVE good pizza and cheese steaks almost every week!

This is run by the original Rays Famous Pizza family.

I feel like I get every dollars worth of food here. Is GREAT!!!
