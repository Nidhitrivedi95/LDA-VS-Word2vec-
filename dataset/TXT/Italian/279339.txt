yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Battista's is great. Simply great. And there it is... simple.

It's often said of restaurants by restauranteurs is that simple is best, and we've found it here. And right in the middle of the strip no less! What a find!

Old Las Vegas adorns the walls, wine casks abound, a dark, busy and welcoming interior, matched by a staff that's used to managing and shepherding packed packed crowds day in and day out.

You can eat in the bar area, wait for a table with drinks, or stand around and read the short menu until your reservation comes around. Either way, there's lots to see and take in.

The menu is simple, and contains simple Italian food. And yes, everything comes with bread, wine, and soup or salad. What a treat!

For $30, Sarah and I stuffed ourselves by splitting the Lasagna, the salad, basket of bread, and three carafes of wine. Including tip! What a steal, as I said, in the middle of the strip! All the menu says is that there's a $10 minimum per person, so why not split all that yummy simple Italian food!

This was one of our favorite meals from our last trip. The energy, the location. It was a truly old school Vegas experience. Imagine what it was like when Battista's was just one of a few options along the strip of smaller hotel/gambling outlets.... oh yeah, it was just like this, busy, dark, and simple.
