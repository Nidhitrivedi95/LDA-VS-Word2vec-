Gino's Italian Deli is what's left of Gino's on State Street (which I'll chiefly remember as the place that ruined dinner with my parents when the owner or manager spent a full five minutes loudly cursing out the waitstaff in front of every customer in the dining room). 

Unfortunately, that bad-vibes tradition seems to have survived the move to this corrugated shack outpost, where grumpiness was on full display during two of my last three visits. 

As for the food, meh. There's little here that can't be found for less and at better freshness and quality levels at Metcalfe's, Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. Even Hy-Vee will get you 90% there at 70% of the cost. 

And they should probably keep the door to kitchen closed. It may be clean, but it doesn't look clean.
