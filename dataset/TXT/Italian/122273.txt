Sausage and peppers pie. Added pepperoni  and whole garlic. Seriously fresh and one of the best pizzas I have ever had! 

They close at midnight, so make sure you get in before it's too late!

If you sit in the restaurant you can people watch like crazy! The Gogo dancers were jamming and you can see everyone going in and out of the Sayers club. As I'm typing this, some group just let out the loudest longest cheer at a game table. Gotta love Vegas and the crazy variety you get in food, people, and entertainment!

Definitely worth a stop I and if you are in the mood for something sweet, try the pistachio gelato. Awesomeness!
