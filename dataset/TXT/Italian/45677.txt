We drove by and it was pretty full lot.    We were going to get it To Go and changed our minds.    It's best to enjoy the food straight from the oven.   Jennifer greeted us with a big smile and a warm welcome.    We ordered or drinks and looked over the menu.   I asked what is considered a "favorite" dish.    She suggested the meatball or chicken Parm sandwhich, then she suggested so many other items my head was spinning and I really like meatball sandwhiches.    We call them Grinders or a "grindah" in Rhode Island.

My boyfriend wanted to start with cheddar cheese fries ($4.45), he wanted to try theirs Gyro ($6.95) and I went with a meatball sandwhich with cheese ($8.45).    If you add fries it's $10.90.   After dinner was fantastic I really wanted to try their homemade Tiramisu ($4.95), the lady fingers (the cookie in the middle) was soaked in rum, it was to die for.   Even tried a tiny bite of the cheesecake here and it too was great.  Only wished it was a slightly thicker slice for $4.95.

This is a sports heaven on 10 different good sized TVs!      Definitely bring your group of friends to watch sports.      We will be back to give the pizza a second try.
