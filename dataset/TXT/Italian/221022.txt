SEH79jbg5Q8cCozCnhqMHA Was hoping to be blown away by homemade pasta but unfortunately we were not. IMO the gnocchi was good but the porcini infused pasta was very bland. Had to ask for and add salt, which should have been added during cooking process.

Maybe will be back but would have to be really craving italian food and if thats the case might try to look for another restaraunt.
