qKButPdfAkVWBMM9oPMU4w Great Pizza. Easily one of the best in Montreal. (Tried the cadanese)

Disgusting Pasta. It tasted cheap and the sauce tasted as if it was out of a can. 
(Tried the fetuccini with tomato sauce and Italian sausage)

I recommend avoiding the pasta and simply going for the pizza.
