SZ5KO1KNiwtrktKo5mpuLA This is the hidden germ of Vegas. I don't know why it has received 3 stars. I first experienced the food here a little more than a decade ago and it was amazing!

I came back recently and the high quality of food/service is unchanged.

Lettuce wraps and duck wraps/Peking duck is just great!

Warning: if u like a big ass food portion then u shouldn't come here. 
If you prefer delicacy over regularity, then this is the place for u.
