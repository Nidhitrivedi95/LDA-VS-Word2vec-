4gXdyihRiytmXEAfqLNMBw It's so great that more sit down restaurants are coming to Surprise. I was never a huge fan of Italian food when I was younger (unless you count pizza), but I'm so glad that's changed. Such a nice restaurant. Looks more high end and classy to me. I loved the light fixtures and different decor. When we went it was after lunch rush and was still very busy.  It was very loud in the bar area so we opted to sit in the back room near the fireplace which was perfect. I decided on the Buffalo Chicken with broccoli and it was amazing! A little spicy for me though and won't get again. My son had the biggest plate of spaghetti and meatballs. You should've seen his eyes light up as he ate it. For an appetizer we also ordered spicy rolls. They almost looked too good to eat...I said almost. They were gone in seconds lol
