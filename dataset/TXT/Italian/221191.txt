SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg Fabulous restaurant! Great view, service, and food. Honestly the best brunch I had in Vegas. I went in on a Easter Sunday so the menu was different than normal. It was a three course brunch: first course, second course, and last but not least unlimited dessert! I ordered the steak and egg and the steak was so juicy and tender. I would have liked to have my eggs cooked a bit more but it was good nevertheless. I was also pleasantly surprised at the variety of dessert and freshness of the fruits! 

I also got a seat right next to the window so the fountain view was amazing! The portions look small but when I got to the end of my meal I was sad I didn't have more room in my stomach for more dessert.
