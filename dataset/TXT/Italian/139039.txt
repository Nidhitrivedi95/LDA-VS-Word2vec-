jEqsHSLzQraqG1qaMNjsBA So we moved out of The Beach to Leslieville this past April, mainly because the food scene is non-existent, everything closes around 9pm and you have to deal with tourists and traffic during the warm months. 

Then this place opens up.  What a great little restaurant. The husband and wife team were like Italian friends who have you over for dinner and spoil you.

So party of four: we had 2 kale/fennel salads and 1 arugula/caprino salad.

Entrees: veal scaloppine, grilled calamari, shrimp, pappardelle bolognese.  
Dessert: 2 tiramisu w/4 spoons.
2bottles of Chianti & great company.

From start to finish, delicioso. I know that's not Italian, but hey, I'm from California.  

Now we have a reason to come back to this area.

BTW Toronto, your Italian food kicks butt!

Last thing, they close at 11pm. Say what?
