dj4UB_e5xYF3IMQucIIYsQ I had a great experience at this restaurant! I came in for an early dinner and was pleased with the attentiveness of the staff. The owner was delightful; she made me feel at home as I was dining alone. She was pleasant and helpful with my selections. I ordered the red sangria and decided on one of their pizzas. The pizza was truly delicious. I've had plenty of home-made meals in Italy and even in the Italian country side. I will say that the authentic pizza and the friendly service reminded me of the time I had spent in Italy. Thank you for a memorable experience!
