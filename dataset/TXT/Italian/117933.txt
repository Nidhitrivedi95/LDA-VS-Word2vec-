Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw My running club was here for the RNR marathon and we had our carb load dinner here. Everything was perfect from placing the reservation, to the amazing food and service. We ended up having a few more people join our large group and the restaurant was very accommodating. The restaurant was very crowded but our party of 29 was served quickly and without any problems. Everyone raved about their dish. Staff was wonderful including the manager. Highly recommend!
