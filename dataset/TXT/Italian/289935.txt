zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA Well.. Apparently this restaurant is not serving the authentic italian food.
The food was bit heavy and too much seasoned. Service was good though. On the weekend, there are too many people to get in there, so the tables were jammed.. it feels like I am having dinner with the people sit on the next table.
