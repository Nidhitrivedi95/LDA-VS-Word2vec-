fe8jmKzXtGvMVQDUvW0pGw Rossini's Italian Restaurant is not an Italian restaurant, it's a Greek restaurant! I should have walked out immediately when I noticed that greek salad was on the menu. Although they have pictures of NY in the restaurant, no one in the restaurant is even from NY. ??? I ordered the baked ziti and took one for the team in the rear end. It was soup pasta as I remember. Melted cheese [ not even close to being baked ] with pasta and a soup of sauce, if you even call it that. God awful. Never again.
