PebX-Sf_h4FJGgsRAA5Fng I'm not sure if these people that rated this place poorly were just having a bad day or what, but I had a hot chicken parmigiana ciabatta and it was amazing! Everything is homemade and their slogan is "Even the chef is imported". which is very clever! My water was refilled even if it didn't really need to be and I was able to meet the chef and his wife! I had a very pleasant time! 6 bucks for a homemade lunch? Yes, please!! I will definitely be back often!
