op0GPkK8YtpTQxSq80lEpw I went here with a group of three and our evening was plesant. 
The restaurant was not full but there was just enough tables filled to create a nice cozy environment. 

The ambiance of the overall restaurant was great and I really enjoyed their decor. 

Our waiter was wonderful. He was kind, funny and extremely helpful. I love when waiters are knowledgeable and offer recommendations and specials without YOU having to ask. 

I had the gnocchi special which was in a delicious cream sauce and topped with truffle. It was GREAT flavour wise but it's one of those dishes that once you are at the 10th bite, it just feels overwhelming since the flavours are so powerful and strong.

My friend had the calzone- the only downside was no sauce to dip it in but she said it was very delicious.

Our other friend had the caprese bianca pizza which was also delicious. You could taste the fresh ingredients and it was perfectly baked.

I would come here again as it's local to where we reside.
