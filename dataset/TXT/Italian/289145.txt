Zt4ljpwfmBufatNM1zPNcQ Take two nonmeat eaters. Then give one of them Celiac's and a dairy allergy. Now add a love for pizza. 

Picazzos meets our dietary needs in every way. Love them for this. However, even for someone who is used to eating out at organic restaurants, it is SUPER pricey. Over $30 before tip for one pizza? *sigh* If only my wallet loved it as much as my tummy.

Nevertheless, I will still return for those "treat yourself" days :)
