8dSIAoz_UphMGpZr_uMing I absolutely love this place and so happy it opened near my home. We come here to watch football games and eat AMAZING food at least once a week. It is so nice to enjoy it all in a totally smoke free place! The staff is awesome, attentive and remember their regulars. Definitely try the double dough pizza, which we now get every time. The Chicago deep dish is authentic and can feed an army! The subs are huge and good for two meals for me. Again, I love them and so happy to have them in the neighborhood :)
