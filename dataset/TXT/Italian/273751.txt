Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A So many bad reviews, I'm surprised! 

Came here around 8:15 with my parents as we just drove into Vegas shortly before that. We were feeling lazy to go look for something to eat, and decided to head downstairs to our hotel where we stumbled upon this buffet. I'll be honest, at first my expectations were pretty low. There are so many buffets in Vegas, and a lot of them are mediocre at best. And with the dinner price tag of $15, I was expecting your average-just-ok buffet. 

However, I was pleasantly surprised. Let me pre-face by saying that if you get the right things, this place is good! They're trying to do a global cuisine type of ordeal, so different sections have different foods from all over the world. There were your typical stations such as Italian, Mexican, Chinese, and American.

 I started with a salad and carved turkey. Normally, turkeys at places like this can be dry, but not this one! It was tender and moist. My dad got the carved beef and again, claimed that it was not only delicious, but also cooked well. Huge plus for the carving station! My mom then went to the Mongolian BBQ area where she had some had some fun with that. For dinner, they also have shrimp on top of your regular chicken, pork, and beef. A few short minutes later, and bam! Out came our piping hot BBQ. We didn't end up getting noodles, but still delicious. 

I can see a few of the things here being super meh such as the Mexican, soups, sushi, and some of the Chinese and Italian. I also noticed someone saying that there were no heating lamps for the food, but when we went there definitely were! All in all, for $15, this buffet is really worth the price if you play your cards right!
