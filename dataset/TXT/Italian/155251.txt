L1PsHcUvdiZvViwYjwGK-A I reviewed this place as a bakery.  We had eaten there several times and the hot table food was not bad.  Last night, however, we stopped there on the way to a movie and it was execrable.  Chicken parmesan tasted like it was cooked several days before and was like shoe leater.  Pasta was mushy and overcooked.  To top it off, the counter staff was brusque and rude.  OK to buy bread if in the area; no more for their food service!

Please note I am writing this after a catastrophic ice storm.  It is understandable that a place may have issue when the power just comes back.  But if food is in shortage, it is better to not serve anything than to serve stale leftovers, unless the customer is forewarned that the quality is not good.
