Tgc2dTcE1xOey2OUt_PvXA Service was horrible .. 
hostess told us it would be a 35 minute wait, no problem, the woman and I decided to grab a couple drinks at the bar and we ended up just ordering food. Waited 45 minutes till we both realized that people that sat down after us are getting there food.. mentioned to the server about our food and she went to go "check on it", she came out with our wings & pasta, darn thing was sitting on the line for at least over 15 minutes. Chicken was ridiculously cold and so was the pasta with dried chicken strips. Horrible service. I was actually surprised she even brought it out to us, knowing that It was cold and had been sitting on the line for awhile. To sum it up we didn't even eat the cold/dry food. Cashed out and left. Sad thing was the restaurant was not at it's full capacity and service was horrible. Save your time go different pizza bistro.
