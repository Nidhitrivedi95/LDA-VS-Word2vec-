-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw Brio Tuscan Grille is one of my favorite restaurants. So much so that I drive from Tucson to Scottsdale to go there. Their service is great, setting is fancy and food is perfect. They serve a loaf of bread and chips before the meal. I'm an east coaster who values good seafood and they have one of the best Shrimp & Lobster Fettuccine I've had in Arizona. Their Lobster Bisque is also a favorite. Paired with their new zesty Watermelon Margarita. For dessert I order the chocolate cake that has fudge in the middle.
