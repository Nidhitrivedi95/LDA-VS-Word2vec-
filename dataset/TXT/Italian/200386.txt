PUDtJu2bFTvIl1_WhyUIXQ food is 4 stars but service is a 1. Once I ordered take out and waited 45 minutes, only to call back to find out we were out of their delivery area. No apologies, nothing. Dining in, they often mess up my order. Also, soda is $2.75, which is pretty expensive I think. 

If you pick it up to go, the pizza is great!
