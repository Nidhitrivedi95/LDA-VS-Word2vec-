YSUcHqlKMPHHJ_cTrqtNrA I'm not a professional and is purely my opinion. Went here last night with a group of 10 to celebrate a birthday.

The service was excellent (5/5). We were greeted quickly at the front. The server was super patient and gave everyone enough time to go over the menu and decide on drinks/food. Some individual order appetizer while others did not, but timing of the mains was perfect (allowed people with appetizers enough time to get a head start and then brought mains for everyone at same time). Our server was present when food was brought out of the kitchen and ensure everyone got the correct order.  Service was timely but at good pace (didn't feel rushed).

Food was good (4/5). At the table, consensus was that pastas and pizzas were good. Pasta was perfectly al dente (not undercooked but had a bite). Complain about the calamari appetizer was that it was a tad bit greasy and bland. One individual order entree dish and really enjoyed.

Restaurant decor and layout (3/5). Very typical decor for a Italian restaurant and nothing really worth remembering. There were couple of visible improvements that could be made. Mainly, the restaurant menus had scuffs and looked like they were starting to fall apart. Overall, the decor didn't seem to match logo, branding and feel of the restaurant entrance way which is very modern and hip. Maybe in the long run it is something that could be considered, but this is a personal. 

Overall 4/5.
