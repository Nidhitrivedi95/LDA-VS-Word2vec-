r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog Today we made the mistake of taking our business to this restaurant. We had this great idea to attempt to try a authentic Italian Restaurant. Today was one of the worse ideas we had. The lettuce leafs from our salad were wilted. After requesting a new salad they still brought another plate with wilted lettuce. " Come on people you don't serve bad lettuce to customers!! " We finally received our food after 30min then to have burnt noodles. Finally to come to receive our check to have a bill of $69.00 to get charged $690.00. I understand human error but to understand bank credit don't come in immediately. Quickly to call the bank to find our 3 to 5 business days to receive credit. Assuming they would just give us a discount from our bill of $69.00 for this large error they proceeded to charge me the full amount rather than crediting me the difference. So now I have a charge of $69 + $690. Making our bill close to $800.00 Wow!! Just ridiculous. Besides the cook yelling at my wife that we don't deserve at discount because they worked hard on cooking there meal, it's obvious there error are supposed to be tolerated yet my unsatisfied experience is still to be charged. Wow!! Lost my recommendation.
