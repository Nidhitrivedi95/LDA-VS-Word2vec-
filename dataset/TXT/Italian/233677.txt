tovUJgSCxi2JfUtP9eNQcA I just spent almost twenty bucks on a pizza and fountain drink, and after sitting down, realized I wanted a small cup of pizza sauce to dip my crust in. I asked a waitress for a cup, and was informed it would be .55 for basically a spoonful of the sauce. After letting her know I didn't have cash and didn't really want to put .55 on my debit card, I figured she would be kind and get me some just to be nice... Nope. After asking for a manager, I informed him that I eat there regularly, and was kinda put out that they couldn't get me a little bit of pizza sauce to enjoy my pizza without charging me. Assumed at this point that Shawn could override the "dip policy", and again I was let down that he wouldn't help me out with a little dip. So here's how it goes... Barros cares more about a .55 cup of dip, than keeping a customer happy, or receiving a poor review. Well, they got to keep their dip, but have lost me as a customer, and have gotten a poor review... Hope it was worth the 55 cents!
