Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA Came here with some colleagues while at a conference and after failing to get in to a bunch of other restaurants. Pizza was great, Thin, bendy just how I like it. Good beer and nice atmosphere. I was annoyed by the calamari. The plate was filled with loads of lettuce and battered vegetables. We really had a to fish around for the actual Calamari and felt a little cheated.
