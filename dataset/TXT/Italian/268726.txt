xiNBWLfditvEZ_GAbGUbCw This is a nice neighborhood place to eat.  My first time here and the decor nicer than I was expecting. We ordered the fried ravioli, which was very good.  The pizza was awesome, not quite NY Style, but thin and tasty, I wish you were able to get a pie bigger than 9".  I had a chicken park sandwich...I expected a chicken breast, but it turned out to be a large chicken tender on a glorified hotdog bun...it was small and underwhelming at $8.00, but very good taste. All in all the prices are cheap, but expensive for the quantity.  Friendly service, and will return, but just not while I am really hungry.
