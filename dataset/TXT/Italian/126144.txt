hSBf_UpaesTHenfCy2YO9A This review I started yesterday.  Before I hammered them down, I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt, by trying them once more.

From my past experiences here, none of them have ever been good.  It's a sad joke for an Italian franchise, wait, this is an Italian franchise right?  Because nothing here tastes Italian.

How do you go wrong with Salad? Seriously?  Mine came out like mush.  I ordered a chicken tettrazini, and I couldn't even swallow it, that's how dry it was.

After all was said and done, my friends and myself have agreed the best course of the meal was the candy at the end.  I just wish they would've given 2 per person, that way I wouldn't have felt like I wasted my time.

I went with a group of 4, and all 4 people ate a quarter or less of their meal.  That alone speaks volume.  Thank goodness for A&W across the street.  Chubby Chicken anyone?  Kinda fattening, but w/e!

Anyway, If I could give them 0 stars I would, however, it is defaulted to 1 star, and this 1 star I give to the very cute girl who served me.  This was the only positive thing about East Side Marios.  She was deserving of the tip, the place? not so much.

I have now permanently banned this restaurant.
