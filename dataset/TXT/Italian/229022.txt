sZMliOne4mADZ2-CqeanZg Yummy brunch, with a surprisingly short wait on a Sunday morning.  There are a lot of interesting items on the menu--I had the Ovo Buco (an "egg in the hole" sandwich served with spinach, brie, hollandaise and roasted tomato).  It was delicious!  But I could probably have eaten two of them to fill me up.  The place isn't cheap, but the food is good and the service is fast.
