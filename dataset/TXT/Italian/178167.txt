nOkSC1GtMUJ_I70sb0SaeQ Good little pizza joint!  

We ordered two "combo" meals of a drink, side salad and mini-pizza (I think the price was $8.99 each).

The owners are very nice - the "side salad" we had with our lunch was HUGE - bigger than most restaurants main course salads.  

There's a great coupon on restaurant.com where you can get 1/2 off your meal.
