OJ6zfenoK-eBNI7vvNrOsg Can only agree with many of the other reviews - the food is great and the service is excellent! They are professional and friendly - it's amazing. We had starters, mains and dessert and were rolling out of there because we were so full ;-) The owners girlfriend even brought us a dessert on the house - just because she wanted us to try it! The Limincello to finish of the evening was the perfect little treat in the end!
