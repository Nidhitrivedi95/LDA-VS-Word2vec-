bUnm0-YK5HicLzkvMWwqjQ I've never had better gelato or sorbet!  The price might be higher than some people want to pay, but you get what you pay for...and this is high quality, gourmet stuff imported from France that you can't get anywhere else in Vegas.  The yogurt tastes like cheesecake or cream cheese frosting.  The mango is like eating a frozen mango.  It's crazy good.  Everywhere else is a downgrade.  Looking forward to the grand opening of their second location at the outlet mall!
