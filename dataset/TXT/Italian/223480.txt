SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw This place was AMAZING. We tried the poutine gravy fries, meatball garlic knot sliders, and the chicken wings. Service was EXCEPTIONAL, and while waiting for your food you can look at all the cute drawings on the wall, which are saved from the paper table coverings that customers can draw on with crayons. The food was brought to our table quickly, hot, fresh, and delish. I will definitely be back here to try the pizza next time.
