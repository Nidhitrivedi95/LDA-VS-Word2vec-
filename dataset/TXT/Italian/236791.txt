txAKid34IUd9spo6MLF_Sw We came here for dinner last night and we had a very enjoyable evening.  Although the decor was dated, the service was excellent.   We used the entertainment book electronic coupon which looked like the code would expire before we paid our bill but the server told us not to worry about it and without any reminder, he reduced the bill.  That is real good service!  I had the Prix Fixe $29.95 menu choosing the veal pizzaiola as the main and it was delicious but the portion was a bit small.  My husband and daughter ordered the veal parmigiana and seafood pasta and they really enjoyed it.  Overall we had a great time and will definitely be back.
