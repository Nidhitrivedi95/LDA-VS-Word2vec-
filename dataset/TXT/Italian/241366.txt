UHPjDgiEHnTe7-MP-b2kyQ The atmosphere had a certain aire of the 1970s to it.  It was so dark in there everyone from age 22 to 83 had to read the menu by cellphone light.  This was ridiculous.  The waitress was rather abrupt.  Our salads were salty very nearly to the point of being inedible.  The entrees were uninspiring, neither bold nor subtle, just bland, and in the case of the cabbage, once again very salty.  Really, just go to the Olive Garden.
