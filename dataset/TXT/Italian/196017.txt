pM4mWLjeaZJlcdUxut2lMg Desperately racking my mind for somewhere to go on Saturday night for dinner with a group of friends, I settled on choosing an old favourite - Vittoria's. Having been out of the Edinburgh circuit for a few months now, I'm already seeing new places popping up that I don't recognise, which look exciting - but sometimes you just need to go somewhere you know you'll get a good meal. And this is one of those places.

The menu is extensive and will cater for all tastes - I'm pretty sure most of their pizzas and pastas are available GF too. My favourite bit about this place though is that they offer a half-pizza, half-pasta dish for when you just can't make that decision. On Saturday I had a half-Hawaiian and half-carbonara which was delicious. 

The desserts list is equally impressive, with a wide selection of ice creams and sundaes. 

It's normally busy here (a good sign!) so I'd advise anyone going to book in advance. Lovely atmosphere too, and the staff are always very efficient and attentive. 

Up there with my favourite Italians in Edinburgh.
