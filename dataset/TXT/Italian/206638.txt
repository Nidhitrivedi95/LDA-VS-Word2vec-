All kinds of super enhanced flavors, you just want to try them all and never stop eating.  The staff seems to get off on being super excited and friendly which is a fun enhancement.  The only disappointment was when I got to the cashier and they waited about 2 minutes fiddling about and cleaning things before they realized I was ready to purchase, even though I sat right in front of them staring in their eyes and waiting patiently.  They didn't apologize.
