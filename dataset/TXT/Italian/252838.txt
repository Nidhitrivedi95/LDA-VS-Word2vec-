In March 2013, I traveled to Vegas with my sister and one of her friends for a girls weekend in Vegas. They had never done table service at a nightclub before, so I decided to be generous and spring for a table on the Saturday night we would be there. I decided on LAVO because the host, Matthew Goodman, was incredibly responsive. Literally within 10 minutes of sending my inquiry email, I had texts from Matt to help set up my reservation (this was opposed to some other clubs that either never responded or took days to respond). He also offered to get us into the brunch, but we decided against it as we wanted to do other things during the day. 

The entrance to the nightclub is on the side and not a far walk from the door that the taxis drop you off at. There was no wait to check in (we arrived around 11 pm) and Matt walked us to our table. Throughout the night he checked on us a few times which I thought was great customer service. Our cocktail server at the table was totally on point, and we were never without drinks. I managed to get us a free bottle of champagne which we had first before moving on to the Ketel One vodka bottle I bought.

The negative about table service at LAVO is that while we had a table right off the dance floor (I cannot complain about the location) is that we were squished in between two other tables with groups. When you get a table, you are expecting to get space to spread out and relax. We were kind of on top of each other which is the reason I give the nightclub 4 stars. But if you want a table, I highly recommend getting ahold of Matt. He is the best host I have worked with in Vegas.
