dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw Went here for a gf's bachelorette. Great Italian food!

Since we were such a big group, they had us order from a set menu and we shared appetizers and dessert. The portions are huge so make sure you don't order too much if you plan to go clubbing later.

We had so much food that I don't remember all of them, but the dishes I love were the scallop and prawn risotto and the apple turnover/tart for dessert. 

I remember the raviolini having a strange after taste, but it was cooked well. 

Great service! They gave all of us a free round a champagne to toast the bride! 

I'm coming back. Again, great Italian food!
