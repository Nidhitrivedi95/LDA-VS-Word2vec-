HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q Wide variety, I had no idea where to begin. I wanted to sample almost every one of them and not get something that was of traditional flavors. They have so many flavors, with names that I have already forgotten. I sampled one and because I wanted to get out of there, I just got it. It reminded me a lot like cookies n cream. 

I know I love gelato but I guess at 7 bucks for single scoop, I'm just not that down with it. I like the wafer they top it off with, though. 

Honestly, I most likely will not waste my money here. There are other great places to get your gelato fix, ones that are topped on delish warm crepes for just a couple dollars more.
