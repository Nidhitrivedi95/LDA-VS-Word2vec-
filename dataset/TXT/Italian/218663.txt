s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q This is actually a difficult review for me. 

Food/Drink - excellent. I had chicken parm, my friend had some ravioli. We both loved our food. We also had a dessert cocktail (can't think of the name now), but it was some sort of Italian espresso... and it was fantastic. Prices for everything were very reasonable. 

Service - also, excellent. Very attentive, friendly, and not overbearing at all. 

Atmosphere - here is where I have issues. Tropicana recently underwent a MASSIVE remodel - soup to nuts. And they really couldn't have picked a more inappropriate area for this restaurant. It's a floor above, and a 150 yard walk from the casino, in an area that feels very much like a mall food court. The space itself is small. Very low ceilings, and feels more like an Italian cafe. If this restaurant was anywhere else in the nation, it would be great; however, it didn't feel like Vegas. 

If you're looking for a no frills, quiet atmosphere, this would be great, but for me, I was a bit let down.
