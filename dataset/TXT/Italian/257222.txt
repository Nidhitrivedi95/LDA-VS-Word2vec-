But I enjoyed this enough that I will definitely come back for them! (I was brought here without any prior knowledge in my defense). Goodfellas is a good Italian option in Streetsville. 

I was brought here by my lovely partner and we decided to sit outside on the patio. The atmosphere was extremely pleasant. We went with their arugula salad, a calamari appetizer, and one amatriciana pasta. 

The food was excellent but the prices were definitely on the high side, and the portion sizes could reflect that. But I can't deny that things were superb here. The calamari was extremely tender and the breading was crisp yet light. It was on the salty side for me but I understand it's supposed to be like that. I didn't expect salad with the calamari so that was a pleasant surprise, but it seemed like that came at the expense of the calamari. The amatriciana pasta was great. Everything worked so well. The bucatini pasta was perfectly al-dente, the sauce was excellent, I loved the spice level of this dish, and I could taste some smokiness from the pork.

After reading many reviews about terrible service (we didn't get that here) so I was fairly surprised actually. Our waiter, Eric, was attentive and friendly. The appetizers came out quickly and there were no problems whatsoever. 

All in all, we had an extremely pleasant dinner here and would definitely recommend them as an Italian option in Mississauga! Now let's get their pizzas.
