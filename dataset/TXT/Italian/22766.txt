3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg I live near this restaurant and have eaten here at least once a week since it's opened. It's that good. 

Best steaks in the area. 

The cocktails are expensive, but the bartenders aren't cheap. The drinks are as good as the food.

Sides are exquisite, as well, including their signature potatoes. 

Best dessert in Scottsdale? A TIE. And both are at Dominick's; the beignet tree and the butter cake. Both to die for and guaranteed to add ten pounds to you.
