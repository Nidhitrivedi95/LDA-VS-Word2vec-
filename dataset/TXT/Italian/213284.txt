r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA I really wanted to love this place because it is so close to me..but no such luck.  I ordered the Beef Cheese Steak, and when it arrived it looked so good but my first bite revealed an overly cheesy and flavorless chopped meat.  Granted, I did not get the peppers and onions but I expected the meat to be able to hold it's own..I was wrong.  Too bad, the search continues.
