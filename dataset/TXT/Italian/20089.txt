3-6biVwm7VwPZ-k67jml-Q I just had lunch there the other day with my family. I ordered the eggplant parm. It seems more like stewed eggplant. It's not fried. It's in pieces. Mostly the skin of the eggplant is on the sandwich. There's hardly any sauce on the sandwich & it only has a small amount of mozzarella. It comes out warm not hot. The only good part of this sandwich is the bread.

One girl that we interacted with was very rude also. She seemed to be very friendly with the people she knew & not nice to others. I will not eat here again.
