xoisXoqK68W2euSKbj5ybw Got a large pepperoni & extra cheese pie, the crust was good toward the outside but way too thin toward the middle.  The sauce is too watery and water logs the crust because its too thin.   All the toppings and sauce slid to the middle of the pie during the ride home in the car and was a soupy mess at home.  This is definitely fork pizza.  Also the sauce needs more tomato paste and salt.   The employees were friendly, that was a plus!
