Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag Arrived at around 4:00 pm, which was quite early for dinner. Requested to sit at the window seats but was refused because they were all reserved(they were almost all empty until we left). Ordered a median rare steak, but it was served very rare. Fortunately the waiter was nice to bring it back to recook. The sauce on the steak tasted too sour, personally I didn't like it.
