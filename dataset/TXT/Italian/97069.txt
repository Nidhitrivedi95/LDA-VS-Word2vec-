esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA If you have an oyster craving, this place is not even worth the time. You'd be better off going somewhere else. The dozen oysters of blue point oysters were extremely huge and tasted wholesale.

Oysters = bottom of the barrel, bad shucking.
Pico de gallo = tomatoes were not fresh.
Asian oyster shooter = tastes funky.

On top of that, the service was horrible! I can see that there was only 1 server working the whole area. The forgotten waters and messed up orders can be forgiven, but an overcharged card can't, especially if the mistake was known.

The split check, half card, half cash, was mishandled. The server, Moon, charged the entire bill on the card and kept all the cash as tip. This wasn't noticed at the time because he reprinted the slip as a different amount that actually showed up on the credit statement. This problem still needs to be fixed!
