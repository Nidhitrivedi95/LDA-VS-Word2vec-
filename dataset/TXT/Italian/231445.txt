Tgc2dTcE1xOey2OUt_PvXA Had a good experience when my wife and I sat at the bar. Great pizza and wings. 

However, we tried to go recently with a larger group (8 people) and it was 1.25 hr wait. At 5pm on a Wednesday... Riiiiight.  

I tried to call ahead and they don't accept call aheads. They apparently only have 1 table capable of seating larger parties. Kinda missed the mark on that one Oreganos. Brand spankin new building and all. 

So we went across the street to Native NewYorker and got seated immediately.
