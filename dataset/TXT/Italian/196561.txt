pOEL97ld-FJMKO8Ki8JmYg I've been here several times and like other reviews, this place isn't anything special but can be hit or miss. 

Tonight particularly, we had a rather large group of 13 people and made reservations a week in advance. They refused to seat us until at least 8 people from our party had arrived.  Later when we had 7 people, they changed it to needing at least 10 people. WTH! It was weird because they had our table set up already the whole time, but made half our party wait outside standing for no apparent reason, including the birthday girl herself!  Boo.

Eventually when we sat down, our waiter was extremely friendly, personable, and attentive. Thank God something was going right.

Started off with cocktails. The Winter Sangria was delicious with a hint of cinnamon and apple slices. Yum. 

Food wise, ate the Shrimp and Crab Cake entree as an appetizer (it's too small to be a real entrée size). That was delicious, although I didn't care for the slaw under it. 

My main meal was the Seared Scallops on a bed of salad, chickpeas, etc. The scallops were okay, but I disliked the salad - it was really random and haphazard and bitter at times. It took away from the scallop, which was what I really wanted.

The reason why I'm writing this review though (after having dined here several times), is because I just found out not too long ago that both my friend and myself (who had the seared scallop entree) felt sick in our stomaches after when we got home.  Not cool. I don't know how anyone else in the party felt (probably okay), but just had to mention that.  The scallop didn't taste funny or anything, so it could've been the salad if it wasn't cleaned properly. Boo.
