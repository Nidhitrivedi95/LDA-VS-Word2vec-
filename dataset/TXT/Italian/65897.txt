bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw Visiting Charlotte for the weekend and participated in the Tour de Food event which featured this restaurant. The restaurant was clean, quaint with nice ambience. The food was excellent. They featured the Calamari and Margarita pizza. If you're in the mood for good Italian cuisine, this place is definitely worth a visit.
