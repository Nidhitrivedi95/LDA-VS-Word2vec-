U3O8l_wmzdeckbhHpuRWCg I'd like to start by saying that I normally love love garden, until today.

My girlfriend and I sat down and it wasn't for another 8 or so minutes that our waitress came up to us. She doesn't introduce herself and mumbled hi, we both give her our drink orders and as I was about to say we wanted bread sticks she just walked away. When she came back and we asked to order and she sighed and rudely said what can I get? She also missed the side that came with my meal. Our food finally came out, cold, and starting to change colors on top from sitting so long. Both of us could barely eat more than three bites and didn't finish. We told the waitress and she showed no concern but instead only said, I'll get a manager. Needless to say the manager did comp my girlfriends meal, but the service from her and the food were horrendous...their service was so bad that I HAD to create a yelp account, that says something..
