CZY3743GpOOhdDJu6UmPBA Went there for a late night supper. The crispy pig head is definitely a must-try and their deserts are super on point.
Food is for tiny mouth people haha - they serve quite small portions. It's good to have a few people go together and try out different dishes
Given 4/5 it's because... great atmosphere for a bar, low light settings and servers are pretty nice but the food are just passable.
