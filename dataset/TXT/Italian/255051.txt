VxgjMl8tQrT4idJW_z8daA Went here for a wine tasting / dinner pairing.  The wine and food were OK, but the service was pretty bad. They crammed the wine tasting / dinner pairing participants in a row of tables so close together the servers couldn't get to you. Heaven forbid you lift your arm to eat, you'd being giving the person next to you an elbow to the ribs. Seriously, shoulder to shoulder. Food and wine were what I expected. Not great, but not bad. Would have given more stars if they had thought the seating through.
