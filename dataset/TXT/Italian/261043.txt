WPV0ucYjnb2HOrNxSopv6A Having lived in NYC for 6 years, I am skeptical of any place claiming to have a "NY Pizza". I don't normally write scathing reviews, and I'll keep this short. The bartender was rude and dismissive, the bourbon was overpriced, the pizza tasted o.k., but made me sick the next day.
