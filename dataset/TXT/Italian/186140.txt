OOXUDZVOREgjwrLiwr3Spg This seemed like a really cool place in Uptown. I've walked past it many times.

Overall, the experience for our date night was mediocre. While the food was decent, the cocktails were weak despite their appearance of being craft cocktails.

Additionally, the service was slow and very disorganized. At one point in our meal, another server who was not our own asked, "What drink did you order?" I told her. She responded by saying, "That doesn't look like any of our normal drinks and doesn't look like what you ordered." She did not offer a replacement.

I imagine it's a great place for bowling with friends but it's not a great dining experience. I won't return.
