H3cMcV9KK3g2pi68lDNsng what a great spot!  we had such a nice time here.  the food was excellent and we had spectacular service.  our server went out of his way to prepare me iced coffee with simple syrup.  very nice.  my dish, our server's recommendation, was an egg bake - potatos and cheese and eggs and a cream sauce.  it was absolutely delicious.  

the actual restaurant design is very cool as well.  lots of love and attention went into the decor and it shows.

would like to come back here for dinner sometime!
