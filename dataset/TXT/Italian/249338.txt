viji5rHhNlsy9w-JmUhyaw My hubby took me to Olive Garden for a nice dinner so that I did not have to cook. We decided to try the current two for $25 promotion since the options sounded great.

We each ordered the spicy shrimp vesuvio as our main course which was jam packed with flavor. The shrimp in this pasta dish was very generous as well which was a nice treat. Our meal also included unlimited bread sticks and choice of soup or salad.

Also included is your choice of a shared appetizer or dessert so we opted for a slice of triple chocolate mouse cake which was super moist!

My hubby had peach iced tea which was super tasty and refreshing, I opted for plain iced tea.

This meal was great and a lot of goodness for $25!

Our meal was generous and good and I also like the sample of wine they offer when seated.

This is decent and tasty "Americanized" Italian food so this review will only warrant a 3 star rating. I am a huge fan of authentic traditional cuisine and am aware that Olive Garden is a commercial concept lacking that flare.

I must mention that our server Maria was simply Amazing. The service she provided during our meal was out of this world!
