iLLzOJLU4tPAN9UUHlyZiQ Really rough experience indicative of a brand new restaurant: We had a 6:30 reservation and were not seated until 7.  Food took 1 hour to arrive and one of the meals was not what was ordered. We were offered a free dessert (big whoop) and then the server just brought one without us picking it.  Under-cooked pasta was the nail in the coffin. Don't think we will be returning.
