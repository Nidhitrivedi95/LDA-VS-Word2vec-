6We2O5X62J_gduXU7jvf8w Our first visit but not our last.....four of us ordered six items and they were all delicious.  Seth took care of us very well as my husband tends to be very picky and selective, he was very cool and helped us pick out our selections and they were all spot on... my husband loved his bolognese sauce over penne.
Thanks Seth for a perfect fun dinner with friends!!!
