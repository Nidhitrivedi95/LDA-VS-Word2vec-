4EfiNcKSsafogIhAjwv0gg I have been here 4 times now. I enjoy this pizza more than any other in Las Vegas right now!  They have awesome chicken wings also.   I really enjoy the crust, so nice and crisp deliciousness.  My favorite pizza is the white pizza with feta :-) 

The place is nice with the kitchen up where you can see it. Owners are always friendly and there! They make sure your taken care of right. The personal touch is always nice! 

Nicely clean restaurant with a few TVs make this pizzeria a good place to go catch a football game here soon! 

They offer delivery too but I enjoy dinning in. I highly suggest getting a bit to eat here. They have everything a pizzeria should; pasta, salad, cannoli, gelato, pizza, a full menu.  I have been enjoying the pizza so much I haven't tried a pasta dish yet but I will next time and come back and let you know what I think but I have seen some others had and oh boy they look NICE.
