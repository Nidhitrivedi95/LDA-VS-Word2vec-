o86OGfW63bVqWkIrvxcEQQ Postino's is what dreams are made of. I have only lived in Scottsdale for one month and am already turning into Bruschetta. Monday and Tuesday nights they have a special for a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine for $20. The staff there is always lovely. I will continue to visit this place on a weekly basis.
