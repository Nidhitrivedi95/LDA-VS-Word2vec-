OIdOJaNS8M624F58XGV3PQ Never been disappointed! Was very happy to see them open a second location as the Ossington spot would get so rammed. Lots of space and they take reservations, pretty much eliminating most of the annoyances of the old spot. Prefer it to the financial district location to be honest. Pizza is great, often with very creative specials, prices are right and the ambiance is nice and vibrant.
