The ambiance was old and boring. Our server was mostly attentive throughout the meal. I mentioned to her that the wine she suggested was not to my liking but shrugged her shoulders and walked away. 
The final bill, $193+tip, was a shock although it should not have been. We know what we were ordering but didn't pay close enough attention to the the cost. 
I have no desire to eat at this restaurant again, it's average in many ways.
