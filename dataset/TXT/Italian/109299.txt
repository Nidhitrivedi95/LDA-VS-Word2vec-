G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I was so excited for this night. I had heard amazing things about this place and then some not so amazing things. I went in stoked. 

Like others we made a reservation for two and were kept waiting about 10 minutes. The ambience is incredible. Seriously so pretty and so well thought out. 

However, I really thought the food would be incredible as well. We started with an anti-pasta meat and cheese platter. The mustard on there was delicious. The signature cocktails were full of layers. Awesome. 

Then the charred octopus came out. No sauce just a small potato pasta. Thank god for the little potatoes. We didn't even finish the octopus it was so blah. 

Lobster ravioli. Possibly undercooked. Or maybe the recipe calls for tougher ravioli. It could be something I wasn't used to. The sauce was not my favorite I felt as though it were missing something and just tasted a lot like butter. 

28oz steak and the surf and turf next. His steak? Charred beyond edible. I tried it. I finally just forced him to say something, it's an 80 dollar steak you should like it. The waiter (David, phenomenal by the way) apologized and removed it while buying my date a drink. Impeccable staff. Still had anxiety doing it and felt horrible afterwards. Still he seemed understanding. My dish was cooked perfectly if you like sweeter sauce go for the surf and turf. 

Greatest part? The chocolate tart. Get it. Worth it. 

If it were not for David we would probably have left really disappointed. Hats off sir! Also our busboy was hilarious. If you're looking for five star go to Scarpetta at the Wynn.
