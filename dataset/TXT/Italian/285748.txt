zFnPRtP7LGvr3sfxvy_dfg I've been here twice: first time for a snack and the second time for pizza.  Both times were really good. One of the best things about this place is their gelato bar, which Mike particularly likes, but I do too since they have a bunch of different options.

The pizza was a bit soggy in the center, so it's tricky to just pick up and eat.  They have a lot of interesting toppings that you can select from -- I tried banana peppers on my pizza for the first time.  It was good!  Their Italian sausage wasn't my favorite -- I was expecting bigger, juicier pieces of sausage, and it was a bit more like ground beef. 

The antipasta, or "antipizza" as they call it, was really tasty!  I thought it would be better if there were a bit more on it, but for a snack, it worked. 

Finally, they have a decent beer selection -- they do pitchers or pints and you select from three price points: for pints, they're $2, 4, and 6.  Only PBR makes the $2 list...shocker.
