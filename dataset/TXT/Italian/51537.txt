9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg Metro pizza is a Las Vegas locals pizza place. It's NOT cheap but they are pretty consistent.

Most recently we had a lunch caterered in at work and everything was quite good.

The delivery & setup man was fantastic he made sure we had everything and extra.

We ordered the salad, garlic knots, baked ziti and chicken parmesan. The food was hot,cheesy and the chicken had crunch. 

I couldn't find myself shelling out $40 for pizza & breadsticks but it was a nice treat.
