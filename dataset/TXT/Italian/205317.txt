QEqMHowTTj5GKvpiKheGlQ I ordered the chicken tikka masala. The gravy(sauce) was good, but not spicy enough. The chicken itself in the sauce was horrible. It was seasoned ok but the texture was like no other chicken i ever had(in a bad way) Some pieces tasted and fealt fine but some pieces were horrible. i have had better chicken from here before but today i was dissapointed, Hopefully the Chicken Tikka Masala which is my favorite item has better tasting chicken. I love the sauce
