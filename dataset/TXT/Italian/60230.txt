aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA Is everybody crazy?? This may be some of the worst pizza I've ever had. I've seriously had frozen pizza that was better than this. I'm only giving it two stars because a nice guy made us a pretty good salad, but, seriously, the crust was burned, the sauce was flavorless, and the pizza wasn't hot. We tried four different kinds and they were all awful.
