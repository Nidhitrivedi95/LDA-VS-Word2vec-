G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q BEST meal of my life. Server explained small portions so order a little of everything and share. We were not disappointed with portions because it was explained to us up front and it gave us room to explore the varied options. Great service. Delicious food.  Yes the little butter and pesto dishes were chipped so that was a little odd but not a big deal. Can't wait to return!
