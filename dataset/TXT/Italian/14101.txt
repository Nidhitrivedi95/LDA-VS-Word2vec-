A perfect representation of the creativity from the hard working blue collar east coasters. 

If you've never eaten at Shelly pie or Vincent's, you're doing yourself a great injustice by going else where in my humble opinion of both establishments.

Now with that being said, you will find the odd yinzer, who will tell you to avoid this pizza . . . I got into that argument at a cousins house just a few weekends ago. He said it was too greasy and "soupy" hard to eat Etc Etc...  

And my response was simple. If you can have enough self control to let the pizza cool down for about 5 min or so, it gets much easier to dish out and cut.. I know that is an incredibly hard thing to do, because the sight of one in front of you is just too exciting, and you wanna dive right in.
But just like with any good pizza, you will most likely end up with a little grease or cheese drippings on you , so maybe wear an old T-shirt or something, no one cares its very casual and laid back 

I love Shelly pie. I live over an hour away, but will make the trek into turtle creek again in the very near future for my Pittsburgh classic . Gotta wash it  "Dahn" with some turners iced tea too! Perfect!!!
