Lazio is hands down the best bakery in Sauga for the freshest, softest buns AND cannoli's! Like WOW! Those were my exact words after ordering buns from them for Christmas and Easter. Their cannoli's are heavenly. Always fresh and have the crunch* on the shell. Aside from the bread area they also have a good hot table and deli section. Their coffee is also great! 
Their hot table and pizza are good, not the best but not bad. Molisana bakery has a way better hot table and the best pizza for sure! But I eat it still when I'm hungry and in the area. So bottom line if you need buns and cannoli's COME HERE! You won't regret it.
