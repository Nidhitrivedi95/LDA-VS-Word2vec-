9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw I know Cibo doesn't need another 5 star review but they've been a favorite for years now and I wanted to share the love!

We've been with big groups, for date nights and everything in between and have always had a wonderful experience.  There is the occasional uber hipster server that feels the need to correct your pronunciation of "bruschetta" but the food always outshines those minor annoyances.

If you haven't been to Cibo, it's a must visit!
