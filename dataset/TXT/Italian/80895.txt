dCgWmN4DuGBSDG4liWH3OQ Had a delicious lunch on the lovely patio at the Vintage House. The turkey croissant sandwich with cranberries was amazing - and the fruit plate that came with it was outstanding!  Add a couple glasses as white wine and it was a perfect lunch!  Oh ya - add the fries that accompanied my husbands also excellent sandwich and you have a real winner!! Will be back whenever I'm the Avon area.
