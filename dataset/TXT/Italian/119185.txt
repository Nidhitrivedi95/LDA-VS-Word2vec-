h-bBnFFTZ2cNiuBMFu2UaQ Been driving past for a few weeks now and finally stopped for dinner.  Incredible food, great service and wonderful people. Anthony was great behind the bar, Tommy & the rest of the staff are very attentive and friendly. Outstanding Bruschetta appetizer and one of the best Chicken Piccata I've ever had. Spaghetti and meatballs was fabulous as well. We can't wait to return and try everything else on the menu. 
Check it out, your only regret will be you didn't come here sooner.
