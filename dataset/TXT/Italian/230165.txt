Tc511yME8axDPq2J6woxkg One of the best meals I have ever had in the metro Cleveland area.  We hadn't been here in years.  I looked at the menu online and the new Fall menu was so interesting we decided to go.  I had the Beef Carpaccio and believe me this is the best I have ever had in NEO.  It was generous and fresh and since I don't care for truffle oil, they were happy to substitute olive oil.  I ordered the pumpkin ravioli from the Fall menu and it was perfect.  My husband had a Frank's salad and the winner of the night the bone in pork osso bucco.  The meat was honestly like butter.  So perfectly cooked.  Our server Jen was top rate!  I have a garlic allergy and she was very accommodating and willing to as the kitchen questions.  This is one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in NEO n the past seven years and that includes all the CLE hotspots!  Do yourself a favor...GO!!!!
