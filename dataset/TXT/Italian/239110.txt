u4x6Oc5pq6VW2NGYz9ZeCg We stopped here for a date night by accident - my husband wanted to go to a sports bar, I wanted to go to a restaurant where he wouldn't be staring at a game. This was the perfect combo! We were literally walking by to go to another restaurant and the vibe through the windows drew us in.

The ambiance was great for a date night, they did have a bar and tv's, but we grabbed some drinks and apps for happy hour and were able to have a conversation without having to shout over the noisy background. The server was friendly without being intrusive (he knew when to chat and when to go away so we could spend time with each other) - the owner even stopped by and got to know us a little before we left. 

Everyone was very friendly, the fish tacos were super fresh and tasty, we had a very nice time and will definitely be back. Especially for their great happy hour!
