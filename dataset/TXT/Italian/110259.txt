G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Let me start by saying I had really HIGH hopes for Giada's restaurant & although it wasn't terrible, it definitely didn't meet my expectations. 

We arrived on time for our reservation & were asked to wait at the bar, which is fine, but on a Monday night when they weren't packed? Yeah. I don't know. 
The bartender was okay, but rushed & short. I ordered the Giada cocktail ($15) which was good but a little sweet. My husband ordered a whiskey they were out of so he had to substitute. 

We were finally seated about 15-20 minutes after our reservation time. It took a good 5 minutes before the waiter arrived at our table, another 3-4 minutes for water & then who knows how long it took for him to take our order.

We were given complimentary bread & accompaniments - which in my opinion was the best part of the meal. 

Here's the low down:

Bacon wrapped dates - they were okay, but I have had better.

Artichoke arancini - Flavorless. The best part about the dish was the gravy they served with it. 

White lasagna - NO. NO, I am not exactly sure what spice (possibly cloves) they put in this dish but it was soooooo overpowering it made my tongue and lips numb. ABSOLUTELY the worst bite of food I have ever had! 

Sorry Giada, we won't be back. Service was slow and the food did not meet the standards.
