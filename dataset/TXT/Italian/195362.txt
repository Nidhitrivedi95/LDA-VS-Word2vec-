PJVjfGtVc71M0XlUr83teQ Heard about it from a stranger... Stopped in with the fam... So glad we did!  Got to make MY pizza and the husband and kids could get whatever they wanted since they would rather die than eat feta and spinach!  Good music... Friendly staff... And manager very attentive... Oh and your pizza is done in 2 minutes... ;) This will be a regular stop.
