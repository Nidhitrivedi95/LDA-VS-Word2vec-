EtLmuDIMsBCmqdgpysz60Q After arriving with my family in Cleveland from a snowy ride from NJ, we checked into our hotel and decided on Italian for dinner.

La Stradas exceeded our expectations for food and service .

My son ordered Chicken Parmesan which he said was as good as our favorite Italian restaurant at the shore(Grazianos).  My wife ordered Chicken Marsala and couldn't say enough good things about it. I ordered the four cheese ravioli, deliciouso!

For being from out of town we received a complimentary appetizer and our server who was also the bartender was right on top  of things.  

An enjoyable dinner after a long day in the car.
