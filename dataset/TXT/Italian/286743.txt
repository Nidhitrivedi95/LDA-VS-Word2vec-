zINKP9rtvo2IUKTZoYJUvQ After eating here twice, I pondered about why they named the place Cento, the Italian word for one hundred. Is it because a meal for two people is likely to run over $100? Could it be because there are about 100 things on the menu, making decisions very stressful? These points may be true, but I finally decided it's because 100% of the food I've tried from Cento is wonderfully delicious.

I've gone for brunch and dinner with a big group and EVERYTHING that everyone ordered was top notch. For example, the Porchetta and Brussels sprouts pizza trumps both Grampa's and Pizza Brutta in my opinion. The squid ink tagliatelle (conveniently offered in a full and half sized portion) is just lovely in it's tasty lobster sauce. The snapper is cooked deliciously, I only got a bite of my friend's order but it was enough to make me want to go back and get a full one for myself. 

Whether you're splitting a pizza and the fabulous butcher board (comes with honey, LOVE that!) with friends or ordering entrees with a date, I highly recommend Cento for an evening of great food. The service is also excellent and the ambiance is upscale without being stuffy. Can't wait to go back!
