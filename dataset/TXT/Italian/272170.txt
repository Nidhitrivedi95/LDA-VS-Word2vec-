XT25YpQoNDuzAZHur-HZ8g Was un-pleasantly surprised by the lack of "magic" in my meal tonight. 
Pizza wasn't flavourful, toppings were scattered thoughtlessly, and the ratio of crust to topping section was horrid. Essentially I ate crust with the tip dipped in cheese and meat. 

If you know me, you'll know I'm (usually) Libretto's number 1 fan. But this has been my 3rd or 4th less-than-stellar experience at the University Ave location. Each time I've become less and less enamoured with the food, but the service is still great! 

If you want Libretto at it's best, I'd still recommend the Ossington location.
