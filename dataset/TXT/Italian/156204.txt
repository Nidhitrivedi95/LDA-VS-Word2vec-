They had a large party that clearly threw them off resulting in a bunch of empty, un-bussed tables, a lobby full of people waiting to be seated, and half the menu items being unavailable. It took them forever to seat everyone and then forever to get around to everyone. We left without even getting any water. Unfortunately, they were just very unprepared and I'd probably never go back because of it. Oh and the bathrooms were pretty damn gross.
