eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg My general impression is 'meh', which is sad, because the food was good.

For three of us we had the Calamari, the Meatzza and an Italian Chopped salad. The calamari was nice and cripsy.  The pizza was a nicely sized thin crust, they had crushed red pepper and parmesan cheese to boot! The Italian Chopped was by far my favorite. When you put bacon in a salad it becomes a game of 'Find The Bacon!'

The unfortunate part was the service. The bulk of the restaurant was empty, only the bar area really had any people in it.  We sat down, it took probably 10 minutes just to get menus. After that it took another 10 minutes for beers to be delivered. After that our waitress never showed back up after almost 15 minutes AND someone saying they'd go find her for us. Apparently they never did.  We moved to the bar. 15 minutes later our waitress came back out and proceeded to get in an argument with the bartender about which one of them screwed up someone else's bill right in front of several customers (including us) and also never even apologized for not having shown back up.

I don't think I'd go back again even though the food was solid.
