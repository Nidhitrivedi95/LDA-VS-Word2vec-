Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg Pizza is great. Service okay. However I have a lot of problems with this place. 

My favorite is the Modesto. Get the metro crust every time on any pizza. It's thick and doughy and is soooo cheesy. If you get a beer get a bigger one because it always seems to run out and I'm left without a drink until the end of my meal. Most times the waiter doesn't come back until it's too late. 

I do not like the other people who come here. Whether it's a bunch of bro dudes, obnoxiously loud laughing people (one time people even had the nerve to talk about us in the very next booth), large parties of children. Many times I just order take out.

The major problem I have with this place is when I try to take advantage of their special offers. Many times it's the reason I'm there. Like one time my husband won on a trivia question on the fb page. But they didn't offer him the prize. We messaged them and they never replied. Not cool. Another time, Black Friday, they offered gift cards at a reduced price. They had run out, but took our info. We never heard. We not only called them a week later, but also sent them a message on fb. No information, no reply. We even saw them advertising that they had gift cards again. RAGE. Finally, weeks later they called us. 

Personally, I go when it's slower or when I don't want to drive all the way to my favorite pizza places. MMmmm, metro crust.
