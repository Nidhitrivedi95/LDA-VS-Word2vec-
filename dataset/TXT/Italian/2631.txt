-raUM9T-1dKPiB5_vRmFYA I have been coming here for a few years. The food is ok, but the staffs' attitudes are terrible. Such a shame. There are so few choices in the immediate area that if the staff were nicer I think they would have lines out the door.  I personally stopped going because of the poor customer service.
