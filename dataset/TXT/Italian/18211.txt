2LOTz08OPRyA0ibJImJRbQ We were there this saturday and really enjoyed our evening there. Our server was awesome ; kind, profesionnal, knew his wines. Very very good service which is already enough to have me say we'll be back. 

The appetizers were very good. There was a special dish inspired by the market, therefore we enjoyed a great veal carpaccio (YUM!) and a classic yet flawless burrata mozzarella appetizer (double YUM!)

I was expecting to be really impressed by the pasta. Homemade, and all of them were shapes that we don't eat too often, so that was fun ! Surprisingly though, it was good yet not as much as I had hoped so. My boyfriend had the full plate of the pasta of the day and felt like it was a small portion. I had tons of seafood in mine which made up for the sauce which I felt was a little underwhelming. However, don't get me wrong, it was still really tasty. You can tell how fresh their food is. Really.

The cheese plate was a bit of a bummer. We didn't get how and why a cheese platter could include a huge portion of parmesan. BUT the caciocavallo and the gorgonzala themselves were more than enough. The servings were huge and the price really reasonable !

Desert was PER-FECT. And so was the wine !!

It's a place to try. Nice ambiance, awesome service and very cute decor. 
Around 50$ per person, before wine + tips. 

You should go !
