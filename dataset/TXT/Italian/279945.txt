yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w We were recommended this hotel by a local.

Walking in, I was delighted. Fun to look around (as we waited an hour to be seated).  While waiting we were approached and asked if we'd like a drink. When we asked what they had, we were told 'there's a long list on the table behind you' - the table with people sitting at it.  FYI - they have a full bar, but nothing on tap.

So, the food. Great salad and a yummy hot chocolate they call cappuccino.  The garlic bread and wine that also come with the meal were mediocre. The food was...just ok. I guess when I pay $30 for a bowl of spaghetti I am expecting to get wowed!  Not the case here - and the portion is not a family style portion which would have helped explain the cost.

We were entertained by the accordian player - sweet, little old man who made us smile and enjoyed the overall ambience of the restaurant. Not sure I would return, or even suggest to it a friend though.
