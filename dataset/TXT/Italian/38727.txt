7CPGGNwHibzQtnERq7u2Hw Came here for lunch on a Sunday 2/8/2015.  First sign something was off was when we walked through the kitchen and the "chef" was reading the picture cards on how to prepare the food.  Only 4 tables seated, we ordered a pasta dish and a pizza.  Well 70 minutes later we were done waiting.  Asked for the manager and he couldn't have been more rude or condescending.  Never going back and certainly explains why this restaurant was dead and everything else on Scottsdale Road was packed.  Looking forward to a new concept coming soon to this location.
