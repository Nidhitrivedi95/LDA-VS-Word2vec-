hr0vxeTzlHx6fTpSSmu2AA Excellent food and great service! I have already suggested this restaurant to friends. We had a fig and prosciutto appetizer that was delicious. My husband enjoyed twin filets prepared to perfection set atop homemade mashed potatoes with a rich streak house. I had the New Orleans BBQ shrimp and it was outstanding! The sauce was thick, peppery, and silky with more than enough for the garlic bread provided to dip in it. We took dessert home because we both finished our dinners and did not have room. The peanut butter pie was fabulous with just enough peanuts for crunch! We will certainly return.
