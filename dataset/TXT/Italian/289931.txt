zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA We stumbled upon this restaurant one rainy summer night.  This is one place that my whole family can agree on.  There is a large variety of items to please everyone.  Stromboli is very good as well as the pizza.  My favorite menu item is the mushroom soup.  It is the best soup I have had in a very long time.  I have tried several of the dinner entrees and none have been a disappointment.  They are currently only serving beer and wine and waiting on their liqueur license.  Service has always been good.  On our last visit, Chad our server , was very attentive.  When he was not around,  there was a young woman who refilled our drinks and brought us anything we needed.
