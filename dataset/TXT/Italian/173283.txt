N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg If you like true Chicago deep dish and don't mind waiting 30 minutes for it... there isn't any place that does it better in AZ than Lou's.

Fun atmosphere and friendly staff. The parking is kind of a nightmare in that plaza and it's a little pricey for pizza, but overall we've had good experiences there. 

Butter crust is a must. Trust me.
