6We2O5X62J_gduXU7jvf8w I have been coming to Spinatos for years now. We
have come to know most servers and have felt like family there until recently. Lately, the kids portions have been lessened to 18 noodles (which doesn't even cover the bottom of the bowl). Even though we've been told to order more noodles, which we have, the attitudes by the managers have really resulted from us NOT being a customer any longer. We were were told it may not be the place for us. I'm not sure what type of management says that to its frequent guests? We love Spinatos and it's servers, so for a manager to say this so abruptly really threw  my friends and I off.

Upper management got involved with no resolution except for to speak with the same woman who told us to leave. This is really sad because this is our place we always went to; however, we will not be cheated out of our money for small portions
and disrespectful managers. This manager is new and will not see our business anymore. I am really disappointed on how the owners of Spinatos chose to handle this situation. I have owned a restaurant business before and the customer is always top priority.
