zTkMh_RUVZW-J3lh7-l09Q If I could say "meh" to Italian food I would say it a thousand times over about the food at Pasta Cucina. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

My mother received a coupon for Pasta Cucina in the mail and we figured it was a good enough deal to get us in. I'm weary of Italian places because I just feel like a lot of them are overpriced and not very good. Hmm, my inklings continue to prove me right. 

Let's begin with service - lackluster and cold. The BIOTCH waitress who served us was just terrible. And yes, she was indeed a BIOTCH in all rights. She knew we had a coupon and we didn't order her much pushed on us wine. Therefore we were done, for her, by the time we ordered our raspberry iced teas. Everything else about her service to use was electronic and rude.

Food - the raspberry iced tea was incredibly too sweet. I felt like I was drinking tea spiked with Hi-C fruit punch. Terrible for a "nice" restaurant to serve such a drink. I ordered the Tuscan Angel Hair Pasta with Chicken (add $2). The plate was being overtaken with angel hair, and all the other ingredients were lost. The dish boasted pine nuts - I think I got a total of five in the whole dish. Instead of lovely combo of flavors, which the dish should have been, it was just a mound of angel hair with some chicken pieces thrown on it. My mother ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, a dish that is wonderfully traditional, and which she loves. The meatballs were large and they were good. The sauce was decent, but alas - my mother asked to have the normal spaghetti replaced with angel hair and guess what? She got regular spaghetti.

By this point we were stuffed and had only eaten not even half of our dishes (they're just HUGE). We got to-go bags and received our bill. If I had been paying the waitress would have gotten half the tip my mother left her. 

I will not return to Pasta Cucina. Overpriced Italian food restaurant strikes again.
