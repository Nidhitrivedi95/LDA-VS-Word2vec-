D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg I had probably one of the top 5 meals of my life at Nove.  51st floor of Palms. Only drawback is it is off the strip, and away from the action.  But once there it is worth the travel.  Ernesto the waiter was super informative and knowledgeable on the menu, and the food was incredible.   Cheese plate was too big for two people, great selection, and the pasta and steak were both top notch.  Huge portions.  Will definitely be back.  Great special occasion restaurant.   There's no celebrity chef, just great food and service.
