aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA I'm going to have to agree with Blythe R.  This place is just not the same.  Servious, it was just ok at best. We ordered two "guacatonis" and they were both over cooked.  Some of the food was cold and the pasta mushy.  For sure I won't be going back to this particular Oregano's.  Oh, by the way, I have been here dozens of times. We even had a rehearsal dinner here.  It used to be a real favorite. It is just not the same.
