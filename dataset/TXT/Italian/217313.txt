RXyM7VrCiEFthJxQ4bGmBg I came here for summerlicious.  The mussel appetizer was great.  It was a lot more than expected.   The main entree was a let down.  I ordered the osso boco and i believe they had it frozen.  When it came to me, the entree wasn't even hot or warm so i asked them to heat it up.   It was ok.  The sauce was too overpowering with too much peppercorn.   Also, the braised veil was dry.   The dessert was better.  Anyways,  just average.
