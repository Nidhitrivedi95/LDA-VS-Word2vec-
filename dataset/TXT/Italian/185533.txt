oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ For being a restaurant with the most uninspired name possible... "Food" in Italian, This place is pretty solid, although it definitely isn't authentic Italian. Having recently traveled for three weeks all across Italy sampling cuisine from six different regions, I feel a tad spoiled but this place still gets four out of 5 for the wine list, nice servers and attention to detail. Great work!
