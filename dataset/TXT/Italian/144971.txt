k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ Yummy pizza and delicious salad. I tried the roast beet salad with walnut crusted goat cheese and we built our own pizza to share. The salad was colorful and the cheese was awesome. The pizza was good with fresh toppings and thin crust. It also has a neat decor and atmosphere. Was a great place to try with friends and would like to enjoy one of their own pizzas next time instead of making our own.
