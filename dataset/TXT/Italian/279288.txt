yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w This place was 5 stars a few years back, but with the economy in Vegas, there is nothing in this town that is priced right, and while Battista's held out longer than most, their prices have risen with Vegas.  I hate Vegas, but I love Battista's.  Gordy serenades you with his accordion stylings, not as late as he used to, but then again, he's about 90 now.  Anyone complaining about the wine on here can always buy a bottle of what they want, but when a place gives you free table wine, I put away my wine snob nose and drink it, and it's not bad at all.  I've paid decent money for wines I've liked less.  The vibe is old Vegas, pictures of celebrities from the Rat Pack days and beyond.  The food is good, very good.  Not Food Channel Celebrity Chef Italian, which most pretentious Vegas posers desire, but good italian food.  You do not leave here hungry.  The garlic bread, soup, salad, all the free sides are good, once again, if you are going to criticize the comps, don't eat them, get something else.  It used to be perfectly priced but the prices have gone up or they would get 5 stars.  This is a place to go if you happen to find yourself in the city of posers and wannabe's.
