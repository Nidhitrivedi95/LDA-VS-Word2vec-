esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA This place was amazing! 

My boyfriend and I went for lunch on a Saturday. 

It's a small place, offers eating at the bar and a few booths. Our server was Raymundo. He called himself the "soup king..." HE IS DEF A SOUP KING! 

He recommended the Cioppino, spicy. Best thing I had this trip! 

We also had a dozen oyster sampler and oyster Rockefeller. Everything was so good!
