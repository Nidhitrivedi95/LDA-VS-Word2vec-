smBsHggLvIuABgntBvlYLw So let me start out by saying that this placed is always packed on Monday or Tuesday's for their 5.99 spaghetti meatball special. Which is a pretty good deal for the price point. 

On Saturday night I went in with a few friends of mine for a birthday dinner and we were waited on by a really nice girl who recommended some great wine and apps. After a few minutes a manager came over and poured the wine at our table and was super friendly. We all ordered our food after a few drinks I got the chipotle chicken pasta which was to die for! My friends shared a pizza which looked really good. I had mentioned it was my friends birthday and the sever brought of a menu and said we should pick out a dessert. We all decided on getting the pizza cookie which was good just wish you got some more ice cream there was three scoops and four girls so we had to share. 

Over all great experience for our first time in there not on a Monday. The only draw back was the music was pretty strange for an Italian place. Pretty sure at some point we were listening to a Spanish guitar love song lol! We will be going back again. For the good food and price point you can't beat this place when your looking to go out and don't wanna drive into town.
