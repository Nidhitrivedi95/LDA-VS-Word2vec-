VIP5_HoBm98wcJPwz0lZjg Had lunch here today. Just randomly walked in and we were pleasantly surprised. The place was half full which is great considering the area and time of day.

The servers were very friendly and took our order quickly. I had the kale salad and added chicken to it for $4 and my husband had the veal sandwich which came with a salad. We shared the mushroom risotto balls which were phenomenal. 

The chicken I had was amazing and grilled really well.  I tried some of the veal sandwich and it was very tasty too!

The beer was cheap but the food itself is in the mid range. Most dishes are about $9-$15 and for salads you can add chicken for $4. Totally worth it.

There are quite a few pizzas available and we'll definitely try those next time. 

There's a nice little patio outside so when it's warm out again next year we will definitely be back!
