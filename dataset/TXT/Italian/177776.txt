NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA Very good pizza, only complaint was mine was a little burned around the edges.  I had the carnivore, very good flavor but not heavy on meat like other meat pizzas.   The service was good, quick and friendly.  The only two things keeping this from being  five stars are the price ($18 for a personal sized pizza) and the fact that my pizza was burnt around the edges which made the crust undesirable.   


Yummy.
