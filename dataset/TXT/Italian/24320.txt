48GIryCZOX7YHpPyimbw2A I was kind of disappointed in this visit to Olive Garden.

A group of eight of us went to dinner on a Thursday evening.  We were seated quickly and since someone in our party could not walk very far they offered to sit us in the very front in the room somewhat sectioned off.  Our service was AMAZING! since we were a larger party they had two waiters helping us.  They were very attentive, constantly refilled our drinks, brought our food out quickly and had the unlimited salad/breadsticks constantly at our table.
You can't go wrong with the salad and breadsticks!! 
As for some of the issues we had, I ordered the rosemary and garlic chicken and the chicken was lukewarm.  The potatoes and spinach were pretty good.
My grandma is not able to eat anything spicy whatsoever and can not eat any black pepper.  We figured she could eat some grilled chicken with vegetables. However this was not an option.   The waitress claimed everything is already pre marinated and the only sauces that didnt have pepper was a garlic, butter sauce. I was completely shocked that they couldnt even make some grilled chicken that wasnt seasoned.  It was pretty evident that all their food must come pre packaged and not made in house.  My grandparents had to stick to the salad and breadsticks and were not able to eat anyting else. (partly because at this point they were kind of frustrated)  
I recommend picking somewhere else if someone in your group has any issues related to this.
