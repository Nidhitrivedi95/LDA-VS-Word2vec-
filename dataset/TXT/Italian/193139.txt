pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ GET OFF THE STRIP! Really, there is more to Vegas than Celeb Chefs and over priced strip restaurants. 

Had the Calamari app, very tender, well seasoned. The Mozzarella Caresse was not the best i've had, but still tasty. 
Highlight was the Crazy Alfredo think Alfredo Fettuccine, then add sausage, jumbo shrimp, mushrooms, bell peppers, sun dried tomatoes, and wait for it...Jalapenos. 

definitely will be a return visit on the next trip out.
