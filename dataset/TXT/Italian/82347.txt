DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw Mimmo, and Mikey at the bar, made the evening amazing.  Made an off the menu request for me and let me try a variety of Italians reds that nocked my socks off.  Tonight was my first time here, but I'll be a regular now!  This is going to be my go-to business lunch and dinner spot now when in Las Vegas.   I had to tease them for having the Cable box go out in the bar earlier in the day , but because I wasn't buried in the TV, I actually talked to Mimmo and Mikey.  Ends up having the tv out was a wonderful thing!   Great job guys!
