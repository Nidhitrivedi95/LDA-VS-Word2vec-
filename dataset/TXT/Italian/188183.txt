Ov68TVizW1d2Hqm2M2FKVg Service was bad.  While I was walking in I saw the hostess chewing gum which is a pet peeve of mine so -1 star instantly for that.

Server was completely rude so minus -1 star for that.  We sat at our table when he asked if we wanted drinks and we said no it went downhill from there,

Food was good and nicely portion.  It would be a 4 star if it wasn't for the service especially with Nobu just few steps away.
