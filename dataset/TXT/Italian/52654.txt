9xdVIIzHp12Zrox5aFaaHA I thoroughly enjoyed myself here. From the food to the decor to the staff. The pizza is great and the crust is the best. The Ceasar salad was really good too, though it was small. It was very flavorful.  The bartender was very amiable. The best thing was their dessert. The Creme Brule was so so delicious. The other dessert we got was also great. I just forgot the name. The restaurant is actually Italian and they had a cute white brick wall that they projected old movies on. It was a great atmosphere with delicious food. I would definitely go back regularly if I could.
