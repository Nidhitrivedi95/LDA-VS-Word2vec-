QDvUdj36I_oAzXoFzCQnNA Saw this on our way home today and decided to stop in - not a lot of stuff in the little strip mall so I assumed it was just a pizza place.

Boy was I wrong. As soon as you walk in the door you see that it's a little more special than 'just another pizza place'. It's clean and cozier than I expected from the outside. My husband ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese and I ordered Chicken Ravioli. Their pastas are handmade (I didn't review the entire menu close enough to see if they all are, but there was quite a good selection of home made pasta).

The garlic bread is VERY yummy, I had a piece while we waited for dinner and then used a couple more to schmutz around in the pink sauce served with my ravioli.

Our waiter was Anthony - and he looked like he was from New York for sure! He was very polite, he and the other gentleman were very attentive. There was a cute blonde gal working tables, too, she was a little chatty for me - just when I was ready to point out how chatty she was to my husband she started talking about how good the pizza was at some other restaurant.

Then she mentioned that their pesto was better than "ours". Um. . . . Really? Then she mentions something about another restaurant to yet another table before we left this evening. I neglected to do my Review from the restaurant, so I forgot what that particular subject was about. Quite annoying to hear the wait staff discuss what they like about another restaurant, over THEIR restaurant..... especially annoying when it's the same food type as the one that they work in.

Nonetheless, we loved Nick's and will be going back. Maybe next time we'll try their pizza, I've ready a couple of reviews about how good it is.
