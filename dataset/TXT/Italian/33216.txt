I had the Spinach salad  topped with warm Bacon dressing.. a very unique touch and  the combination of mushrooms, bacon and bits of hard boiled eggs went well together.  The Shrimp Scampi was cooked to a perfect texture and the lemon butter cream sauce was to die for! I even dipped my asparagus in it!  I had the Spumoni Ice Cream cake with the cookie crumb crust and hubby had the Almond Caramel Pecan ice cream cake with Bananas Fosters. So make room for it! Dessert was insanely good!  

Service and staff was top notch. Even the servers from the bar took time to acknowledge us as we were leaving. I also like the fact when you go to pay your server has a card machine and runs the card in front of you. Very convenient and saves time. Very nice atmosphere with an upscale feel to it and it's the perfect location with the view of the Las Vegas skyline. I see why now the place is always packed! Im very lucky that Ventano is in my neighborhood.
