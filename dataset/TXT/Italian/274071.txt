Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A So I went to this buffet thinking the worst.  But to my surprise the service was  great and the food was good. Now, it wasn't the best buffet in Vegas , but I did get my money's worth. I don't know if We went a good night, but the buffet exceeded my expectations. The worst thing about the buffet was the cheap wine.
