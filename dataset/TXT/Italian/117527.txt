gyDTYm_NDWXEHBPGnL-oRQ My first time in Madison, and my first meal was eaten here just now. It wasn't disappointing at all. I got 2 small orders of the pad Thai and the curry soup--both were fresh-tasting and delicious! I could have had a small, but sufficient, healthy meal with  just one. But at $3.95 a pop,, I decided to get greedy and try both. Now I am a bit overstuffed and feeling a little bit guilty by my constant failure at moderation, but happy nonetheless after a tasty, cheap, and wholesome meal, in a city that I'm enjoying, and which I'm  looking forward to explore further!
