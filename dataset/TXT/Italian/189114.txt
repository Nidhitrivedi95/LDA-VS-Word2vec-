OYaL_-uxBCgrE94uNQ4VCA We decided to give this place a try after passing by several times.  I have to say that we were definitely not disappointed! We ordered the chicken parm. It's served with spaghetti.  The portion size is very generous. I could not finish all my spaghetti! I took it to go. The marinara sauce is well seasoned and delicious.  The service is wonderful and extremely friendly! The only qualm I have is that is an alcohol free restaurant. We also ordered a pepperoni pizza. Tasty as well. I would definitely recommend this place.
