q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Cool idea, poorly executed. Guy that seated us was standoffish and left us without menus for almost 10 minutes. Were never offered water. Ordered wine and received one glass that was almost 2x the other one, when pointed out to waitress she told me (I got the bigger glass) that I must have gotten lucky. Hubby's glass was no more than 3 oz - ridiculous. Food would have been tasty if it was hot! Good flavors but lukewarm at best. Same thing for my starter, the spinach egg soup. I wish it was served hot! Also, $20 spaghetti and meatballs featured one meatball. IT SAYS MEATBALLS ON THE MENU. And I have never seen a smaller portion of lasagna. As I mentioned, could have overlooked the small pricey portions if they food was served hot, or at least warm. I will not return here, totally not worth it. And the live singer was just awful. What a tourist trap!
