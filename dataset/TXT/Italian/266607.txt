x4aHNNo1osWNCB75q_PijQ The food at Pomo was extremely delicious. The melon covered with salami was typical Italian and delicious. The pizza there has a extremely thin crust full of flavor that enlightens the taste buds. The delicious food that they make is one of the best. They make the food with such care and precision and it's all handmade. Everything was good and delicious from the water to the pizza. I will be coming back. It was truly a delight to eat at Pomo.
