i4hvmTd4RH9HvOyG8ndYGw I don't give five stars lighly. This is my first, and it's only for the delivery from Raffaele's because I have never seen the place in my life. 

We (my housemate Joanna and I) ordered a cheese Sicilian because we saw it on the menu and had no idea what that meant, and we wanted to find out. Sure, I could have asked the friendly phone voice, but that would have killed the adventure. 

What showed up at our door (held by a wonderfully cheerful gal in red glasses - sassy!) was a box full of bliss. 16 mounds of pizza each as big as a slab of lasagna. There was a slight kick to the sauce, the cheese was melty the crust was crunchy at the edges, light soft (but fully cooked) at the center. Oh man, was I in trouble... I made it through 3 pieces and then had to go lay on the couch and read a book. But it was so worth it. Mmmmm. 

All that, and they'll bring it to your door!
