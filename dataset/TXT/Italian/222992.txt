skQ-HIR664Ivp2-A4kOfnA For many years, Cucina was a favorite place to go for Italian food, but lately it has really gone down hill. I continued to go because although it isn't great anymore, it was decent...well today was the last time. 

My wife ordered soup and salad, the soup tasted like it came out of a can and the salad had a hair in it.

I ordered wheat pasta with rustic roma sauce, mushroom and asparagus. The pasta was fine but the sauce was bland...no snap to it.

The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is that the bread they bring out at the beginning of the meal is good.

I hope that Cucina gets back to their old goodness, but I'm not holding my breath.
