LqO_983CEmi1_X1En4mZow We have been wanting to try their Sunday brunch for a while. We finally got there last Sunday, but were disappointed. For twenty dollars a person, we expected more and better selection. They were supposed to open at 0930, and while they were open, they were not yet ready. The to order omelets, were not omelets, but scrambled eggs with the ingredients mixed in. The bloody Mary's were nine dollars each, and tasted as if they had maybe on ounce of vodka in them. Disappointed in them as well. 

We wanted to try it, and we did, but we will not have their brunch again. With two drinks and two buffets and tip, our tab ran about $85. Not worth it. We could have gotten a better breakfast elsewhere for half the price.
