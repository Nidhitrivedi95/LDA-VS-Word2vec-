DjvpsmdtEvnyMk2vXxpc-w Enjoy a picturesque view of the lake while dining in a casual atmosphere. Pier 54 offers sandwiches, burgers, flat bread, and salads. The first time we went here our burgers were more on the well done side rather than medium as requested, but were still tasty. I've also had the salmon BLT, which had a generous portion of tender salmon with crispy bacon and lettuce. 

While I've enjoyed the food here, service can be hit or miss depending on how busy it is. On our last visit they were severely understaffed and the poor waitress was the only one there to check up on a nearly full seating of tables.

The plus of outside seating is that they are extremely dog friendly. The minus of eating outside (If you are sensitive to smoke) is the plethora of smokers that tend to frequent this restaurant.

While the atmosphere is great, some of the chairs could use some cleaning or replacement. The ones at our table had cushions that were supposed to be a cream color, but had some dirty brown spots on them.

Overall I'll definitely be coming here again to try more of their menu items, but probably at a less busy time.
