AYLxEeVq8NKG2UhcBiggrA Came here a few weeks ago and used the Yelp check-in special for a free garlic bread!  It was super delicious, we ordered a cheese version as well.  I was with a group of friends and we all had individual pizzas.  A few of us had the "Rocket" which was super delicious, you could tell the proscuitto was really nice quality.  One of us had the "David Bolland" and wow, the salami on it was super hot! Service was good and I really want to try some of the others options on the menu.  This is a great pizza place in Etobicoke when you want some really good quality pizza and I will definately be back!
