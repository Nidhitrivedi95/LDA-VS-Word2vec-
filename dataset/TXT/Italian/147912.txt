KcIalceIg6PSPONvLlI4-w I've not had any meals at the new Sud Forno so this rating is just for the desserts... and those were really good! I've had:
- Bombolone: I've had both the nutella and cream ones twice now and cam safely say the bombolone is the star of Sud Forno's sweet offerings. The bread is airy without being dry, the filling is very generous (the nutella or cream both just oooooze out when you take a bite), and it comes in small or big sizes to cater to your appetite. I hope though that the quality continues to be good - last time my husband had the nutella bombolone, there wasn't as much filling.
- Babamisu: Tiramisu with rum was nice and moist
- Sfogliatelle: Ceam-filled pastry tart with strong cherry flavours

I've seen reviews on the meals which aren't been great. Again, I haven't had any meals at Sud Forno but I'd come back here just for the desserts - definitely worth the visit.
