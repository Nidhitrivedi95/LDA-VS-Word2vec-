pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw We came here for lunch on a Tuesday.  We came right when it opened so it was not packed and we didn't have to wait.  The pizza came out so very quickly once we ordered it!  We got the Margarita and Rosa pizza.  I personally loved the Rosa pizza with pistachio!  There was a good mix of sweet and salty taste to it that made me love it! If you're in Phoenix, this place is a must stop!
