zluk4cL7Ch-uRlRply42ZQ My first time eating at Molinaris.  Food was good.  Not much of a white wine selection even though their website list this as a highlight or the restaurant.  I had the mussels, they were tender but would rather of had them in a lemon wine sauce.  Had their Pasta Putenesca, was good.  My wife had a fillet and that was very good but the dipping sauce was kind of bland(chipolte butter sauce).  Our waitress was great.  I would go back again
