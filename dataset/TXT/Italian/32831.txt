5ykOWYZ44sUvu9qxD8rPeg I found Il Bosco on Yelp and came because it had so many 5 star ratings. It's for good reason this little hole in the wall has garnered such positive remarks.

First thing: it's tough to find, but don't give up. The restaurant can be found behind their portable wood fire pizza oven. Once inside, wave to the owner. He's wearing a white chef coat and has grey hair. Even if you don't wave, count on a table side visit. 

Second: he's a former golf pro who tired of traveling and thought opening a restaurant would be fun. 

Third: get the homemade meatballs to start. Delicious and served on a plate of homemade tomato sauce that's also delicious.

Fourth: order the Joanna or Biaggia. Every pie comes in just one size. The Joanna has hot Italian sausage that's home made. The Biaggia is the PERFECT combination of sweet and savory. Yes, it has figs in it and yes, they are delicious. 

Fifth: be prepared to come home with money in your pocket because Il Bosco is very affordable.

I brought two buddies from SoCal and all agreed we would return. Lots of people talk about Pizzaria Bianco, and for good reason. Il Bosco is right there in terms of food quality but you don't have to wait four hours. It's the PERFECT local Pizzaria.
