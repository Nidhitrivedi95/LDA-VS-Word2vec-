Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ This to me is the best pizza in town! There are some close seconds but consistently, the pizza here is hot, great crust and the sauce is delicious. I am a fan of the simple cheese pizza and I have never been disappointed here. The owner is great and he is often seen being the one who makes the pizza.
