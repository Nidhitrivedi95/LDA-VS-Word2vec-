5ykOWYZ44sUvu9qxD8rPeg Just went here and really loved it.  The owner is pleasant without being obnoxious.  The pizzas lie somewhere in between a high quality American style pizza and a Napoletana pizza.  We had a caprese salad with high quality tomatoes and medium quality mozzarella.  The basil, olive oil dressing was wonderful.  The pizzas are tasty with excellent ingredients.  

The atmosphere is simply wonderful and cozy.  It's a small space but interesting and nicely decorated.

For amazingness I still rank Pomo #1 for pizza, Andreoli #2 (they only serve pizza a couple of nights a week) and Bosco is in the next category.  This is a great place so make sure and give it a try.
