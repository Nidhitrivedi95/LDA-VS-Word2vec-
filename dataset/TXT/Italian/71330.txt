C63sF-wG4f1doMIMv2qvOg Well-balanced and baked pizza and decent pasta. The seafood in the seafood linguine is very goood, but I personally think it's a bit expensive for what it is. Casual / comfortable place that is decently sized. Not the largest place, but I wouldn't worry too much about bringing a larger (~10 people) group here to eat. I have had some amazing pizza in my life (my favorite is surprisingly in New Haven) and I really dont think this place is up to par with some of my other experiences, but it is still very good for what we can find in Madison. Their tiramisu is really good, as well.
