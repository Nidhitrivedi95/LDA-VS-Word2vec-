True to it's "Deli" name, you get the feeling you are in an old New York neighborhood when walking into this unassuming shop on West Sahara Ave. The deli counter will have you perusing for 10 minutes and the friendly staff are welcoming. The little wine shop inside the deli has some amazing gems, so spend another 10 minutes browsing there. 

Once you sit down at a table to look at the menu you are fully ready for the fresh bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar they bring you promptly.

The menu is full of hidden marvels. Everything is great and if you are in a group I suggest going family style - everyone order something and share as portions are generous and you'll want to try everything. 

My personal favorites are the homemade pizza as appetizer and the sausage ragu fettuccine. The linguine and clams is another excellent choice. Is you are on the go then just gran the Chicken Parme sandwich.
