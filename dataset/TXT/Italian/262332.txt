wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg I'm a true believer that North Happy Hour is one of the best in the valley. It has an open air/trendy vibe, delicious sangria and fabulous pizza. Oh and I couldn't forget the zucca chips {zucchini chips} for $3!! Their bottle & board special is $20 for a bottle of wine or sangria + a margherita pizza or their pizza of the day {which is always fabulous}. Their pizza of the day today was a white pizza with bacon, fig & peperoncino peppers. To. Die. For. The perfect combination of sweet & spicy! 

The best part, they have HH ALL DAY SUNDAY too!!! Also, for brunch, their chicken salad sandwich is phenomenal! Their pastas are all hand-made and you truly can't go wrong with any of them. Yum! It's safe to say that I'm a regular here.
