VsHhy9ixEze-AxNYt6UxLA This was mine and my girlfriend's<U+200B> first time eating at this restaurant. We heard about it through Uber Eats. Upon delivery, my veal parmesan was so ridiculously burned, it was inedible. I'm afraid to ask how the food even left the restaurant in that condition. I called the restaurant and the manager was very nice and advised she'd give me a $20 credit on my next visit. However, I don't think I'll be returning.
