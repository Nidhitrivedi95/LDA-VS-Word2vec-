9CYZaEbU3KjdLFMkKbUXVw I thought all the hipster vibes in Toronto congregated on Ossington, but the Colonel proved me wrong

Came here for a Paint Nite event and loved the feel of this place.  Pretty chill bartender made everyone's drinks pretty fast, I enjoyed their strawberry mojito but didn't like the cosmo or orgasm very much, too strong

Also liked the little charcuterie board my friend got at the end of the event, obviously not the same quality as other restos but for the nice ambiance and drinks, 4 stars, would come here for chill drinks but probably not food
