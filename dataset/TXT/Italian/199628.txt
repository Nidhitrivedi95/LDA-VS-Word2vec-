pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Great food for a decent price that should easily get 5 stars if it wasn't for the insane amount of wait time.  My group showed up 15 minutes early for a group reservation and still had to wait 60 minutes, ridiculous!  

Everything I had was delicious and I think the spinach pizza was my favorite.
