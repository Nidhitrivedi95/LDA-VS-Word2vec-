dSEcQPPUlATxZf5pvN_t5Q I heard such great things about this restaurant... I was totally looking forward to it.. The building and interior decor is totally outdated.. but then again who cares. Its about the food anyways.. I ordered the TORTELLINI BROCCOLI ALFREDO..... So SO gross. Tasted like something cheap out of a can.. I am not a picky eater at all whatsoever... and this was nasty....
