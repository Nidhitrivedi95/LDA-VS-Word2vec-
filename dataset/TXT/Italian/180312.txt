nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Wow! What a great dining experience all the way around! Eatery is very inviting like a friendly Italian kitchen. Staff was neat, dressed impeccably and very friendly. Our waiter was fantastic and offered us an option that made our dinner even more special. We had an excellent calamari appetizer, a wonderful salad which the waiter recommended (he said he would split our entree because it was huge and add the salad which saved us money and we got to enjoy an amazing salad as well!) The food was delicious, the ambiance was lovely, the staff fantastic! Definitely going back!
