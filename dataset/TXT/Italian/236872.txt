tXJkGjBkGOZHWAcCmlzS6w Great cozy, intimate Italian restaurant.  Updated decor unlike some places on the street in need of a major update.  I love that it is not a zoo/factory in here.  Good variety of food.  Started with the dinner salad..nothing more than a pile of mixed greens.  Balsamic vinaigrette was good.  I went with the Orechiette with sausage and the man of the house went with spaghetti.  Both dishes were good but I felt like the sauce was missing something...garlic perhaps? Just a little dull.  Sausage was yummy in my tummy.  Great all-Italian wine list with Sangiovese for $5 a glass.  Score.  Chef Valerio is visible in the dining room when he comes out to greet many regular diners.  Bartender was also our waitress.  Very friendly and good service.  She said Valerio makes a family meal for the staff each night.  Very cool.  Nice spot for a quiet dinner with occasional live acoustic music from a 1-man band.
