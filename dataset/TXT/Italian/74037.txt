CPgyfcsyPegLha1ajaSRoA Being an out of towner ..  It's my favorite restaurant to visit. It's one of the must haves! The atmosphere is relaxing, the service is always wonderful & the food always exceeds our expectations. Asked for the desert tray, you won't be disappointed!!

The Zucchini Parmigiana was simply amazing! Just the site of it will make your mouth water! It is definitely enough for 2 people to share
