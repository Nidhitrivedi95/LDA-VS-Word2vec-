-Mm4YqCDM5CqSDDh7HI6Zw The pizza was pretty good. 

However, when the gal took our order, we ordered two slices of cheese pizza. 15 minutes later after we ordered and sat down, they brought out two pieces of pepperoni, forcing us to wait another 5 or more minutes for our actual order. 

This isn't my first choice in pizza in the city. The service wasn't best, and I felt like the employees were annoyed that we even placed an order with them in the first place. Maybe if the attitudes were better, we'd go back for a second visit.
