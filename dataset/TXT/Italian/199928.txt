PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA We stopped by for dinner and drinks around 10pm... the owner was kind enough to keep the kitchen open for us and it was such an enjoyable experience from the start.

Our waitress, Stephanie, was such a delight to be around. We kind of figured she had to be related to the owner because she knew the ins and outs of every single item on the menu and described it with such passion! 

He went with a ravioli dish with ricotta and spinach and I went with the gnocchi di ricotta, which consisted of eggplants, basil and roasted tomatoes... both to die for. She also recommended these tiny jars which come with a blend of eggplants, mozzarella cheese and tomatoes and served over tuscan toast... MY GOD. It was so good and the chef brought us another round on the house. We topped it off with a delicious dessert of chocolate, peanut butter mousse and vanilla gelato... also complimentary thanks to the chef!

Side note:  They also have THE BEST Moscato I've ever had in my life! 

This was a fabulous dining experience (major thanks to Stephanie and the chef) and him and I will definitely be returning!
