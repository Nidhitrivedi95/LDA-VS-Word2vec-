The service was good, she checked on us. And was very helpful. 

The food, I could have done without. Pasta is bland, very lil flavor. It all around sucked sad to say I was hoping for better. Seems like the cook had his hand slip with the red peppers because I had to stop eating, it was way to spicy. Not a fan of this place.
