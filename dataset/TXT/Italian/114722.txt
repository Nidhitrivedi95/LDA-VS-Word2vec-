GMriYorKj1v-dhhJ1om-Sg The pizza here is always good, especially for those looking for a N.Y. style pizza. The prices are a bit higher than competing family pizza joints, but the overriding complaint is the high volume rock music blasted through low quality speakers. This results in an atmosphere that is the furthest thing from a relaxing, conversation-accomodating dining experience that one would expect. Everyone at our table quickly became annoyed, as we could not hear anyone else try to talk. Adding to this cacophony, the party at the table next to us was really loud, trying to overcome the music to be heard. The three stars are for the good pizzas that the place consistently churns out. Take out would be a better bet than dining in.
