I came here because of the reviews and I was hoping to get some decent pizza, but I was wrong.

As soon as I walked in, I should have walked out. This place was filthy. The bathroom was filthy. There was dust all over. I should have known better that their pizza was going to be any good. 

They may have gotten me in the door, but I won't be back!
