gsh-kcWxR7JHWxYEDXmS8Q As much of a pizza aficionado that I am (il Bosco is the best of the best), Little Caesars consistently gets a good portion of my families pizza budget (Barros is our other go to). It's all about the Detroit Deep Dish. They do it better than any I've found. Mrs Beautiful even declares it her favorite (I fear that may be a bit blasphemous, but I can handle a bit of charring on my artesian pizza, she can't). Pizza! Pizza!
