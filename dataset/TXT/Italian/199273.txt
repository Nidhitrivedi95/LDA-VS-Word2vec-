pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I'm giving this experience only 3 stars simply because the weight of my expectation about the quality of food was very high but was not met. 

We were seated 20 minutes after we checked in, but had wait a further 10-15 minutes to place our order. We ordered a pizza bianco and a pizza "sonny" which had prosciutto topping. We also ordered a green side salad and had bread as a side.The pizza base and the bread that was served as a side, was outstanding. But that was where the accolade stops. The salad was so tart and bitter we couldn't enjoy it; the pizza "sonny"'s prosciutto topping had a ripe, almost fetid smell and we had to leave the meat. the pizza bianco was ok. 

After the tremendous publicity and fan fare surrounding Pizza Bianco, we were definitely underwhelmed, and if we do go back, will be looking for a better standard from the kitchen.
