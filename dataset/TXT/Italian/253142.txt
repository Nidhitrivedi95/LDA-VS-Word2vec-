VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w I cannot understand how this place has so many 4+ star ratings. The environment is nice and it has a decent vibe but avoid the food. A better meal can be found at Fazolis. First off, they gave me a menu that was outdated. So my original selection was no longer offered. I settled on shrimp scampi which was essentially like eating tough rubber balls. The side dish of Alfredo was also horrendous. Finally, I thought I might be able to redeem dinner with a piece of cheesecake. Well not to disappoint I had a large completely taste free block of cheese with barely thawed berries. 

Oh and the fun didn't stop with dinner. This dinner continued to reward me well into the night with a severe bout of intestinal distress. AVOID THIS PLACE.
