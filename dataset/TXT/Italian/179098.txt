nsw3tlB-hwz4KbPYcuaSww I'm Italian and I have been l've been living in the US for 7 years. This is hands down the best pizza place I've been to in this country. In fact, Novanta would be a great pizza place even in Italy.

Pizza to me is not about how many toppings you put on it. Even a simple Margherita has to taste good.

Novanta is great Napoli-style pizza, fresh mozzarella, correct toppings (not friggin pineapple and 20 different things on your pizza)!

I recommend their Regina with Buffalo mozzarella and basil and pretty much all of their pizzas. Pair with a Mexican coke or a Spotted cow and you had a great day. On your way out you can buy some of their homemade mozzarella for a few bucks.

Really a great gem!
