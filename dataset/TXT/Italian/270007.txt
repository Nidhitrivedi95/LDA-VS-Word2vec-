xLmJnwxpPXIPZotBDpPngg First visit .....will definitely not be our last.!  Start to finish everything was great.  Antipasti platter, surf and turf seafood platter even the pizza , superb.Chris, our server was informative,professional and very nice!  
  We went without reservations only because of the  holidays but I would imagine this little gem is a hotspot and reservations would be a god idea.
