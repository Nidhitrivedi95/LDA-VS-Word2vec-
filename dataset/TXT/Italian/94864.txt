eobkI2jIFXjdUiv-5LCV9w I went to this Pizza Hut to get carry out pizzas for years.  In the past six months I've gone twice.  The place kind of smells, I'm not sure what it is but it isn't good.  Yesterday I went in and ordered the new Big Dinner Box.  While it was cooking I went next door to get some groceries and returned about 15 minutes later.  I was standing in the front waiting for the pizza to come out of the oven and I noticed the guy & girl working in the back.  They were getting pizzas and breadsticks out of the oven and cutting & boxing them.  While doing this I saw both of them pop some food in their mouths.  Then even worse I saw the guy lick his finger and keep handling the food.  Then he rubbed his nose with the side of his hand!  I stepped up to the register and requested my money back.  After I explained what I had seen the cashier gave me my money back promptly and said that she would speak to them.  I probably won't go back, ever.  There are lots of other pizza places within a mile of this place, I've heard that Bella Pizza a mile south is good, I'll have to try that.
