w4yq1IRk0DHQE995giqjGg My husband surprised me with family and friends on my birthday at Olive Garden on flamingo. We've been to that Olive Garden 100s of times but for whatever reason this time was a disaster. So many issues and problems with food & drink orders. We are so very disappointed with the service, no discount was offered or anything it even took forever to get the bill.
