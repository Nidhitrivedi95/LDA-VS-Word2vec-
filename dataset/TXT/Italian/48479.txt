It's much, much bigger on the insdie than it seems and the wait without reservations on a friday night is completely reasonable (15-20 minutes)- and you can wait next door at the bar for your table.  The food is excellent- I highly recommend the appetizers! Prices are also reasonable- a spaghetti dinner is under $18- and the portion is large enough that you will have left overs for two meals to take home!
