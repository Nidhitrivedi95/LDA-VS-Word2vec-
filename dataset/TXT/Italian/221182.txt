SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg I usually do not write bad reviews but when you make my wife  upset  who was excited to make reservation  in person day before  you deserve one.  We arrived 30 min late after horrendous  traffic and they pretended like we didnt make reservation.  Said were not to be found  when my wife physically walked there the day before  to set a time.  She remembered and described all of the staff and all of a sudden they found our name.  I thought we would get a seat outside  and didnt mind a small wait since we were late also.   Then the manager ridicules the hostesses on how to seat which I found quite rude.  Hoping to get a seat they say sorry guys  u have to wait 2 hours.  I felt bad for my wife who all day was excited to show me this place LAGO.  Now I am pissed mess my night  up.....really.  I get her to sit inside  at table near bar and not be sad since last vegas visit till we have baby.    To make things worse this waiteress is super fast like a machine says just so you know all is a la carte and super small portions.  So pay a lot for very little...then front  hostess says your gonna eat here now after trying  to patch up situation.  Terrible service, snobby, rushed and just plain unacceptable  treatment  no matter how nice to look on the outside.   We got up and left this place quick as possible.  Had perfect dinner next door at 5 Star Olives who always treat us well.  Fix your service.....no surprise  the last month several bad reviews.
