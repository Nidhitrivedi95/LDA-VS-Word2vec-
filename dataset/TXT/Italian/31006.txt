5nZVVPO_cYH9aQeClTP9zA The overall experience is great. Must say I was pleasantly surprised. Much better then I anticiated. Since liked a chicks place to eat. I went with my wife and I must admit I really liked it. I got a spinach apple salad thingy and it was amazing. Great size portion and actually tasted like a good, healthy salad. The pizza is good and the mac and chheese is great. Overall ambience is nice and was a good place to relax woth freinds or family and enjoy good food. I think it is reasonably priced ( about  $7.50 a person) considering you get great quality food.  Definitely will be back!
