lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ Came to this location with my boyfriend and was seated quickly, in the bar area with 0 other people around us. (Very awkward) It was very quiet except for the servers that kept talking across the room to the bartender about drinks and other guests. Once the bartender made eye contact with us we realized he was actually also our server. He was very nice and friendly but the level of service here is awful. Once he took our order he offered us house bread and said he would be right back. Our entrees came out first(and were cold). Then our appetizer. Followed by our "server" smelling like smoke. Maybe if he hadn't been on a smoke break we would have gotten our food correctly. Then after we were almost finished with our food he brought us a cold bread basket....  Thanks but no thanks. Waste of money. With all the places to eat at in vegas this is definitely last on the list.
