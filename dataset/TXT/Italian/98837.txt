ExLXL_oQvI7oPB7TrVpGhg The pizza's are fantastic!!! The best we have had in a long time. My husband and I absolutely love the PIZZA here.  They even have a few outstanding staff members like Anthony who was  extremely welcoming and positive. We appreciated how he treated us as VALUED  GUESTS.

p.s. 
We would have given them 5 stars but didn't because they didn't have any vegetarian salad dressings to choose from. Hopefully, next time we go they will have a better selection. We love Pizza and salad together.
