-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw I go to Brio often for happy hour. The food is always delicious but recently the service has been something to mention. A new server named Nikki took care of us and was so great that we ask for her by name when we go. You guys made a great choice when hiring her. Hope to see you all again soon.
