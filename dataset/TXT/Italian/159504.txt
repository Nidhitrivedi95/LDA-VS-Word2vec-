lgWB0yGXpZvupYREWxtV7g I was in Arizona this past weekend and stumbled on to this quaint little restaurant -- I Hab a chicken dish cooked in a tangerine sauce and these fabulous beans like fava beans and a salad with onions and red cabbage oh my god I thought I had died and gone to heaven - not to mention the Bar tender and the hostess who served us -- thank you Pane Bianco ... My friend had a pizza and it was so fresh all the  ingrediates  were great !!!!
