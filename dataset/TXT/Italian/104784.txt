fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ This is casual dining. The food is tasty. Our waiter, Rick, was really nice, friendly, and very helpful with suggestions about the menu. We had passed by this place for years wanting to go in, but afraid it would be too pricey. But this was very affordable. It was a nice experience. When you dine here, ask for Rick!
