CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA I was first introduced to Venezia's years ago when I started working at a new job in Tempe. It was the team's every-Friday lunch destination and it was kind of a big deal *every* Friday.

Having grown up in New Jersey, I was skeptical at first. I've yet to find a pizzeria that truly matches the "New York style" they claim to live up to, and I've been looking!

The minute I walked through the front door, I knew that Venezia's was going to get me very close to that holy grail I'd been searching for.

They had pizza-by-the-slice, the slices were obnoxiously large, thin-crusted, and soggy with grease. This was about all I needed to see. The first bite confirmed my hopes.

Venezia's has been my #1 go-to for pizza ever since. Unfortunately, there must be something wrong with my body, because I feel sick after eating here *every* time.

**To put the quality of Venezia's pizza into perspective for you, though, I make the conscious decision to order here even *knowing* that it will make me feel unwell!

Any other business would lose a star for "making me feel sick afterward", but not Venezia's. I don't blame them, and it doesn't stop me from eating here.

If you haven't been, GO! It's the closest you'll get to an authentic NY-style pizza this far south and west. Careful, though - portions are much larger than you might expect!  ;)
