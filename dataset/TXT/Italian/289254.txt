Zt4ljpwfmBufatNM1zPNcQ Good pizza, went with a large group and was able to try several different styles.  Heres what I had: Diavola pizza, The Vortex pizza, Southwest Chicken Pizza, Hawaiian pizza, Classic Gluten free pizza,  They were all very good!  My favorite was the Southwest chicken, and my least favorite was the Vortex (too "olive-y" for me, but a it was a couple of my friend's favorite).  Oh and the salads are really big, 4 people shared a small (appetizer portions)!
One negative about the experience was the waiter though.  This kid just didnt seem to know very much about anything, and wasnt very attentive to our large group (10 people).  When a friend asked about a beer he was unfamiliar with, the waiter described it for him, "Its from California.  Its good."  when he asked about another beer, his description was very similar (although slightly more helpful), "Its our darkest beer, its good."  Maybe they can educate their staff a little better about their menu.
