7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ First time at this place . Had the Reuben sandwich. Normally I don't like cole slaw and forgot to ask for it without, but that was by far the best tasting Reuben sandwich I have had In a long time. The flavor of the slaw really pulled it together . Great atmosphere and good crowd if people . The service was excellent. I'll definitely be coming here again.
