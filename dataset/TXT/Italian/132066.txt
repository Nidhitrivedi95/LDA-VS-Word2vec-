The bread was great. All the bread in Pittsburgh is great (or at least most of it). Large, crispy, crunchy, fragile, toasty bread. The only complaint was it was corn dusted on the bottom. This makes for messy fingertips and a messy desk.

I got a steak hoagie. Four thick slices of steak and tons of browned, bubbly cheese. Very tasty. Unfortunately, they do serve their steaks Pittsburgh style....covered in lettuce and tomatoes. No biggy, I got mine without. The onions were crisp, fresh red onions. I would have prefered sauteed onions on a steak but its no big deal. They did charge me a buck for the bannana peppers, even though I left the more expensive tomatoes of my hoagie. And it appeared that they let Peter North put the mayonnaise on it, it was pretty much coated in the stuff.

Tasty hoagie though. If they would have limited the mayonnaise to a reasonable level, it would have been perfect.

Everyone else was more than pleased with their food. Fast delivery, too, even for a Saturday night.
