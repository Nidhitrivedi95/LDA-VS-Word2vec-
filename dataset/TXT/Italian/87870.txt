dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg We came here for dinner on New Year's Eve.  I was put off by the strip mall exterior.  It is a stone's throw from a KMART and a smoke shop.  The interior put my concerns to rest.  They have both a restaurant seating area as well as a lounge with coffee tables for more casual eating.  The food was very good.  It was easily better than many meals offered at higher profile restaurants on the Strip.  We ordered the Chef's choice which was a five course meal selected by Chef Marc.  The Filet Mignon and the Octopus salad were amazing.  We had three visits from Marc during the meal which was nice.  The only downside to the visit was the quality of the desserts. We were given a cheesecake and a rum cake.  They were just average and not what I expected after such superb entrees.  I would definitely come here again.  As indicated in the other reviews here, service speed is not a priority here.  But then again, this is not fast food.  If I had three hungry young children to feed, I would not come here.  However, if you are looking for a good meal to be eaten at a leisurely pace, this is a great escape from the Strip.
