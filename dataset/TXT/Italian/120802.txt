h96UFhWMM6k2xGgvmMoszg This is the best...I MEAN the BEST "penne alla vodka" I have ever tasted!!!  I even had to wake up and sneek a few bits in the middle of the night.  The owners take great pride in there food.  We also had the pizza and a sandwhich followed by wonderful desserts.  We had to bring half home only to enjoy again that night for dinner.  If you are ever in this area, this is MUST place to eat.  I am getting hungry writing this!!!
We look forward to bringing our friends and family in the future.
