jcasci3gjbsSuTEVzvDQKg Took the girls here for Mother's Day and sat on the patio, which is even more attractive with the new greenway. Unfortunately it rained so we could not take a walk after the meal. We had a reservation and were seated within 7 minutes. Excellent waitress, good food. A local favorite.
