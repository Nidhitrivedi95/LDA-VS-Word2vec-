LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Ask to be seated in Nestor's section.   He directed us to the perfect entree and wine.  I told him I wasn't very hungry and he suggested the perfect seafood and pasta dish ( seafood di mare). The best dinner I have ever had, period and I have traveled most of my career.  Service was impeccable.  I will fly to Las Vegas just to eat here.  Great Italian atmosphere and food.  And Nestor was the key!
