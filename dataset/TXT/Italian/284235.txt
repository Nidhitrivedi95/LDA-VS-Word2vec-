z8H4Mdzl4jS9pYswj6Jf9w I came here on a Friday for a work lunch.  Food was fantastic, prices were high but still less than I thought it would be and the service was great.

What I had:  sparkling water,  glass of Chianti and stuffed butternut squash ravioli.  The ravioli was a bit on the small side but absolutely delicious.  

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there website is crap.  Very difficult to find an online menu and to distinguish between there different locations.  

One thing I didn't realize until I got here was that the restaurant is located inside the Four Seasons Private Residences in Yorkville.

I won't be a regular, but will try and come back again.
