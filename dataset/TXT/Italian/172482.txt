N8ArHOgRDI8wOJIOZaEHyg Forced to go into this place w/ a group of co-workers.  Sorry, I do NOT willingly go to a restaurant to eat a freaking side salad or that insipid, totally uninspired cop-out called a "steamed veggie plate"   UGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH.  

With the exception of said freaking side salad and dry breadsticks NOTHING is vegan here.  Not even the minestrone soup (chicken broth).   Why cant corporate chefs at chains get it into their heads to specify vegetable broth for a soup FULL OF VEGGIES??????   Everywhere else, dried pasta doesn't have egg in it (only fresh pasta).  Nope, not here.  

On the other hand, I saved myself from consuming tons and tons and tons of fat and sodium :)
