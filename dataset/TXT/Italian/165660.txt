M7gB_MsmKwjSO8pk1rQ00w My first time here although I've always passed by it. I don't really understand the other reviews calling this place expensive, look at the inviting atmosphere, warm service, menu selection and quality of food.. I'd rather have something of good quality and tastes good than a large helping of subpar food. I also actually found their prices to be very decent, I left as a happy customer. I've never tried cannoli so I chose that, I got two for only $3+tax, the girl who served me made it fairly quickly so there wasn't much wait time. Other places usually sell one cannoli for that price. I noticed the price of a salad is $4, which sounds very fair to me. I'll likely be back next time to try other things on their menu.
