UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ Love this place - Pizza Muffins are the best....- updating my review 11-16-16
I have used their catering services many times - Just used them for my daughters wedding this past weekend.  Sarah and her staff were outstanding - they served Pizza Muffins for cocktail hour - received rave reviews for them - buffet line food was outstanding - they provided table service clean up efficiently and politely.
I received feedback from many, many attendees telling me how great the food and service was.
Thank you Sarah and the Floridino's team for helping make it a great night!
