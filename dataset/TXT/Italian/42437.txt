7sh1qDlGo_80zpJfFrnb4Q An excellent dinner at Giordano's Italian in Carefree.  Have not eaten here in years.  I've so been missing out. Hands down the most delicious, velvety Cavatelli Bolognese I've had in a long time.  The Mostaccioli with sausage and artichokes was also delicious.   To think, just dow the road and I'd completely forgotten about it.
