We get there, get seated rather quickly, and were being taking care of by a newbie by the name of Stephanie. all was going pretty good at first. We got our drinks, we got our appetizers, plenty of bread and then it kinda went down hill. We waited, and waited and noticed that other tables around us that came in after us were already noshing on there food, so about say 45 min later my hubby was like hmmm yea ( not all that happy) He talks to the manager (who's name I am sad to say I do not remember but it was Saturday 03.29.14) and omg he was beyond generous. He comped our entire meal (apps, drinks, food) which was not even close to what we expected. We just wanted our food because we were hungry lol. 

My hubby loved, loved, loved his sausage and peppers and I loved my pasta di mare (with white sauce instead of red). Our waitress, Stephanie, was super apologetic and we weren't really that mad, just hungry ( even though we had bread and apps) Will we come back? Of course. This not my first time at this particular location (contrary to my check in) and it won't be my last.
