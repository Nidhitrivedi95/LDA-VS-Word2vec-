vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw I'm giving it a 5 star because of the bartender, Jeska. Super nice, friendly, great humor, and great service! Ordered the Picasso salad (which came out fast! *thumbs up*) - tried ordering a small but it was freakin huge! Def enough for 3 people! I hate to waste food so def worth the $ (not that it's a lot) because of the size - it's more than enough to fill you up. However, I would still prefer a smaller size at least for a lunch time special - I would probably visit more often. Ordered a kiltlifter and it was ICY cold just the way a beer should be! First time to this location and have to say I prefer it over the Tempe location.... 
So, great job Jeska & kitchen staff for the great service! Kudos to you for making my experience top notch!
