pvCcrHFAGCml492qoQBsQg Disappointing. With good reviews and coming recommended from a friend, I had high expectations for Ricci's even though I am always cautious about Italian food (I love Italian food but bad Italian food is very very common.) 

I ordered the gnocchi and upgraded the sauce to their pescatore (seafood) sauce for $3 extra. I knew this price meant the "shrimp, calamari, and clams" offered wouldn't be plentiful but I did not expect to find precisely one mini shrimp in my dish. The calamari also seemed to be of suspect quality. 

The tomato sauce itself was just not good. It wasn't terrible but I'd expect better from an Italian joint in Woodbridge. It seemed Canadianized. 

Also, once I ordered it took over 15 minutes for my dish to arrive. This would be acceptable in a restaurant but with the set up they had, I expected a quicker lunch. In fact, I had to pack most of my dish to go because I had to get back to work. 

The decor was nice and as I saw panzerottis pass by I thought to myself that I definitely ordered the wrong thing. Part of me wants to give them another chance to try the panzo but another part says there's tons of Italian joints in Woodbridge so why go back to one that's disappointed you before?
