VEusQnnMJW6e8wuiW2_H0Q Well, I had ordered from Portofino's since I received one of their menus in the mail.  I'm new to the Crafton area so finding my go to pizza place is a must.  I try to find the best of the best wherever I go so when I moved to Crafton, the search was on.  I had tried a couple places before discovering Portofino's...I didn't realize they were the place I had passed by many times prior to moving here...very convenient spot off Steuben St.  So, when I got the menu in the mail, I decided to try it.  I ordered an Antipasto Salad, which I've grown very fond of...it's the ham, salami And cheese that bring it over the top.  I had gotten the pretzel bites, which, for the price were a little short on size and portion...but good.  I had gone to Supremo's Pizzeria in Ross Twp, and their pretzel bites are, sorry to say, better.  But I ordered a hot Italian hoagie which the bread was crisp on the outside but soft on the inside, with a good portion of meats and cheese.  I ordered a pizza too and actually was very happy with the size and portion.  The toppings were plenty and the crust was crisp and not droopy like some other places.  The only disappointment was that my most recent order, I ordered a bottle of Diet Coke, and t didn't come with my order...can't eat pizza without a soda (pop).  I can't bring myself to call it pop...I'm not from Pittsburgh originally, so I call it soda.  Crafton has a several choices for pizza, but do give this place a try...I like it...
