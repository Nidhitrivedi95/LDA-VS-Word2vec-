klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw Breakfast! So yummy! Potatoes are AMAZE-balls. Like, if you go in with a hangover (pretty likely in Vegas), expect to eat A LOT. They soak up the alcohol so nicely and are just freaking bomb.

I always get some yummy egg white omelets to complement my grease - the Gruyere they use is delicious, and I stuff that puppy full of all the vegetable offerings available. 

Allegedly there is a guy that comes around with bloody marys but I actually never saw him the last time we were here. Stuck with champagne / mimosas for my hair-of-the-dog choice.

OMG the bread is to die for as well.

Service is a bit slow, I think because they are always packed. But we always come here for breakfast when staying at the Wynn/Encore and are never disappointed :)
