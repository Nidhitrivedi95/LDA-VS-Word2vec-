Vx5WtgU6YK83xCy2feLJ6A I always went to Fired Pie on I-17 & 101 shopping center, when this location opened I was thrilled! Unfortunately the first time I tried it, my pizza was borderline burnt. I went back today to give it another try...when I walked in, nobody said hello or acknowledged I was there. Not a single employee smiled or seemed to have any personality. My pizza was yet again, burnt. My two stars are because this place truly have potential to improve, but as of right now, I won't be back anytime soon. 
It might be good for this location to take notes from the I-17 & 101 location on customer service and correct pizza cooking.
