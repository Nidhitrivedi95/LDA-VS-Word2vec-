u_s0zWoTlX7PoYDjtKAK2w Very rude. First time I went customer service was horrible and they were very rude but food was good so I gave them a second chance just now. The man on phone was extremely rude. When I asked what pizza specials they had he said call back when you know what you want, go and look at Facebook and call back. I couldn't easily find their online menu. Sad because their food is good but service sucks. Good luck on running that kind of a business. Crazy.
