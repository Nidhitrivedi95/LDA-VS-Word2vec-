MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg Finally, amazing Italian food on the SouthWest side of town!! 
Ordered the Pizza Piccante - Italian sausage, spicy broccoli rabe, mozzarella 
And Angry Sicilian Sub - Prosciutto, capicola, soppressata, mortadella, mozzarella, red peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, red wine vinegar and oregano.
Their home-made mozzarella is mouthwatering!
The owner Glen is super nice and friendly. He mentioned that many of their products are made in house from scratch. I'm curious to try their fried boloney next.
