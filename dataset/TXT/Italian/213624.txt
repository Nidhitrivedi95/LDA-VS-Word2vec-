I Never Intended to Eat here, but My Nephew Forced Me to Go in with Him, LOL! The Eatery is a Little Small, and has Limited Seating, but there is/are Outdoor Seating for those Absolutely Gorgeous Days in Vegas! The Counter Person is Very Pleasant, and Friendly to Talk to, The Specials Board is on the Right Side of the Eatery, Close to the Order Counter! There are 2 TV's for your Viewing Pleasure! 

The Food is Very Hot & Very Good...
Garlic Knots- Enough for 2 People, Comes to You Hot and Buttery with the Marinara Dipping Sauce.

Pizza- the Small Size, Again Enough for 2-3, Cheese is Gooey & Stringy, Very Tasty (Just How I Like it) not Greasy, or Soggy like some Places! 5.99

Chicken Wings- Comes with French Fries & a Drink for 6.99. Crispy & Tasty! I Ordered the Garlic Parmesan....Yum!! 

Free Refills on the Soda Machine! 

They do have Lunch Specials, They Do have Take Out! 
This Eatery is on the South East Part of Vegas on Maryland Parkway, in the Albertsons/ 24 Hour Fitness Shopping Complex! It's a Little hard to find,..Just look for 24 Hr. Fitness and it's Across the Parking lot, next to Teriyaki Madness!
