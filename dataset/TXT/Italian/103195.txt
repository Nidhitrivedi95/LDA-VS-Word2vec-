FmraE2CWt65VRnEqCAqNEg Came here on Friday night with a pretty big group. They were very nice to let us use their party room since our group grew beyond the number of our original reservation (26).  

Service was great. There was only one guy serving our whole crew. He did awesome at keeping drinks full and checking in on us for other needs. It felt like he had a whole staff helping him when it was just himself working our section. 

Food was pretty good too. The fish and chips looked great! I will try that next time. 
I got the fried egg burger. Cook was nice (mid rare) and fries were great. My only complaint is that the egg is cooked over medium and there was not much yoke.  In my opinion, it should have been over easy so that the yoke pours out when cut into. 

I also tried the chips and dip. Great home cooked chips with onion dip. Great flavors and textures. 

The carne asada nachos were very tasty. Not Mexican in any way, but very good. There was a sweetness to the nachos and they were also a little spicy. 

Just as we were getting leave, a band showed up. Turns out that they have live music on Friday nights. 

Parking is scarce, so get here early to get a spot.
