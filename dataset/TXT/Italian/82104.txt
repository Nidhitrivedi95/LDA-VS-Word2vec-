DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw We will never visit Las Vegas without dining at this restaurant, in fact I joined my husband on a business trip to Vegas just to eat here.  Truly authentic Italian food, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. We loved the homemade italian sausage, homemade ravioli and osso bucco to name a few. The service is some of the best we've ever had and the owner is very friendly.
