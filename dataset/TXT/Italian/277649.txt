YIW9EccX6isxy5NE6D5wSQ Was good while it lasted, not sure about ordering a pickup meal but the hot table food was always very good. I knew it was cheap for a $6.00 veal / chicken sandwich and the $10.00 lunch special where always filling! As far as licking figures while working, I've never seen that. I was happy to see that they used the sink after handling money to wash hand and serve the next person. I gave them a four star because not all staff are the same but the owner did try her best! Now closed permanently, paper in the window maybe the new owners can turn it into a gold mine. One complaint would be pizza wasn't big slices like next door.
