By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g After leaving the restaurant with our group of 9 we would have given them 4 stars... But as the night...and next day progressed any one who ate the Beef Carpaccio would  have given them a 1.

The value and the food was wonderful. The ambience would have great if they hadn't put us outside of the restaurant with loud hipsters and clubbers walking past us and bumping into the railings.

The pizzas were wonderful and the food is easy to share. It is unfortunate that many of us got sick (I am still sick 3 days later) from the beef carpaccio.
