kz7O0_o6WrDQk1Kl8dKeHQ My wife and I wanted to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary with style boy were we disappointed 
We chose stock and stable because we had heard good things via word of mouth.
The service was very forgettable, we sat the bar and were left alone for what seemed like forever before she acknowledged our existence.....
I ordered the cheeseburger and it was less than tasty. Very well done not to my liking. My wife ordered the Arugula salad and was please with it. 
Our drinks...... when they came ......I was again let down!
I ordered the "some like it hot" and it wasn't very tasty.
I was told it was a very popular drink,  maybe it's just me but I didn't care for it. 
My wife's wine was fine.... Can't mess up wine I suppose.......
All in all it was forgettable experience. I'll probably give this place one last shot , because I believe in second chances just ask my wife!
