yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg We have walked by the Italian grotto hundreds of times, looked at the menu and never went in.This weekend my girlfriend and I decided she needed a Back East fix. 
First she made me go to grimaldis for a thirty dollar pizza,it was good.the next  night she wanted really good Italian food.we parked in old Scottsdale, and talked about several places before we walked by the Italian Grotto,we finally decided to go in ,after 16 years of walking past it.We were met by Gary the owner of 36 years,all New York, and all personality.my girlfriend Cathy felt like she was in New York.everything we ordered, the tomato garlic bread,the salad ,pasta and tiramisu were the best. We absolutely loved the people and the food, we live in Kingman and have had a place in Scottsdale for the last 40 years,we know most of the best restaurants, sorry it took so long to find Gary and the Italian Grotto, we will be faithful patrons!
