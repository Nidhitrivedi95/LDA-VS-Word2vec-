Cg3sK4ptre1uPPCzPWH1aw Well, we waited about 15 min to be seated. We got served by "Nasim" . We got the deal for 11.99 pasta plats.
The complementary bread was so fresh and yummy, was a good start. 
We had then our salad, was not great but was fine. We also had a tomato soup, was so delious and special.
Our pasta plate was very good. I really had a very good experience, our servant was very friendly, helpful, and smily. She was not bothered for our request. 
I recommand this place, and happy with my visit.
