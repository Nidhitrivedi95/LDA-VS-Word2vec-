TFftsYkRIUtdo6ZhRwJ2lQ The best thing about Terroni is probably the impossibly fresh chopped chillis that they serve as an accompaniment to their pizzas and pastas.  As for the pizza, it was alright.  We were about to leave the line that went out the door when we were called for an upstairs table.  We were served by a harassed waiter (probably not his fault for his I'm-cooler-than-you-attitude as he was incredibly busy).  In retrospect, it was kind of funny that I almost mangled the pizza trying to cut it with my dull dining knife as it comes whole, with a tough crust, on a slippery ceramic plate.
