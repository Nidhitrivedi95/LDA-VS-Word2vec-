dLRJhdnelmOXRa3WeeTbnQ We were in the area and wanted to grab some dinner. We absolutely could not believe $2.95 for a pepsi and the same for iced tea. $6.00 for 2 beverage! Salads do not come with the meal and still ordered. Simple lettuce and some onions with their homemade italian dressing. The garlic bread does not come out before the meal.. yet it was prob worth the wait as it was really good. Hubby ordered pasta with plain tomato sauce. He had to order 2 meatballs on the side.. I had ordered gnochi with plain tomato sauce. The sauce was really good. there was way too much sauce to ea dinner.  Overall very average and the bathroom is on the outside of the building.I really wanted to love this place. We will try and come back to try the pizza.
