hX3qKoTnpzxTGiPuO2YVTQ I liked the salad.  Ordered the basic for $10 decided to just order it as it comes.  No dressing on the side or any changes and it came out, nearly perfect. Maybe a bit too much dressing for my liking and that's why I'm giving them 4 stars.  

I did get a side of crispy fried calamari which was surprisingly a good portion considering this is what I would call modern airport food, I was impressed.  Gone are the days of the old 70's and 80's style cafeteria when I would have to order up the rice pudding as part of the airports god awful food tradition that I had.  You can now order good food!

And this is what I found here while waiting for my delayed flight from my original booking that I got bumped off of.  Pssst the food is good but Air Canada sucks!  What's with all those delayed flights this week and overbooked planes and no service?  
Glad I got decent service here before I get on a plane with a bunch of grumpy airline people.
