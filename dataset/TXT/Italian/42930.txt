I went there today with my brother for a brunch. We took the Chef board and the daily bruchettas and couple of glasses of wine. The presentation of the food is really nice and the taste as well (I love there abricots mustard! ). Since the summer is here we were able to eat outside with there beautiful patio. We will be back and we hope the service will be better.
