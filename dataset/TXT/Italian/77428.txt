cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA A home run. Located in the old Krispy creme location. This place is friendly and a helpful staff you are allowed to place your order outside by a ordertaker with a tables the Waite was 35 minutes outside. But our pizza was cooking while we were waiting. By the time we got to our table it only took a additional 10 minutes very efficient. We ordered a deep dish 12 in wow great crust plentiful cheese and sausage also the sauce was just right not too much just right. Our server was very helpful and told us about the history of the crust. 
 The price was solo reasonable a great value.
More seating is needed. Also instead of people waiting outside by the door I would take advantage of the outdoor patio serving appetizers and drinks just a fyi.
