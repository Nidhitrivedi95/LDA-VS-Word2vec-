JH3zKlfslbSVeA_KsAaRRQ I agree wholeheartedly with Jordan T - everything about the Splendido experience is impressive. From the quality of the food, to the calibre of the service, to the atmosphere in the dining room - it's really, really ridiculously good.

Sure, it's expensive but it's the kind of place where you get what you pay for - a great choice for a special occasion.
