8cQc0BRbkSDSkLn6oFw3mw We love this place! The breakfast is homemade fresh and hot. The service is always great and very welcoming. My fiancé and I always try new places but end up back at good old Nicks. A couple times we had off days the food was just ok but it still nocked most places out of the water. Way to go Nicks we love ya
