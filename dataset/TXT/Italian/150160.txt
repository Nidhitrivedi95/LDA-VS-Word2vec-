KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ I've been here twice now, but I just can't help mustering up anything more than lukewarm feelings for this place. 

We went for a family style kind of dinner and got to sample a few more menu items than we normally would: bruschetta, caprese, osso bucco, chicken sciarapello, meatballs, and some desserts. I will confess that the meatballs were awesome, but that's about as enthusiastic as I'll get. Everything else was just kind of meh and left me craving some good Italian food. 

I will say that while the food was just okay, the service was great. We loved our waiter - he was attentive, made great recommendations, and was really funny.
