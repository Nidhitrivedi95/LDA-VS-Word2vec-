MjAuGkgPjNLyMrN74_0YbA Lovely, this is one of the nicest establishments I have eaten at. I don't think we have old classic restaurants like Johnny's Downtown. I came with 7 people and we were definitely the youngest folks in the place until a family with kids came. 

I had the petit filet  with crab gratin, Medium rare 6 oz filet cooked perfectly. We all shared the pork stuffed banana peppers and the fig, goat cheese crostini.  

My only complaint is that service seemed to take awhile. Some of my friends were late in  coming, but it seemed that the slowed down  service was intentional.
