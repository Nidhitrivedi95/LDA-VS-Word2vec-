sKy8HkP6X-8dCKq_SzeIpw We went around 830pm and ordered some food to carry out. My husband and I both bought a drink at the bar. The one bartender was doing his best from what I could tell, with no other employees insight except an "of the clock" employee still in his uniform drinking at the bar. The off the clock employee kept stepping in to "help" despite loudly asking what the legal drinking limit was. He was clearly way over it. They bartender called  this other employee "David". This was entirely unprofessional. My husband and I waited 1 hour and 48 minutes for our food (a 12 inch pizza and an order of chicken tenders). When we got back home we realized what a mistake waiting had been. 3 small chicken tenders cost us nearly $7!? And the pizza (prosciutto arugula) was bland and mostly uncovered on the top (1/3 cheese and toppings, 2/3 bland burnt crust). You left one person on to man the whole place on a Saturday night? In downtown Mesa? The poor busy bartender! It's just irresponsible of the scheduler. Lost our business for absolute certain. 2 hours is too long to wait for terrible food.
