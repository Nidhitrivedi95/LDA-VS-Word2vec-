8yoe08nCUpjDQ56Y9qVPKg I see that we all agree that the service is terrible here.  Who has a business and treats their customers like crap???? Really??? This should be appropriately renamed HOT DOG HELL!!!!!! We all just need to boycott this business by not patronizing it so that he is forced to close.  
We visited here once and there was a guy that was very nice and that's why we returned.  When we returned there was another guy who was beyond rude. They don't use gloves so you know the guy is not washing his hands and handling the food.  Yuck!  The thought of it just makes me sick.  We won't be back that's for sure.   Nasty in all respects!!
