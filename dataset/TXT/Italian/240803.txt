UFn1moo95-PBzi9wWt5FGg 6 month update...So I decided to try this restaurant again and once again I ran into the same problem I ordered pepperoni lover and the pizza did not have enough pepperoni or cheese for that matter and the flavor was definitely lacking once again service what's quick but the pizza is sub par. I want order no more.
