9UX9_Vec2gxrrHvBjdzXgQ Just came back from a weekend visit to Toronto and I made it a point to stop by the Distillery district to have lunch when we stumbled upon this restaurant. It's a really nice looking restaurant and on a Friday afternoon it was practically empty. My friend ordered the gnocchi (which he said was good) and I ordered the spicy sausage penne pasta which was good but nothing to write home about. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it. There were about 4 or 5 small pieces of sausage in my pasta. I'll give them credit for the really attentive service we received.
