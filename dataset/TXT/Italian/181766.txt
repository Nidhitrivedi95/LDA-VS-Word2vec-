O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ If you're looking for authentic Italian ambience and food, look no further. Sassi is a huge venue with multiple rooms, which can be rented for catered events, and the food and wine were delightful. At night the whole venue is softly lit with candles and fire pits.  The walls are painted soft colors of Tuscany, with ironwork chandeliers and sconces. Highly recommend for a romantic dinner or group gathering.
