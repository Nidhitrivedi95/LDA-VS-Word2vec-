I primarily do take out from here because it's so easy to order and pay online. They also have a mobile app. There's even a super convenient take out door that's completely separate from the restaurant. You know what that means, your girl is picking up her food in sweatpants.

App-wise, we always order the chili queso dip. It may sound odd to get at an Italian place, but it's delicious. My go to pizza here is the Elizabeth Special (Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Bell Peppers, White Onions) and I always add jalapenos. I also like their Penne Spinach Portabella. I love the spicy gorgonzola sauce and the drizzled balsamic on top. Right now, my current obsession is their Philly Cheesesteak. Anything smothered in melty cheese and chipotle mayo wins in my book. 

Kids eat free on Tuesdays, half price bottles of wine on Sundays. They also have a gluten free menu.
