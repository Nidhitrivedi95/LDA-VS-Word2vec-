w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q What a lovely restaurant.  We started with the beef carpaccio which was so tender. Caprese Salad as an appetizer and we each had a New York strip which was cooked medium as requested and quote flavorful.  

I enjoyed a Paloma which was perfect.  Key lime pie for dessert.  I would definitely recommend The Palm. We will be back.
