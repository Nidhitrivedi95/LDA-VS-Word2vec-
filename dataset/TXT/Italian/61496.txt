AYLxEeVq8NKG2UhcBiggrA Well I finally came here as the rave for this spot continues !!
There was 8 of us in the group and everyone got a different Pizza , so I thought let me try a Pasta dish I got the chorizo stuffed ravioli .
Well that was a mistake . Stick with the pizza cause the pizza here is Fantastic !!!!! I'm serious the pizza is worth coming for ! I wish I didn't get the pasta as I wasn't a fan at all and Neither was anyone in our party who tried the dish .
HOWEVER ....the waitress was very nice and took Care of the situation for me and offered to get me something else . Excellent service ! 
So in the end the Service  is great , the staff is very friendly and nice , the Pizza is Fantastic !!! Actually that's an understatement it's amazing !!! the atmosphere is nice , and modern ! Check them out for sure !
