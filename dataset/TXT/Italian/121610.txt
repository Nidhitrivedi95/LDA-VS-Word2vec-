hcHaWzM5wfdAbCWs4zmmqg I really enjoyed my experience at Nodo. The staff were very nice and knowledgeable. I had the cacio e pepe with pear and walnuts and it was super good. The others in my party had pizzas and they looked and smelled amazing. There are a few other dishes that I have my eye on, so I will be sure to revisit! 

Pasta la Vista, baby!!
