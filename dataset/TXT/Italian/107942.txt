FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A I ordered a chicken Alfredo with mushrooms. It was okay. Compared to the other location on Warm Springs and Durango, this one seemed stingy with their ingredients. I also upgraded it to the mangia and it barely had chicken and mushroom. Not a fan of Mac Shack's chicken in general, something about it is off, maybe a little too dry for me. The flavor wasn't as strong as I'd like it to be, maybe the penne was too thick, I don't know. They are pretty fast with service and friendly so this is the place to go for something quick and mediocre. Their garlic bread is free when you check in thank goodness because it's definitely not worth $2. Probably will give them another shot, but not any time soon.
