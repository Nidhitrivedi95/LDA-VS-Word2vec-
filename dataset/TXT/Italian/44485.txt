8Cny1-SYxd8vtgmBFFSJYA This restaurant is a little out of the way, which is perfect so it doesn't get the pass-by crowd. Since this was an "Apportez votre vin" (AVV - and apparently one of the few in the near downtown area), the costs were very fair and the food was excellent. The night we went, the owner, I think, was a one man show but was very amiable and amusing. If we had stumbled onto this place earlier in our stay, we would have returned.
