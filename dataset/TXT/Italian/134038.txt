IqH-J1D0HIP9wyJs2q_uGQ My boyfriend and I decided to have a late cheat night (around 11pm). We reluctantly ordered from this place knowing we were probably going to be disappointed because of past experiences and friends who warned us. We definitely were. We ordered a small Margherita add spicy sausage and pepperoni knots to go. We wanted a dinner salad to share and dessert as well but they weren't serving that stuff at the time (Which is odd to me on a Friday night when you're open til 3am...). Anyways, we finally get the pizza and knots home (we live about 3 minutes drive away) both the pizza and knots were cold, the knots were over cooked and burnt and the pizza was a sloppy mess of cold cheese, cold sauce and NO sausage. We were charged for the sausage that was not on the pizza as well. This is definitely not the best pizza in Charlotte, far from it. We will not be returning. Save yourself the money and go somewhere decent.
