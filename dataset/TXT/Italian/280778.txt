There are fancy Italian restaurants in suburbs that people rave about, but when pressed (or tried first hand) the food is never very interesting, e.g., pasta, red wine - things like gnocchi or pesto are exotic to these people.  

Now take Lombardino's.  When you walk in it clearly doesn't look like a suburban white linen restaurant - this is far more real, and without the snoot.  Well-crafted (and well-conceived) salads.  Mussels or scallops, not just steamed or seared and plopped down, but built up with nine other ingredients that contrast and complement.  Chilled soups.  Same idea with the pastas and entrees.  The desserts are necessarily less complex in a fantastic way.  Look at the menu on their website lombardinos.com - it's all true.  AND the menu changes regularly.  

The wine list works very well, and the servers have always seemed happy to talk about options (in a knowledgeable way, about the food, too), grant tastes, etc.  The cocktails have always been very well done as well, and I recently tasted a campari-based creation of their own that came off brilliantly (if you've had campari, you know this takes knack).

If you like food, you'll like this place.  If you love food and think you have an adventurous or sophisticated palate, you'll love this place.
