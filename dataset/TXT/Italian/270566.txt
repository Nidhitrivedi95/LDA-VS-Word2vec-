XmxRXzCFkzQK23kkHgUgLA We were looking for a happy hour after doing some shopping and Wink 24 fit the bill perfectly. $5 apps and a Bellini featuring a delightful sorbet from the Gelato Spot.  The wood-fired pizzas are small, but shareable, and feature a crisp, thin crust. 

Isaac, our server, was attentive, knowledgeable, and made an excellent recommendation to order the Cucumber Basil Martini. He helped to turn a delicious meal into a very enjoyable experience. 

The décor is eclectic and modern, and I look forward to returning again in the near future.
