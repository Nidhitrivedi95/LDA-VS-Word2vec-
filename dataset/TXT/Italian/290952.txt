zxsktAMsVBKj2PvvCV11UQ I visited during restaurant week and while the food was good, the drinks were so-so and the restaurant was about 1,000 degrees.

We tried the (award winning) sea bass cake, eggplant napoleon, she crab soup, sea bass entree (which I understand is on their regular menu and is fantastic), and filet. The one negative on the entrees was the flavorless julienne vegetables with the entrees, but I am guessing those were just for restaurant week? I would hope. Desserts of lavender creme brulee (though more than a little burnt) and raspberry cheesecake were good.

We tried a few cocktails, none of which were great. A simple cocktail (vodka/soda with a splash of grapefruit) took about 15 minutes to receive and because of the heat, all the ice was just about melted once it made it to the table. 

Overall, the food was good and service was fine, but I can't imagine why they didn't notice sweaty diners and do something about it before we mentioned something at dessert.
