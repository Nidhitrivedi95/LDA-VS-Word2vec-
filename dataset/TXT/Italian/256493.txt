w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q I'll be quick: The food was great...except for the steak and the clams we ordered as appetizer.  I really enjoyed the bread (yes, i know it's free, but it's important) and the mashed potatoes and the mushroom sides were out of this world yummy yummy yummy.  The service was very good - the waiter was nice and helpful, he cut up our steak in two and brought it on separate plates (since we were splitting).  We ordered only one glass of wine, trying to keep the price down, but it was brought out in a little decanter and was enough for two full glasses - it worked out great!  The only thing - our steak was a bit overcooked (16oz sirloin at $40), but that maybe because they misunderstood our desire for medium as a medium well....  The clams oregano were a bit too oily and bread crumby.  In general, it was a good experience with large portions. (Price: $100 approx for one glass of wine, appetizer, $40 steak entree, 2 sides)
