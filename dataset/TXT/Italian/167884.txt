mJ_ucQ2_3hfTsmCcKb-hgw This is probably one of my favorite places in town. Have been here many times and never had anything I didn't like. My favorites are the meatballs and flatbread. It's nice that there is valet parking after 6. You really have to plan ahead if you want reservations for weekends. Service is good and prices are reasonable.
