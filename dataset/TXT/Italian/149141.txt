Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA My boyfriend and I tried this place on Saturday. We were having drinks at Blvd. Cocktail (nice atmosphere, typical over priced drinks) when we noticed a pizza place across the way that seemed incredibly busy. We had to try it, considering my boyfriend is from New York and is fairly particular about finding a good pizza place in town. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. They were only partially open so you had to order from a convenient To-Go area outside. We ended up paying about 8 bucks for just 2 slices of plain cheese and no drink. 

Overall the pizza was great, had a nice crunch to the crust and most importantly to me, was not overly greasy. I enjoy my fair share of greasy pizzas (Secret Pizza at the Cosmo comes to mind), so this was a nice alternative. The atmosphere of The Linq seems really chill so far. We bar hopped and talked to a few bartenders who said it's been mostly locals coming to check it out. The colorful fountain is a perfect spot to enjoy a slice. I hope this place sticks around.
