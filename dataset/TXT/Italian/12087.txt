0URIvKxCNT-AVgtdYFAX8w Harley's is the kinda place i imagine my Italian grandmother would run. that is, if i was Italian and if i had a grandmother who ran such an amazing place. a girl can dream, right? from the decor of the restaurant to the richness and portion size of food, everything screams comfort! it's definately not the place to go if you're counting calories. you could get full on the bread alone. and i love how they secure your box of leftovers with about 10 layers of saran wrap. your fridge doesn't end up smelling like italian food, and when you go to eat the leftovers, it's like opening a present. thanks grandma!
