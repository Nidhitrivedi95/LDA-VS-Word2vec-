UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ My wife and I love going to this restaurant.  The risotto entree is fantastic, and the fried calamari app is one of my favorites.  Service is always good and the atmosphere is really nice.  Prices are steep so I don't get to eat here often, although I would if they had better lunch specials.  They do have happy hour deals but I can't usually take advantage of them.
