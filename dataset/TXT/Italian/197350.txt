ppwYJPfE0tpSJA9X8l54cQ Love that this place is right around the corner from the house.  We have ordered the special a few times and its definitely enough to feed our family of four.  The staff is very friendly.  People complain the pizza is "limp" and I guess they never had pizza in NY before.  i think the pizza is very tasty.   We get our wings from here now that Buffalo Wild Wings is closed and they are very good wings though their hot isn't really that hot.  Will be back!
