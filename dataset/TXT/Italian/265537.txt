wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw After I left my first review of my first visit to Postino's I was highly disappointed but want to give an update. The management team of Postino's promptly responded to my negative review with humility and offered an apology with zero excuses. They also went out of their way and offered to have my husband and I back, if we accepted, on the house. I found that very professional because of the many fans they do have, my one negative review was not going to ruin their business, however, none of that seemed relevant to them and they wanted to make it right for all customers. My second visit was great, went with a girl-friend for some of their famous bruschetta, which we loved, and the service was great as well. I'm thankful for the management team of Postino's going out of their way to make it right for their customers, it shows what they really value most and how they want their business to be viewed as. I will definitely be back and appreciate the accommodations I've received from Postino's.
