DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw Came to eat at Siena tonight and I was blown away with how nice this restaurant is . They have an amazing relaxing lounge area with a very reasonable happy hour . The foot tasted amazing and I could tell everything was fresh . But over all the best thing about my experience was the service . My server LiLi was the icing on the cake . She was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu . Thanks for an unforgettable experience LiLi . I'll definitely be recommending this place to friend !
