HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A It is obvious why this restaurant is so highly rated and popular with the locals.........quality and excellent recipes.

The grilled veggie plate was perfect, the veggies were all still warm, and the garlic marinated peppers were so good.

The seafood salad was traditional and incredibly well cooked....meaning the squid/prawns/scallops were barely cooked thru so they stayed tender. Dressing was perfect balance of evoo and lemon with lots of micro-greens/celery/capers. It was a very large order enough for 4 to share as an appetizer.

The spaghetti bolognese was excellent, as good as I have had in a long time. I am an Italian chef and make this dish several ways and generally don't think much of most bolognese sauce in most restaurants because it is just not that great....often good but not great. This sauce neared perfection. What was amazing was they split it for us and came out with two large pasta bowls filled. The order was huge, great value for sure.

Our waiter Vince was excellent, so friendly and enjoyed talking cucina italiano well after they closed. Kudos to such good service.

We will be back.
