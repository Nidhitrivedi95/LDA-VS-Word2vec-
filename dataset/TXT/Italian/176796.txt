nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow Was disappointed the last night when we went here. Daughter ordered half order of the fettuccini alfredo the bowl was so full you it was hard to eat, it would be better in a bigger bowl so that you can have space for the fettuccini, she barely ate, I tried and was not impressed we did not even take this home. I had the cavatelli with meatsauce, not impressed either not the best tasting, have had better down the street. I hope the next time we go here it has improved.
