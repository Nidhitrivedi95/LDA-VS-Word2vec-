BQqwIYQuo2W94smjrBjy5g This is more of a 4 1/2 star review, but I love local restaurants....and all around, we had a very satisfying dinner experience so I bumped it up.

First thing I noticed was the ambiance. Dimmed lighting with Sinatra music playing in the background.....gives me that whole Chicago/New York vibe. We told our waiter this was our first time here and he gave us a quick run of the menu, specials of the day and some of their popular items. 

I ordered the beef and cheese tortellini and my boyfriend got the veal vesuvio. We both were highly pleased with our entrees. Food came out pippin hot and portions were plentiful. Enough for leftovers too. We will definitely be returning...there were other entrees I wanted to try...like the Chicken Parm or the Carbonara Della Nonna.

FYI, restaurant is closed Mondays so plan accordingly. Smaller sized restaurant so you may have to make a reservation if you're planning to come with a big party.
