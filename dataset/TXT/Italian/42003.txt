7PRse3yCQbEprAj1DWrEQQ Dish has always been one of my restaurants in Pittsburgh. Their menu changes often and never disappoints. Just recently we celebrated two birthdays in my family with dinner here and had such a wonderful meal. Our server was attentive, fun and friendly which always makes for an enjoyable experience. We had the meatballs and calamari for appetizers - both excellent choices. The prosciutto wrapped veal was cooked perfectly and the rigatoni with smoked mozzarella I had was delicious! Thank you, Dish for another great meal. With all of the new spots in town I still love visiting those tried and true favorites!
