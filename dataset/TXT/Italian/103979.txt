FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA I've officially been to all three Postino locations. This restaurant has to be one of my favorites in AZ thus far. The bruschetta is to die for, the salads fresh and light, and of course, the wine never fails. This location is much like the Gilbert location in terms of ambiance and crowd. Cool decor and even cooler coed restrooms =]
