S2eGygYWQB2yyb3-neKTlw Haven't been to 7 numbers in about a year.  As I wrote in my last review, this restaurant is one of my faves.  I've been coming here for almost a decade.  For shit's and giggle's I checked out the Yelp reviews to see if there were any changes.  A number of Yelper's gave a low rating due to poor service.

Here's my story from tonight:

Arrived at 6:30 knowing we would need to be out of there by 8:00.  In my mind 90 minutes is enough time to have a good meal, a couple drinks and enjoy the company of good people (in this case, my wife. Ahhhhh).  It was pretty quiet when we arrived so we got great attention, ordered a beer and glass of wine and let our server know we would have the family meal ($34 each).  All good, great vibes, the salads (3) and calamari came out and was on point.  So far so good.  Next were the pasta's (3) and they were also as good as I remembered.  Well seasoned (some Yelper's commented on this) and very tasty.  Our protein, wife braised lamb and me the meatballs, was supposed to be next.  Somewhere in here everyone showed up at once.  So I get it.  Suddenly everyone from the servers to the chefs are now in the weeds.  And all I wanted was just a little attention, let me know the next course is coming....but nada.  So, at 7:55 I let the waiter know we had to go and we would take the rest of our meal to go, along with the bill.

We were having a really good time and then it all went so sideways.  We were fine with it and understanding that timing did us in BUT STILL, recognizing the issue and being even a little apologetic would have gone such a long way.

Perhaps other Yelper's are right or maybe this was a one-off.  We'll try again before making writing this place off.  Down to 3/5 stars from 4.
