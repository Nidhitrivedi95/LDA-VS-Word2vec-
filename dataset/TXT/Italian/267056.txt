xAuRUPj5p04uvj5WRYa9Xg Great small restaurant! Had a late lunch here with lobster ravioli and rose wine. The service was quick and so nice. The food came out right away with bread. The sidewalk tables were pleasant with constant traffic walking by for good people watching. I would recommend this place if you're in the mood for Italian.
