wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q We arrived with a  large party and was assured they could handle us all. The first batch of food started coming out about an hour and ten minutes after ordering. And continued to come out in small 2 or 3 plate batches for the next 45 minutes. They brought the young kids food last out of all the meals.  Only part of my food came to the table. II was told the potatoes would be coming right out. Right out must mean after the check has arrived and we had paid the bill.  Our waiter was nice but was over loaded. And to top it off he was surrounded by rude employees who refused to help him out. Pretty sad for a chain restaurant really.
