iL2-xJ4-eMsJk88PsbivbQ We love pizza and we know a good pie when we eat one and this is really a good pizza. We found it on Yelp as we were looking for an east coast type of pizza. We are from NJ and have pizza at home once a week. We know all the pizza places in middlesex county & beyond in NJ. We like our pizza thin crust, crispy bottom with a good sauce and real cheese and we found it here. Shannon the waitress is very friendly and provides good service and best of all we found out she is originally from NJ about 10 miles from where we are from. We also had the Cesar salad & it too was good the croutons were very good. If you like NY style pizza this is the place to go.
