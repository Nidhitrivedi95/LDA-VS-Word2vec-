zFnPRtP7LGvr3sfxvy_dfg Been here several times over the past three years and it's steadily declined in service and quality. I will say i was cheerfully greeted and several people apologized for the wait (which wasn't long for a Friday night, and didn't bother us at all). However, our sever was lackluster to put it best and I don't think he smiled even once! That's fine though, what really stunk was my calzone- undercooked and raw :( I had them put it back in the oven for a bit which did the trick, but our server just gave a casual "sorry" and that was it. I've never had a problem with taste and atmosphere until this recent visit- sadly, I don't think I'll be coming back for a while.
