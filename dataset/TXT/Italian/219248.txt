sa1ZAswk7kEQfg9Mb6iQwQ The atmosphere of this place is insane!! It's like someone put a cute little Italian home in between two flower shops and then turned it into a cute little restaurant & bar. I can't say enough about how friggin cute this place is.

I got the lamb gnocchi and it was FANTASTIC! I went with a couple people and we all got something different so we could try a bit of each other's food. Let me tell you, this shit is SO good. If you like Italian food, you MUST try this place.
