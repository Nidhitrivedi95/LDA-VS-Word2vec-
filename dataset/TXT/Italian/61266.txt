aYjZc-3aVbPIPaJgGiUK_A After reading a few favorable reviews of Nostrano, I'm convinced they were written by friends or family of the owner.  The remodeling is very nice although there was nothing done to address the terrible acoustics in the room.  

Our appetizers were very good (Risotto w/ Pears and the Sampler platter) but rather pricey at $13-16 per. for these was too much.  From here it went down hill quickly.  My wife ordered the squash filled cannelloni.  They were rather skimpy and served on a very large plate which made them seem even smaller.  The flavor was so-so.  No salad, veggies or bread served with these either.  My entree was the Crispy Chicken Thigh for $17.  The single thigh was cooked earlier in the week and reheated before serving.  It was served with some greens on the plate - not worth the price.  Not a value at half the price.  This has to be the first Italian restaurant I've been to where there was no bread served!!!  Major disappointment.

Madison diners are spoiled with some good restaurants in the area.  Lombardino's sets the bar pretty high and Francesca's is pretty good too.  However, if Nostrano does not get it's act together and improve the entrees and how they are served, they won't be around long.

We will not return.
