Tacky hostess staff.  As a party spending several hundreds of dollars, you would hope the hostess staff would start your experience with class.  I would be embarrassed to bring coworkers or family here based on the "check in" experience.  Thankfully the waitstaff and cuisine redeemed our experience.  Once you make it past the unwelcoming, unapproachable and unpleasant hostess staff, you encounter a fun, satiating dining experience.
