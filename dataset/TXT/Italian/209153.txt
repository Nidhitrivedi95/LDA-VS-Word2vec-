qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg Love Mediterranean food especially when it's fresh like it is here.  Great place for lunch. I ordered the pumpkin mushroom soup. Thought it was an interesting combo it was very good. Though there was construction going on in the front of the restaurant, the owner was kind enough to approach each table and apologize for the inconvenience  and noise.  Would definitely go back again. Hope they open one in the southwest
