pjpUOlJLlkIxBZ5BquA2PA Really enjoyed the food and service at Pomo! We shared the grilled veggie app and a pizza with ricotta, salami and sausage - both GREAT. Our waitress was very nice and I loved that the owner came to our table after the meal with a complimentary fried dough dessert and shots of a yummy cinnamon drink that he made. We'll be back!
