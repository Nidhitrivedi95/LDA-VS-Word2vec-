TFftsYkRIUtdo6ZhRwJ2lQ I liked the decor of the restaurant but to be honest, I was not too impressed as I had high expectation of the place. The service was okay, nothing wrong but nothing amazed me...And I thought the dish was a bit overpriced, especially Ravioli, wines because of the small portion size. but the highlight of our dishes was tiramisu and espresso. I definitely recommend to try their tiramisu, not overly sweet and good portion size too. Perfect for sharing with two.
