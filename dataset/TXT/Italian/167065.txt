Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw Yum!  I am so excited to have found this place on Yelp.  I ordered the Cugino's Special sandwich and found the price reasonable and the ingredients to be very fresh and flavorful.  The staff were all very nice and you can tell the food is authentic.  I know where my favorite place to get lunch around campus is now!  I can't wait to go back and see what other treats they have to offer.
