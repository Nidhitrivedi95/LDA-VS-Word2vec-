EhuKnhTKJTm_EZ_QGe7PvQ Went here for the first time recently. It was a typical chain place, but very good. I had the chicken canneloni and it was excellent. We didn't have to wait long for our food, the waiter was friendly and quick. However, we were seated near the open kitchen. At first I thought this would be a good idea, because I enjoy watching people cook. Then I started listening to various conversations going on between the waitstaff. I could not help but notice one particular waiter running around asking the others if they have ever seen the movie "Waiting". Then he would giggle. The members of the staff clearly had a little more intelligence and either pretended not to hear this kid or just blankly stared at him and walked away. If you have seen "Waiting" you know that you don't want to hear a waiter talk about it. Luckily, our waiter had nothing to do with this. But overall, good place. Don't know if I will go running back right away, but we will keep in our rotation.
