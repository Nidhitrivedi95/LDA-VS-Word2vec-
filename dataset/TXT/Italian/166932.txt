MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg I ordered the meatball sub and my mom ordered the lobster bisque. The meatball sub was delicious! I had to eat it with a fork and knife because it was pretty big. The lobster bisque was the best I've ever had. It was actually better than the one I had tried at Texas De Brazil. They have awesome specials going every day. Sunday's have all-day happy hour. The atmosphere is very comfortable. It could be a cute date or even just a nice sit-down lunch. They also have a rewards system connected to telephone number that allows for rewards here and there and a free birthday dessert.
