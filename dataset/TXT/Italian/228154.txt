SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog Last night was my second visit to this wonderful local spot, the first since they moved. I specifically requested this trip because I enjoyed my first meal. I was not disappointed. The antipasti salad is a meal on its own! I had the Capallini Pescatore which was wonderfully prepared. The mussels and clams were very fresh and perfectly cooked. The tiramisu and cannolis were also perfect! Great service as well. Will always make this a must go stop when I'm in the area!
