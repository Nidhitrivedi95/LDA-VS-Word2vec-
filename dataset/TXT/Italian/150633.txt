klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw Came here to recover from partying at XS the night before. 

I liked the upscale feel of this place but it still felt casual enough where we didn't need collard shirts to eat breakfast....well....more like brunch.

I shared a red eye breakfast and a "bacon and eggs" with my girl. The eggs were done right but the meat is where I was impressed. So succulent, juicy, perfect. The other things my friends ordered looked amazing as well...especially the pastrami sandwich. I'll have to come back and get it next time.

The down side is that this place is expensive. The breakfast plates here are $20+. Oh well....when in Vegas.....
