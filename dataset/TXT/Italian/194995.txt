pjpUOlJLlkIxBZ5BquA2PA Pomo was an excellent choice for us to celebrate our 5 year anniversary! We went on a Saturday night around 5:30 and there was no wait. Literally 5 minutes after we walked in though we would've been waiting. The service was excellent and the owner even brought us a special anniversary treat on the house! The pizza was delicious too. The bruschetta was very different than any others I've had before. Not bad, just different. We probably wouldn't order it again. The ambiance is also very charming. We had a wonderful time!
