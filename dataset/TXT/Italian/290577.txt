ZvtELJTUOh0yRrPxyyiakQ Stopped by as a recommendation from a friend's coworker to try while we were in Tempe for Spring Training.  Have to admit, I usually don't trust the recommendations of people I don't know directly, but they were right about Oreganos.

-The place was absolutely packed on Thursday night, one sign of how popular the place must be, especially with the locals.

-The service was prompt and courteous.  We were never left too long without being checked upon.  Their "Legalize Marinara" t-shirts also helped keep my wife entertained because she thought they were taking a stance and legalizing MARIJAUNA... which was highly entertaining

-Now to the best part, the food. Our friends got the Chicago stuffed pizza, which had a wait time of 45 minutes, but was so worth the wait.  One of the best pizza's I have ever seen, tasted, smelled, etc.  My wife and I split one of their salads, which was huge!  It was also very good, not quite CPK good, but close.

-In summary, if you are looking for good food in a casual atmosphere give Oreganos a try!
