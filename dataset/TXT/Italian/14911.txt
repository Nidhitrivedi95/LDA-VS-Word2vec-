1muT5zEqoC4qp9ms08qJtQ Went here for lunch. Didn't want to wait for a deep dish so we regretfully ordered a XL thin crust. This supposedly feeds 4-5 people. There was three of us normal size people there and it barley fed all of us. Anyways the pizza came out and we had to ask if it was an XL as it didnt fill out the pan and looked like a large at best. We were told it was an XL.

Now onto the pizza. Do not order THIN from here ever. Not sure if this was over cooked on accident or intentional, but it was hard. Could not eat the burnt rock solid crust. The only decent thing was the sauce. The toppings did not appear to have many cook marks.

The taste was not good at all. I'm from Chicago and am having a hard time writing this, but its true. Pizza with toppings was around $30. Total let down. Its sad to say. Service was good, I will go back to try the deep dish, but never thin ever again!!!!
