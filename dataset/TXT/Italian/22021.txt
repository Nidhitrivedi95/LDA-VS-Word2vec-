3fxpRLPjrSuuFmf3tCwNkg Had a wonderful dinner at A Tavola last night with my family. The wait staff were attentive and knowledgable. All food is made to order, which is great. My father can't eat mussels but was able to have the seafood linguine without any mussels. My partner had a whole fish which he said was amazing. I had the chicken which was moist and flavorful. We also had the chef's choice of red wine which was a lovely negroamoro. Can't wait to go back and try a pasta!
