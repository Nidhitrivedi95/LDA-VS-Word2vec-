The patio is very welcoming lattice of overgrown greenery and background music provides a great atmosphere just a stones throw from Mill Ave.  The decor is rich with warm hues great  lighting and dark chunky wood furniture.
The service was GREAT...rachel was energetic and very knowledgeable about the menu both food and wine. (excellent wine list) We had the flat bread the primavera salad the salad is a warm salad which we were not expecting but was made with local organic ingredients from South Mountain.  Full of texture, flavor and veggies..fava beans and artichokes, good but not great.  my favorite part of the meal was the halibut ceviche served with light fried crispy flour tortilla points..fresh tomatoes, onion, cucumber, avodcado and  tender perfectly marinated halibut.  The voodoo pasta was cooked al dente, very flavorful, just enough of a cajun kick to the cream sauce!  Overall..we dine for the ambiance and fresh eclectic organic menu and great wines. Perfect for a date night!
