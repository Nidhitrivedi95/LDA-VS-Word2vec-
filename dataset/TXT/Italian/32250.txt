5sTFevXhGx01eLT4wF7Urg Tried out Tanzy for the first time today and decided to grab lunch during the happy hour. When asking our waitress Jenna about the happy hour specials while ordering she said she wasn't sure what the signature drink specials were since they just rolled out the drink menu, but she said would ask the manager and be right back. 20 minutes later we asked again when recieving food, when she rudely cut us off and said she was still waiting on an answer. After that she ignored our table, which was hard to do in an empty resteraunt. The only time she approached the table was to give us the bill.  The Chicken Salad And Tuna WAS Delicious For lunch.  But the terrible service and ignoring our requests for an advertised happy hour left a bad taste in our mouths.
