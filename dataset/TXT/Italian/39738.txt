7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Open on a holiday! How very accommodating!

Pros:
- Waiters were very attentive to our needs! 
- Food was amazing! I have never seen mashed potatoes cooked so amazing! MmMmm
- very pretty setting
- steak is cooked a little rarer (if ask for well done, comes out medium well)
- wine selection by the bottle is fair
- portion size is really good for single meal! Not too much and not too little... It's perfect!
- sides are generous and made for sharing

Cons:
- pricy for sure, but it's Vegas!
- not enough wines by the glass.... Would have liked a bigger selection for that
- didn't really see a "stand out" factor
