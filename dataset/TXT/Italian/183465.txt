oejQ4bWsJaKszf98xjNrrg If you're still eating at Pizza Pizza, you obviously haven't been here. You know the saying you get what you pay for? Abruzzo Pizza is the definition of that. Everything tastes real, homemade, fresh, and ridiculously delicious. I always get thin crust with mushrooms cheese, tomatoes and olives, and a special salad (which is basically cheese, peppers, olives, and a bunch of cold cut meats) It's to die for. Best pizza in the world, and I've been around to quite a few places, NOTHING beats it.
