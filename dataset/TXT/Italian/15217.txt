1PJpo48hSChCbriXEHGSjw Opus is one of Toronto's best restaurant's hands down.
They have received a Wine Spectator Award in the past and have one of the most extensive wine lists in North America.

Be prepared to ay for the best. This is top tier eating, drinking and socializing.
If you're like me, and you like to eat at the bar, there is always a good mix of people perched at the bar or drinks or for food and there's a real sense that it's a community of regulars who are welcoming and social.

The waiters are all pros and know food and beverage inside and out. In the summer, they open their back garden patio as well, and it's gorgeous with a big tree in the middle. You feel like you're not even in the city.

Be prepared to see big name politicians and stars (I've see Christopher Walkin and Wendle Clark here) alike, dining at Opus.

It's totally one of those, "in the know" type joints.

Favorite dish: pan-seared tuna. And their molten chocolate desert is made on site from chocolate they import direct from Portugal. It's like heaven in your mouth. Worth every penny.
