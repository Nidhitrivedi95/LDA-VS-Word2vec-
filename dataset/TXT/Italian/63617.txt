b9WwTtC1Hd5-9bryVgbuLw After changing reservation attendee numbers 3 times with this restaurant (all without a smidge of impatience!), a group of us (10 in total) ate here on a Saturday night.  As I made the dinner reservations for 7:30, I was on time, but friends being friends (albeit all had children and babysitters to deal with), the total group wasn't there until well past 8.  Even then, staff was very accommodating, taking drink orders on the fly instead of all in one go.

With a name like Pasquale's Trattoria, this establishment is obviously Italian.  The special starter for the night was seared scallops and they were really nice - perfectly cooked and not at all rubbery. Pasquale's also had the ubiquitous melon and prosciutto. It was as it always is = a delicious blend of sweet and savoury.  Eight other people...excluding my wife...had the Calamari a la Griglia - grilled calamari with lemon/olive oil - simple and very tasty.  Wifey had the minestrone and it was more of a stew than a broth. Very scrumptious and felt very rustic / homemade.  Bonus points for that.

Main orders were all over the map, but I had the gnocchi, radicchio and tiger shrimp - HUGE bowl and shrimp the size of my palm.  Came close to not being able to finish, which would be a near-first for me.  My broad had ricotta stuffed ravioli in a pesto/rose sauce and these things were the size of playing cards and tasted so good.  There were no complaints from anyone at our table, but possibly complaints ABOUT our table, as we are a loud bunch + booze = hilarity.

10 people, two bottles of wine and individual beers/wine by the glass = $470 before tip. This is an incredible price for the quality and amount of food that everyone rec'd. Bottled wine prices were not over the top (for a change). Top marks to staff that kept the plates and drinks coming.  Would recommend in a heartbeat and will return.
