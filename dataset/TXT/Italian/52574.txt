9x1bWbbSgFCMLJlJR8mezQ A modest little pizza shop that makes darn good pizza and offers a cornucopia of toppings (think smoked turkey, pineapple, crab meat, etc.) Nestled in Market Square amidst the trendy and traditional establishments, it manages to succeed at maintaining the charm of a small-town pizzeria... Since I'm originally from a small town, it gives me a strong dose of nostalgia.
The staff is very friendly and committed to making the food well; it's not the fanciest place, but if you want a large and reasonably priced slice, regular or Sicilian,  this place is just terrific.
