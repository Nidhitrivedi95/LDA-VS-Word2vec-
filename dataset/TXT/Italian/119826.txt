H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g I am giving 2 stars just because of the price/quality ratio, but nothing more than a 3. Overall food may  The location is very cool, at the St Marc place inside the Venetian. It offers both outside and inside with a large and nice wine list. We were not in a mood for a big feast but just wanted some fresh and delicate italian food. My friend ordered the pizza and it was very disappointed. Ingredients aren't very fresh and the recipes aren't very exciting. I ordered the pasta with lamb ragu and my other friends got the meat balls. Both dishes were recommended by our waiter. To start with, the portions are extremely small. I am european so I do not except to have a huge plate of pasta but unless you have a massive lunch, you will be hungry after this. This goes against the italian food spirit... The ragu was ok. The lamb was great but it was lacking a lot of flavor. The sauce was very basic tomato sauce which I suspect they use in every dish. My friend got the same sauce in the meat balls. Unfortunately, the meat balls were so small that you couldn't get full flavor of the meat which I think is key.

Anyway, I do not think i will go back there. Too expensive for what it is just because the owner is famous and doesn't deliver on high quality food. I don't mind paying big $$$$ at all when it comes to food but it just has to be top. This was not the case....
