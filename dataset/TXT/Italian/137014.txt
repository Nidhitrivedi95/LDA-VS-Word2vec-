J1qzIVBt3lGpiz-8UdjhXg Not sure if Mike Pulous still runs this place or not - but still has the same good food as the original on Central Ave.  Manager special is my fav - with 2 of the sauce choices on 1 plate of pasta- I got the meat sauce, and the brown butter/cheese sauce - a great combo.  They bring a nice warm loaf of french bread with your included chilled salad.  Add a glass of cabernet wine, and top it off with spomoni ice cream - and it is a great meal.  The bar is nice and large - and a great place to sit and have dinner if you are just a single.  The bartender is always pleasant and knows how to take care of you with great service.  I have been back a few times and have enjoyed consistant great food.  I hope this place makes it - I know the rent has to be high at Chandler Mall.  So I am going to do my best and eat there at least a couple times a month!!!  :)
