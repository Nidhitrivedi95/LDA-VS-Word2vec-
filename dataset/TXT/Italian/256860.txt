w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q Service?  What service? 

Tried to sit down outside- which had a ton of empty tables-but was told by a waiter to see the non-existent hostess.  

After waiting as long as I could- I just left and took my party and money somewhere else.

Hey if you're looking for the NYC experience in LV- they seem to have got the service or lack there of -down right. 

Shame cause I used to LOVE the Palm.
