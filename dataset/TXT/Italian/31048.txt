Sauce is a fast-casual concept that serves beer and wine (like Chipotle). Be forewarned that while you can order alcoholic drinks, their liquor license does not permit drinking on the patio. You have to keep your party indoors.

I went in with three other people. Three of us got the chicken and broccoli pasta and one got the meatball panini. That panini was the best thing on the table. The interesting thing about the pastas was that two of them were cold -- room temperature at best. The other one was blazing hot. I'm not sure what they do with their chicken here, but it has the taste and texture of canned chicken. They also ran out of wine glasses during our visit. When we ordered our second round, we were told we had to wait for clean glasses. We all finished our entrees and the glasses still weren't ready. Had to get a refund. Super disappointing. 

I might be back to grab a pizza for takeout. It seems that's what it's known for. Definitely won't be bringing a group in again.
