I am glad that I am back by Za's after moving back to Champaign. This was my favorite place to eat at on campus when I was a medical student. Now that I am back I have found out that there are multiple locations which works out well. I tried this other location before the springfield avenue. Very similar experience. The prices are actually cheaper than when I was here for college due to a modification in the menu. For the pasta you get to select from multiple types and sauces with 4 toppings for 5 dollars. The premium protein items i.e shrimp, meatballs, chicken will run you a dollar more each. The food is prepared quickly, however I don't know if they changed it now to use a convection oven/microwave to nuke your toppings which is one down side. This is then added to a pan with the sauce and served quickly. You also get a nice piece of garlic bread. All and all this is better than McD and for the same price. There are also other options such as pizza, salads, sandwiches etc. I have never strayed from the pasta

Pro: inexpensive, quick, large portions

Cons: microwaved toppings (i guess you get what you pay for)

Hidden gem:
Sign up for the perka app. You need to check in and tell the cashier so they can give you the punch to earn free food. I did not realize this and ended up not getting my first check-in. You can't just check-in which makes sense or people would abuse the system
