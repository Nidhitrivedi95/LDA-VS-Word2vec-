_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw Great food and great service. The inside is a bit loud so we sat out on the patio where it is quite pleasant. Despite it being hot outside the misters kept it cool and we had an enjoyable time. The pizza is the closest thing to pizza in Italy that we have found. We had the Bruschetta Trio and the flavors were great. We also had the margherita pizza and quattro stagioni. The crust was thin, flavorful and soft. I preferred the margherita but my Mom and sister preferred the quattro. The waiter brought my Mom a panna cotta for her birthday. He was very attentive but not overbearing. A great place to eat!
