zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g The go to's - Di Fara special, spaghetti with tasty marinara sauce... I always ask for extra sauce but never get it... sooo cruel, I end up scraping the bowl for leftover sauce with my Di Fara pizza slice. Service always excellent and Nice clean decor with very comfortable red leather weaved seats. I always come back for their square, thick crust pizza and spaghetti...love it.
