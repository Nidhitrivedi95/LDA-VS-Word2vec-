4RL5ydKIIFpU8bevsOKRdA First impression was great. Second third fourth and fifth were the pits.  Every hour on the hour I woke up with the unreal acid indigestion. I never get sick but this is that one roll that you never say never with. My Mischel impression was very very good then the acid woke me up from a dead sleep. After repeatedly taking Pepto-Bismol and drinking a whole bottle I was finally able to remain asleep. Next time it won't be a whole pie but, a slice if I'm ever in a desperate situation!

I have to say I was appreciative that Mike the owner has sent me an email to discuss this issue with me. I look forward to hearing what he has to say and hopefully having a better future experience so I will raise his star rating buy one for now until I get his response
 Mike want to go and has responded to my emails and I appreciate his efforts would show me he genuinely wants to show me all of the great things that I heard about his business himself. I have a raised the bar once again due to his efforts and I told him I will honestly review The food when I come back in the next few weeks to try again. Bravo Mike!
