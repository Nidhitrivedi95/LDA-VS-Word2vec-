c5x6HWB8MTZvlTgabihaSw They were out of bolognese, my first choice.  They were out of bread, which is a big no-no for an Italian restaurant.  However, the waiter was extremely well versed in everything on the menu and was very cognizant of the fact that it was a problem.  I think he went out of his way to give detailed explanations of  the other dishes, but I liked that.  His guest service was excellent and he did a perfect job of making us forget about the bread.  

The food certainly helped.  We ordered the Rondelle 4 Formaggi which was excellent.  Waiter suggested a side of meatball to go along which complimented the dish well.  I can honestly say the meatballs were about the best I've ever had, and I've had a lot of damned meatballs.  We also ordered the Spaghetti Vongole, which had just the right mix of seafood and had an excellent flavor.  I will definitely be back, and I apologize to our waiter for forgetting his name.  Probably lack of carbs!
