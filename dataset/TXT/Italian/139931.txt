JHrZlJBq8QNdugfmxug1rg I was looking for new place to take some out of town visitors to in the north hills of Pittsburgh. Several friends had recommended Emelia's Garden in Cheswick, PA so I decided to give it a try.

Emelia's is housing within a residential home complete with friendly dog as their greeter. The décor can best be described as rustic and somewhat dated. The chef/waiter was very friendly, informative and attentive despite filling in for the normal waitress.

The menu was surprising diverse for such a small establishment. We choose the Shrimp Diablo, Ziti & Meatballs with tomato basil sauce and Spaghettini & Meatballs with Pomodoro sauce, wedding soup, and Garlic Dipping Oil to go along with our bread. All the dishes that we choose were flavorful, properly seasoned and generously; the Shrimp Diablo was delicious and had a pretty good kick to it. A few of us checked out the desserts and weren't disappointed; the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake was excellent.

Lastly, Emelia's Garden allows patrons to BYOB, doesn't charge a corking fee and the chef/waiter gladly offered to open our bottle for us.
