nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A The food was good. The service was ok. We had a group of 10 people eating for dinner. The waiter argued with us when we didn't order what he thought we should order, Including drinks. At the end of the meal he wouldn't separate our checks. He said that they couldn't do separate checks, but after We had to figure out each persons portion of payment he took everyone's cards. Made no sense. Would not recommend to a big group.
