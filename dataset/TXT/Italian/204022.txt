qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg Eh. I've had better Italian food. We ordered the spaghetti algio e olio and fettuccine alfredo.  The algio was bland (I did not taste that kick you get from the red peppers... in fact there were no specks of it in my dish), and the noodles were not cooked all the way. The plate was drenched in watery oil too, which made my lips itch. The alfredo had a large cream sauce to noodle ratio but lacked flavor.

Service wasn't bad but it almost seemed to cover the minimum. They came by twice to refill water before the main course. We didnt get another water refill until the check came. They don't really give you a choice of how much pepper or cheese you want on your plate. They just dump the cheese on or turn the pepper grinder once and call it good. 

Maybe it was an off day.  Who knows? If not then avoid these two dishes. 

Oh and $7 for side salad, you may as well get the full salad.
