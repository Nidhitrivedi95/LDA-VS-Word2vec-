q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ This place was okay I had the chicken anastasia, it was a dry piece of chicken stuffed with spinach someone forgot about the ricotta, the sugo sauce was awful and bland, but my hubby had the gotti and mash potatoes and it was delicious. Beware this is not a place to go with a big party, and beware they charge $100.00 for the private room and with big parties they don't allow you to sit anywhere else then the private room. They add on tips and the service sucks.. They don't allow splitting the checks. The power went out our server never came to check on us once during the outage, if it wasn't for the bus boy we never would have gotten our drinks refilled, and it took 2.5 hours to get our food.. we attempted to make reservations earlier that day but they don't open til 5pm we called at 450pm and we're able to make a reservation were told that they would waived the room fee, when we got there they hunted me down to question me about the fee. I wouldn't have minded paying the fee but there was no air conditioning and it was a little side room that was hot and stuffy and there was no view to enjoy the entertainment,  not what one expects to pay additional for. Our bill was over 400.00 and an additional tip of 85 was placed on the bill for a party of 10 adults and 4 children. After the 2.5 hour wait for dinner we couldn't wait to get out of there and I was to hot and exhausted from complaining about the stupid room fee to stay and complain about the awful service. I felt ripped of with the quailty and quanity of the food vs. The price. I thank them for at least taking the room fee off as it is not worth it and they had told me that they would waive the fee in the first place anyways. Thank you Capos for making our yearly Vegas family vacation dinner memorable in a bad way.  We won't be back, there is to many other places in Las Vegas that consistantly serve better food with better service then this place that will appreciate our business..
