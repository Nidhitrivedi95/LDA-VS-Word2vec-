iJpTpE9A8WDWvUlvUcFZuA I came here with 3 other people during Charlotte Restaurant Week (3 courses for $30) The waiter was almost TOO friendly... like almost awkward but still very nice. 

They bread they have is more like a cracker with herbs and that was really good. 

Our appetizer was the Margherita Flatbread and that was really good. 

I got the Fettuccine Rustica and that was delicious, if I wasn't so stuffed I probably would have eaten it all. 

Another person in my party had the Shrimp Verduta and they said it was just as good. 

The dessert was really small (it came in a shot glass), because it was part of the 3 course deal. But it was really really good. 

Overall, a good experience, I would like to come back not during the restaurant week so see how it is different.
