k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw I loved dinner last night. I had the Salmon, spinach and angel hair whole wheat pasta in marinara sauce. Every item on my plate was pure perfection! Moist and well seasoned fish, flavorful spinach, tasty marinara. Our service was spot on! The live piano music was a lot of fun. The singer will be performing at the Smith Center on August and I am going to make a point to hear him in concert again with friends. 

My group had fettuccini Alfredo and egg plant Parmesan and we all had Mozzarella salads. My only comment on the food is the slice of tomato on the salad was flavorless. Now let me tell you about the bread they serve..,sooooo good! Served with marinara dipping sauce. Could be a meal on its own. 

We didn't eat dessert, well we will be back and leave room for dessert. Total cost $150 for 4 people with wine and salads. Best Italian meal we've had in Las Vegas.
