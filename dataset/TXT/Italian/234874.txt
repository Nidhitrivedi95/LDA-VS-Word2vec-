tUjyGFSN8wQqLgKp5Q0CUA The food was good, but the service was absolutely embarrassing. If you want a high-end restaurant, or even a decent restaurant, you need good service. We had to wait at the hostess stand forever, sat down and had to wait for drink orders - after we gave our drink orders it took 15 minutes to actually get the drinks. The waiter seemed knowledgeable - he was just terribly slow and inattentive. There were 5 tables and 3 servers and the service was inexplicable. I could have served all 5 tables faster than the 3 person wait staff. The pasta was cooked to perfection - but it's not worth the terrible dining experience. Sawyer should make sure he has a good staff before opening a high-end place.
