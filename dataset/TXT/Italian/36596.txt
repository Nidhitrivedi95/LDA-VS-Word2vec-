I was not real impressed, thought the sauce was a little sweet and the crust was just ok, kind of soggy.  A few weeks ago we tried again and ordered the specialty spinach pie.  It was delivered cold and super soggy.  Was so bad we couldn't eat it so I called and spoke  to the manager and he gave us a credit for another pizza.  Tried it again tonight.  This time we ordered thick crust half mushroom half sausage.  It was disgusting!  Came cold again, the crust was so dry that is cut the inside of my mouth.  Sauce has way too much sugar in it.  We won't be going there anymore.  We each ate one piece then threw the whole large pie away, what a waste!!  The salad also had the wrong dressing with it and the lettuce was warm and wilty.  Sorry Spinato's but just being honest.
