H3cMcV9KK3g2pi68lDNsng Food was average, and I expected more based on the menu/location/atmosphere. Menu said burger came with "house made pickle," and it did not. When asked about it, the server brought me some sliced pickles, which didn't taste very "house made." Beet salad was rather bland.

Server was a bit aggressive and rather rude.  Also, it was quite a while after our food was brought before he checked back with us. I would have ordered another glass of wine, but by the time he came back, my meal was practically gone.

Also, they won't bring you bread until after you've ordered your food? We were waiting on a few more people to join our party, and when asked if we could get some bread to go with the oil that was on our table, already poured, we were told we'd have to wait.
