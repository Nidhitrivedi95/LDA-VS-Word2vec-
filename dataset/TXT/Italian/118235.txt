gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw I was quite disappointed by how this meal turned out. After feeling like a million bucks from playing a heater at craps, we all decided to go for a nicer dinner in the Venetian. We settled on this restaurant because the prices were decent for the variety of food they offered. I was never a big fan of Mario Batali, but when I do think of him, I think that he would (should) know Italian food. We were quickly seated at a round table enough to fit a large group, which was nice. The service was top notch as we were quickly given paper-wrapped bread (nice and soft) and some thin bread sticks. The waiter was also very enthusiastic to help us take a picture. My sights quickly turned to the menu, but I didn't really see anything stand out so I settled on something that I know and love - pizza. 

All the other pizzas were your standard so I decided to try something different - clams. What came out was extremely disappointing. I can't believe they would offer a pizza that tasted like this at this type of restaurant. The cheese was very rubbery and the clams were still in their shells (probably for presentation, but not very practical at all). The clams were tiny and didn't provide the pizza with any flavor. All I tasted was extreme saltiness. The clams were not even cleaned because I felt gritty sand between my teeth, which is one of the worst feelings to have when eating. I didn't even taste the chili that was supposed to be on the pizza. Overall, it lacked substance and flavor. I tried some other pizzas including the prosciutto arugula and the margherita both of which were better. I think my favorite was the margherita with the basil. I probably would have had a better time eating at another buffet for dinner.
