k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw Came here at about 12:30 am on a friday night with a party of 9. 

let me get the one major thing said: i am really really sad that i don't live near here solely so i can eat many garlic bites. delicious!

the menu late night was a simplified version of the regular one, but they said we could order from either. my friends had the breakfast pizza, which they claim was "amazing" and a salad, which looked really delicious and fresh.

i had capellini pomodoro with grilled chicken and it was not only delicious, but very affordable. everything was well priced. the service was just a little bit slow, but it was the middle of the night i guess.

i would definitely come here again, but probably without my boyfriend because he was perturbed when the waiter flirted shamelessly! :-)
