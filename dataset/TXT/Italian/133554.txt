It was a bit hectic on opening night (16th Oct 08) with all hands to the pump to keep diners happy, but the effort was appreciated and I think most folk were happy. We certainly were. The kitchen is towards the back of the ground floor and it's got an spacy open plan feel to it. Nice clean toilets (up the stairs). Not cheap but then again not too highly priced. Our normal sized childs buggy was too big to fit anywhere inside the restaurant, so had to be folded down and left inside the foyer. It looked like extra tables had been laid out to cope with the demand. Despite the odd concern over whether or not it might go walkies (it didn't), I'd say that overall it was an enjoyable experience!
