j_PL_u4SWW1LoEd2dCu0Iw OMG, this place is soooo good! We chose the lower priced brick oven pizza which was very good, a antipasto which was a nice salad and ended with vanilla gelato to die for.  The very best part was their uber-garlicky bread knots - I could have eaten ten of them.  Great place, nice staff, good variety - next time I am going to try the ribs - the picture in the menu looked delicious!
