xrA53WYhRCml2bMfpQ_Hig Had a very bad experience here this past weekend. I called earlier in the week to make a reservation and was told that their section for reservations was small and booked up already, but that they kept most of the restaurant open for walk-ins. When I showed up with my family I found out that I was in fact misinformed and most of the restaurant was for reservations. The hostess was extremely unapologetic for my being misinformed saying "well I don't know who you spoke with but no that's not how it works". I then asked how long it would be for a table and she did not even bother to look in her book or at her computer she said "well it will be a really long time...but its the same chef across the street if you want to eat there". 

I understand mistakes happen, but it would have been nice of her to say I'm sorry you were misinformed, unfortunately we will not have space for you tonight, would you like to reserve for another night? 

I left with a very bad taste due to her poor customer service skills, it almost felt like we were bothering her...I likely will not come back here
