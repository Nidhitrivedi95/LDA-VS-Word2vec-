5dCJy5oH6ZHqB_7cx76DhA We are just in town for the night and my husband went and got our pizza to go.  He came back to the hotel and they had not given him our full order.  We were missing the cookie that my little kids were really looking forward to.  So, I tried to call, but apparently that is an impossibility. The call to the number listed goes to some corporate call center who then tried to forward me to the actual Pizza Hut, who after a long time on hold finally hung up on me.  So, while the cookie isn't a huge deal, the fact that there was no way to fix this problem was a pretty big deal to me.
