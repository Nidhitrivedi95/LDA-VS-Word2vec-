W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg Nice environment, but I can get better food for the price in many other Italian restaurants. We've tried parmesan chicken and FETTUCCINE FELLINI, for $22 and $18, chicken is good but nothing special comparing to other parmesan chicken you can get in Cleveland, fettuccine fellini is a plate of spaghetti  with tiny bit of ham and heavy creamy flavor, nothing special either. The main dish doesn't come with anything, no side salad or soup.
In general: Environment is good, food is good but nothing special, parking is hard to find unless you paid for valet, and price is overpriced given the portion and quality of the food.
