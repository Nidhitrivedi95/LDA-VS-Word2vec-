VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Have been for late dinner, and happy hour appetizers.  Both good, but only good.  Which is good!!  Italian is top quality for Las Vegas, but with a club inside the restaurant it becomes tough to take serious as a top quality restaurant.  The appetizers are great, cocktails are decent. If you want Vegas flare, it is one of the top places that cater to people who need both liquid and solid.  Definitely worthy!
