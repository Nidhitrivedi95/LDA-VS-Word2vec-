Overall it was pretty damn good! I loved the jalepeno type spread rather than the full peppers with seeds - this way you get heat in every single bite! The bun was fresh and soft. The veal was not greasy like San Francesco up the road and also superior to California Sanwiches. I will be back fo sho!
