oHgCHC8a3QNJiB4-Ld0_kg If you're looking for a quick, cheap, and delicious lunch for under $10, this is the place, especially if you're on the UofT campus. I had it for lunch today but have been a handful of times already, and I always leave there happy and full. The ingredients are fresh and they don't skimp. I also like that they offer half portions of pasta because I can't get into too much carbs so early in the day and still be functional.

The guys who work here are really nice and accommodating, and Daddy-O too is a friendly guy. The place is small but there is a good number of tables and it does get busy at lunch but no need to fret as the turnover is high due to the speed of the service.

I have only had the pastas (both red: tetrazzini, and white: carbonara) which were very good, but I'm sure their salads are as fresh and bountiful. There are maybe five types of pasta to choose from and endless sauces. The menu is quite extensive for a place this small and busy but that's a good thing, unless you're a really indecisive person. Either way, there are options for vegetarians and meat-lovers alike. I can't remember what else they have on the menu but I'm sure it's available on their website. Anyway, do check it out!
