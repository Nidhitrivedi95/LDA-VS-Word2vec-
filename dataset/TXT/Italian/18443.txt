The Bocca trio had a well rounded flavor to it. The Sicilian sausage tasted great and in my opinion, created the natural flavor for the pizza. 

The Margarita pizza had a sweet sauce with the mozzarella cheese melted on top that made for a delightful flavor combination. 

Overall the pizza was thin, with a thick crust which is what I enjoyed most about the pizza. The dough didn't overpower the ingredients on the pizza. 

Great ambience and well decorated. This will be a place I definitely visit again.
