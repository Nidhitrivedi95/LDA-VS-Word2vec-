I think the owner lets his nieces work there without food service training.  The bar is the weirdest shaped bar I've ever seen, not to mention you could park a tractor trailer behind it and the employees would still have room to walk around it. If you added up all the "behind the bar" space in all of the bars in the state of Ohio, Abo's would still have more space. Decor? Zero.
