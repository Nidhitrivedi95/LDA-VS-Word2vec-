esnvHQxunLTAckQpntqbCg I discovered this tiny little Italian restaurant through yelp. On a warm summer day, I imagine it would be lovely to people watch on the patio (the restaurant is situated on a very busy section of Queen st).

I tried two dishes - tagliatelle with fresh homemade meat sauce and fried herbs, and the risotto alla milanese with osso buco. I really enjoyed both the dishes- the risotto, in particular, was richly flavourful. The portion size was also very generous, and I packed half of it home for lunch the next day.

Would definitely want to come back in the future and try other dishes!
