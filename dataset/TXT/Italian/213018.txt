r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA I've been to Defalco's a handful of times before with average customer service, and above average southwestern Italian food. However, tonight, I ordered a soup, they were out of. The cashier refused to make more of the soup of the day. After waiting 10-15 minutes to hear the news, he offered a dinner salad. The salad was not fresh and the lettuce was unsatisfactory, after waiting an additional 10 minutes. I went up to the counter and spoke to the owner. He offered to give me another salad, which at that point I didn't want to wait any longer. He finally gave me cash back, after giving me some of the worst customer service experience I've received at any restaurant in Arizona.

The worst part is that he would NOT listen to me when I told him the lettuce tasted stale and out of date. He outright denied my claim. I have not received such an attitude toward a customer before. He had no reason to give me a snarky, self-righteous attitude. He acted completely full of himself and his restaurant, saying that it was fresh and I was wrong. It's not that hard to please the customer. I will not return and can't recommend this restaurant based on their refusal to put the customer first. I'm pretty sure I know how a fresh salad should taste and this was not up to par. Not a big deal, don't attack the customer. That's unacceptable. There are a number of Italian restaurants I frequent in Tempe and Scottsdale and will go to them in the future. Defalco's inability to give a welcoming and positive experience is not well received and will not be tolerated.
