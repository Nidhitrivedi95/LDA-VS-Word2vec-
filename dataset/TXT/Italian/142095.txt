JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A Maybe closer to a 3.5/5 depending on the night. The Bloor/Yonge area has always been strangely bereft of good dining options outside of grab-and-go places, so I find myself heading to 7 West periodically.

Food: Nothing extraordinary, and a little overpriced, but they have a wide variety of food items and some of their burger/sandwich options are surprisingly tasty. Appetizers are a generously portioned. 

Drink: A good selection of the basics. Some of the cocktails I've tried are good, maybe a couple were below average. 

Service: Not too shabby. You won't be left waiting eternally. I also appreciate how they leave each table with a bottle of water and replenish when necessary. 

Ambience: Probaly the main reason to come here. Cozy, intimate, and softly lit, but without feeling staid or stuffy. You can sustain a conversation without having to shout over the table. The uppermost floor feels like a private room.
