8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA As Chicagoans we are always looking for great pizza. We saw a commercial on TV  for Amore and decided to take drive over before the fireworks. We were nicely greeted and seated right away. The staff was attentive throughout the meal. Atmosphere is like a typical Chicago pizzeria with Chicago memorabilia and photos.

We ordered the bacon cheddar fries which were decent- our pizza was a sausage and mushroom thin crust which came out quickly. The sauce was rather plain and some of the pieces ( corner ) did not have much coverage but overall the taste was good.

Really nice view of the strip if you sit by the window. Price for value was good- they don't serve alcohol so might be better take out if you are a pizza and beer person
