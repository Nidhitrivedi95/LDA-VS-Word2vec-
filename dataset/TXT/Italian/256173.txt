W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg The last time my girlfriend and I ate here we had a nice experience -- the food wasn't great but not bad either, and the staff was kind and even went out of their way to surprise us with a free dessert. Consequently, our next visit to Little Italy we were eager to give it another go. Sadly, we were sorely dissapointed.

To start, no bread was brought to our table. Last time I remember receiving bread with different butters, and the tables around us all had bread... but okay. A little strange for an Italian place, especially one at this price range. My girlfriend's ravioli was good, but my meat pasta tasted like something I would've made at home, and I am not a skilled cook. We waited forever to get our bill, and waited even longer to have it taken back. I'm not even sure who was waiting on us, or if anyone really was at all. We were seated by the hostess and then our orders were taken by a waiter, who after that basically disappeared. The hostess brought us our food. Nobody checked on us, nobody refilled our waters, and nobody asked about dessert, though there were only 3 other tables filled in the entire restaurant. It really bummed us out. We will not be returning.
