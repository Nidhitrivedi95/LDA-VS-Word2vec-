0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw Where do I start?  From the moment we drove up to this fantastically redone 60s style farm property I was IN LOVE!  They've redone the main house to look mod-retro; like a 60s cafe with milk glass globes glowing above you in what was the family's former living room.  The trees on the north side of the property are HUMONGOUS and equally as breathtaking!  And there's a coffee shop on the west side that was just adorable also.  Oh yeah...did I mention they sit on 12 acres of an urban garden called Agritopia?  They use a lot of that produce in their food.  Ok, I guess I should mention their food.  It's pretty fantastic!  The grilled wedge was perfectly smoky and cool/crisp and their fried jumbo shrimp basket served up shrimp the size of chicken wings.  Ok...I could go on, bottom line...try it out but I hear they can be busy...cuz amazing restaurants usually are!
