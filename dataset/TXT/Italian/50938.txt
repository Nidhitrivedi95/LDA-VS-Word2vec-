9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg As a solo diner I came in on a slower lunch time with lots of open tables everywhere. The host seemed to have been annoyed at the fact I did not want to sit at a long bar table, as I felt a little uncomfortable and asked for a smaller one (not even suggesting a lower table as a possible option). 
I sat down and had a glass of wine and ordered a pasta (a very good sized portion considering it was a small). I had the Capri because I love seafood but to my disappointment found it very bland and almost sweet, which I do not enjoy in a savory pasta. I did ask for salt and had to add A LOT to bring out any sort of flavor, but I did enjoy the seafood.
My server was lovely and attentive, and after some dessert I left her a good tip however I hope the next time I come, I hope I am welcomed with a warmer reception and perhaps will order something different from the menu.
