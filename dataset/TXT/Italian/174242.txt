nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g I love Terroni restaurants, but this is one location I will not be returning to.

A group of 20 of us got there at 6pm ahead of the dinner rush. It took two hours for our food to be served - many of the meals were not even hot and the quality was not worth the $100 I paid for my partner's and my dinner. There was no effort to apologize or compensate the table and the automatic 20% gratuity did not reflect the sub-standard service. Even if they could have just brought bread again sometime in that second hour, I might have given them a 2/5.
