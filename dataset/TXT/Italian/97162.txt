Plenty of toppings which was nice - you get what you pay for, but unfortunately, the pizzas were so soggy we couldn't eat more than 1 piece each of the pizza.

The Nonni's meatballs were okay. I wouldn't pay $8 for 3 golf size balls with no cheese on top. We ordered because they were a mix of pork and beef, not just all beef. They totally lacked flavor.

I hope this place can improve as it's so convenient for us living downtown! And the customer service is awesome. However, a good restaurant has to have both so hopefully, food will improve.
