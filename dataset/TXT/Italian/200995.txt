PWW_jT4tHP_r1S18ePJyTQ I came because of a really great Groupon offer Herbs n' Flavors had and was thoroughly impressed.  The food was surprisingly reasonably priced considering the local and organic ingredients.  Less high quality places are so expensive that the Groupons offered only cover a portion of the meal, but not here.  All that I needed to pay for was my drink and tip.  In addition to being some of the most delicious food I've had in the Valley at any price, the portions were large enough for me to get two meals out my sandwich order.  The hummus appears smaller than it actually is, too.  I really like this place, and highly recommend it.
