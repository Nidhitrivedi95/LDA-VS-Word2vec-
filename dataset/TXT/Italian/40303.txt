In our party of 8, all but 1 person loved their food.  That one had the 16 oz. NY strip and wasn't impressed.  The beef cheek ravioli with shaved truffles was outstanding but a pretty small portion for the price (over $35 I believe).  
Calamari appetizer was perfect and mashed potatoes with poached egg were too.  

Overall, an elegant dining experience.  Although, I can't fail to mention the entrees arrived as we were still eating appetizers.
