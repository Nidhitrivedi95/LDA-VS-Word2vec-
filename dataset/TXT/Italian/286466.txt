ZHNxxsZrowzP-RedJ6cSFA Best Italian food I have had in a long time. The atmosphere is great and the employees are very friendly. I had the chicken parmigiana and was it was delicious and had great flavors. Also my favorite part was the cannoli that I had for dessert!!! Excellent food and service and hot and fresh food comes out.
