eHLUQ2W_hXx61NmiL9kSVg Traveled from Payson to Scottsdale today, 10/7/15, to enjoy some good Chicago thin crust pizza. Being from Chicago and very familiar with Rosati's from "back home" we felt very comfortable in choosing Rosati's Sports Pub. The restaurant has a nice bar area (would be a fun place to hang out if we lived in the neighborhood) as well as a great outdoor patio.  We chose the bar area because they were having some minor work done outside.  Our server was Crystal who was also the bartender. She was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Our pizza was wonderful...sausage, pepperoni, black olives and green peppers...just perfect!! I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir, which was very good, but I felt $10 was a bit overpriced. Both the cook and the owner came to our table to ask how we liked the pizza...which I thought was a nice touch. I mentioned to Crystal that I was from Chicago so i think they wanted to make sure the food was up to a Chicagoan's high standards...lol! Had a nice conversation with the owner as well. He really seems to want to be an exceptional restaurant. The only negative was the Tiramisu. I knew it wasn't made fresh on site but it was not good!  Parts of it were still frozen and other parts were too soggy. I would not recommend it. Hubby and I will be back to try their $6.00 lunch specials....especially the Beef and Meatball sandwiches...looking forward to it. Give Rosati's a try if you like Thin Crust Chicago pizza...I think you'll like it!
