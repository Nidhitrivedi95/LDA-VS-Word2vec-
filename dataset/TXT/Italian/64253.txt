bCrMHwCLZzyKsAUOiAL0OA I don't get it. I ordered a couple of slices of veggie pizza. It was loaded with fresh veggies and I love that, but the overall taste of the pizza was just OK. This pizza must be eaten immediately, the leftover slice 2 hours later made me wanna cry. I only ate half of it and sadly threw it out! I spent way to much money for bad pizza.
