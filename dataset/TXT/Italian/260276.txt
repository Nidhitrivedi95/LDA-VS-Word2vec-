wp5FAtCGMyU2RnQ-7kxKHQ This place is absolutely horrible for a decent steak or caring service. I can't believe I wasted my hard earned money dining here. I grew up close by and keep giving this place a chance but I've reached my limit. Mike Roman needs to buy better meat and train his bar staff to be professional and caring servers. Next time I'll go to giant eagle and grill it myself.
