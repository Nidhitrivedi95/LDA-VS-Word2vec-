x4aHNNo1osWNCB75q_PijQ I loved the original location at the Borgata more, but the new spot is substantially larger, with a great covered patio as well.

I had my birthday here again (previously at the Borgata location), and while we were a large group, the service from one of our 2 assigned waitstaff was frenetic.  When trying to find out how we were to be billed, she was essentially complaining and being extremely pushy about how hard it is to split checks and she needed to know NOW!  My pals eventually deferred to me, where I reiterated that we weren't all just going to "throw credit cards in and split it".  Gimme a break! I checked before booking to make sure it was still OK to split checks. You're getting your large group guaranteed tip, so chill the f out and stop yelling at my friends at my birthday dinner!

The food was great, and the service otherwise good.

At another recent visit, our service on the patio was pathetic.  With empty drinking glasses, I eventually turned it into self-service and took our empty glasses to be refilled at the bar.  That should NEVER happen. Ever.

Drink tip: their version of the mule is NOT good...ask for a regular Moscow mule or order a different drink!
