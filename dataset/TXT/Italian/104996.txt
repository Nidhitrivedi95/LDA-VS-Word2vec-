FQ9C3ZF0NOfRyvFdx-J5Wg This is definitely my favourite restaurant in Brampton. It's one of those places that I seem to hear people complain about quite a bit, but based on my experience, I can't understand why. I've been here a bunch of times now, and just went again today for a late birthday dinner with family. I had the special: red heart shaped ravioli with cheese and spinach. I admit.. my mind was made up when I heard "heart-shaped" ;) And I was in the mood for pasta and some wine so it worked out. The ravioli was very tasty! And the service was great as always. I love the atmosphere and the relaxing music here. It's always a really pleasant place to spend an evening with family or friends (and would be a great date spot!)
