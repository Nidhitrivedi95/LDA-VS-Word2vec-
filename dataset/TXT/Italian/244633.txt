uUIYh3iKyYKzbhl7ORYxVA Very disappointed, i love Pizza Hut, however this location has changed that, just moved and this Hut is closest (unfortunately)... Ordered online and got an incorrect delivery, hot wing containers smashed in, though the order was somewhat right according to the receipt but incorrect from the receipt i had online, hard to prove over the phone because they kept referring to the receipt, very very rude customer service... If Pizza Hut could actually see my online order n the receipt this location gave me, they r both completely different! Papa John's next time
