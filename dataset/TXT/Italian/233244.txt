tngl2VZ4VGpK3qFpmU0NMw I had an late lunch/early dinner with a friend here after the yoga conference. I ordered the mixed greens salad with salmon. It was good,healthy and simple, which is what I was after. For dessert my friend and I shared the Chocolate toffee jar cake. That was totally delicious and decadent. We had a nice waitress and our food came pretty promptly so I have no complaints at all. The place is nice. It has a kind of upscale pub type atmosphere. Washrooms were clean as well (one of my pet peeves). Didn't this location used to be a Lonestar? Anyway, yes I would eat here again.
