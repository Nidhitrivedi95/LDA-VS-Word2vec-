The server was quick and friendly. To the food...I had their sausage pizza, with local sausage company Schriener's on the pie. I was excited to see that. My wife ordered the penne aka vodka. I must say the pizza is just, meh. It wasn't bad, but far from what I would come back for. The pasta, especially the sauce was bland and really lacked depth. It needed seasoning or something. That's another thing. No bread at the table, and no offer for fresh Parm on the pasta dish. Kind of sloppy for a bill that topped $45 including the tip. My wife and I agreed we will give it another shot, but it won't be first on our list.
