r3PPgxuhSh2rwxPqJ2waDQ I always have a great experience here.  The staff is so nice and know what they are serving if you have any questions about a meal or ingredients! The cuisine is mostly Italian.  And they do it right! Their soups and salads are very good and homemade fresh! An excellent place for a girls lunch or family dinner!
