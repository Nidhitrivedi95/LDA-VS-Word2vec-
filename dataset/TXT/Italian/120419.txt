h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ A wonderful dinner. Huge special lobster cobb salad that 3 of us fully enjoyed this evening. Also, the Seabass dish was so flakey over tastey risotto. Would not think twice of getting this again.  As usua,l the chicken parm was large enough to share plus cooked perfectly. Music was a little loud, but lowered when asked.
