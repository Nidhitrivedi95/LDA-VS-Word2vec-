g9iIBuh-g4ld3w3kUWLMqw YUM, this place has great pizza!! You can order a whole pizza or order by the slice. They have a huge selection of toppings, which again, can be done on a whole pizza or by the slice. That build-your-own-pizza option of ordering is nice compared to just picking from per-determined combinations. My personal favorite is artichokes and tomato slices. Mmmm

The drink selections aren't particularly impressive, but they are good enough. As far as service, they are slow. That seems to be a trend downtown. Most of the time I don't mind this, but as far as lunch breaks go: order everything all at once, then request the check when the food starts arriving. 

The first time I ate here, it was very hot. The air conditioning must have been broken. I haven't noticed this as a problem after that initial visit. Last bit of info., they have a ton of TVs. This is a great spot to watch sports, drink beer, and eat pizza.
