VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w This place is perfect!!!! Their food is amazing, the environment is relaxed and perfect for a date;) 

I highly recommend the Shrimp Scampi, Sea Bass, or the Spaghetti. Also recommend the Gelato for dessert!

They also serve garlic bread with marinara sauce complimentary. Which is delicious.
