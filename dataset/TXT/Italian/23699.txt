3yMmo1sERpks50quoaA8PQ You really cant beat this place. Its great for a nice meal with good table service or a late drink and small meal from the Bar menu. I don't think you could ever have bad service here either. Honestly if you gave it less than 5 stars for any reason, it was you....not Sal's. I recommend this place to all of my friends and family that visit from out of town. The spare ribs are probably may favorite dish so far. If I ever manage to order anything else I will be sure to update my review.

The food here is amazing.
