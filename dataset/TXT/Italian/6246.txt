I've  been to this small, local gem multiple times and I must say La Bona Pasta never fails to please.  La Bona Pasta is a great place to enjoy a leisurely-paced meal, allowing plenty of time for conversation and relaxation.  

As you walk into La Bona Pasta you can't help but notice the aroma of fresh bread baking.  You are greeted the moment you walk in and are seated promptly. Once seated you are given  a complimentary basket of assorted breads and rolls with soft butter, and the bread is absolutely delicious.

La Bona Pasta offers a variety of menu options, to satisfy just about anyone desire. Each entree comes with a choice of soup or salad.  At tonight's visit, we had the minestrone soup, which was enjoyed by all. Our entrees ran the gamut from Spaghetti Bolognese with meatballs, Lasanga, to Eggplant Parmesan.

The portions at La Bona Pasta are generous and all entrees received praise.  The eggplant parmesan came with bowtie pasta featuring a marinara/alfredo sauce.  The Bolognese featured a wonderfully spiced sauce and three generously-sized meatballs, and the lasanga was flavorful and delicious.

We will definitely be returning to this local faimly owned ans operated restraunt in the future and we would urge others to do the same.  You won't be disappointed.
