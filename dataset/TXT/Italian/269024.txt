All the pizzas were excellent and better than our favorite pizza joint back home! Great and friendly service, clean, and fast! We tried the jalapeño poppers and fries, which were also good. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for NY style pizza with lots of topping options, and friendly, fast service.
