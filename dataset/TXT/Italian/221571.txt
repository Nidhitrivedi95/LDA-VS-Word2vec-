SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg The small plates are all very good. Prices are high as expected. Only issue was service. We wanted to place orders for more small plates after first round but could not get our waiter to return. Also wanted second bottle of wine with our first Malbec and could not find waiter or Sommelier (who was very helpful). We would have doubled our bill (6 people) but when they finally came back after initial plates were delivered we had waited long enough and requested the bill. As for specifics. The tuna was good, as was the Salumi plate. Pastas are very rich but tasty as well. Mussels were nothing of note. Hamachi was bland even with their added spicy sauce. Poor service would keep us from returning. Nice ambience and some tables have great view of fountains.
