UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Writing this as I am sitting at the table waiting for the waiter to come back, it's been over 15 mins and our server is no where to be found. The food was very good, but the service was lacking. I could understand if the restaurant was really busy, but it's almost closing time and there are only 3 total tables seated right now. If I could split the rating for service and food separately I would give them a 5 for the food, and a 2 for service. I've come here many times, and always had great service, but tonight is definitely is far from it.
