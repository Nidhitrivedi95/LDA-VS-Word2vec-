CO8MpD1bSkBPArXKBKkIfA First time here.

I got the regular size Japanese Pan Fire, and pot stickers to go.
It was super awesomely priced! About $10 for those two things.

The noodle bowl was disappointing. Sadly :( I love noodles. Their Udon noodles are on the thicker, more short side for udon noodles. They seemed over cooked since they were very chewy and sticky. The bowl lacked flavor, and was very dry. Not very much sauce/ left over juice in it. It comes with broccoli, sprouts, carrots, and shitake mushrooms. It came with 4 broccoli pieces, tiny bit of thinly sliced carrots, and less than a handful of sprouts. It was deff lacking on the veggies. I'm used to traditional Japanese restaurants, so maybe it actually had an okay amount and I'm used to a lot. I also thought the serving was very small, but it was cheap so I'm not iffed.
The pot stickers were not great. The ones I buy at sprouts for $6 a bag are better. They were limp, and soggy despite being pan fried . The dipping sauce it came with was okay. Though it had a strong taste of alcohol? Not vinegar, alcohol.
Over all, I was let down. I was very hungry so I think my expectations were too high.

The staff was nice and they were picking up after customers very quickly after they left.
