SeQXxtKhqgr5SHw4VIjaLw This was once my go-to place for authentic Italian food. However, I visited since the original owners left...and sadly it will be my last visit. 

The food was oily, had no flavour, and was worse than frozen food but twice the price.the eggplant "rolls" were
Oily, tasteless, and overpriced for the small portion. 

Meatballs were like rubber, cold on the outside but steaming hot inside - seemingly microwaved. 

Lasagna was a large portion, and again the same oil soaked sauce they used on everything else. And it tasted like it came from a can. 

We were sick the rest of the night, and will never eat here again. Not even if the food was free!

*Our server was very nice, and apologetic about the food that even she agreed was 'not as it once was' her words.
