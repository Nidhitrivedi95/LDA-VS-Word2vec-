Fresh and delicious. Says 14 pieces on the box. It's definitely more than that. More like 20+ pieces. 

2 red tuna, 3 white tuna/butter fish, 3 octopus, 3 red snapper, 6(?) salmon, 6 albacore tuna.

Lemon on the side is quite nice. Their soy sauce comes not in a pack, but in box with a lid, so you can dip a lot easier. 

Would have taken a picture, but forgot cuz I was too busy chowing down.
