SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Way to go Trevi! I'm a total Italian food snob and the last place I thought we'd find anything half-decent on the Strip was in the middle of the Forum Shops. Alas, the Chicken Francese I had here was the best ever! It was so fresh, and so tasty I took my time on it. It was probably the first time my wife ever finished her food before I did. So frikkin' good.

It's also worth noting our entrees made it to the table like lightning. I was floored. I had only eaten one piece of bread prior. I'm always suspicious when that happens, but like I said, this food was very good. And finally, we had the triple Gelato for dessert. I'm a Gelato snob as much as I'm an Italian food snob, which figures since they pretty much go hand-in-hand. In fact, it was the Gelato counter that made our decision. If we can have a nice dinner next to that beautiful fountain under the fake sky with Gelato for the win, I call that a good day. 

I also really appreciated the manager-type who came over to the table to check up on things. What a fun dude and great conversationalist. Seeing that helps explain why we had exceptional service and food. Hey - don't ever take it for granted. Some Vegas places are just happy to take your money and boot your pants.
