IsN0qEzgAXBjbT3qn6lokA This gourmet pizza joint is on par with Patsy Grimaldi's, i.e. a close second place to Pizzeria Bianco. How do you beat the national favorite? You dont.  But that is still a HUGE compliment, as even a close comparison with PB is an honor, in my book. And, Humple pie is biting at the heels of Bianco, no doubt. I work close by, so maybe I'm partial but the pizza is fantastic. They have great variety and do all kinds well. Try the Margharita or Artichoke pizzas. The artichokes on the artichoke pizzas are huge chunks - no skimping here!
The lunch special and happy hour prices are both good deals. I ordered the cold Green Bean salad at happy hour ($3 i believe) and it was surprisingly delightful and refreshing. Puts a new perspective on "salad."
Also, the staff is ALWAYS friendly and helpful- even when slammed with the lunch crowd. Have yet to have a bad experience here!
I highly recommend it for a nice light lunch or dinner. Its yummy!
