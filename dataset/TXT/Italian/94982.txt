eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg The food was okay and the music was a nice change from the country music playing in the casino.  I had the special (veal parmigiana in this case), decent but soggy.  Don't know for Vegas but I've had better Italian in Seattle.  The house red was tasty though (pino noir blend).  I do agree with R.J's comment about the food being over seasoned.   Seriously, a little rosemary goes a long way
