p1ohbPwI1QfjHQ2zRup5OA Just came from brunch and it was a pretty good meal. The restaurant itself is a little quaint place that does not have a lot of seating. They had a nice patio but it was a little too chilly for that. 
My husband ordered the salmon and I had the brunch pizza. Salmon was good and generous. My husband thoroughly enjoyed it. My brunch pizza was good if not a little too much. I think the pizza could've fed us both without having to order another entree. My only complaint was that the egg was a little too cooked and they added too much pepper on top of it. 
All in all, it's a place we would definitely come back to. Maybe for dinner.
