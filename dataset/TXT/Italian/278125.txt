Ykg-jzdJS5UAlkF5YaCsyA I ordered from them on a Friday night. I live in the city and love pizza so wanted to try them out. Yuck!!! I order cheese fries with bacon... They were under cooked. I could have made better at home. Plus, something crunchy and nasty tasting was in them as well. The pizza I ordered was defiantly sub-par. I paid for onions so I expected to get my money's worth. I will never order from them again. Not worth the $$$ for sure.  I hate trashing a  business so close to home. But think that other individuals should be forwarned. Btw, my husband was going to get mcdonalds which would have costed much less than I spent for this crap. I wish I would have let him. Would have tasted better. Better luck next time.
