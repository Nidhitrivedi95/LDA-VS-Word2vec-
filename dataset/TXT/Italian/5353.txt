_qA2HPqgLiBc-M4wRyml0g Authentic wood-fired pizza comes to Chandler!

Went in today for a late lunch with mom. We shared the Italian Chop salad and the Tuscan Village pizza. Both were simple and delicious, with fresh and unique ingredients you won't find in many local Chandler eateries. I only wish we'd had a larger party so we could have tried a sandwich and pasta dish as well!  After our meal, Matt (one of the owners, trained under the likes of Batali and Flay!) came over to check on us and chat a bit. He and his partner are loving the area and are really getting involved in charity and scholastic causes. I will most certainly be back here soon and wouldn't be surprised to see lines out the door come fall!  :)
