F4zvnOsgjEV9aVbKqBYRng Decent enough pizza.  Prompt service.  Good pizza lunch deal.  It looks like some tough reviews for this place, but honestly they didn't seem bad at all when i stopped in.  Way more seating than some of the other pizza places on Mill.  Way less grimy/grungy than the other pizza joints too.  

The guy working behind the counter even offered to swap out my soda for a to-go cup when I paid my bill.  I'll certainly give them another shot.
