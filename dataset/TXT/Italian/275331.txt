yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg This place is more like Italian Grosso. Judging by the huge number of negative reviews, I'm not the only person who experienced Gary the Sociopath. I was in town on March 13, 2015 for spring training with some friends and it was a Saturday night. Every restaurant was busy so I stopped into this place to ask if they had any availability. I was talking to a nice young woman when a greasy haired man with erratic behavior (who I discovered later was the owner, Gary) interrupted and said "No, there's nothing." I asked if he could recommend any other place. He answered, "You won't get in anywhere, I recommend nothing. Everything is full." Perturbed at this odd response, I said, "So are you saying we should leave Scottsdale?" Gary suddenly flew into a rage and asked me if I was f---ing with him. He yelled, "I gave you a good answer and that's what you ask?" He then stalked off. 

Shocked, I asked the young woman who that crazy person was and when she answered, "my father," I felt such pity for her.  She explained that Saturdays are busy and she tried to smooth everything over. I thanked her for being polite and left with my friends. After a few moments, Gary comes outside and proclaims that he wants to "make amends to whoever he offended" and that he "has a table for us right away." I told him it was me he offended and when I balked at dining at his restaurant after what happened, Gary stalked away again and gave me the f--- you. You would think that after all these pages and pages of negative reviews about this disturbed man's behavior, that someone would GET A CLUE and GO TO REHAB. Needless to say, stay away from this maniac and his Italian Grotto unless you enjoy being verbally abused.
