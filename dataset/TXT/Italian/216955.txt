rVupX09AQhEg7Q_XnV1jYg My wife and I were searching for a random Italian restaurant to try in the Richmond Hill area and came across Citro, which had very positive reviews. When we arrived, we were surprised to find a very small and quaint restaurant. My wife ordered the Homemade Ricotta Gnocchi with sautéed Mushrooms, Zucchini & Roasted Red Peppers in a Rosé sauce. Each of the gnocchi pieces were smaller than what we've usually seen, but they were just melt-in-your-mouth delicious! I ordered one of the specials they had - a mushroom risotto with tenderloin tips. The risotto was excellently done with a wonderfully creamy sauce and the tenderloin tips were very tender. For dessert, we shared a tiramisu. Very creamy and just the right amount of coffee flavour. One of the best we've tried. After conversing with the waiter, we also found out that everything is made in-house, including their sauces and desserts (including the tiramisu). The restaurant is also planning on re-making their menu. I encouraged them to add the mushroom risotto I tried as a regular menu item. I really enjoyed it!
