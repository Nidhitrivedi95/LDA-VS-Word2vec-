wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg NoRTH is my new favorite go to spot for lunch and dinner.  The atmosphere is wonderful -- country themed, open, fresh and clean.  I have travelled throughout Italy several times and have found NoRTH's food to be the closest thing to being there.  They have captured the flavors so well.  They have super friendly staff that are engaging and welcoming.

Only down side that I have experienced is the valet.  One time the valet left and instead of locating me in the restaurant, he left my key sitting on the corner of the bar.  This is not acceptable to me.  If you only have valet parking available, make sure they are servicing your customers they way you insist your wait staff service your customers.

Don't let that stop you from going though.  Your palet will be please you went.
