SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg My wife and I ate here on our anniversary before seeing Cirque du Soleil "O" at the Bellagio. Great food, on the patio, overlooking the Bellagio fountains. 

Lago serves small plates for sharing, think of Spanish "tapas", except Italian. They do have some "main-course" meals, which may make sense if you are eating alone, but part of the great appeal of Lago for my wife and I was being able to order a selection of wonderfully prepared dishes without stuffing ourselves. 

When I made the reservation, I asked for a patio seat. It turned out to be one of the coldest days in Las Vegas. I asked the hostess if we should sit inside near the windows instead and she said that they heated the patio and suggested we take a look first. Glad we did. With the heaters we were comfortable. Some other folks had light coats on, but we had just come in from Minneapolis, so perhaps our tolerance for "cool" weather was higher :-)

I highly recommend sitting on the patio. Being able to watch the fountain as you eat really adds to the experience. Actually, I would only want to sit on the patio or next to the large windows overlooking the fountains. We had an early reservation, so had no issues having our seating requests accommodated (though I also make the request when making the reservation). 

The seating in the front part of the restaurant might be okay if you are there with kids, but I would avoid it for any more intimate dinners.
