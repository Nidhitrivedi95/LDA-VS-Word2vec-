fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w Tried it for lunch and we were really happy we did. I had the no bun burger and the meat was .very tasty, "steak like". My husband had the gyro and I tried a bite of the meat, it was SO juicy and tender. We will definitely go back next time we're in Vegas, it was a great experience.
