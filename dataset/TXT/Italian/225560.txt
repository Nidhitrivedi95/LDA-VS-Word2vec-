The Italian American food is good with huge portions.   They're sauces were very flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly.   The appetizers are very large so be aware when you're ordering that you might get full fast. 

 The service was great.    Our server was very attentive as well as the server assistants.  We got our food pretty fast and with a good pace. 

The ambiance and decor was very nice.   The live singing was also a very nice touch.
