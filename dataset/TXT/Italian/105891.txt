fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg This time the family went, because everyone wanted something different and  I said I'd be back to check out the menu. I felt that we'd get to try alot of other things this way. My daughter had Penne and spicy marinara, I had the Nagasaki Sara Udon and my partner had a Curry dish. We shared a dessert despite saying we wouldn't try one again. I got a pineapple cooler despite saying I wasn't going to try the drinks again. Listening to myself next time on both desserts and drinks. Promise.
Food: The Penne Marinara was not spicy, but it was good said the daughter. It was $7 and the serving was plenty. She was ok with it. She lamented that we didn't pick Pizza a Metro again. I think I may have spoiled my ability to grab just any old pasta to suit her after eating there.
My Nagasaki Udon had some good flavors, but there was a bit of burnt in it, sort of what happens some times at Panda Express with their noodles, but it was nice to have calamari and the shrimps. I added my sushi soy/wasabi sauce to it and the red pickled things from my partners curry dish and that livened it up. The sauce consistency was a bit ew at the end, so I didn't finish. The food was better than my previous visit. My partner did not enjoy the Curry, said it had no heat to it at all, was bland. 
Nice service, though. We grabbed two sushi rolls for appetizer, one crunchy roll and a spicy yellow-tail. Both were fine, but again "Spicy" wasn't there. I think this place hedges itself on spice and for those that seek it, may feel disappointed.  Seating was difficult because they had a large party and I had to sit in a walkway in a door-frame on the edge and it was awkward.
I upped my rating to a third star because our bread basket was tasty and because we were able to feed three diverse needs in one place, with better service this time.
