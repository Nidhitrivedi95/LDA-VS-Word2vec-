jeJbLKuVSbPuAwvgOoP5hA as an amendment to my earlier review:
I neglected to say that regardless of two locations in Charlotte sharing the same name of US Fried Chicken .. my favorable review is for the Tuckaseegee Rd location only.   :)  try not to confuse the two .. different owners and the food taste different.
