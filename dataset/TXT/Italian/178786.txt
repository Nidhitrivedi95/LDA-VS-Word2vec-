nRsiBbhgsKmwl6TMKZ70xA Giggling Tomatoes is my families go-to breakfast spot in the city. We have been to the Queen/Kennedy location, but this one is definitely a better overall experience in terms of the space itself and the quality of the food.

The portions are big and the food is always made fresh to order. Despite being made from scratch, the orders are usually delivered quickly. The staff are really nice and usually willing to help you figure out substitutes.

There is an extensive lunch/dinner menu as well, but we have not explored it a lot. My wife swears by the Chicken BLT and enjoys the wraps though - often having them for breakfast. Compared to the other breakfast options along Steeles, this one is by far the best.

A heads up - the staff (I understand) do not get the tips that are on the debit machine. I try to pay my tip in cash and if I'm out I'll double the tip the next time I'm in. Staff seems appreciated and always great my family with a smile and ask how we are doing.

Other stuff:
Bathrooms are clean; No change table in the men's though (can't recall about woman's - but don't think so)
Wifi never seems to work
Coffee & tea refills (self service)
