3yMmo1sERpks50quoaA8PQ So a little background before I give my review. I'm very finicky when it comes to Italian restaurants.  Being from Chicago and going to New York and Boston many many times I have dined at some amazing authentic Italian places.  

With that being said I think this place is a true hidden gem in Scottsdale.  It may not have the most ideal location but wow, they really bring it with the amazing food, wine, service and ambience.  

I went there on a Tuesday and place was packed. Not overly packed but lively in a good way.  that's a good sign given usually Tuesdays are a restaurants deadest day.  

Ambience:
When you walk in you'll notice it's a dimly lit restaurant with dark wood.  The bar is a "U" shape with 2 tvs and its setup nice so you can chat with new friends you may find yourself meeting there.  The Old school pix on the wall are always in my opinion a good sign of an authentic Italian place.  In my opinion it makes you feel a part nostalgic.  

Food:
I had the shrimp and scallop dish w vodka cream sauce.  Healthy portion of shrimp and scallops and the pasta paired with it was delicious! I paired it with the Super Tuscan (they have many bottles or wines to choose from by the glass) followed by a limoncello aperitif that was sublime.  
They offer steaks, chicken, veal, fish/seafood and pasta entrees so there's much to choose from which is why I can't wait to go back.  

Service:
I sat at bar and they had 2 bartenders on a Tuesday so service was prompt.  I asked to try a few of wines before settling on Super Tuscan and they were very accommodating.  

Overall I highly recommend this establishment if you are looking for amazing authentic Italian and a cozy welcoming environment.  Prices are very reasonable as well! 

Enjoy!
