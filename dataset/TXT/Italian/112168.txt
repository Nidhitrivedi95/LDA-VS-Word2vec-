gae9LAyt7Qvf_OgAkWASxA I had one of the best waiters in the world.  One of those guys who always speaks about 10 decibels too loud but who will do whatever it takes to ensure you are a satisfied customer.  When I told him that I'm vegan, he went to the kitchen to ensure that the ingredients in the meal I wanted were all vegan (which they were).  I ordered the veggie pizza (without cheese).  It was thin-crust and absolutely delicious.  He asked me if I wanted balsamic vinegar and some olive oil on the side.  I said yes, and he put some in a little plate for me.  The bread was great, the pizza was great, and the waiter was great.

My family loved their food as well.

The bathrooms have some of the weirdest art up on the walls of butts and elephants doing suggestive things and fat people and naked Greek statues and every weird, crude, amusing thing you can think of.

If I go back to the Burgh I'll be back to Buca di Beppo.
