Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag I ordered one of the pizzas and it was fantastic. Service was also great. My wife and I got a side of meatballs with our meal and they were delicious. I would come back for sure. 4 stars only cus to get 5 i have to love the place.

it is in the crystal mall inside of the Aria complex so it took us a little while to find it but it was a great time. The Aria is beautiful and the pizza was great. I was a fan.
