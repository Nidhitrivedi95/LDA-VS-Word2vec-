gZYt10Kn-eHpo3n4lx3iBg I like this place. The food is a unique take on Italian food by Marco himself. Is it your typical Italian restaurant...absolutely not as Marco adds his personal flair to each and every dish, or at least to all of the ones we have tried. Everything we have eaten is homemade as far as we can tell, very flavorful, and reasonably priced. Most importantly is that the flavors are great and the food quality is high. We have gone back several times and always enjoy the food. The wait staff is also very friendly and we have always been treated well. My only recommendation would be that that they do an update to the decor as the atmosphere is very blah. I also despise menus that have pictures, as that always comes across as cheap and of lower quality, which is not the case with their food, but they deliver a different impression with their lower grade decor and cheap Chinese fast food style of menu. I love the food, the service, and even the value for what you get....just update the decor and print out a more quality menu that screams of a higher quality of food that you actually do serve. We will be back for sure as the menu and decor does not turn me away from good food!
