eQCYur0033RkZdh5VjbF8A Had a great day in the city and was ending off the evening with a bite to eat near union station. Had very high expectations for an O & B resto, but have to say was disappointed overall after our visit. 

Calamari, although tasty, was unappealing to look at, seems like they rushed through the breading process and tossed it on the plate. This led to a lot of the breading falling off etc. 

I got the butter chicken, which was recommended.. the dish was not terrible, just very bland. Not something I would tell a customer who is looking for the best dish. 

Mushroom fettuccine, was above average, but hit and miss with the truffle from plate to plate - inconsistent. 

Fish and chips were solid, again, breading was falling off the fish, but the taste was there. 

The house red was great and the service, besides recommendations was very nice and pleasant. 

Not a bad evening, but having the O&B tag on your restaurant I just expect more finesse and execution. 

Cheers.
