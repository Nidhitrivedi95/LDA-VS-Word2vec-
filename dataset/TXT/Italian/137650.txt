The menu is diverse yet not too huge to be confusing. We tried the salad and soup that came with the entree (love that!). We liked them both. For main course, I had the Italian cheese omelet and my husband got the polenta. I liked my cheese omelet, it came well shaped and the balance of the three cheeses were good, although I would prefer less of the blue cheese. My husband enjoyed his polenta as well (in general I am not a fan of polenta's texture). 

Would definitely return to try pastas and other items on the menu.
