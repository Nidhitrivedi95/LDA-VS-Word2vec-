CvpXZRF-I7wfm19dW1jOXA I have enjoyed Mark Rich's food for over 3 years and in addition to me, my Dad orders delivery a MNIMUM of 1 night each week. Dad is 91 and homebound for the past 2 years. Since I travel frequently he ordersbhis dinner from Mark's.   I can't blame Mark for requiring a minimum charge for delivery.  So when Dad orders his meals he orders UP only to meet the minimum.  Last evening Dad ordered his meal as usual but for some reason the total was $0.02 (2 CENTS) less than the minimum and was told he needed yet ANOTHER item to bring the total up.  At first, Dad thought this was a joke but after some continuing discussion he realized this was no joke.  Dad asked to speak with Mark who came on the phone.  Homebound Dad was offered a "beer" next time he comes in and even after being told Dad cant leave Mark was steadfast about the 2 cents. So, Dad is understandably disappointed that an resolution couldnt be reached.  So, how much is the loyalty of a long time elderly customer worth to Mark Rich???  Answer: Not even 2 cents.
