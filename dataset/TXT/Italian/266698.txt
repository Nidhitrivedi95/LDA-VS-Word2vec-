X4rqmQMJcpY4EajFAFTSlw Two stars for at least having a creative menu, otherwise this is a one star review. 

I have ordered from here 5 times, yes fool me 4 times over. The first time my family ordered from there, the pizza was delicious, and the dough crispy.

We were so excited to find an awesome pizza place right near us. We ordered for a larger family event of about 12 people, with six kids. They sure made me look bad - delivery was late, even though they are three blocks away. Pizza was floppy and limp, and bland. The pizza was so limp that the toppings fell off. When you pull a slice from the box, the points frequently stayed stuck to the box, along with some toppings.

They also had a bunch of promotions on their site -when I asked about them, they were all "expired" even though there was no mention of a shelf life to the offers. 

I kept ordering,  hoping they would go back to the way it was the first order. No luck. ALWAYS LIMP PIZZA, with mushy dough. Ordered yesterday, after a six month break - still limp, the marguerita for the kids and me, so completely bland that it could not even compete with some pizza pizza I had at a kids party a few weeks back. I wanted to order from a well reviewed panini place on st. Clair, but they were on vacation - that's why I went back to this lousy excuse for a pizza joint.

I have my doubts about the veracity of the 4 star Yelp rating this place gets.  

You know what, one star.
