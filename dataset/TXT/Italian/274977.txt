y8Yake6yYKAzoi23l8Vezg I have come here several times over the past two years and have never been disappointed.

A classic Italian restaurant tucked away off Weston Road.

The owner is almost always there to greet you and he is always extremely nice. 

The food is classic Italian with nothing to spare. Some cheeses and bread waiting for you and a fresh menu on the table from the veal, Fish and pasta dishes that you will find in most staple Italian restaurants. 

The food is extremely fresh and is always cooked to perfection. 

The wine selection is excellent with great choices from entry budgets to some seriously high end bottles. 

The atmosphere is new but a bit dated.  Definitely not the modern style. 

I would take a client here and or a family function if you are in for something on the higher end price point.  

Great choice for a reliable and classic Italian.
