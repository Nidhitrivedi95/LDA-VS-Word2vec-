Ok no big deal I get it but I was told otherwise specifically when I ordered, and charged for it. The estimated delivery time was 40 minutes and in reality i waited 1 hour and 30 minutes, this resulted in my pizza get cold. So cold pizza, double the wait time and no soda which was paid for and fully anticipated. For a starving pregnant woman this is problematic. The only reason this is not 1 star is because management was super cool. Alex, the manager on duty gave me several options to rectify the situation, and genuinely seemed to care about me being upset, it seems he puts up with a lot. He was pleasant over the phone, everyone I talked to was really nice. I appreciate how he handled the situation.
