H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g The food was pretty strong. I had a small salad with prosciutto and the sausage and peppers pizza. Food alone would be 4 stars. I get that I am basically eating at a fancy food court; but the service was weak. Lot's of staff running around but, just not getting much done. Slow and lots of apologizing. The hostess spent most of her time taking laps of the restaurant (recon mission) to find out how many seats she had available.
