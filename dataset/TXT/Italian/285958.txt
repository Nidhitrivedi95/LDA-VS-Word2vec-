They mail out coupons and that brought us in. Their pizza is amazing! Great quality and excellent taste. We went on a Thursday and they had happy hour specials on drinks. They were also great and all 3 of us enjoyed our beverages. 

We had a buy one, get one coupon and used it for pizza and pasta. The pasta was just okay, but the pizza, drinks, atmosphere, and server made up for it. 

Great restaurant at a reasonable price.
