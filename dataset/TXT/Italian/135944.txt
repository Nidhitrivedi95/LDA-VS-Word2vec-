iXGqaPR7ucNdwK-HapDnCw Last night of the trip, close to the hotel, Italian sounded good. That's where it ended sadly. Everything started out ok, but when the waiter brought out my pretty bland salad (though, fresh), I mentioned the 15% discount advertised on this app for checking in. He said he didn't know, but didn't think they did that. He said he'd ask. Annnnnd that was pretty much the last time we saw that waiter. In the beginning, we mentioned that we wanted to put one item on another check (gotta love spending down foreign money), he said no problem. We got our pizza (spinach, asparagus, mushrooms and artichoke) and wow, it had no flavor at all. Surely, I didn't expect a ton of bold flavor with a vegetable pizza, but the asperagus were from a can and the spinach was the chopped frozen kind. The sauce seemed to have been put on the pizza, but there was pretty much no other evidence of it but the red. The only other time our original waiter reappeared was to bring out the check...which was wrong. It took nearly 10 min for someone to come back so that we could explain the issue. That waiter assisted us promptly. The experience really felt cold and as though we weren't welcome. I'm disappointed because the reviews were pretty decent.
