jOseCpGmgbQWEfX2Wn_TGQ 5 star experience, all the way around. My hubby tried a sampler platter the chef put together--WOW. Lobster, halibut, scallops, linguine, and veggies, it was perfectly topped with a spicy red sauce. The salad was so crunchy and their Caesar dressing was definitely the best I've ever had. Ingredients were super fresh all the way around. The appetizer was on point as well. Also, best bruschetta I do believe I have ever had. And finally the creme brûlée, mixed with strawberries--ahh I cannot get enough of this place.
