pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg My experience at Carmine's was pretty good. The service was on point. Our drinks were always refilled without having to flag anyone over. I recommend the chicken  parm. It was really delicious! The waiter was knowledgeable of the menu and helped us pick out our entrees, took the time to explain everything. The vibe inside the restaurant was good too. Everyone was smiling and having a good time.
