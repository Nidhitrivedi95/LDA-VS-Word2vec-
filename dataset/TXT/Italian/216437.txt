RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ I was here with a friend before he was leaving got the summer. We ended up spending over 3 hours here, each of of us downing 3 beers. This place is at the sweet spot between too casual and too classy. They had some very nice beers on the tap. 

We had tried their lemon garnished chicken wings too, but I found them a little too sour and a little too greasy.
