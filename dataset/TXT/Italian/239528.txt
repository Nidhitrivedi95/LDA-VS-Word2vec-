u9R0_pvEkl7QGPJYH3j1sg My wife and I have been eating here since they have opened. The place is packed all day from open to close, that tells you how good the food is. Now we have a child and it is a great place for children too. 

They have a nice small bar to get some drinks and best of all they have Moose Drool from Montana which comes from west Yellowstone where I first had this beer. And Times Square has it on draft.

They also serve breakfast which is amazing. I would recommend this place to everyone. It is a must try.
