SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog Good neighborhood Italian restaurant.  Line can be a bit long after 6pm.  Take out family specials are pretty good.

Bread and salad come w each entree and are very tasty.  Pasta source is good but can be a little heavy on butter and/or cheese.  Overall, great value for the money.
