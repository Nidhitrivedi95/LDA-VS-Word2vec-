dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw I came here with a group of friends on a Friday night after we saw "O" and had a great time.  They make a great manhattan.  They remembered the twist I requested (you'd be surprised how often they show up with a cherry) and it wasn't over-shaken (I don't need an ice floe diluting my drink).  My friend's old fashioned was a bit sweet though.  Bartenders of the world, lay off the sugar already!
 
Most of us ordered their "winter tasting menu" which was a three course prix fixe meal for $45.  The options were a bit limited and most of us ended up ordering the same delicious salad (a classic of fresh greens, gorgonzola and balsamic vinaigrette) and out of this world ravioli.  The menu indicates they make their pasta fresh on premises every day and it shows.

For dessert they brought out an assortment of dishes.  The tiramisu was rich and creamy and the torte was the densest brick of chocolate fudge I've ever tasted.  There was an assortment of sorbets which included blood orange (delicious) and the earl gray (interesting) flavors.

Finally, the staff was outstanding.  Our waiter was very friendly and engaged us in a conversation about Seattle--it would seem our donuts (Top Pot) are famous now.
