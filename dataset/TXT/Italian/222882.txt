SKpg4zgr83YPZ14uzhmn9g I've come to appreciate Grazie. I had been to the one in Old Town 3 or 4 times a few years ago, and always thought it was okay. Maybe Grazie has improved over the past two years or maybe my palatte has changed, or maybe I was just really hungry. Either way, we had a great dinner there over the weekend! My boyfriend told me that I was  in charge of the ordering that night.... Pressure!! 

My order:

Their bread was very good, perfect to go along with the salad we started with.

The waitress brought us a couple of wines to try. I went with the Nebbiolo - nice wine

Emiliana salad: Arugula, mixed greens, red onions, red bell peppers, shaved parmesan. Good mix. I've always thought that Grazie is a little heavy handed with the oil and too light on the balsamic on their salads. Still slightly true. A dash of salt and pepper perfected the salad for me. 

Vegetariana Pizza:  (a waitress suggested to add red sauce, which we did and it was a great choice!). YUM! The carmelized onions and sweet peppers were delicious. Very good crust too. My highly carniverous boyfriend commented that he didn't even miss not having meat. 

The Grand Finale... Dolce della Casa. This is a calzone stuffed with nutella (we thought probably almost an entire jar) and bananas then topped with vanilla icecream. We ordered the small to share - I can't even fathom the large size. It was delicious! Very rich, so neither of us could finish. 

Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. We enjoyed the perfect weather on the patio. A little traffic noise - I'd prefer the patio not facing Thompson Peak Pkwy. Definitely going back to Grazie!
