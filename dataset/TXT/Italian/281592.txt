yvJqxVTO_qwRGLMtUrqzQw this is one of my favorite places to eat! as a fan of wings and gluten free pizza, it's a weekly occurrence. I love the wings, big, fresh, and saucy! I have been to six different locations and they never fail to impress on any scale. great staffs, fresh food, fast service, awesome salad bar, I could probably live there!!
