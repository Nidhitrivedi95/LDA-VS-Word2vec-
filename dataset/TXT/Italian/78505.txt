D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA This may be a great spot for late night dining.  And the reviews are mostly favorable.  But for a fairly early dinner on a Wednesday, I will say I am just not that impressed.  The ambiance was cold, stark and strange.  The waiter was lacking any interest or passion for the job.  The food was so-so in a city that can boast so many outstanding Italian restaurants.  To sum it up, not to happy to have wasted time and money here and won't be back.
