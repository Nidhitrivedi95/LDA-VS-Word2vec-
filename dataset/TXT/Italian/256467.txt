w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q Came here for my mom's birthday dinner because we were informed of the 4lb lobster deal for $80 that comes with two salads and two sides. We had a party of 5 and we all ordered different things, so we had a good variety to taste some of their dishes. 

For the atmosphere, I did not really like the 1/3 of the restaurant butting out the front entrance in the mall walkway. It just feels like your eating in a mall with just a table and chairs with people walking back and forth staring at you and your food. Luckily, we were seated like half and half from the outside and inside. I sat down at an angle where I can see a little interior and the forum shops. I kept staring at Burberry. 

For the food, I tried the watermelon salad with the cheese in the middle of the watermelon. It was different, pretty good and I'd say worth the try. Nothing superiorly amazing that'll make me come back for though. Lobster bisque was okay, a bit towards the saltier side and not as creamy as expected. There was this shrimp dish, forgot the name, but it had Dijon mustard as part of the sauce and it was pretty good. For my entree, I had the double cut lamb chop 18oz. We also ordered sides: the asparagus fritti, goat cheese mashed potatoes, three cheese potato something, and wild mushrooms. I really enjoyed the potatoes. Cheese and potatoes? Hell yeah. Goat cheese mashed potato was different, I'd probably get that again if I came back. Asparagus fritti, no big deal. Just deep fried asparagus but the sauce with it is not bad. Wild mushrooms are no big deal. As for my lamb, it was juicy, fat, and pretty good. 

My mom got a cheesecake, whoop happy birthday mom, comped by the restaurant, and it was like your typical cheesecake. Thank you though ! The staff was really friendly. I enjoyed their kindness and happy-go attitude. 

Oh and eat the bread. That shiet was addicting.
