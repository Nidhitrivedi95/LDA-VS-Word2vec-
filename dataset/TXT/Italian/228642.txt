SX5NA-yKCGR234vV1eaxZA I have ordered (delivery) pizza from Rosati's many times, have always been happy with what we got. I really like the "monster", has tons of toppings. The Chicago deep-dish could stand more goodies in it, but has lots of cheese, is skimpy on the other ingredients. Still WAY better than Pizza hut, at a higher price.
