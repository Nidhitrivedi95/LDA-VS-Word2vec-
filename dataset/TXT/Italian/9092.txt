0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw Went here with my girlfriend, and had a good experience.

We only wanted wine by the glass (the wine list here is huge, and takes up a few blackboards on the walls), and was very happy with the service - the waitress asked us our preferences then came back with a few bottles to try, before we decided on what we wanted to actually have. This is something I haven't seen done before, and even though it's only a little thing, it makes a big difference to the experience.

The menu itself was interesting, and obviously changes regularly. We started with squid stuffed with lobster - it was good, but I wasn't blown away by it. The seafood here seems to be taken seriously, so I would recommend trying it when coming (I saw someone else eating the oyster plate, and had instant meal-envy). 

I had the ribs as my main, and they lived up to expectations - the meat was cooked spot-on, the sauce good and thick, and plenty of chips. I didn't expect to have such a meal at a 'gourmet' establishment, but I definitely enjoyed it.

For the dessert we had homemade doughnuts and a chocolate brownie. Both were really good (the doughnuts reminded me of Aussie doughnuts - lots of cinnamon), but I think the brownie was the winner.

The place itself is warm and cosy, and makes a great 'date venue.' It isn't cheap, but you do get quality service, food, and good atmosphere (if you want cheap, there's a 
Dilallo Burger down the road!).
