SMTMAaGjUfsefp9RIIfQmA Great food in a warm and inviting atmosphere!
After hearing that Massimo Capra's latest restaurant was situated in the heart of Mississauga, my husband & I were looking forward to giving it a try.
We arrived to a packed restaurant just after 8 p.m. on a Saturday night, but luckily were able to sit at the bar with s full view of the appetizer/dessert prep girl and kitchen.  We were originally going to wait for a table but decided to stay put as we really enjoyed watching the hustle & bustle of the kitchen staff, prep staff & servers.
We started off the night with a meat & cheese shared board which was a nice variety of meats, cheeses, olives. house pickled vegetables fruit mostardo & focaccia bread.  Next we shared the Caesar salad consisting of baby Romaine |Fried Mortadella| Spicy Anchovies &!Shaved Pecorino. As someone who eats a lot of Caesar salads, let me tell you this was one of the best I have ever had.  The dressing was divine.  The lettuce & ingredients were so fresh &'that spicy tangy dressing was so delicious & unique.  Next I had the Lamb T-bone | Tomato | Olives | Caramelized Onions & Thyme & my husband had the Tagliatelle Bolognese: Beef | Veal | Pancetta | Wine | Crushed Tomatoes.  Both meals were delicious & the portions were large enough that we had some left to bring home for lunch the next day.  We usually don't order dessert but we couldn't resist ordering the Chocolate Charcuterie Board, the highlight being the white chocolate mousse.  
We had the pleasure of meeting Massimo at the end of the night who obviously is very proud of his new restaurant,   He expressed his desire to bring a top-notch dining experience to Mississauga and we think he has done just that.  
We will definitely be back and will recommend Capra's Kitchen to all of our friends & family,
