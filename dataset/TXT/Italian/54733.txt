aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ I've now been twice. Once as a business dinner, once as an intimate dinner. 
Both times had their good things and their so-so things. 

The first time I went, they already had 4 things 86'd off the menu at 7pm. And since they had a slimmer, summer menu in place, it made it even narrower of a selection. 
I did have fresh softshell crab for app that go around with scallops for entree. The scallops were over cooked and the accompanying risotto was under cooked. 
The most recent dining experience there I had pork belly as app and lamb loin for entree. The pork was delicious and the lamb was good, but the spinach and baby carrot coins that came with were oversalted. 

Desserts were pretty good both times I went. Of course everyone marvels at the cotton candy as well as the take-home cookie. 

All and all, if this place didn't price gouge the shit out of you, I'd might come back. But after spending $200 on a mediocre dinner, I am not likely to return on my own accord.
