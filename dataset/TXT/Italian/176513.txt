nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ Hilda our server was on point and knowable of the wine list. Spaghetti with meatballs was perfectly hot. Red sauce was just about perfect and not a mushroom in site,bits of garlic and see through onions. The wine was Bon Anno, Nappa Valley price at $50.00 a bottle. Antipasto, roasted and marinated red, yellow bell peppers,olives green,red and black and perfect hard cheese. The bread was a type of hard roll pretzel type. It did lack butter in the baking process. The double dark chocalate cake was perfect not overly sweet. Coffee was average but doable. I would have gave a 5 stars but the rolls bread gave it a 4.
