9Boahjn3QxlZnP2Aw_V1Rg I am not quite sure why this basement restaurant gleans such good reviews, except that the quality of everything is excellent.
$300 for two, with a couple of bottles of wine. 
Lovely pasta to start, ( Parpadelle),  followed by a luscious sole and then a veal.  Plenty of people queuing to take our place.
