Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag I'm honestly perplexed as to why this place has 4 stars. 
We came on a Sunday night at 730; the place was half empty which apparently means you get half the service and quality of food:
-Waited 10 mins to get greeted and seated (had a reservation)
-Wine and water glasses smelled like dirty dish soap
-Noticed another table had bread, had to ask FOUR times before it was finally brought out - after our entrees arrived 
-Both pastas - ravioli and carbonara - were basic and just barely edible
-We saw our waitress maybe twice the entire meal
I'd expect this quality of food/service at Olive Garden, but not for these prices or with this name attached. There are plenty of other great Vegas restaurants - try one of those.
