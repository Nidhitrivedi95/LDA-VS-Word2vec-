IT0IODInyhKbG4a_ka71MQ Highly disappointed in my first experience at an Oreganos. We had a large group with a reservation when they opened. Service was slow, entrees took more than 90 minutes to come. My entree contained two over done sausages that resembled cardboard and tasted just as bad. To their credit, they did remove it from my bill when I sent the dish back. Definitely will need some convincing to come back and try again.
