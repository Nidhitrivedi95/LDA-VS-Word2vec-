SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Should be 2.5 stars...

Atmosphere is loud, cramped and dark (we ate inside).  Patio area was louder but at least you could people watch and had a nice view of the fountain they had.

Service: Prompt, attentive, and the waiter was very nice.  We had 9 people all showing up at different times and he was very accommodating.  We also had a B-Day and he added a B-day dish with a candle. 
Food: Just OK.  No one disliked their dished but no-one totally loved them either.  I ordered the Linguine Al Frutti Di Mare (their "signature dish").  Basically it's lobster, crab, scallops, scallions and tomatoes in a white cream sauce.  It was ok at best.  Shrimp and Scallops wee flavorful, Lobster was not.  Sauce was bland.  
Price:  Like most of the Strip it is over-priced.  Dishes are from $18 to $30.

Best way to describe this place...food is a tick less tasty than Olive Garden but cost $10 more per dish.
