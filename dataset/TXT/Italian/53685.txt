a6SqJZTFMpSOR6Qb0STyFA We had dinner there on a slow Monday night. We felt the young lady who was a our server did a very nice job taking care of us. There was bread and water served very promptly. She checked on our readiness to order a few times and was very attentive. The food and service was worthy of a four star rating. All four meals served looked very appealing and tasted wonderful!!! The atmosphere and decor is where Arrivederci needs some TLC. The doors to the restaurant and bar areas were confusing (due to the tinted windows). They had past award frames sitting in the window (and in our opinion, should have been hung somewhere inside). The lighting was pretty dark and there was a big metal cabinet with some boxes/supplies right by our table. The pathway back to the bathrooms had supplies and other materials along it and made that area of the restaurant look subpar and junky. We would go back more for the food than the ambiance. I think if they cleaned things up and did more with the decor, I could easily rate this 4-5 stars.
