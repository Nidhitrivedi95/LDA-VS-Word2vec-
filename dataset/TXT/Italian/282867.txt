Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ Here with a Living Social coupon. The restaurant itself is nice, old style Italian. Located next to the food court in the back of a getto casino. The California pizza I order was pretty good. (I'm a pizza aficionado) . 4 stars for the food. 4 stars for the restaurant and the service. 2 stars for the location.
