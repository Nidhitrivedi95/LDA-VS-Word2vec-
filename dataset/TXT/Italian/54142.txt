A8CbZwWOPsd_9wrJlv94Lw Under new management (Tony's in Florida), this small restaurant tucked away between a barber shop and a store in the Big Lots shopping center/strip mall, across from Sam's Town casino. This place barely surpasses being called a "Hole In The Wall" with mostly booth seating (6) and one large table and a small table in the middle of the restaurant. I am guessing most of the clientelle is from locals that live in the area. Delivery charge is $1.50.

The menu featuring appetizers ($1.95 for fries-$24.95 for 50 pack of chicken wings), subs ($5.95- $7.50), pizza ($10.95- $22.99), calzones ($7.95 or $15.95), stromboli (same as calzones), pasta ($7.95- $14.95), and salads, is pretty reasonable. For example, a small calzone for $7.95 is enough for two people to share. The sandwiches are made with Boar's Head (proudly advertised on the front door BTW) and fresh bread baked daily (half  moon shaped). Daily lunch specials are from monday- saturday, 10:30 am- 4 pm (closed sunday and holidays). There is a Pick-Up Special of one large 1-item pizza for $10.99. I could go on and on about the specials, because there are so many, so these are just a few examples. 

I've had the calzone and the hot pastrami sub from here, and both were excellent. The calzone almost tasted like the one at Villa Pizza, paired with marinara sauce- it's a winner. Like I said, two people with regular appetites could split one small one. The sub was very good, featuring Boar's Head pastrami, paired with pickles and mustard, this was surprisingly very good. Since the meat was Boar's Head, the meat was lacking large pieces of fat (which you come to expect in other places). The bread is baked fresh here, too, don't forget.

This place has been here for 18 years, and the new interior paint on one wall, has given it a fresh look (topographical Italy).  It's located on the left side of the strip mall, tucked away in between a few stores. If you're in the area, check it out.
