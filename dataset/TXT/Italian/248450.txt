VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ I had high hopes for this to be a great place to go after work.  The food was disappointing to outright bad.  The free coffee infused whiskey shot on Yelp is disgusting, they can keep it.   On the plus side, people there and the bartender were great fun!  Maybe I'll try something else when I eat there.
