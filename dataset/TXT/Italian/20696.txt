366FaRQ1MWEHBhaEKTcriQ I came here yesterday evening, and ordered a medium size pie of "L'Italiana, Mamma's Award-Winning Other Signature." I'm a huge fan of feta cheese, and they complimented very well with the roasted red peppers and spinach. I can understand why the other reviewers felt that the pizza sauce was copiously sweet. It is very sweet, but at least it balanced very well with my order! I would forewarn those who want to order the hawaiian style of pizza because it could be a sugar overkill. Overall, I'd come back here again :)
