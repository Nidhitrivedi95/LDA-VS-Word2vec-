xz_FWJkI_UhTk-t6KvpaXw Have come consistently to Aurora ESM for about 8ish years, and have posted a positive review before (good value/service/ decent food) but after two aweful visits in the last 6 weeks, we are done here. Yes, they comp meals if they are overcooked/inedible, but ya know what? My dining dollars are not compensated, because my family night out has been ruined, and my time and $$ is too valuable to chance incompetence. This place is understaffed (and I actually feel sorry for the staff, because they are clearly trying hard), the management has not been trained (can comp a meal, but is not actually watching the hostess, who struck off our names, forcing us to wait 30 min for a table of "10 min wait"),  is clearly not watching kitchen staff (30 min between salad and main, burned wrap and oily rice),  and appears to be under trained (asking staff for direction over and over)... The kitchen is now smoking as I type this..... last visit I was berated because they changed the seating policy (you are not allowed to seat yourself in the vacant bar tables anylonger, apparently, even if they are empty and noone is at the hostess area). Go figure.
