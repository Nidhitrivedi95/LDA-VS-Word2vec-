Da0c8BkSx0gxk5HwoZJiYQ My husband and I went to Corleone's this eve. The food was average at best and not worth the price. We definitely are foodies and we know real authentic and good Italian and this was not it. I got supposed milk fed veal and I know how tender that should have been.....I could hardly cut with a sharp knife! We spent over $100 and hardly got much for it. I am very disappointed and I will never go there again. The portions were average also but in this case that was ok because the food was not that good. One thing I will brag on is the beautiful plants on the patio, they must have a fantastic gardener. If you want fantastic Italian in the same are go to Vivo restaurante on Ridge rd. in Parma and Bruno's in Cleveland by W. 41st. is two outstanding places. You will get great food, large quantities and decent prices at the other places I mentioned.
