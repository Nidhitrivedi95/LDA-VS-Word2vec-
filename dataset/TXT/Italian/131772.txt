ii9kqE9s4456Jn9asz-BPQ Really nice place near the Old Port area in Montreal. This place ended up being off the main street where it was a nice big area for walking and outdoor cafes. Only about a block away, though. It itself had a nice outdoor seating area, but with seven people, they had difficulty accommodating us without a really long wait.

Everything else was fine. Good pizzas we had and others enjoyed the pastas they had.
