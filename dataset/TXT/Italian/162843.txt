Lu5hB_5YtX5Re2067Zf3cg Espresso was good!  Pizza was even better!  Remember the Majority of the staff is very friendly, polite and provide great service!

This Pizza I ordered tasted very good.  It was one of their signature Pizzas (I never order this way - unless it is a signature Cheese Pizza).  This was a (I'll call it "thin" crust) Pizza with two types of cured Peppers, Salami, Sausage, fresh Basil leaves (whole leaves), Buffalo Mozzarella and a tasty Tomato Sauce!  While the flavor was very good the Pizza was Totally Beautiful as well! I'm picking on someone when I use the word "Totally" in case they ever read my reviews!  I would not chose this Pizza again, though if someone else chose it I would eat it again!  I prefer minimal toppings so It took a while to figure out why this Pizza was soggy in the middle (it was cooked perfectly) and the Sausage was the only ingredient I was not a fan of!  If this had been a sausage pizza it would have received half as many stars or less!

So far I have only been here twice, the food was very good both visits and I will return because if this multi-topping Pizza was this good I imagine a three topping (Basil, Cheese and Tomato Sauce - OK maybe that is considered ONE Topping) Pizza would suit me fine!
