jM6JjZXFAQQANwdlEwbH3g I get lunch here for work because it's the closest place to get a latte for my boss but the service sucks. The coworkers argue and give each other attitude in front of customers, the wait for our pickup order is long even if I come later than the expected time, they've messed up our order a few times, and they're always understaffed.

The food is mediocre at best and inconsistent. My last order was a ceaser salad which was drenched and the gnocchi was horrible. Honestly, an omelette is the safest thing to get here.
