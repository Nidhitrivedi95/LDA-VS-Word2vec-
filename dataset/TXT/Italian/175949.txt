NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ Being from the east coast it is hard to find authentic pizza and pasta places around here. Montesano's does it! Their bruschetta is amazing. It isn't traditional hard, break your teeth, baguette bread. Instead it is served on their garlic bread, topped with huge chunks of fresh tomato, onion and basil. I could eat it every single day. Their portions are HUGE!

The only thing I don't recommend is their shrimp cocktail. The shrimp looked and tasted like they had just been thawed from the freezer. 

Beware: You have to wait quite a while for your food. They warn you of this in their booths, however even when it is slow the wait can get a little frustrating. It is SO worth it though!
