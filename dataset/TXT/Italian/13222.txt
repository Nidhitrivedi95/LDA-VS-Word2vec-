15YuEFO59yXd7BTO5NZgYw This is a very nice family Italian restaurant. We went here after another place was packed with people. Vito's was also full, but the manager rushed forward to accommodate us--immediately.  We were subsequently doted on by a variety of waiters, bartenders, and hosts/hostesses. Might have been a result of lower organization, but they were all trying to please. Some small mistakes in service were always met with apologies and making them right--the way it should be. The food was very good, ranging from veal parmesan, cheese pizza, salmon piccata, and Caesar salad. Nothing five star, but fresh and substantial. Drinks were topped-off without asking, everyone friendly, prices reasonable, and ambience authentic. Well done!!
