Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA Second time visiting. Our server was new and it really showed. I asked for the details on the barrel aged cocktail and she didn't have a clue, requiring help (that was never provided) from another server and finally giving up having the bartender talk to me. I'm ok with having the new person because everyone is new at one point. I just think the management could have trained her better to be more successful in her job. She tried very hard so this is not a knock against her. 

On to the food and drink. 

The pizza was good. Not great, but above par for the style. My friend said it was a little "floppy" for thin crust considering the crust was a little burned. 

Calamari was excellent. No issues here. 

The romaine salad was good, but far overpriced. Should be $4 and not $12 for the amount provided. 

Once I finally got the barrel aged drink squared away, a tequila based negroni, I was pleased. Very unique and flavorful. Not an ordinary negroni by any means. Two for two on the barrel aged drinks I've had here. 

In summary, not perfect but very good overall. I will go back as it's hard to find consistent food in Vegas.
