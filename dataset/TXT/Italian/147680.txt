kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Nice atmosphere. For the price, very average quality.  Good wine list. S'mores dessert was good but not quite up to what I hoped for.  More graham cracker please. And let the marshmallow seem identifiable. 

Waiter needs more training and menu is way too expansive.

Lots of solid competition in the area. Central bistro did not woo me to leave my other favorites.  I'd go again but it's not on my list of choices.
