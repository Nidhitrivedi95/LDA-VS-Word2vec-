B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw I LOVE Gusto, I go fairly regularly with my girlfriends...Thursday nights sometimes the line sucks but the kale salad and the mushroom pasta are worth it!!! Also dollar an ounce wine obviously helps! I tell everyone I know to go here!! 
This is the first night I have had an experience that really made me think I wouldn't come back/recommend (and more realistically I'll probably come back, but just be jaded...as the pasta is that good)  
Worst off it had nothing to do with the food! 6 friends and myself went for a dinner and when the bill came we opted to split it as some of us had a few drinks and appetizers while a couple didnt at all so we figured it wouldnt be fair to just split the bill...so I did the math thinking it was better than asking the server to (though considering I used to be a server for 9 years I know how easy it is to split bills....but I don't what system they use...anyways I digress) so I split the bills with a generous tip and we walk out....and the server runs out after us!! which is obviously kind of embarassing for a couple of reasons
I realize this is so server specific, but she tells us we didnt pay our bill fully...so I went back in (redoing the math in my head the entire time) and stood there while she searched the trash for a receipt (so embarassing when you are surrounded by people) and she finds a bill that she "misplaced"...then she says she thinks its ok.....so I asked her to add it up and stood there...  I didnt walk back into a restaurant to be embarassed for no reason on the chance "its fine" so I waited until she tallied it only to realize we gave her over 20% (good considering she wasnt special at all, or even very attentive....did I mention I am also an accountant- you can't doubt my numbers) and was like oh you are right...didnt even expressly apologize or anything
it was just such a bad taste to leave a restaurant in when you have only had great experiences....all in all I would recommend, but service is not guaranteed (mushroom pasta is always a guarantee...just be warned)
