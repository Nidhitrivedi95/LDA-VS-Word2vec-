XguKrY0dAuaK1W6HUlUQ1Q Thank goodness for great local places like Retz. They are our go to for pizza at our house parties. They also have great dine in hours, by being open more often and later than most other restaurants. I've enjoyed everything I've had there from burgers to appetizers. I highly recommend Retz if you're looking for a local, causal dinner.
