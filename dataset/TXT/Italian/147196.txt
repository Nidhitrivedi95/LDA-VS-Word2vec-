k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw OMG delicious, Bootleggers, how I love thee. Your atmosphere, your food, your 24 hour service. Right now I will admit that I am aghast! Your taps aren't working leaving only bottled beer and wine available for purchase. Luckily for me, tonight I planned on wine but my company did not! Not a single craft bottle in the house! Options are something along the lines of "bud, bud light, miller, milllllaaaarrr, whomp, whomp whommmpp...." I was lost some where between the Micaloab River and Coors Island. If I were drinking beer tonight, my 96% of the time booze choice, I would have did a 180 and not let the door hit my butt. That being said, don't underestimate a snob's affection for a craft brew.

Garlic knots on point
