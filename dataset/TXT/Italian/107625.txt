FyKefsWq62xeXpje0Flcig This place is malto bene! The owner is honest and sincere and has a love for his business. The waiter was great and was really good with the kids. Linen tablecloths and napkins, I felt underdressed in khakis and a polo! But everyone was dressed casual....

The antipasto salad served 2 adults and 3 boys.... Fantastic with fresh meats and cheeses, crisp lettuce and artichoke hearts.

The saltimbocca was wonderful and the gnocchi's were cooked perfect.

Enjoy this little, tucked away bistro....ask for a grappa.... Really generous and good tasting!
