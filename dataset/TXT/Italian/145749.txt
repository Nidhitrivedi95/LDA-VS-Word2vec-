K67pkQljTFTW_P-7xUQrFw I spent one long afternoon for lunch here. The place was empy and airy, bright considering it was grey and wet outside. Such a pleasant place to sit and watch Montreal stroll easily in the rain. I ordered caesar salad, it was nothing special. Definitely in the lower range of my caesar rating. The linguini dish that came later was not a disappointment, but just OK. 
I started to wander why there were always crowds in front of this restaurant before dinner? The food was nothing to brag about. It must be the space and the BYOB, with SAC right next door and all.
