djKTruHtS4n_vlfOknxjRw Very nice place, great service, good food.

Good spot for a date, or a casual dinner with the family.

I highly recommend the Butternut squash agnolotti, it's a plain but tasty dish at the same time.  I'm also a fan of the veal parmesan.

My only complaint is that they don't have pizza on the menu, when i go into an Italian restaurant, i always like to have that option.
