02Ycww2etUAxorZb5gIM8Q I used to not understand why people liked cannoli. It was never a dessert that tickled my fancy. Now I know that I'd just never had GOOD cannoli. I have since tried cannoli at Tre Mari and can't get enough. It's the best. Just thinking about it makes me think that I will probably have to go there tomorrow...
