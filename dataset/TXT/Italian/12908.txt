0xzmIBsJQc5eUNLucFrZ0Q Going to Stratta this time definitely made up for the terrible experience the first time I came.  Most of that was due to high expectations and a shitty waiter.

Stopped in for the Taste of Wynn experience. Appetizer, entree, and dessert for 39 bucks a person. That's a deal anywhere, but especially in the Wynn!  

Ordered a decently priced bottle of wine and enjoyed some bread and cheesy bread crunchies with their pesto dipping sauce. Started with the Panzanella Salad; not bad. I've had better (at Panzanella in Sherman Oaks, actually), but it was fine.  Husband thought the Caesar Salad was decent as well. For dinner we had the Bucatini Amatriciana and the Papparadelle Bolognese. The bucatini was much better than the first time I had it. It tasted like it was made with cream though, rather than using good cheese. That was a tad bit disappointing. I wasnt a huge fan of the Papparadelle, but I will say that the pasta did taste freshly made, so kudos for that.  Dessert was a chocolate toffee cake and tiramisu.  We were too full to really enjoy them, but the tastes we had were nice. I particularly thought the chocolate toffee cake was yummy and very rich.

What was most impressive, I think, was that for such a small price, we received full portions and the same quality service if our bill were hundreds more. They've earned my business again!
