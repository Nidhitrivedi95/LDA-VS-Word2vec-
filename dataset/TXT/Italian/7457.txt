0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw Lunch at Joe's Farm Grill was a great idea!  I saw it on Food Networks Diners, Dives and Drive In's and it stuck in my mind as a place that I wanted to try. It was a bit of a drive from where I was staying in Chandler, but it was totally worth it. Before stepping a foot into the restaurant, we fell in love with the grapefruit trees surrounding the building, such a cute area with a lot of outdoor seating. I ordered the special of the day, which was a grilled salad.  It was Romaine lettuce, topped with bacon, tomatos and blue cheese. Oh mama... so damn good. BUT what made me stop in my tracks was the GIANT slice of lemon- seriously it was almost as big as my hand. The salad was really good, and since it was grilled, it gave a nice smoky flavor but it was not over powering.

My only complaint is that we only ate their once.  They had plenty of items on their breakfast and lunch menu that I wanted to try.   I like that they use local ingredients when they can and look for healthy ingredients (natural beef for the burgers and transfat free oils)
