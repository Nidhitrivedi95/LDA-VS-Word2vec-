WCqcYtJ4rUxA4bIzjOfzqg Vapiano is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Everything I've had, whether pizza, pasta, appetizers or dessert, has been equally delicious and well presented. The pasta is made in-house, and other ingredients may be as well. The desserts are off-the-charts, a must try.

There's never any problem finding a seat. The wait for the food is not too shabby and perfectly acceptable as the setting makes for good vibes and plentiful conversation.

If you are looking for a great place to eat at a VERY reasonable price, give Vapiano a try. The negative reviews I've read appear to come from people who have underlying personal issues that create problems everywhere they go. Disregard those comments and go enjoy some good food and a cool dining experience.
