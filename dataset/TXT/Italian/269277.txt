xjjxHavx4RIiW6zS6rasGA Tommy V's is a good. Not Great.  Restaurant is large.  It was not crowded but if it were I would imagine it could get very loud.  Started with prawns wrapped in panchetta with a balsamic fig arugula salad.  Very good.  Entrees were the clam linguine and fettucini bolognese.  Bolognese sauce was great but too much sauce on the pasta.  Could  not taste the organic pasta because there was so much sauce.  The sauce should compliment the pasta.  Not overwhelm the pasta.  The clam linguine was oily and did not have a great clam flavor. Service was good but it was not busy.  The prices were not bad.  $80 with tip for two.  Not sure what other options there are for Italian.  The name "Urban Bar" I think is more for the style of the decor and not for the food.   Good meal but not great.
