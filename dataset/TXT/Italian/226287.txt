sR8AnN3Exc3VJ6Ax3MNT5Q When I saw Tutto Pasta's menu -- a long list of unusual pasta dishes, including some homemade pasta, with quality ingredients and rarer pasta types, cheeses, and sauces -- I was elated and couldn't wait to try it. Unfortunately, my pasta (a spicy daily special with anchovies) was a bit of a greasy salt-fest. I know anchovies are inherently salty, but it didn't seem like the chef made the dish otherwise less salty to compensate. My friend ordered a daily special chicken entree and also felt it was just OK.

The restaurant was gorgeous inside -- and completely empty for a Saturday lunch!! I went with a Groupon specifically for this location, so it appears they are trying to drum up business. I heard it was newer but other reviews seem to indicate it's been open for four years.

They did have a good wine list. If Tutto Pasta could focus on making the food a bit fresher and lighter, I'd gladly come back -- and probably will, just to give them one more try, since they have plenty to choose from besides plain old bolognese.
