abA0s0uxoeOn7zNm-1dDxw Super small portions for takeout options- got a small order of pasta for $5 and ended up with what looked like a side that did not fill me up at all. I was really disappointed because I've gotten the same pasta with the dine-in option and it was much more filling and adequately portioned. Noodles were clearly frozen and vegetables weren't too special. I like that they had tofu and mushroom options for vegetarians, which bumped it up from 1 star to 2 for me. Definitely not worth the price I paid.
