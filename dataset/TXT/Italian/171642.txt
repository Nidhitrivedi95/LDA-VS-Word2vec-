N20Z6CmL1ZnCHYd2aojRyQ I can't say enough about this place!  

Let me start with the staff - definitely what differentiates this place from most other restaurants.  Everyone is not only friendly, but also interesting - it seems that every person has something fun going on.  There are aspiring writers, musicians, pilots, singers, and poets on staff, and they are more than happy to share the latest about what's going on in the arts scene.

The events - I came here for a 3 course dinner and poetry reading.  Definitely value for $.  They have little events like this periodically.

And of course the food - fantastic.  Great gourmet pizza with fresh toppings, fresh pasta, and good quality ingredients all round.  I even enjoyed the calamari (and I HATE squid).  

To sum up - GO HERE (and if you do, ask Collette to hook you up with the "special" olive oil)!
