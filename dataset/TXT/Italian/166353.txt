MDjIylNU6CYq9hR3Qe6hVA Came here for lunch with my mom,  Scaccia is the only restaurant in the immediate vicinity of the building.  They got their express section for patrons who are looking for food on-the-go rather than dine in.  Luckily we came here just before prime lunch time as the tables started to fill up with office employees.
Scaccia usually has daily specials but in this case we both decided to try their scaccia (aka pizza dough sandwich) which is what they're known for. 

**Spinach and veal scaccia served with salad

**Sausage scaccia served with salad: Presentation was bang on, served with a homemade vinaigrette to compliment the salad, the sausage scaccia was quite delicious! chunks of sausage packed in between two slices of pizza dough topped off with a tangy sauce to give the overall dish a kick. 

overall their prices are okay, however when in Yorkville, comes to no surprise.
