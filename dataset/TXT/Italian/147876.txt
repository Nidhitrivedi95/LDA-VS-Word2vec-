KcIalceIg6PSPONvLlI4-w Right by the Terroni on Queen West, this beautiful, newly opened Italian bakery is everything great that the Terroni brand represents. They of course sell espresso drinks, panini, pizza, pastries, bread, cakes, chocolate and gelato. We sat by the window bar drinking our delicious espresso, and I felt relaxed and taken away by memories of Italy. Tried some of their pastries and they were excellent too (too bad I couldn't try them all). Would love to come back for lunch sometime. Even the floor tile is beautiful!
