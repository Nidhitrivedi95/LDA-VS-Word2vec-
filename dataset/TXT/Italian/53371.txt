A2aOwMcP0DxGPr2El7eifA We went there a couple weeks ago and I'm struggling to remember what I had.  At least that means it wasn't terribly bad either. 

My wife had seafood risotto and she said it was just okay. The portion was certainly generous, as she couldn't finish. It had a lot more seafood in it than I'd expect for the price. We shared a Fried Calamari which was also generously portioned. The dipping sauce was really good! I had the Pollo al Masala. The wine flavor in the sauce was a tad overwhelming but the roast potatoes and veggies were yum. Unfortunately the star of the dish, the chicken, was slightly overcooked and not as juicy as I'd like. 

We will probably end up going back some time just to try a couple other items
