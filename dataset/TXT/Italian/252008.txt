VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Became our favorite restaurant while we stayed in Palazzo! We came here 3 times - we tried - eggs Benedict for brunch , ahi tuna tartare for one of the dinners and truffle crab pasta , all the food was amazing ! The ambiance of the place is great, well designed , and restroom's sinks are cute !
