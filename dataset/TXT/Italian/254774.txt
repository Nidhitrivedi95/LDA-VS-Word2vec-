vxadNrpTY7OHNmWsrEpNnA I have eaten at Landmark on various occasions, and have never had a problem until now. 3 of us decide to come in for a quick bite to eat, and this was the closest place. We were seated and after a while or so a waiter comes to take our drink order ( granted they were busy so I will let his tardiness to greet us slide) We get our drinks and there are more people coming in and they are seated. We order our food and patiently wait as we see everyone else receive their orders including the people that came in after us. More time passes by,an hour to be exact ...by this point we are late to where we had to be. I see our waiter attending other tables and we still are sipping our watered out drinks, I give him one more opportunity to pass by without our food, and then I call him over and let him know that it has been an hour and a half waiting on our food, I am tired of waiting and no longer want my food. He explains to me that one of the dishes we order takes time to make, but I am not buying that it takes an hour and a half to make one plate. I wait 5 more minutes and out of utter frustration decide to leave, my party leaves while i go over to the cashier to pay at least for our watered down drinks and saltine crackers that one of us ate, right as I am leaving the food comes out and I was instructed to pay for the food, that I just said i no longer want. The cashier tells me that the food has to be paid for now because it is already cooked. I told them I refuse to pay for food that i am not going to eat. And she insisted that I can at least take it to go and wait even more time for it to be put into a box..needless to say I paid for food that I waited an hour and 45 minutes for that I did not eat. I will never be back, nor recommend anyone else to go there.
