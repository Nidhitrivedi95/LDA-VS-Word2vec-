83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw I agree with the reviewer who said this is not a 4- or 5-star establishment.  It was OK.  I think my home-made bruschetta and canneloni are better.  The service was just OK.  The wine, again, just OK.  In the middle of my meal, a wall-mounted heater began blowing directly on me and my food, making me very uncomfortable and hot.  I asked the waiter to turn it down or off.  He said he would but he did not.  I actually gave him a good tip and am now regretting that!  Anyway, I would not go back to this place, and I am know from previous visits here that there are far, FAR better places to eat in Montreal.
