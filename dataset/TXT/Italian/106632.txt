FTVDICd-uxoEGYh4pU0pcw I am a native New Yorker and I always have a pleasant time when visiting Joey's NY Pizza. The staff is very friendly and the service is great. Joey, the owner, is a great guy and the food is always fresh and delicious. Today I called minutes before closing (I didn't know they were about to close) and they still had a whole pie prepared for me and waited for me to drive up from Inspirada. That earned my loyalty even more!
