99j5vhhtFJIefXDLsmA29Q You know you find a good place to eat when there's a line out the door and a smile on everyone's face in line. My husband and I are new to the area and we're craving some wood fired pizza. We found Inizio on Yelp, saw the fantastic reviews, and had to give it a try! 

We had a margarita pizza and a pistachio Pizza and oh boy, it was amazing! The pistachio Pizza sounded like it would be an odd combination, but it turns out it's the best invention ever! 

The staff was kind and prompt with service. John came to our table and asked how we were liking the pizza and of course we told him it was amazing and it hit the spot! He thanked us and left after chatting with us a bit. He later came back to the table and welcomed us to the area with two cannolis! One chocolate chip and one pumpkin. Both of which were to die for!

Thank you John and the staff at Inizio! We had a great experience and look forward to returning!
