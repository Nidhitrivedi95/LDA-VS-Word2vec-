pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Just tried the new location last night and the food is still my favorite Italian in LV but they really need to do something about the lighting, it felt as though there was a spotlight on us, very uncomfortable. The noise level is also an issue, we couldn't even talk to the person sitting next to us because the music was so loud. I do like that they now have outdoor seating so I'm hoping that if they adjust the issues with the lighting and noise I will be able to go back and give it a 5 star.
