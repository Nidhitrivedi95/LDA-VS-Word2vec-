sKy8HkP6X-8dCKq_SzeIpw Even when I feel like something fell short (service wasn't super great or the food was a little over done (on the really packed out nights)) I always enjoy myself here!  The food really is delicious (*creative* vegetarian dishes are kind of scarce, this place has options, so that alone keeps me happy), the drinks are always spot on, and the staff are engaging and entertaining.  Even if I visit and feel that only two out of those three were met that night, I'm still smiling when I leave, and stoked to share with friends and colleagues.  I even had my birthday dinner there in May and they were super accommodating.

I love this place!

Plus it's just off the light rail so we can sober up and let our bellies settle on the ride to our car :)
