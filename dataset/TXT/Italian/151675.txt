KPKQLzVKqLgEPKOWrSCRtg Came here for lunch for a work meeting, and was overall happy with my visit. The service was great and the food was pretty good. The decor is also really cute here- they had the entire place decorated for fall. I wouldn't say this is authentic Italian- it felt more like Americanized Italian, but the meal I had was still pretty tasty. I ordered the romano-crusted chicken salad. The chicken was really tasty, and the salad was quite fresh. The creamy parm dressing was delicious as well. The prices here are a bit steep, but overall we had a really great meal. I would come back for another business lunch meeting, although I don't know if it's worth driving here from the South Hills for dinner.
