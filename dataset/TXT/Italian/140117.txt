JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw We liked the overall service. Food was 3.5 out of 5. The Moussel Frite was excellent! But the fish, the spaguetti bolognese and the Veau were a little "unsalted".
We were very well atended, 5 stars for that! She even wrote "obrigado" in our bill, and we didn't tell her we were Brazilians.
Price was also very reasonable, less than 25 per person, plus tip.
We recommend this restaurant, specially if you go there for Moussel Frite!
