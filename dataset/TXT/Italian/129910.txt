i7NqPkLgLEBApeoBsPNvyA First time lunch experienced with a co-worker.  Attentive service and very good food.  We were served hot bread right away which smelled delicious and tasted wonderful.  We both enjoyed the Cesar salad which was perfectly dressed, and we split the Margherita pizza.  The pizza was good but was missing the tomatoes.  And we split the Profiteroles which was a tasty dish. 

There was Italian music playing overhead at a soft volume so they must have corrected that from another review. But whatever station or CD they were using included Christmas songs!  But it was snowing a little so could have been just showing a sense of humor. 

I would definitely return. Would be a good place for a larger group lunch.  Plenty of space and a nice menu selection.
