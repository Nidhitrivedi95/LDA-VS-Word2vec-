OOXUDZVOREgjwrLiwr3Spg A friend of mine and I went on at Thursday afternoon around 4PM. Only a few other lanes were taken and we were able to get three games in for the hour slot that we had. As we played, we got a few appetizers and a pizza to share. Service was good, prices were great and the food was yummy! This was my first time visiting (not hers) and I will definitely be back!
