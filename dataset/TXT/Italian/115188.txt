GQAvKHDfuBws7312iIqX6Q I think this is some of the best pizza in town. I haven't tried anything else on the menu because I can't get by the pizza. So good. Even cold the next morning.
I haven't been here in awhile because they changed their special but I was craving it so I called up and ordered an extra large cheese. The only real pizza is cheese pizza, in my opinion.
The staff has always been friendly to me. Even forgiving change when I didn't have it. Even last night someone else was picking up their order and the total was $X and 52 cents and he didn't have the 52 cents and they said don't worry about it. Not a big deal but a nice small thing not many places do. I had been in there enough that when they changed their special awhile ago they gave me the old one one more time. Again not a big deal but still cool.
Definitely a family owned restaurant. Small and covered in New York decorum all over the walls. A friend at work introduced me to the place and we used to get pizza all the time at lunch. I will still go back when I get a craving but just not as often as I did and only because they changed their special and work is just a little farther way now.
Still really good pizza though. Some of the best.
