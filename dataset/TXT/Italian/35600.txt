6okGKL2PA7kkc-GjZzNHnA I've eaten here twice; once on each of my last two trips to Madison. I'll eat here again before I leave.

I am somewhat a creature of habit. When I try an "Italian" restaurant I want to know if it is "Italian" or "italian". This is easy to do. Order the marinara. It is a simple dish that most places don't bother to do right. But a real Italian restaurant will take the time to do this right. That means sauteing tomatoes and spices together, but knowing when to stop. And none of that "al dente" nonsense with the noodles...that's for fat Gourmands in bowties without friends, not for people who just like good food.

I am pleased to say Johnny's gets it right. The gravy was magnificent--neither acidic nor sweet with lots of tomato and oregano flavor. MMMMM MMM!

I had a "side Caesar salad" which was made with crisp, fresh, clean lettuce, parmigiano cheese, and a tangy, but not quite excellent dressing. It seems to lack the fishy flavor from the anchovy paste. Some folks leave that it, but if you do, that is NOT Caesar dressing. The anchovy is the core of a good Caesar.

I took my order to go, and that is where the fifth star went. $10 for a plate of spaghetti and nothing else. The menu says it is served with garlic bread but I received this neither when dining in nor when to go. Also, don't be so stingy with the napkins and not so cheap on the plasticware...the knife needs to be strong enough to support a noodle.

The staff are friendly at the bar, professional elsewhere if not overtly engaging.

Overall, a very pleasant experience and, as I said, I will be back!
