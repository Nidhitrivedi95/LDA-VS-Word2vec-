QcV8KIPKbGRnWQPql55bKQ This place was recommended by a friend but was terrible.   They delivered the wrong pizza and when I called them about it they acted like I was putting one over on them.  The first person I talked to said they could give me a discount next time I order but they couldn't bring the right pizza.  I had to talk to the owner to get them to send the correct order. 

This is terrible customer service.  Two hours after I ordered I still have no food.
