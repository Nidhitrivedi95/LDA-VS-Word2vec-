8un5h1h8NXs0hzeVraaPbA I had flown in from NY that day and by 2:00pm I was starving.  I was staying in a hotel a block away and decided this was the closest restaurant to just walk to, get in, eat, and get out.  The parking lot was jammed with cars so I wasn't expecting great service.  I was proven wrong.  Service was exceptional and the food was to die for.  I can't wait to return.
