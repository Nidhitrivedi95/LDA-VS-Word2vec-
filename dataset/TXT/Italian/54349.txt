aadG1TzULt-ezzUJZUSSJQ Review is based solely on my Winterlicious experience a few days ago. We were really excited to try this place out. The place was buzzing and had a really vibrant crowd on a Friday night. We had reservations and were immediately seated. 

We ordered a bottle of red. It sucks seeing the LCBO right across the street and knowing the same $35 bottle we had cost about $11. We both had the meatballs to start. They arrived cold in the middle. Another small thing that I noticed, the plating was different for the same dish. I'm just a fan of consistency. I have to say, the meatball sauce was great. A shame that they didn't serve any bread or something to soak that deliciousness up with.

The mains were grouper. Nothing fresh about it and again, the sauce was better than the actual hero of the meal - the grouper. To finish we had the donut (meh) and the bread pudding - amazing! 

Our waitress was absolutely awesome, which directly attributes to my only positive experience with this place. Like I said, this was the Winterlicious menu and maybe their regular menu serves up a better experience. I'd go back to try their regular menu though.
