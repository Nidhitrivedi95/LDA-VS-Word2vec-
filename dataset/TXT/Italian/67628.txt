We started with the caprese and the lobster bisque. The caprese was done with fresh burrata cheese and perfectly ripened tomatoes. The bisque was tasty, especially when paired with the fresh breadsticks.
My husband had the adobo nation, which is a braised pork belly and chicken dish. The flavors were beyond expectations. It's served with a risotto. He was really happy.
I ordered the Linguini alla  Mediterranean. The seafood was perfectly cooked and tender. The flavors of the pasta and sauce were fantastic. 
This visit reminded me of my trip to Italy. I will be back!
