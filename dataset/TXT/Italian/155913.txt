L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw I wanted to check this place out since it came on my feed a few times. I was in the area doing some shopping, so it was the opportune time to try this place.

Staff: We were greeted at the door and had the option to wait 20 minutes for restaurant seating or be seated in the lounge area immediately. They both had full service so rather than waiting, we opted for the lounge area. The gentleman serving us was nice and helpful but he always seemed MIA when we needed him for something. Food came a little slow but they apologized when it came so that can be forgiven. It was Family Day/Valentine's Day weekend so it was busy.

Ambience: The seating was kind awful. The stools we sat on were cushioned but tiny and I kept sliding off. My life flashed before my eyes a few times. It was all quite harrowing. We were seated on the long table so it was a shared space which we were fine with. Tragically, hooks were only on one of the short side of the table and we happened to be sitting on the side with no hooks. Even the waitress conceded that it was a poor design. Did I mention our waiter's look of fear as he fumbled along the window to serve wine to the party next to me due to the lack of space?

Food: It was all hit and miss. I chose the Sausage Pappardelle which was heavy on the wine in the wine sauce, but tasty nonetheless. The pasta was ridiculously long and thicker than other pappardelle I've had in the past, so I wasn't a huge fan. For dessert we had the Brownie and it was wonderful, but the caramelized popcorn served with it was very hard.

Like I said, it was a hit or miss with food and I'll probably forget this place.
