EQxkMoPq_3FlClrYop58_Q Terrible service, Filthy washrooms..  Paid for my order, was told it takes 20 minutes, returned 30 minutes to pickup my order. Gave my receipt to the cashier lady, she walked away without saying anything. Waited patiently for 20 more minutes, asked for my order, the lady asked for my receipt. After telling her that she took it and telling them what my order was, they told me it had been ready for a while... Well, I'm never going back to any Pizza Pizza.
Is not the first time I've had a bad experience at pizza pizza(s).
