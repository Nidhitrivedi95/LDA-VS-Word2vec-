Pe-vwHAn4Gnxp8g6e4HFLQ I didn't enjoy my experience here. The service was horrendous. We had a 5:45 pm reservation on a Saturday evening. My group of 15 arrived early and were seated promptly enough but it took a really long time to get water. We ordered and we didn't get our entrees until 7pm. My side plate from our appetizers was sitting in front of me and the waiter made no move to move my plate for my entree. He placed my entree on top! He could have asked for help, I would have moved it for him. At no point did the servers ever come to ask how our meal was, to refill our water, to refill our bread or simply to check in. That would have been nice since our entrees took such a long time! Considering this restaurant wasn't full for a Saturday night - so that's a signal as to the kind of service you are going to get. It took a long time to get the bill and the waiter practically grunted at me to move over so he could clear my plate. I'm quite disappointed. To add insult to injury it was an automatic gratuity in which I felt they did nothing to deserve.
