dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw My wife and I were wandering around looking for a good dinner spot for the following night when we walked by Fiamma.  We looked at the menu and decided to try it.  Am I glad we did.  It was one of the best Italian meals I've ever had in my entire life and possibly the best.  First, we shared the buffalo mozzarella salad which was amazing.  I asked the waitress (who was very helpful) what she recommended for an entree and she told me the most popular dish was the short rib ravioli.  She called them "little pockets of love".  I had it and she wasn't lying.  Overall, great service, great food, and reasonably priced for a nice Vegas restaurant.  I highly recommend.
