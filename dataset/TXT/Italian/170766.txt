MWYJl-bIxhtQ-4Kg3ENUxA I really love thin crust pizza so I'm always happy with Rosati's. The sauce has some nice zing to it and there's the perfect amount.  In the past, the cheese seemed a little skimpy to me so I ordered extra this time and it was definitely better.  The pizza came really quick, was hot when it got to my hotel, and the delivery guy was very friendly.  I will order again!
