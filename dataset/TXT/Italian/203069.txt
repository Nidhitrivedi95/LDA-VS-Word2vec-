We enjoyed the singer doing Sinatra songs while walking aound the room. The food is very good with the portions being enough to fill you up. Consequently we did not have room for dessert. The chicken picata with garlic mash was excellent as well as the veal picata with mushroom risotto. The only downside to the food was the crusty bread was dried out on the inside.
The night of our visit the service could have been better. First our server did not offer us water. She seemed to disappear for a while and we had a hard time flagging down another person to help us. The restaurant was full. There was a group of about 20 people at one table. They could have had more servers. Resolving these items will add other star.
