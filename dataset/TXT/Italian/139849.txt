JH3zKlfslbSVeA_KsAaRRQ New to the Winterlicious roster we just couldn't pass up a chance to try Splendido. 

We've done winter/summerlicious a few times since moving to Toronto a few years ago with less than stellar results so thought we might be making a bad choice when we agreed to a 9:45pm reservation (the only time left on a Thursday night). 

Luckily, the meal was delicious, the service was formal but not pretentious as others have criticized, the food was fantastic and overall we were very pleased with the experience.

If you want my opinion the scrambled egg starter was just okay. I thought it was a bit of a bold move as an appetizer and although it was paired with a delicious truffle sauce it just didn't do it for me. 

The duck main course on the other hand, ooooo lala! This was tender, moist and full of delicious flavour. Also, I highly recommend dropping the extra $5 and splurging on the brussel sprout side. They were char boiled to perfection.

The cheese platter was no one's taste at the table but the chili, lime, chocolate cake, worth the visit. The chili was subtle but present, the lime was in gelato form and the chocolate cake was just decadent.

We left with full warm bellies and coupons for 20% off our next visit.

Overall Splendido is a place worthy of a Winter or Summer licious visit. Bravo Spendido. You've broken my trend of mediocre 'licious' experiences...now that that's out there, good luck getting a reservation the next time one of these events come around.
