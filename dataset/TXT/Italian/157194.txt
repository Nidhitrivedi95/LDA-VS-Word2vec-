lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ I was interested in Buca due to the affordable prices and then really fell in love with the menu.  It was a gamble to get my wedding catered by a restaurant I had never tried before but it was recommended by a friend so I figured. Lets do it. 

I called only one day in advance! The general manager was super helpful. I think his name was David. But there's two David's who work at that location.

It was truly an awesome experience they were early and fast and efficient. They kid brought the food all the way to my room on a cart.  All of my guests were really impressed with the food. My son only ate the bread because he never likes anything so I thought that was nice they had a package to purchase that offered bread.  My husband doesn't eat vegetables or spaghetti sauce so he ate the mac n cheese pan. And everyone else ranted and raved about how good the spaghetti and meat sauce was and the salads and the egg plant Parmesan was absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much for making my day even more special.
