LWwAMZUiH6iBaL4a6jGRWw Was excited to try this place for years...wasn't worth the wait. The calamari that came out in a paper bag was just ok. My wife and friend had Caesar salad and I had the minestrone(which was obviously sitting on the rail cooling until the server decided to bring it to out table). The three entrees...shrimp risotto and Tuscan steak were mediocre while my wife's chicken Marsala was horrible and sent it back with an offer from our waitress to bring a dessert on the house.  Had to wait about 15 minutes for a margarita to be brought...then when the complimentary dessert was brought up the waitress said "if the boss will allow it".  Needless to say...we didn't have the dessert that was offered in place of a horrible entre.  We're staying at the Sunset Station for 10 days and most likely will not be back!!!
