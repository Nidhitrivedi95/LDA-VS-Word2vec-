V6MWAv-xv4dgSUrDU1qxaA Sitting in here right now. Had my food messed up four times. Went to the person I had dealt with everytime who had been treating me well and asked for a refund on my meal because I was growing frustrated with the wait and I wanted to go across the street and get something to eat at chick fil a. All of a sudden a manager who was in a dress not in uniform with no name tag or indication that she was an employee started to tell me about how the meal I ordered came with something. I had to argue and tell her 3 times I had asked for it without it and the meal I ordered didn't state on the menu what they put in it. Regardless of whether it was or not you don't argue with your customer who's pissed off about not being able to eat while his table feasts. Horrible and despicable service from a manager. I am 19 years old and can properly handle angry customers what a shame to see a great company with such rude and childish management. Also to the female employee who dropped the silverware on the table in disgust have fun working a low paying job for the rest of your life
