_qA2HPqgLiBc-M4wRyml0g I went back for lunch and grabbed the chop salad to go along with another focaccia since it's free with check in :) The salad didn't have an overpowering flavor but I didn't think it was bland, I thought it was delicious. My only complaint was the lack of salami. When I first dug into the salad I thought they forgot it. I picked through and found five little slivers (think chiffonade) of salami.  If I'm ordering a chop salad I'm expecting a balance of meat cheese, and veggies. The cheese was great and much more of a generous portion. I would only order the chop salad again if the meat portion matched the cheese portion.
