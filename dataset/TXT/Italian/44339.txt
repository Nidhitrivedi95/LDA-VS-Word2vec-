Service was prompt although not entirely knowledgable. We had quite a few questions because the menu has some unique options. We tried the bread and spreads. The bread was freshly baked and warm. We also shared the eggplant and goat cheese dip which had such a great flavor combination, especially with the toast. My boyfriend got the duck breast confit with foie gras and tortellini. The pasta is made in-house and was delicious. The duck melted in your mouth. I tried the tomato tart. The buckwheat crust tasted almost burnt and wasn't the most palatable. It's a bit pricy and wouldn't be the best place to go if you were starving but is ok if you're just trying to munch and try some unique food.
