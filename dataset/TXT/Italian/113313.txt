Gh-qmVwvibLnNdqEZXcQHw I HAVE BEEN GOING TO EURO CAFE FOR OVER 15YRS but after today I will never return!  I have never been treated soooo rudely in my entire life! The waitress was GREAT- it was Mr. Romeo himself.  I was invited by a family member to lunch along with my mother.  Mr Romeo participates in program for business which gives vouchers for trade. On these vouchers in states DINE IN ONLY.  My siser was given these vouchers as a bonus from work. We used the value of the vouchers plus we purchased dessert. When it was time to pay the waitress informed us that we can only use these for TAKE OUT-We showed her that it says DINE IN ONLY-so she went to get permission. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS GOOD! Mr Romeo is by no means a little man-so when he enters a room people look. He walks to our table that is surrounded by other guests and says "LETS NOT DO THIS AGAIN!"   "Next time its for take out only, When i'm not here some waitresses may allow this but when it comes to fri night-I need the money!"  "I can't keep doing this,,so please help me ou here!"  We sat there like 3 little kids that just got scolded for stealing!! Everyone was watching and listening-we were mortified!  It's Simple MR. ROMEO-IFYOU DO NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM THEN GET OUT-DO NOT HUMILATE YOUR GUESTS.  I WILL BE LETTING A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW HOW WE WERE TREATED. FYI-You could have handled this in such a better way!
