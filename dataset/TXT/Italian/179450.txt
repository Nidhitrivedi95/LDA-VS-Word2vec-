nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A I honestly had a hard time finding things to eat here as a vegan. I opted for the whole wheat penne pasta with roasted vegetables - mostly mushrooms! It was delicious, aside from the mushrooms. I'd prefer if it was listed in the description what the veggies were! Otherwise, seems like an average Italian restaurant to me.
