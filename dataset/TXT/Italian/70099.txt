By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g D.O.C.G is a casual Italian restaurant created by Scott Conant. It's located right next to his upscale Italian place Scarpetta on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan. Both places are not a disappointment! 

I Was excited to learn that in past few months D.O.C.G added lunch to their hours. Stopped in on Monday afternoon & sat at the bar. We were waited on promptly by a friendly bartender and greeted by a manager. Along with the lunch menu they showed us their dinner & happy hour menus for future reference. Looking at all the menus we ordered meatballs to start but they weren't on the lunch menu. However, they we able to make them for us. Glad they did. Wonderful! Next we split a Caesar salad & the Soppressata Picante pizza. The salad was perfect & not overpowered by garlic. The pizza wasn't greasy, nice amount of spice, and had a light, chewy crust. We enjoyed it all... Definitely will be back.
