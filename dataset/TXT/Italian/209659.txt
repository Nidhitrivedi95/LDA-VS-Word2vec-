qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA A Nightmare on Thanksgiving!!!! Posted rate of 39.95 for Buffett. The when you get there were charged $21 for glasses of water that we had to flag someone down to get! No one ever waited on us and our table of four was charged an 18% gratuity!! We could not have been more disappointed and felt very taken advantage of.
