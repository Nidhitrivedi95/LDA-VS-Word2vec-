VUOn9pztnaEX49Xfb_9L7A Part of me doesn't mind at all that other people just don't get Osteria. 

It just means those of us who do get to keep it to ourselves, and I'm all about that. 

The beau and I dropped by for a late Friday night dinner and walked into a pack restaurant with live music (Rick and Sharona, again) and dancing! But not douchy club dancing--we're talking Frank Sinatra tunes and classy dancing. I seriously have not seen people having this much fun out in a while. 

And once again, the food did not disappoint. We started with a caprese salad and the crostini misti, which were delicious as always. Then came out the hot sex on a plate, also known as the orecchiette pasta in a tomato basil cream sauce with Italian sausage. One bite and I wanted to roll around in the plate. Oh, and don't sleep on the ricotta and spinach ravioli with fresh peas and tomato basil sauce. Super fresh, light and just perfect all around. 

We also asked the server for an easy drinking wine and she came back with a bottle that was quickly gone. So good. 

Awesome vibe, atmosphere and food mixed with fantastic live Frank and dancing. How could you go wrong?
