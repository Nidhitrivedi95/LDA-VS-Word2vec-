nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow How can you tell if a restaurant is good or not?  Order the simplest thing on the menu and try it.  Well my mother and I did just that and we both loved it.  My father pretty much hates Italian food yet still found something that he liked.  Very cool that you can pick potatoes as a side too.  Not everyone loves pasta.  The old Italian-American guy complaining about the long line for table was funny too.      

Yelpers who ordered seafood and complained about it:  Why on Earth would you order seafood in a land locked state and expect it to be fresh!?  This isn't Vegas.  Casinos aren't even legal here.  You really think a mom & pop place in Ohio is going to pay to ship fresh seafood on dry ice?
