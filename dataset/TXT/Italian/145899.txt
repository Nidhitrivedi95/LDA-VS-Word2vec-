K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ So far, so good. Friendly staff, great decor, good music, nice ambiance (cool mix of people), and free drink tickets. Had heard a number of rumors about the venue; however, I wanted to experience it for myself first. If you want an awesome view of the fountains, try coming early. When we got here the tables overlooking the fountains were booked and full so we couldn't really see, but from what I could see, the view is spectacular. Will definitely be back and hopefully next time nice and early.
