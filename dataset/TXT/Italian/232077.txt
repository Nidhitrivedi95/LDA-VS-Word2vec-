TIYnquDIPdYmVJK4GNeXSQ $17 pasta that tastes like plastic? No thanks. Unless butter is your favorite "flavor" I'd opt for something else. 

Now I remember why I stopped visiting chain restaurants... OG has definitely gone way down hill as far as quality goes. And to top it off, their prices are through the roof for what you receive. GO LOCAL; better quality good and a better deal.
