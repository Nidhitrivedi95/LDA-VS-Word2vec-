tpesKzKbcPFekdThYZ4UpA Have been going here for many years. Have taken people from out of town here on many occasions and we generally have enjoyed it. Its nothing amazing, but its always decent. Last time we went will probably be my last. Bar Italia must have some managerial problems as the staff are totally incompetent. Our server seemed like she just arrived from Sudbury and was reading from a script. Had no clue how to interact, had no idea about the menu. Its like all the staff were sick and she is the alternate that gets called up a couple times a year to fill in. Had to ask over and over for simple things. When you are looking at your date, in a "What the hell was that" manner, more than once in an evening, you know somethings wrong. Get it together Bar Italia or you will be out of business soon.
