1lujZNJqP5s966L0PRmRrg I have always been a huge fan of Rocky's. I frequently go to the one off the beltline. I always have great experiences there. However this location is a disappointment to the brand. The place is dated and dirty. The pizza and bread sticks were clearly not fresh and were severely overcooked, almost inedible. Then to add to the poor experience, the busser in charge of cleaning off the table next to me was making a scene as he cleaned loudly because of his apparent headphones. My experience was dissatisfying in product as well as service.  Will never return to this location. If you are a Rocky's fan then I suggest the location off the beltline. It is clean and food is consistent.
