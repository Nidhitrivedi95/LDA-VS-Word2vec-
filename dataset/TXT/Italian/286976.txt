Zja7ykq3icDzkN20XX6j1w Unquestionably delicious!  I picked this place to meet a friend because of the reviews and I was not ONLY not disappointed, I was wowed.

The staff was one of the friendliest I have ever encountered at a pizza parlor which is very nice.  They chatted freely, came over to the table, asked how we were doing. They wanted to be sure that we were having a good time.  WE SURE DID.  They are very trusting and welcoming.

NEXT.  There was a huge selection to choose from.  I was there for pizza, but some people came in for pepperoni rolls that looked like savory little nuggets of goodness, plus lots of other food that I didn't really pay attention to. (lots of variety)

They had a huge listing of gourmet pizzas, but almost any pizza could be made and served by the slice.  My friend ordered two slices of something and mushroom and you couldn't even SEE the pizza there were so many toppings.  And they were fresh and delicious!  

QUALITY.

I love white pizza and rarely find any I ever like.  THEIRS IS FANTASTIC.  I want to go back, I will go back, if you haven't gone go now!   

Definitely order a pizza, it's worth it.
