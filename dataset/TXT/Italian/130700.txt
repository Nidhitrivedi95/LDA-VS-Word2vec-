iD_OyIRbLI6IdjCq3LKUkQ Horrible service. Mediocre Italian food. Had the minestrone and linguine di frutti. Mediocre but they were the only restaurant open late. Why does everything close so early in Edinburgh? Whyyyyyy?

Whoever our server was, he must hate his job or maybe a bad day because it reflected his service toward us. Is it because we didn't want wine instead water?
