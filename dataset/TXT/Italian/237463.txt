u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg The food here is great. I have tried nearly ever type of bruschetta and haven't been disappointed- favorites include the tomato jam, salmon, and prosciutto fig. Also the chicken and mozzarella panini is one of my favorite sandwiches ever. The reason why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the service- sometimes it's good and sometimes it's just meh... Regardless, we keep going back for the delicious food.
