Took over thirty minutes to get our salads, only 4 or 5 tables occupied, only happened when we went up to counter asked if we could get the salads!  Took another 15 min (45 total) to get the pizzas, and then we waited for another 15 for our calzone dessert, finally went up to counter, said forget it, take it off the bill.  They had it ready then, and I need to say they gave us free pizza coupons as a way of saying "we're sorry".  

So we were not the only ones frustrated, almost all the tables were waiting a long time, servers were frustrated.  When we left, they had 7 pizzas sitting on counter eating to bake.  A server was fanning one of the two ovens, apparently some problems.  

This was on a Sunday, 11:40-12:45.  Should have been ready for the after church crowd!
