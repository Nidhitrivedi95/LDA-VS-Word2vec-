HYhbeLznSWEl6JIYTllVUA Made reservations for 630 and we were not seated till 650. The cocktails we got were not so good. I had 3 of their specialty cocktails and I just was not feeling them at all. Waitress was sweet, we never waited long for anything, our food was delicious and that's why I'm giving 3 stars.  We had the meatballs and bruschetta. I'll be going back for the food alone, maybe next time we will be seated on time and I think I'll stick to wine.
