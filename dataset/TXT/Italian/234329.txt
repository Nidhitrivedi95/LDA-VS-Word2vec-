TQqhfjlPVEz41K_wAogQSQ I've had Luigis now about ten times in the last year and I must say, I'm a fan. I've only had it for carry out so I can't speak of the table service. 

I truly believe that Luigis makes some of the best pizza in Madison, without a doubt! It's not Neapolitan and it doesn't pretend to be. However, it does sort of on the surface maybe a little bit resemble neapolitan pizza but with a real midwestern twist.

The pizza has been somewhat inconsistant over the last year (mainly in the first few months)  but I feel they've worked out all the kinks.

If you live on the near west side then I highly recommend calling ahead and picking up a double cheese (thick) baddabing to go, with a side of spinach and artichoke dip. Order doughnuts with dipping marinara as well, they make for a great little side.

I don't think I would be sitting down for dinner since I can't have a rum drink here. 

Either way, It's a great addition to the neighborhood.
