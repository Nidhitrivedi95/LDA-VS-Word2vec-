k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw This is where I always wanna stop on my way home from the strip with the wee-hours munchies! I throw 20 bucks in the slot machine, get a couple free cocktails (or waters) and order the baked penne pasta.... so good!!! My friend got the breakfast pizza which was "featured on the Food Network" according to our bartender, but it literally just tasted like scrambled eggs on a piece of cheese pizza. Interesting, but i'll stick with the pasta!
One advantage that Vegas definitely has over my years in California is the late-night tipsy food spots. No more begging cab drivers to take me through a jack in the box drive-thru.....well maybe once in awhile. But baked penne in a classy joint beats curly fries in a taxi anyday!
