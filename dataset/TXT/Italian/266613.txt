x4aHNNo1osWNCB75q_PijQ I have been here twice and both times were excellent.  The pizza is very authentic and delicious.  I love the spicy olive oil they put on the table when the pizza arrives.  I have also tried the caprese and mango salads.  Both were deliciious.  As far as pizzas, I suggest the margherita or marinara.  Both are excellent.  I also had the diavola and that was good, but the vpn pizzas are why I come here.  Very friendly wait staff and the bar tender was great.
