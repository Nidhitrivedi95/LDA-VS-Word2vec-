pdGbbysWAjxHtyXePV1oHQ Great place to stop over on the way to the cottage. Generally hit up Mario's bakery, but decided to give this place a try. In terms of size and selection, this place is big. Plenty of space to sit down. Selection is also enormous. We had a prosciutto sandwich and plate of tortellini. Both were good. They also have a wood oven pizza, gelato etc. In terms of value Mario's is better imho, but in terms of quality both are comparable. But depends on what you're looking for, personally for sandwiches & pizza we'll stop here, for everything else Mario's.
