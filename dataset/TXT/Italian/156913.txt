It could be because I went to a Rosati's in Chicago and decided it was 10 times better.
It could be because the prices were raised WAY too much.

I ordered a pizza I usually get and found out the price was raised $10. In that case, I'd rather get a WHOLE pizza somewhere else for the difference. Cici's all-you-can-eat even sounded good at that point.

I could've bought a large pizza from Pizza Hut and added in 10 boneless flavored wings for less.

I hate to say it, but they're also lacking sauce most of the time. I don't know what it is. That pizza in Chicago will never be topped, even though it's the same chain/recipe.

The pizza wasn't as hot as I'd liked when the price was raised, too.   =[

Sad.
Don't get the wings. Go to Tony's Pizza for that.
