8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA I must say,  everything I've ordered to eat here has been great.  My highlights are the ribs, fall off the bone tender.   And, the chicken piccata, pounded thin with a light caper lemon sauce.  The amount of food you receive is more than plentiful.   We generally take half home for the next days lunch.  They also give you a complimentary brushetta appetizer while you wait for your food.  Service is spot on.  And if you are a Chicago sports fan, you'll be in heaven with all the sports memorabilia!
