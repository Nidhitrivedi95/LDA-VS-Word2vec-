USGPIHHLH-5Q8CvSEvLXYA I'm not that often in here, but it's a good choice if you just want a simple pasta dish without the full Italian restaurant experience. 

They do good lunch deals too, although there's usually too much cheese or dairy in everything for my lactose-intolerant taste so I just stick to the soup.

In the mornings it's pleasant to sit in the window seats by the counter with a coffee and a sticky while you peruse the papers or watch the world go by.
