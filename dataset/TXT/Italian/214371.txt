RHcfJ-l69RbBE4viU0-jwQ I believe this place is actually called Uno Mustachio and in terms of Italian sandwiches in this city, it is certainly in the top five! The sandwiches will run you about $8 or $9 but they are enormous--I can usually only eat half in a sitting. You can do breaded eggplant, chicken, veal, or a combination thereof. My favourite is the veal and eggplant, which features multiple layers of both, and you can add sauce, peppers, onions, etc. They do the regular chicken parm, meatball sandwich, etc, but the real winners here are the eggplant / chicken / veal sandwiches.

It's just consistently delicious. The staff are friendly and efficient. Since they are in the market they do close pretty early (best to get there before 4pm, I think), but it's worth it to grab a sang and a Brio or Orangina for lunch, eat half, and save the rest for dinner.
