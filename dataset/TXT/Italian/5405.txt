_qA2HPqgLiBc-M4wRyml0g My favorite Italian place in the Phoenix metropolitan area! The burrata is AMAZING and the sticky toffee cake is a must have. Service is always incredible - we've had Dorie most of our visits and always ask to sit in her section! I would highly recommend venturing in to this hole in the wall. You can't go wrong with a pizza and the panini's are a great value for the price!
