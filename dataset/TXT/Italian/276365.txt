Yej9s79KJG5r8_aDjJcVlQ I hate to be a jerk and usually will keep my mouth shut if I have nothing good to say but the price you pay for a "medium" pizza is outrageous.  The average size of the slices were no bigger than a chicken wing, I'm not even being dramatic, check out the picture.  

We ordered a medium spinach pizza and 12 garlic parm wings.  The wings were ok but slightly over cooked and didn't have much flavor.  Like I mentioned before the pizza was pretty much personal sized.  The only reason it's getting two stars is because the flavor was actually decent.
