Egd-0nDgzZGEVA0R09yyUQ Checked this place out tonight based on a few reviews and curiosity. I understand that everyone's experience dining is going to be different, but there's no way anyone that's eaten here can say this is good authentic Italian food and if they do they've never eaten real Italian. 

I ordered meat and cheese ravioli mixed... 2 meatballs and we got an order of "garlic bread" The red sauce looked and tasted like condensed tomato soup out of a can that you mixed with too much water, no seasoning whatsoever and personally I couldn't tell the difference between the cheese and meat raviolis. 

The meatballs were definitely balls of meat, but again no flavor giving any indication that they were Italian style meatballs, more like "hey here's some ground beef, toss it in the microwave for 5 mins and see what happens". 

The garlic bread was ok, not good not bad just ok. 

The only reason I gave it 2 stars is everyone there was very nice. I feel a little bad trashing this place because it feels like a family restaurant, but not so bad that I would bother going there again.
