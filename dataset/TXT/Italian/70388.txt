BzerEVgnPcQPr0iFzIO8Aw We went there for dinner on a Sunday afternoon. One of us had eggplant parmigiana, two had pasta with seafood and one had crab stuffed shrimp 
Everyone loved their entree and the house salad as well. They make their own cheesecake and I have to say it's the best I've ever had including NY deli, fancy French and other upscale places. They usually have 3 kinds on the menu. Superb!  Great service, friendly staff, two nice dining rooms. Prices reasonable even for glasses of wine. Go there.
