VnS3kmAmRyHeN9_lMPBp0g My boyfriend and I went here for a late lunch at 3:00. We were both on our hour lunch break from work. I ordered a small cheese pizza and he ordered a grilled chicken salad.  There were only two other tables of two in the entire restaurant.  We place our order and 40 minutes in we still haven't gotten our food and we can blatantly smell something burning.  Five minutes later our server comes over and said the pizza was burnt.  She said it would be another 10 minutes to make a new one.  At this point we have to go back to work.  I'm not sure how it would take any restaurant over 40 minutes to make a small cheese pizza and grilled chicken salad when there were a total of 4 other people in the place.  We had to run through a drive thru somewhere else and scarf down some food at work. Extremely disappointing and unacceptable.
