After having listed to my friends go on and on about the pasta here, I finally went to try this oh-so-delicious place. Its a small place and you place the order at the cash counter and have to option of placing a full or half plate order (comes handy since this is a heavy meal). I had the vegetable lasagna but was totally eyeing the shrimp pasta on a strangers plate. 

The lasagna was pretty good but I would love to try the other options as well.

Brown girl says, "Stranger, why your shrimp pasta smell so good?!"
