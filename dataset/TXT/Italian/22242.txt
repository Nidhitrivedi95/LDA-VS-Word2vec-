3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A I had a couple of days free in Toronto recently and I wanted to visit a number of restaurants and bars with a good selection of local Canadian wines to try by the glass. I quickly generated a shortlist and one of the places that came out near the top was Enoteca Sociale. While they have a focus on Italian wine, at the time they also offered 8 Canadian wines by the glass and the food sounded fantastic.

I arrived around 6pm and although there were already a large number of tables occupied, I was made to feel welcome and this friendly service continued throughout the meal. With the assistance of the waiter, I selected 3 "taste" sized pours of both white and red wines.

After complimentary house baked bread, the first dish served with my white wines was a Grilled Ontario yellow perch with wild leeks and romesco. This dish was superb, there was an amazing balance between richness and acid, with a complex nutty character coming from the romesco underneath. This was a star dish, right at the top of the dishes I tried in Toronto.

The next dish was Lobster spaghetti with tomato, chili and basil. Another excellent dish, great flavour impact and perfectly al dente pasta for my taste. The chili is just a background note, which is important as any more and it would be difficult to balance with many wines.

I did expect Enoteca Sociale to be good as I had done my research and the feedback online is very positive, but it exceeded my expectations and I left extremely impressed.
