TP6hgLCNGkqjFne9nCfaiA I don't get it. 
There are so many things in this restaurant that don't make sense. The dining room was clearly well designed and comfortable, but why are the servers dressed like they work at Olive Garden? It seems as though it was caught in a weird fine/casual dining vortex. 
The menu was pretty boring, if well executed. The service was perfect, but again, those tacky red ties! I think there are so many restaurants in Phoenix at this price-point that are more imaginative and serve tastier food. 
There was nothing overtly wrong, but nothing that made me want to go back.
