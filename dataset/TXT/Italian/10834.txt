0O3H5plJx-Cq2A80qFVW5w Wow!  My boyfriend and I had dinner at LAB last night and had a great experience overall.  The place is so small that you feel like you're part of some exclusive food club but it still manages not to come across as snobby in any way.  Totally comfortable vibe despite the incredible stuff coming out of the kitchen.  We arrived around 8pm and it was very quiet, and because of the size of it I felt like everyone could hear my conversation, but it soon filled up and I got so distracted by my meal I didn't care.

I had the grilled romaine appetizer and my boyfriend had the corn spaetzle.  Both were SO good!  I couldn't believe how delicious grilled lettuce could be.  For our main course we had the lamb meatball and the bibimbap a la French.  We asked for wine suggestions to pair with our meal and they were spot on.  The service was totally personal and attentive, the presentation of the dishes was beautiful and each one tasted as good as it looked.  I would totally recommend this place for a date or dinner with a foodie friend.
