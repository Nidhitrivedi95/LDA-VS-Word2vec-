Z6_gRH_m8FQlKgsNkZKmTg Very disappointed- I so wanted to like this place... started off good, appetizers were good and came out quickly but went downhill from there when not all of our salads came out and the waiter was in a spiral... finally got the salads and they were good. The entries were under cooked and not hot and had to go back... instead of remaking them and presenting them the way they should have been- they were simply thrown into a pan and all tossed together to get hot and then served.  The staff was accommodating and tried to make up for the error by bring out one lava cake with 6 yes 6 spoons. And guess what - the lava cake had no lava as it was over cooked and hard.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.
