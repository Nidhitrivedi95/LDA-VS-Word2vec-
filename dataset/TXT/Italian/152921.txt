We sat at the bar and Chris was our server, he gave great explanations and recommendations on both the food and Canadian beers on tap which I had never had (Beaus & Duggans #9 + another I didn't try). 

I got the Sausage pizza - the sausage is apparently made in house and it is great...it's got a little sweetness to it. My wife got the margherita pizza which is always a good choice.

Since we were roadtrippin we asked where else we should go for brunch the next day as well as Montreal, our follow-on destination. Maja, the manager, came over too and gave us some great recommendations and we talked about the DC area, where we live.

Overall the food and service was top notch. They get extra props for making our roadtrip and experience in Canada top notch!!
