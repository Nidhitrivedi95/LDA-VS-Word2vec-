Great local Italian restaurant. High quality at an affordable price. I wouldn't necessarily say it's neighborhood pricing but the portions and quality match the price and then some. Entrees range from about $17-$25 on average with meats a little pricier. Appetizers are really expensive in the $15-$20 range but are larger, family style offerings. 

We had a chicken Parmesan and a seafood penne with vodka sauce. We also had a bottle of wine for a great price and the caprese. The caprese was enormous and easily shareable - a nice starter. We ordered our entrees extra extra spicy and the chef did not disappoint. The sauces had some type of pepper that really burnt the lips - perfection. The dishes themselves were fantastic for entrees and the spice level was perfect. Props to the chef for delivering on spiciness as we hoped for. 

Mastrioni's has takeout options as well as a nice dining area with a bar and a few tvs. Staff is great and alcohol prices are very fair. Open for lunch and dinner, this place is a great local Italian option in Summerlin for a meal.
