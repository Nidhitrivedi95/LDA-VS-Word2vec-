d1_Ko1DQ4QyB9BjnCFjVLw When you would like to pull over to the side-street of life for lunch or dinner, this place has charm and great eats.  The antipasti has cantaloupe, salami and peperoncinis plus black olives married in a delicious home-style dressing.  You must try it when you go.  All of the pasta dishes I've tried have been above average, homemade and fresh.  Thin pizzas are not bad when you're on the run. I love the classic bossa-nova music playing from the 40's & 50's and italian wine garden style dining room is quaint, dark and relaxing.
