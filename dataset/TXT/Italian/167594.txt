Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw I'm so glad my co-worker convinced me to join him for lunch at this Italian Deli. I ordered a spinach calzone and it was big enough to feed me for days. Everything was made fresh and was wonderful. I suggest going here if you're really hungry because of the portions or share with someone. Definitely going back!
