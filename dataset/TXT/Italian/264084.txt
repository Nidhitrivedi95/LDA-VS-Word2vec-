wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg Went back to Maggiano's today...exactly 1 week after my 1st visit. It was busier than last week, but the service was just as good! 
Mattie sat us and was very friendly. She recommended some of her favs as well. Our server (Penny) was attentive and professional. Always there BEFORE the beverages ran out. Very friendly and bubbly. I like that.
The food was great again. I'm really impressed with this location and the staff.
