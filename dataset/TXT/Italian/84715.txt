DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA I have been to Amy's a few times over the last few months and I have to disagree with some of the reviews on here. I'll sum up my experiences upon meeting Amy, Samy and their food. First off, Amy and Samy couldn't have been nicer. Each time I went in for food, I was blown away. Yes, I was curious about meeting them after watching the show, but the truth is that they couldn't have been nicer. The food is as good as it looks. The restaurant itself is immaculate. I've seen Amy herself cleaning up, mopping the floor. you could eat off this floor.  I have tried the infamous Blue Ribbon Burger,  Asparagus Pizza and their desserts (AMAZING!!!) Amy's Key Lime Pie is delicious. Tastes like no other!!! Just to show you I'm not completely biased, I had the hummus and it was good, not crazy about it, but it was good, but her presentation of all of her food looks Great!!! Does the food take long, a little, but do you want food that looks and tastes like crap or food that looks and tastes great. ABC reminds me of why we go out to eat in the first place, Great food and good times to spend with family and friends. First time in awhile that I wasn't asking to use their WiFi:) Overall great experience and definitely a supporter for as long as you'll have us.
