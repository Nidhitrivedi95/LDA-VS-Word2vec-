KuxDPl6UYNLxFChPm0_MNw Came here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised with this place. They have a really nice secluded patio just off Yonge street and they have really good food. I had their lunch special which was an open faced chicken sandwich with a whole wadda stuff and it tasted magnifico. Also tried their tomato soup and it was much better than what I expected (although I wasn't pleased to be unexpectedly chewing pieces of garlic and dried leaves). The chicken and shrimp kebabs were well made and tasty too. The service was a bit slow but the owners / staff were friendly and hospitable. Although this place might be a couple dollars overpriced, I'd say it's one of the better places to eat on Yonge street.

Lunch for two came out to be appx $29 - no drinks.
