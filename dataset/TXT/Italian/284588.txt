zBsAx28cbiUgqWGjKOGucA One of the best and most unique pizza places in Vaughan. Friendly staff, always a fun time. I Was one of the few to try their food challenge... It's almost impossible to do LOL three pizzas each topped with an egg, bacon, pepperoni with the last pizza  topped with 1lbs of poutine  eat it in 35 minutes and it's free!
