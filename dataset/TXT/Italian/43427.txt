7ZBh-3wWVQ5zkd6KZytW0g We had dinner there last night. The serving staff was cool and indifferent. No interaction whatsoever... We were seated 'upstairs .' We had a reservation but it was not needed. We were initially seated next to the pizza ovens. (Kitchen) Our table was 'wonky' so we asked to be seated elsewhere. They were quick to accommodate, and since there were several open 4somes we were immediately moved.
As I mentioned staff was not engaging so why would we let them know that we were celebrating our daughter's  21st Birthday?!
The wine list it extensive... We are not wine connoisseur's so we easily found a $40-50 bottle of Italian Red.
Salad starters were OK. The Caesar salad was bland and totally uneventful. My daughter and I shared the Radicchio/Arugula with feta and olives. It was better- presentation was lacking however. Perhaps sprinkling crumbled feta would have helped. There were 6-8 cut up chunks that got lost in the salad. 
All 3 of us ordered Gourmet Pizzas... 
We might as well have ordered cardboard! The crusts were so hard and dry not even the knife could cut it. The Smoked Salmon pizza which my daughter would always order when living in Paris was dry- no créme fraiçhe to give it texture or flavour. I ordered the Capresse Pizza- same thing, dry and bland. I couldn't find the Buffalo Motz. My husband's as well was tasteless. Not even the Italian salami spiced it up. 
I don't think the server asked us how things were. I don't think he cared to be honest. 
To top off the experience it was hotter than a pizza oven up there. Seriously hot!!! 
The best part of the evening was walking back (on a cold January evening) to the dorm and having Birthday cake with out daughter. 
If this is a new establishment then good luck. I imagine people who regularly dine in Yorkville will make it a one of... I know we will not be returning.
