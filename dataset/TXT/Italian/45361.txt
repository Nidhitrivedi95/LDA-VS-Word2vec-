8lZtLSeJVg28Gb75iklmmQ I have stopped in before for the lunch special with 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. That was good and the right price at just over $6 and change. This visit I phoned my order for pick up and wanted to try a sandwich and pizza with toppings. I ordered a "Bambino" which is their version on a meatball parm. It cost $8.99 and was terrible. The bread, sauce and cheese were good but the meatballs were very tough. I don't know if it was just an off day but I wouldn't ever order anything with meatballs here again. The sandwich did come with a side salad that I enjoyed. The pizza I ordered is called "The Fenway" and has sausage, green bell peppers and onions for toppings. The pizza was just so-so. The crust wasn't able to hold the toppings well. It was $21.99 for the large pizza. Almost $35 for a pizza and sandwich after tax is way too pricey when it doesn't even taste that great. I will stick to stopping by for the lunch special since that is a good deal and tasty. 

Service is good and the inside is clean. I noticed a sign that said they offer catering services. They also offer delivery.
