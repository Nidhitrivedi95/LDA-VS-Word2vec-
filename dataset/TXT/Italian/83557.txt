djKTruHtS4n_vlfOknxjRw Great pasta joint.
Unfortunately I've moved further away from this area, but we still make random visits to Queen's now and then.
They do not have a big menu, however I almost always get an item off their ever-changing 'specials menu'... something different every time I go.
Cute, cozy atmosphere and a great location.
Prefer the upstairs when it is open.
