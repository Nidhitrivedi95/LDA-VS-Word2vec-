59c3Cp-p5i18xFCKUuCkFQ This has been my favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto for probably the past 4 years.  
I'm not sure what I enjoy more, the food or the service and ambiance.  I've enjoyed every dish I've had there; some of my favourites being the Ravioli De Niro, the Agnolloti Di Monte, and occasionally they have a special delicious dessert, Profiteroles!

The service and ambiance is what brings me back their monthly.  This is the type of place where you get lost in your company, and before you know it you've been there for 3 hours yet you still don't want to leave. The owners Fillipo, Massimo and Ciro always have their eye on what's going on to make sure everything is perfect.  
The servers Alex, Nico and Pavol to name a few, are what servers should be. Friendly, knowledgable and very accommodating. I'll never forgot on my second visit there, Alex ran out of the restaurant after my family and I (us looking in our pockets assuming we'd left something behind), solely for him to tell us it was a pleasure serving us and he hopes to see us back there.  Needless to say we were all shocked, but with huge smiles on our faces.  

This place is a triple threat, food, service and ambiance.  If you love Italian food, and are looking to go on a date, a family dinner, or take out some guests or friends..this is your place!
