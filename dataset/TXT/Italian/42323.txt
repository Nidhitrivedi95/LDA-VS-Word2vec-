7qo6rqDjlHds8ObxzxBD4A Went to Brooklyn V's last night for dinner for the first time with my family.  I was intrigued because they were from Staten Island so I figured they knew good pizza.  It is hard to find a good "pie" out in AZ.  The restaurant did not disappoint.  We had the Margherita and the White Eggplant Pizza's.  They we amazing. The dough was light and thin. The sauce was perfect. Not to thick and acidic. The eggplant pizza is a must.  I can't wait to go back again and try the dinner selections.  
The staff was so friendly.  It actually felt like a "family".  Highly recommended.  
They deliver and cater also!
