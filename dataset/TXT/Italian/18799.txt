2QBD8wYCrwgOGRfHKvS23w Holy toppings!! I got a veggie slice and it was overflowing with mushrooms, tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes, onions and green olives. I love pizza with green olives, so this made me very happy! I also ordered a supreme and it had black olives, peppers, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and onions. I probably could've had just one slice, but I am a glutton so that wasn't happening. The crust was thin, crispy and just the right amount of chew. The sauce was plentiful and flavorful. Some of the better pizza I have had in a long time!
