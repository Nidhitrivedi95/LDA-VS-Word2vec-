The flavor was very good and layered well. The bread was fresh but a little disappointed it did not automatically come with olive oil and vinegar but I had to ask. I'm spoiled by other authentic Italian spots that do the traditional stuff. Nice place and I will come again. My daughter loved her spaghetti !!!!
