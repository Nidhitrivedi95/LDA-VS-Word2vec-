LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g Being from out of state, I spent weeks of research trying to find a highly rated restaurant that not only had great food but was affordable, I finally found it at Fellini's. We had a welcome/rehearsal dinner here for my son's wedding with 54 people and it couldn't have turned out any better. Chef Joe was so professional and easy to work with. He was willing to change up the group menu a bit to accommodate us. The food was absolutely delicious and there was so much of it. The restaurant is a quaint little place tucked away on the ground floor of the Stratosphere. Our private room that holds up to 60 people had beautiful murals painted on every wall making the space feel warm and cozy. Not only was food excellent, the wait staff didn't miss a thing, they truly were incredible. Our son and his wife and many of our guests just raved about the food and service. We also ordered a 3 tiered wedding cake that was to feed 50 guests. It was beautifully decorated, super delicious and was large enough to feed at least 70 people. If you're looking for great food and excellent service, this is the place for you. If you can't tell already, I highly recommend this place.
