dPxZI9lrKTl5dvFfnb1_Ig Finally a good real Italian restaurant in Las Vegas! I was born and raised in Italy so I'm very picky when it comes to Italian food, and I can honestly say that Trattoria Italiana is my favorite Italian restaurant. It's family owned and that gives that personal touch that you can't find in the chain restaurants; I met Milena, her husband Ninni, her brother Pasquale, her son Giovanni, Laura the waitress, and they were all so nice to me and my family! I like the atmosphere because it feels like being in a real Italian trattoria, I like the table clothes on the tables (typical in Italian restaurants but not here in the states), the bread is phenomenal, they make it with pizza dough and it's still warm when they bring it to the table, and the list goes on. I and my family will definitely go back to Trattoria Italiana!  

We went there again for my husband's birthday the other day and we both had pizza: it was really good and I'm going to post pictures so you can see what I'm talking about!
