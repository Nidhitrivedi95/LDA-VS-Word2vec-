jZARZjPedelwxgCmVRgBQg Had a spontaneous early dinner here with Mom a few weeks ago after a long day of all kinds of shopping in Robinson Town Centre.  While not particularly life-changing, Carino's did the trick and provided us with some much-needed energy for the drive home and emptying of the vehicle.

I thought the complimentary hot bread and olive oil with dried garlic chunks was Heaven at the time...or maybe I was just starving.  A combination of both, I think.

The Honey Pecan-Crusted Salmon Salad I ordered was a monster.  Huge, much bigger than the photo I took leads one to believe.  I wouldn't say the chopped pecans were "crusted" onto the fish, but, in any event, there was a serious amount of tasty pecans present. The vinaigrette was nice.  Would have liked to see the tomatoes cut into much smaller pieces.

My mom really liked her Spicy Chicken Romano dish, and I thought it was decent taking into consideration that simple boxed dry pasta was clearly used.  Not too spicy at all, and I enjoyed the big chunks of cheesy artichokes.  Did she really order the lunch-sized portion though?  It was quite a pile of food!  Again, my photo doesn't do the portion size justice. 

I found Carino's décor, food quality, and service to be that of a fairly typical chain restaurant:  good in a pinch but not something I'd go out of my way to experience.  A-OK.
