2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg Being here is a little like being at home. I'm from Costa Rica,  used to the  "big coffee experience", the nice treatment and making every cup an enjoyable delight.  It sure doesn't feel like Starbucks!  The food is good, the manager goes back and forth to make you feel at home. The staff is sweet and courteous and will take care of you.
