hcHaWzM5wfdAbCWs4zmmqg Well to start off I haven't really heard much about nodo before coming here. One of my buddies works as the bartender which is where I heard about how good it is (he's an awesome bartender by the way).
So I went with my family, the atmosphere of the restaurant was enjoyed by all. They start off by bringing your table some beans that are a definite must try. 
We then ordered the rice balls which let me tell you.... They are wonderful. Cheese is perfectly melted with a crisp outer covering. 
They then bring you a complimentary bread with an olive oil to dip. 
We then ordered a bottle of wine and some other drinks, which were all super great! 
So now that we were pretty dam full to move on the the main meals.
I ordered the fettuccine, which had mushrooms! My favorite thing by the way and some awesome sauce! Would highly recommend! But f*ck I wish I got the gnocci
My sister had the pizza with mushrooms, olives and artichokes, she subbed the procutto for sausage and it was quite tasty. 
So with all that says it was defiantly a challenge to resist desert so we went for it. 
Have you ever had canelloni? Well If not this is your calling. Crisp pastry with a homemade cream... One end pastaccio, one end chocolate
we got the whole platter so taramasu and chocolate cake all which were mouth watering. 
Our waitress was spectacular and highly educated! But big shout out to that bartender 
Needless to say... Make sure to starve yourself before going and make sure to expand your stomach
