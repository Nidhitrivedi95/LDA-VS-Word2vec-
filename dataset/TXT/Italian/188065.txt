oUvqwPJkorOnYZFKRt0oEg We went there for lunch today. We meet the owner, Frank. I told him that I hated eggplant. So he made me and my wife a sample piece of his eggplant. It was delicious! I still hate eggplant, anywhere but here! I had a lunch special which was minestrone soup, and a dish of sliced sausage and pasta with a delicious sauce. Absolutely fantastic! And the service was great!
