We came here last night.  I read reviews before going, and they were pretty accurate. 
 
Decor and Ambience:  
The decor was pretty nice, the bar area looked good, with a brick or tiled wall.  We were seated on a bench, with a curtain behind us, separating us from some pool tables.  The curtain was very swingy and kept brushing against us.  The bar was kind of loud, but I think that's how it usually is.

Service and Food:
The service was slow.  Our servers were quite nice, but towards the end of the evening we saw a HUGE ANT on our table near the our chocolate mousse cake, and I jumped about 3 feet, and eventually went over to the bar and servers to let them know.  The right thing to do would have been to apologize and probably take the dessert off our tab.  No such luck.  

The food was ok, if not a bit salty (we ordered grilled calamari to start - super salty, and I would totally pass on this next time).  My friend ordered the steak salad, (it looked good), we had a pizza with sausage (ok), and my other friend order gnocchi (weird shape, with what they called a basil sauce, but it was pretty much just tomato).
The cocktails were good - we had kir royales most of the evening.  

If coming here in the future, don't expect speedy service, I'd be wary of the food, if there are ANTS in the dining room, who knows what's in the kitchen.
