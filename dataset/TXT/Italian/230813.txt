My first visit was around November 2012 when they first opened. Wait was long, Service was slow, waiters mixed up several orders and became confused. Plus it was cold outside and the heat lamps were not enough. The chicken meatballs with pesto sauce were to die for! So i wanted to give it another shot. 

Took my cousins there and luckily my sister called in a reservation. Typical Friday night wait of 45mins while we shopped. Upon arriving the guy in the front greeted each one of us and noticed we had a stroller for my nephew so he told them to seat us inside. Very considerate. A little packed inside, but all the restaurants in town square are the same. Our server Pete arrived and told us he'd be back in 2 mins. He came back and to ask us if we'd been there before, he told us all about the menu and gave his own group order suggestions. He then made a few jokes and took our drink order. Good introduction. We didn't really wait as long as i expected. We ordered a half sheet of pizza with sausage which was very large! There were 8 slices and more than enough for us 4 plus a 3-yr old! I myself ordered the turkey meatball with pesto sauce. We added a side of the garlic mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. 

My turkey meatball was very dry. I forgot i had ordered chicken last time. The pesto sauce was completely different, this time it was creamy-but still very good.  

The garlic mashed potatoes were great! I think $5.99 for side dishes are kind of pricey. The mac & cheese was good but not anything special. We could have done without it. 

When we were all full it took about 5mins for us to locate Pete but he came back with out pizza boxed and to-go boxes and our check. 

It's been awhile since i've had service this excellent! Even in comparison to a very high end steak house i'd been to just a few days earlier. So please tip accordingly 20%+!
