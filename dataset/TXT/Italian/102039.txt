We got a hot lead that the breakfast at Carmine's was good and clearly cheap, so we decided to go for it. The spot is freshly remodeled, so the interior is spic and span, and we received friendly, prompt service. 

The $2.99 special comes with two eggs, toast, hashbrowns and two slices of toast. Granted, it isn't super fancy, but it was executed perfectly. I wanted my eggs scrambled soft. I hate egg bricks, but 9 times out of 10 that is what I receive when I order scrambled. Here, they delivered nice, soft eggs. The hashbrowns tasted fresh, and they weren't crisped to death. (I actually prefer my browns non-crisp.)  The bacon was fine, and toast is toast. I really liked the coffee, just a nice, well-brewed java. 

We tried to go back again today, but they stop serving breakfast at noon. Travesty. Guess I will have to eat breakfast with the bankers. 

Note: I haven't tried anything else, so if you go in for linguine and hate it, don't look at me!
