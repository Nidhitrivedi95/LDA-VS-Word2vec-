jaicRYvLNQKT-iquYQ1wAA The food is ok.  It could be great because they use fresh ingredients, but it's too damn salty.  I feel so bad saying that because the service was good and the bread was so freekin fresh!! I'm sorry, but it's just the truth.  Great potential, but an overall 3.  Minus all the salt, it would be a 5.
