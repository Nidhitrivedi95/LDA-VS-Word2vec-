l0aaLW6ZdDXWjUegUECSxg Came for a business lunch with two others today. The three of us were seated rather quickly and offered a free sample of wine, which we declined. 

Our server, claiming it was his first week, was really the lowlight of the visit. Clearly he had either been with Olive Garden for years or was just plain whacked. His antics were cute for the first one-to-two minutes but he never stopped with the jokes, sarcasm and childish behavior. 

We each ordered our entrées, along with the calamari app to share. The calamari comes with two dipping sauces: ketchup and thousand. My lunch, which was Soup, Salad and Breadsticks, was excellent as always. 

Olive Garden is always a solid lunch spot, especially for a quick bite in the working corridor. The server tho?  He has got to go.
