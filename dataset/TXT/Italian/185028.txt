oJSa5HCiZXKLXxggQmecEQ Update- Apparently, app's look small when your at a table with 7 of your bro's! with one babe the app's were huge, prosciutto again which was awesome, king crab leg app was amazing, as was the squid. Tried the octopus main which rivals the octopus at Enoteca, save for the chorizo which just wasnt that awesome (compared to the amazing octopus). Overall there wasnt one bad thing on the menu and i cant wait to return
