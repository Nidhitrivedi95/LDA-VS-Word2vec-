LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g This was my second trip here in this rustic casino-housed ristorante that serves authentic Italian dishes with a twist.  A couple of small dining rooms with townscape murals painted on walls provide the feel of a small family-run trattoria that one might find off a side street in Roma, and servers are friendly and approachable.

As for the food, my party of four began with good complimentary rustic bread with butter served on top of vinegar and oil.  A bowl of scratch-made Minestrone Soup and Caesar Salad were both very good.  Veal Marsala consisted of lean scallops of veal adorned by Marsala Sauce that was neither sweet nor bitter.  Tortellini Alfredo with Sausage was excellent, but the Marinara Sauce was weak in texture and taste.  Once again this experience was very good overall.
