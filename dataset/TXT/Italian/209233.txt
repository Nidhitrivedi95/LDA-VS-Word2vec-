qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg New to Las Vegas from LA and dining out while our frig is being delivered.  Made it a point to come here tonight and wasn't disappointed at all.  In fact during the introduction of MGC's history and food preparation my mouth just started watering.  I chose the Lamb Roast Cabernet and really the best lamb (pulled for that matter) I've ever tasted in my life.  Reasonably priced and their atmosphere with live music is just made my evening.  Strong tips to the musician and MGC as it was a good introduction to how Vegas suburbs is so mellow.
Definitely coming back to check out the rest of the menu since they're only 5 minutes away from my new home.  
MGC.  Did I say MGC just beat out the Persian way of cooking lamb.  Well, I did now.
