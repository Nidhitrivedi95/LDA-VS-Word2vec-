COUJUfrodU-MH4tenlzoXA I was quite hungry after doing a little bit of gambling in the casino, so I decided to stop into the food court for some chow. After checking out all of the choices, I decided on Rosie and Rocco's! The pizza looked delicious and it tasted the same way. We thought about ordering a whole pie, but after get a peek at the slices, we realized they were HUGE! I ordered the margherita, and it was very good. It had half baby tomatoes on it instead of the usual diced tomatoes. I do prefer the diced tomatoes. Its nice to have something easy to grab in the casino that is not super expensive. A quick dinner for 2 under $10 is always a great thing!
