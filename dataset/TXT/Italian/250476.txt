Vnt7TqRmsVTe1U8x558wyA Absolutely awesome place to buy your meat and lunch/dinner!  They have everything from four cuts of steak to their own special marinated ribs!  Lots of lunch meats to choose from and amazing brisket!!!  I took other reviewers advice and ordered the brisket and rolls separately so it wouldn't go soggy for tonight's dinner. I also ordered the rice balls, the pulled beef and meat balls!!  The Mennonite Turkey was fabulous and the salami was as well!!! All nitrate and preservative free!!!!!!  

Very friendly and helpful!  A lot to take in one first visit!  I will definitely be back!
