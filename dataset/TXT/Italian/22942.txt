I wouldn't recommend it because even though it is a big dining area, it feels like you are secluded from the restaurant. I suggest sitting downstairs in the main dining area above the first set of stairs. For the appetizer we ordered the Shrimp Dominick which was pretty good but only had 3 medium sized shrimp. It was served in a garlicky vodka sauce which tasted decent and it also came with 3 pieces of cheesy garlic toast. We split a Caesar salad which was excellent. The whole anchovies in it was the perfect touch. When I got my steak I knew it was a little over cooked. I could tell it was on the medium-medium well side even though I ordered it medium rare. I didn't want to send it back because I didn't feel like waiting around. My girlfriend pointed out that her steak was a little over cooked as well. We also got the mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese, and creamed corn. All sides were great and I would recommend getting the half portions if you want to try a little of each. For dessert we got a butter cake on the house thanks to our server Janice and bussed Evan. I couldn't have asked for better service. Overall, we had a pretty decent dining experience minus the over cooked steaks.
