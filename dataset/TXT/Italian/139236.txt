JFNv5sKeKAf1ZVPnfbzpXw This place use to be great .....Going down fast . Called to order and was told a twenty five monute wait . So waited about that and left house . When I get in the place empty on a Saturday night no-one at all . So I walk towards the counter and the guy says you ordered a large right - and went to take my money then I noticed another man come out from the back of the restaurant break area which is basically the alley  . Then one guy says Ohh I forgot to tell you about this order . They stare at each other . I said so my order has not been started and they said yes. Well I have no idea what the heck they were doing no one was in the place - no sorry nothing just a dead blank stare . I asked to speak to the manager big surprise he was one of the guys staring .I guess according to them the place was sold recently so we will not be back . fair warning this has become amateur hour .
