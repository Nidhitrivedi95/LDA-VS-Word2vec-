rV6PwAjgpTx5Knr5lYouoQ I don't like to review pizza places on Yelp since I'm a bit biased to Angelo's in Lakewood.  By far the best pizza in Cleveland.  However, Master's has been growing on me.  They have a large menu with all sorts of pizza, apps, and salads.  The house Italian dressing is VERY good, and I bring home a bottle with me each time.  The pizza is above average with fresh ingredients.  The parking lot is a total nightmare!!!!
