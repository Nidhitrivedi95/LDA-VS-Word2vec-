DhRJJ5aUUuBp3XR1JbLeuw Fresh ingredients and excellent sauces are the stars at this restaurant. We ate here for lunch and in addition to the indoor seating, there is an outdoor patio for al fresco dining.

After browsing through the menu, I decided on the meatball panini. The order came out quickly, but I was surprised to see that the sandwich was placed in a thin, folded over pita-like bread rather than a thicker panini bread. Since it was only folded over and thin it was hard to eat it without the meatballs falling out of the sandwich. Additionally, the sandwich came with a marinara dipping sauce. The sauce itself was superb but any attempts to dip the sandwich in the sauce also resulted in the meatballs rolling out of the sandwich. 

The actual ingredients were good though. The meatballs were hearty with good flavor, and the thin bread was nicely toasted.

If I eat here again I probably won't be getting the meatball panini, but perhaps another lunch item will be less unwieldy to eat!
