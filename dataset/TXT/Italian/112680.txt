gdXfiX8gRpe2TeaWZJoOHQ Urban slice is the Stephen Baldwin of campus run restaurants on campus. The only time you should ever get a slice of "pizza" is when all other restaurants in the area are closed. These greasy triangles with cardboard quality dough make you question what happened in your life that made you end up trying to enjoy this slap in the face to pizza. I always say "this is the last time I eat here", but I know I will end up being there once more, struggling to suck down a slice. Shoutout to the university for the comfortable seating, because I'm going to be here awhile rethinking my life.
