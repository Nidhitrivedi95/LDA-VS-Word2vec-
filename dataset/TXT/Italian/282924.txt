Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ I have been a regular at Pizza Rock since they opened and consider it one of the best in Las Vegas. But Little Tonys is nowhere near the quality and taste of the original. The salads and starters , like the calamari ,are very good. But the pizza , in my opinion is no better quality than a first rate frozen. They are poor copies of the original and anyone who is a Pizza Rock fan will notice it at once. Too Bad.
