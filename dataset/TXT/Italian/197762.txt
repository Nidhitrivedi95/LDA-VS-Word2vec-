pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw My husband Matt B. and I love pizza, so when we decided to spend a weekend in Phoenix, Pizzeria Bianco was at the top of our to-do list. I'd heard great things about the pizza (which is a favorite of Nancy Silverton's of Pizzeria Mozza) and rather frightening things about the line (five hour wait times, what?) so Matt and I met up with our friend Stef P. at about 10:45 on a Saturday morning. By 11, when the doors opened, we were one of two parties waiting for a table. We saw no line the whole time we were here, so maybe massive wait times are a thing of the past.

The place was very charming, small and cozy, located in some kind of science center park that felt a bit like a college campus. Apple Maps did a shit job getting us to the right building, so we missed the free lot. Be advised that there is one, and that it's much closer than any metered parking. The restaurant felt like a new wave fancy pizzeria, with big ovens and a modern/rustic decor. Service was good, efficient and friendly.

We drank beer with our lunch (I forget what was on tap, but it was good), and enjoyed the excellent pizza. Stef and I shared the Wiseguy and the Sonny Boy, while Matt had the Margherita. The pizzas were delicious, with flavorful crusts that were beautifully charred with a good amount of both crisp and chew. The toppings were high quality. The Wiseguy was probably my favorite, a white pie loaded with wood-roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage. That sausage was so savory, that onion so subtly sweet. The Sonny Boy was also a winner, with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami, and olives, meaty and full of flavor. I stole a bit of Matt's Margherita, and it was a top notch version of the classic pie, with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil.

Now that I know Pizzeria Bianco comes with no hassle, I'll stop by whenever I come through Phoenix. The setting is nice, and the pizza hits the spot. Its reputation is well deserved.
