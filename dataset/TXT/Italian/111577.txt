g6AFW-zY0wDvBl9U82g4zg Great Italian food and prices! The cafe itself is a small place inside a medical building but don't let that put you off. 

The cafe uses really fresh ingredients. I tried their chicken panini and croissant with egg. Both are great sandwiches. The croissant is sooo flaky, it's amazing! The cafe is really good with their latte/cappuccino art. The cappuccino itself is average but the art makes up for it. 

I would definitely go back if I am in the area.
