BrhyYc1-gn3lPuhlkqNk2w It was ok. Delivery was super quick and food was hot. Last minute order. Spaghetti sauce was basic and almost bland.  The meatballs were tasty tho. Im glad i ordered them with the pasta. Garlic bread was average, soft center, toasted outside. The pizza left much to be desired. It was for my kid and he isnt picky. Im moving on to the next place.
