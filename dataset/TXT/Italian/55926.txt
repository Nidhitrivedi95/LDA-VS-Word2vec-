aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw Worst dinner I had in a while! This "Fresh Seafood" place smelled like rotten fish guts. They have a roll-out cart with fresh fish they show to every new table, every time they passed by with it (and it happened every  5-10 min) the smell was really strong and disgusting. The food was bad too. Urchin risotto, scallops, fillet mignon, pasta, even cocktails, everything tasted weird. This place doesn't deserve to be $$$$ restaurant. It looks gorgeous in the pictures, however you can't see any of the views they show you on their website, unless you reserve one of those few "lucky" tables few months in advance probably.. It's nothing fancy at all. Regular Italian restaurant with ridiculous prices, they don't even bother to arrange the food nicely on the plate. Will never come back. The staff was very nice though.
