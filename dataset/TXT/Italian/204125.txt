qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg Went for a lazy lunch, nice food and staff. The Red Sangria is amazing and if I wouldnt have to stay up all day, would have had more than just 2. I got the cheese ravioli which was fresh and sauce tasted good. My friends were also happy with their entrees.

May not be the best restaurant around but still food tastes good, nice service, awesome dessert choices (looked great though we were too full to order) and a decent outdoor ambience. I would go again!
