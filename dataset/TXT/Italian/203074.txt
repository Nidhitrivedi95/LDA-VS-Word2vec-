q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I fully expected this restaurant to ride on its gimmick, but the food was great! It looks like a dump on the outside, but that's part of the shtick. Even the managers play full part. Inside this place is really a throwback, and the service was great! We went on a Monday and had the industry happy hour, the bartender was really attentive and she made us feel extremely welcomed. I had this Caesar salad pasta marinara sauce thing, it sounded odd but I was delicious! The sauce at this place is ON POINT.
