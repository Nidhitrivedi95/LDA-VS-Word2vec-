aJU9eRgtY6wH-5m7a6ZeEA Tonight the family ventured outside the usual boundaries of our Markham dining faves to experience all that Ferrovia Ristorante has to offer.

What a great Italian restaurant. Similar to Johnny Bistro (in Markham), this cozy space has friendly and knowledgeable staff, delicious wine, great ambience and last but not least, fantastic food.

There is a wide variety of salads, pizzas, pastas, meat, and seafood all prepared in a traditionally yummy but slightly adventurous way. The best part is the incredibly accommodating kitchen, willing to substitute, subtract and modify dishes in a variety of ways. We were able to custom order a number of main dishes without any trouble at all.

The specials were another amazing feature, I'm assuming it was not just this one Tuesday evening, but there were NUMEROUS specials that all sounded delectable. 

it was a perfect family dining experience, but would also be great for a date, gathering or friends or even business dinner.
