BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Excellent choice for Social(happy hour). Limited menu items, but all the items on the card are delicious! The hamburger for $5 is a steal! Another favorite is the shrimp santa lucia. My fabolute favorite drink is the Makers Mark slushi... I can handle 2.. Can you say potent!!! Anyway, go and try it. You won't be dissapointed.
