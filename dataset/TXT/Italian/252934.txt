VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w For me Sundays are the hardest nights to decide where to go after 2 days of debauchery.  It's a dilemma really, you want to party hard cause its the last night in Sin City, but you also want to keep it low key due to the check out at 11a the next day and trip back home.  Upon recommendation from a promoter friend of my mine, we decided to go to Lavo. So we visited the Club just this past Sunday as a sort of final hurrah after a crazy weekend.  So here's a what I took from my visit:

1) Alcohol and Stairs don't mix.  Whoever decided to put sooo many stairs between the entrance to the upper level club wasn't thinking of what kind of issues drunk people would have going down those few flights of steps.  I wasn't even drunk and I slipped and fell down a flight of steps(I could only imagine how funny my tumble musta looked) what more with someone drunk off their ass. 

2) The club is really small, I know its Restaurant first, then club second, but this place was really tiny.

3) DJ Vice was killin it Sun Night. Probably had the best music playlist out of all the clubs we went to over the weekend.

4) The girls got free open bar wrist bands 'til midnight.  Coupled with the complementary drink coupons I got for us guys, we pretty much drank for free all night.

Overall I found Lavo to be a great club to head to for either a night where everyone isn't trying to party to hard, or a spot to head to after a partying somewhere else.  I finally found my Sunday destination next time I'm in Vegas
