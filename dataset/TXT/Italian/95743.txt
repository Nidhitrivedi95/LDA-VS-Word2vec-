epoEBSCz3Mh4X-vVvcioNA I will admit that I have not yet experienced the full dining service but I been there numerous times for happy hour.  Their establishment is tastefully designed, the atmosphere is inviting, and the staff I always very nice.  The upper portion of the restaurant shares the same great staff, with an indoor/outdoor feel.  Leonardo is an amazing Maître d'.  Great place.
