I have been here 3 times since they opened. Love the burgers and now pizza!!  My new pizza spot hands down. Wings are excellent and unique. They fry then oven baked for crispy goodness!

My only suggestion is get with Uber eats, Postmates, etc so I can get it delivered!

Ignore the guy complaining about the ceaser salad: Who orders a salad at a pizza place anyway? That's like ordering a burger when you're at a pakanstani place.
