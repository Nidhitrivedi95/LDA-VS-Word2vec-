Awesome service from 'Sloan' & VIP Yelp treatment.  The Baked Ham was similar to a Stromboli.  The nice arugula tang w/ fresh shaved Parmesan in the middle was wonderful, warm ham, melted ricotta, fresh mozzarella, Parmesan, olive oil & fresh basil.  During happy hour it is $5.92 or $6.40 after tax.  

Reminder to self, comeback the next four times to try:
