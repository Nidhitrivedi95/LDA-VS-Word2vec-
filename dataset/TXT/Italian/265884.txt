wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw K and I dropped off C for his rehearsal for the AYT production of Dracula. On this particular night Postino has the awesome deal of Bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20 after 8pm so we headed over. We were sat right away by a very pleasant hostess. Since we had 90 minutes before the Bruschetta/wine deal, we opted  to have a glass of wine and split a sandwich while we waited. K had the Perfekt Riesling ($11) and I had the Fable Sangiovese-Merlot ($10). Both wines were fine and we enjoyed sipping them and people watching. We thoroughly enjoyed the Roast Beef Panini ($10) as well. Super yummy. Before we knew it the 8 o'clock hour was upon us and we ordered our Bruschetta and bottle of wine. A perfect date night. The whole while many different servers came by, kept our water glasses full and basically made sure we were well-taken care off. One of the many great things about Postino is that all the servers are functioning as a team and they all seem to work towards the same goal, customer satisfaction. 
Time flew by and before long it was time to pick up C from rehearsal. Adam recorked our bottle of wine so we could take it home and we wrapped up another awesome time at Postino. Winner winner chicken dinner.
Awesome customer service. Great food. 5 Stars.
