smBsHggLvIuABgntBvlYLw Babbos is in close location of our home so we frequent occasionally.  I love their bread that comes with every dinner.  The spring mix salads are good but a little pricey.  The pastas I have are tasty, but nothing that would make you drive across town for.  They can be on the pricey side for the quality of food you get.  Overall, the servers and managers I have come across are friendly but can become overwhelmed during snowbird season.  If you want a nice dinner they are worth visiting, just don't expect mind blowing food but good.
