K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ Great before/after dinner drink spot with a nice view of the Bellagio water show. We sat at the bar and had excellent service (a bit slow, but we had specialty drinks). The pomegranate and blue agave margaritas were delicious! Ample lounge seating as well. We did not experience the club.
