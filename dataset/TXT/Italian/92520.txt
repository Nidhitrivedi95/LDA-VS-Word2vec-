EHmxhhpj2kwYhCgKdRXmqw We've been here twice. The first time we visited because they'd sent us a coupon for a free large pizza for being new to Litchfield Park. Awesome! We didn't mean to be "those people,"- the ones who show up within the last 20-30 minutes a restaurant is open, but we were. They were more than happy to get us our pizza, even though they weren't making any money (aside from the tip we left at the register) from us getting a free pizza to go. It was good pizza and so we went back.

Again, we didn't mean to be the kind of people to show up late, but we aren't ones for great timing. This time though, they'd be making money and we ordered two medium pizzas to go. Just as delicious! We got a White Pizza (the fiance says it isn't as good as Sal's Tuscan Grill, but he liked it) and a mushroom pizza. 

We plan on going back during lunch time hours next time since ordering whole pizzas is a bit much for us.
