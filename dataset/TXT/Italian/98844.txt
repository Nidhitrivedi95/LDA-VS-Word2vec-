ExLXL_oQvI7oPB7TrVpGhg Saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  They have only an 11.5" Pizza.  The crust was very thin and crispy like a cracker, they were very skimpy on the toppings. We ordered red sauce, mushrooms, onions, black olives, pepperoni.  The pizza was very flavorless, the sauce had no flavor.  No plates, not even paper plates.  Not my kind of pizza place.
