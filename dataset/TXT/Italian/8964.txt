0iOF4P2dMmhQRJ84h2wDeg Was here for my bday meal.

Cozy restaurant hidden in a North York plaza off Yonge Street (north of Steeles) - was pleasantly surprised! There was sufficient parking in the plaza which was convenient. NO PIZZA!!!

Accidentally binged before dinner so, split the calamari and mushroom risotto.

Calamari - 5/5 (served with two types of dipping sauces and sauteed bits of garlic and fresh herbs...generous portions...oddly, no calamari rings but, I didn't care)
Mushroom risotto - 5/5 (tons of mushrooms...the risotto was perfectly cooked which is very rare because most places, the risotto has the consistency of mucus or sand...you could really taste the cheese...came out hot...generous portion as well)

My friends had the veal and chicken parmesan and they said it tasted great. Huge portions as well.

Will definitely be coming back.
