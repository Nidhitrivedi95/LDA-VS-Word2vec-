5sTFevXhGx01eLT4wF7Urg Went back for the first time in months...noticed they changed the menu. Yayyyy!! Their previous menu was a big fat FAIL!! It was no wonder the dining room was always....let's just say...crickets! 

This time, I only went for drinks and an appetizer. The revised, hand-crafted cocktail menu is super-slamming! And I'm SO glad they kept the tempura brussels sprouts on the menu! 

I'm looking forward to trying the new dinner menu!! Who knows, Tanzy MAY get another star!
