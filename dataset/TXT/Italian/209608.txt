Service was the worst I have ever experienced.  Arrived early for a 9PM reservation.  Went to the lounge to have a drink and wait for our table.  The lounge table we sat at was dirty.  It stayed dirty and we were ignored for 15 mins.  Finally seats opened up at the bar.  We went there and were ignored for another 10.  Finally we get served, order a bottle of wine, and explicitly told to pay our bill before heading upstairs to dine.  Fine no problem, we paid.  20 mins after reservation time we are told we can head upstairs.  We had to carry our own bottle of wine up the stairs with our glasses.  As we head up the stairs one of the bar tenders who had ignored us yells at us to make sure we paid our bill.  Yes, bill was paid, thanks for realizing we exist.

We head upstairs with wine glasses and a bottle of wine where we were asked to wait... Again...

Finally get seated.  Service got minimally better.  Not sure who our waiter was, went back and forth between people. After ordering and eating appetizers, asked the guy filling out water if we could order our entree.   Asked to split a pasta and our fish entree and have them come out in courses.  It was completely ignored and all brought out together and not split.

It was just a huge disappointment all around.  The food is fine, nothing super memorable.  The service left such a bad taste in my mouth.

Way too many other great options to ever consider going here and I will not send anyone here in the future.
