ZvtELJTUOh0yRrPxyyiakQ Visiting the area and stopped by at 9pm with a party of 8. Our waitress was Alexa and everything was amazing! Among our party we had the stuffed mushrooms (delicious spicy Italian sausage, basil, cilantro, and marinara sauce), spinach artichoke dip, big beef sandwich, Italian wedding soup, and old fashioned sangria. We also had a birthday among us and they provided the BEST birthday dessert I've ever had - it was a HUGE warm chocolate chip cookie with several scoops of ice cream on top. AMAZING!  Alexa even included enough spoons for us all to try/share the dessert! SO impressive! The service was prompt, friendly, and professional. The environment was clean, the temperature comfortable, and the jazz music was a great compliment to the enjoyable ambiance of the restaurant. I'm sure that if I lived local, this would be a place we would frequently visit!
