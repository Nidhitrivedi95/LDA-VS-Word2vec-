wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g I have some mixed feeling about this place.... 

When it comes to the staff - 5 Stars! They are over the top, bend over backwards nice/friendly. They go above and beyond to make sure your meal/experience is a good one. 

When it comes to the food - it breaks down in two sections. Let's start off with the 5 star section. 

The bread (I know who rates the bread...me) is delicious. I could make a meal of just eating a loaf or two. And the penne ala vodka is lick the bowl good. The pasta is homemade and the sauce is perfect. Literally I wanted to lick the bowl :-) Oh and the pear four cheese ravioli - OH MY GOD - It was brought out for us just to sample with our meals. So rich and delicious, I was cursing myself that I didn't order it as my main meal. 

However the fried shrimp, bruschetta and risotto ball is about three stars. The shrimp and risotto ball were a bit over fried and greasy for me and the bruschetta was a bit dry. The salad and steak were also three stars. The salad was average - nothing too exciting on the place. And the steak was just so-so. Sadly, I could have cooked a better one at home (for a third of the price). Not to mention, I really didn't like the sides - roasted potato and a sprinkling of mixed vegetables. Again, nothing to write home about.
