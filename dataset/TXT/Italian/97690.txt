eU_713ec6fTGNO4BegRaww Definitely a hidden gem!  Don't use Google Maps or Mapquest for driving directions......William St. is one way and partially closed in the Winter.  The location is easy to find if you take an alternate route.  

Cozy and charming.  BYOB/$5 corking fee.  Couldn't find street parking, but they have a valet lot for $3.  

The waiter was friendly and attentive.  The mood is relaxed, so I don't recommend it if you're in a hurry.  This is a place to sit back and enjoy your company.  

Fresh seafood.  I heard compliments all around the table on the chicken and lasagna  The marinara sauce has a bit of a bite, so be forewarned if you can't eat spicy food.  

It was highly recommended that we make advance reservations.  The place was pleasantly full, but not overcrowded.
