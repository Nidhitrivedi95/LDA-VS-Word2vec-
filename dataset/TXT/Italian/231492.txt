Tgc2dTcE1xOey2OUt_PvXA Went there yesterday to meet a group of old work friends.  I called last week and tried to make a reservation as there were eight of us.  I was told they don't take reservations.  We were there a little after 11 am and when we got to the front of the line were told we would have to wait an hour and fifteen minutes to be seated.  Ridiculous.  We left and went to Arribas next door.  We were seated immediately and great food and excellent service.
