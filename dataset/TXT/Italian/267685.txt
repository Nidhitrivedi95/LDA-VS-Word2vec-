XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q They were 15 minutes shy of closing for the night, but were willing to take my mom and I in to sit down and have dinner, so props to them. My mom and I split the seafood giant manicotti since we weren't too hungry, and despite sharing, were still able to get our own soups. We ordered the potato soup which was a creamy soup with potatoes, kale, and imitation crab. Never thought of putting kale in my soup before, but this soup was a pleasant first. Going back to our order of the seafood giant manicotti, it was a not-bad meal. Be warned though, they will ask if you want cheese on top of your dish, and if you love cheese but don't love love it, put only a small layer since the pasta is stuffed with rich, creamy cheese. The sauce was also quite creamy so it was a little overwhelming. 

The waiter was really nice, though, and was quick to get our orders and constantly checked up on us. He convinced my mom to order their mango martini, which was so good, you couldn't taste any alcohol in it (how my mom and I like our drinks). Good Olive Garden location!
