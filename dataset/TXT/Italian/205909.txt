qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA Good tasting food, but less than satisfactory service. I wouldn't say that the service is bad all around, I witnessed our server take great care of the tables around ours. Offered fresh pepper, cheese, refills, etc...just not to us. But what really puzzled me was the portion size of my mother's entree. Her $20 linguine with clams was smaller than my 2yo daughter's spaghetti from the kids menu, which was served in the exact same size bowl that is only slightly larger than a small bread plate (see pics). We had to wait 15min, after asking, to receive the check, another 10min for her to take payment, and had to remind our server that the kids meal came with dessert, which we ended up having to take home. The rest of us wanted dessert but we couldn't handle being there any longer (nearly 2hrs). There were only 5 seated tables in the entire restaurant at the time, so it was frustrating that we had to chase our server down so much. Needless to say, we're very disappointed. 4 stars for food (5 stars for garlic knots). 1 star for service.
