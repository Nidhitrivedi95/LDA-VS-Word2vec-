SXgVJz5aIvbeCXWvg0ZuNg My fiancé and I tried the Pizza Peel on a Saturday afternoon while out shopping, and it was such a pleasant surprise! We shared a salad, then I had a chicken philly and he had the pizza that was on special. Everything tasted fresh and came out piping hot! I'm particular about my chicken philly's, and this one was one of the best ones I've ever had. I also had sweet potato fries with honey mustard, which is one of my favorite sides. They were delicious! We have no complaints about the food at all. Our service was a little slow, but the restaurant itself was slow at the time we went so we weren't surprised about that. The inside is rustic/modern, clean, and has a nice bar with local beers on tap. The outdoor seating area was nice as well.
