53BSdnhzcCBfBH_6TgX63Q This place it not the same! Maybe they're on the verge of closing? They have changed their hours and are barely open on the weekends now. Their deepdish Chicago pizza used to be LARGE, DEEP, PLENTYFUL, BUTTERY, AND DELICIOUS. Now it's SRINKING, DRY, BLAND, AND NOT DEEP AT ALL. Will probably never come here again because I know they are barely trying to stay afloat. I feel bad but I just can't throw my money away like this to support a business who is not trying to provide a consistent product.
Gave it two stars, one for cooking "it" and one for having "it" ready.
