aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA I have gone to Oregano's a number of times and I was not impressed by their pasta, but their pizza is worth the visit! I've tried a number of pasta dishes that were all big in portion size, but left me unsatisfied when it comes to flavor. I love, love, love their kickbutt garlic bread appetizer with cheese and marinara sauce. It was the perfect start to the meal and it was like 2 feet long! The best thing I have had here by far is the numero one-o Chicago style deep dish pizza. It took a while to make but we knew what we were getting into. It was so huge that we could each only eat one piece! We substituted mushrooms for jalapenos and it was the best choice ever because that transformed our pizza into a spicy treasure. We were both surprised at the kick (which we loved) that came with these red jalapenos. I had a bloody mary, which was decent, and Eric got a margarita that he enjoyed. The service is top-notch with our server constantly checking on us and apologizing for the wait for our pizza. The deep dish is extremely huge and took a lot longer than the other dishes that you can order, so be aware that the wait is inevitable and be patient!
