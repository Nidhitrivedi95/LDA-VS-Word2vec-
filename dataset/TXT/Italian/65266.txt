BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA I had heard good things about this place and was eager to try it.  I arrived at and was seated at  5:55pm.  I asked the hostess if I could still order a happy hour drink.  She said, no happy hour is over at 6.  It was not 6 o'clock yet.  Ok, we are not off to a good start.  After that though, the place did not dissappoint.  We both had the New Zealand white fish and gnocchi special and enjoyed it very much.  (I even took some home for lunch the next day.). The waitress was knowledgeable
and helpfull.  The place gets a little noisy however.  Since I live in the Grayhawk area, and this place is convenient, I will probably be back.
