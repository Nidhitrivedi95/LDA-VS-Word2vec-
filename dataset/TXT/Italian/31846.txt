5qbnj0IMpMsuwHCWzd6kCA I went here with a few friends on a weekday evening over the holidays.   There was only one other table in the entire restaurant that was occupied.  

The waiter made us feel like we were wasting his time and could not even make a suggestion of what was good to try when asked.  He had zero personality.

Every time he brought us our drinks or plates of food, he banged the glasses and plates against other glasses and plates on the table when he was setting them down.  It was kind of like a war zone with the dishes

I would rate food a 6 out of 10 and there's very little selection for dessert. 

I would not waste my money here again.
