tVyLQzyhhinKcGzlZIFZjQ I go here once every couple months or so, and it's always great. The Stuffed Italian sandwich and the Antipasta Salad are both solid choices. On one occasion, I ordered two entrees to-go, but they messed up one of them. I called the restaurant, and they had me come back to pick up the order, at which point the manager gave me a brand new meal and refunded the cost of it to my card after apologizing for the mistake. It's just nice that they own a mistake and make it up to you. Also, the pizza and drinks there are awesome as well - will definitely continue going here...
