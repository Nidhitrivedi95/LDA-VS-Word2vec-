SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Truly a local gem! This wonderful restaurant and bar is just off the strip and the perfect place to take someone for a more affordable but quintessentially Vegas experience. The happy hour is one of the best in town but I would recommend skipping the discount drinks. This place has one of the best cocktail menus in town and you would be an utter dunce not to indulge in the wide selection of exceptional drinks offered. To compliment the terrific cocktails is a well focused menu with some truly great offerings, especially for those who want to partake in the happy hour discounts. Rhe cocktails are already $11 to $13 each (which is a steal in Vegas for this level of quality), but some of the menu items are half off from 5 to 8pm during the week, particularly the steaks. To start, the carpaccio is as generous as it is delicious with a perfect balance of acidity. I have been to most of the great steakhouses here and the steaks here do not disappoint. They are comparable in quality to steaks I've had in strip restaurants for $10 to $20 more without happy hour discounts. They rely on excellence and quality service here, rather than location and name recognition. I almost feel bad recommending this place, hoping to keep it a bit if a secret for myself and friends who visit. Honestly, I can't wait to go back.
