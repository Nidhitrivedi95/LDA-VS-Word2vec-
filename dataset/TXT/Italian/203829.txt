Q8qsbFqIE7lwA-zkv07fxA I don't know if some of these reviewers were drunk when they wrote their reviews, but the food is very good. The sauce is NOT canned, it is homemade. The meal I had had lots of seasoning (chicken francese), but the chicken brocolini was a little bland because it was a lighter meal. They also give free yummy garlic knots!
