78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw Okay, so I know the rule about eating seafood when you're not near the ocean. And I should've followed that rule. I ordered the lobster bisque because a yelper said there were chunks of lobster, and so did our waiter, Bryce. It sucked balls. There were no mentionings about having pieces of ravioli with what tasted like cheese. The soup base was good, yet it would've been better if it was a bit warmer. (I totally understand liability issues and tourists suing for hot beverages and soups), but both my soup and husband's were a bit on the cold side.  Not enjoyable. Oh, and he ordered the Tuscan white bean soup and asked for sour cream on the side, they came back saying they don't put sour cream in their soups.  Uhhhh,  does it matter!? Shit, my husband's Romanian and his people put sour cream on EVERY soups! 

Onto our entrees,  I ordered the seafood pasta with linguini. Pasta was aldenté, sauce was blehhhh....seafood,  well lets just say I had a few rotten tasting pieces of mussels, there were also some JUMBO ass shrimps that was overcooked and the clams were okay. Hubby ordered something with chicken...blah blah idk I was much more concerned about the bad mussel taste in my mouth.  

Okay, Bryce our waiter. I understand waiters have to be a little fake but your personality was flat out like a piece of rock. I didn't appreciate the fact that you and that haggard blonde hostess were making fun of the old man coming in to have dinner by himself.  *snicker snicker* was all I heard you two. You suck Bryce. I don't really like your face either.  

Please do not send your guy that sweeps the floors to sweep around people who are eating!! Worst organization skills here! 

Ughhhhh, why did we pay $120 for this place. I should've gone to McDonald's.
