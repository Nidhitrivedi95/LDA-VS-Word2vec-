HYhbeLznSWEl6JIYTllVUA We had a great time trying out this new spot. We came in for happy hour, where apps, bruschetta, pizza, and some drinks are discounted. Our server Alexis was outstanding. I got the red sangria, which was fantastic, and my boyfriend got a Stella Artois. We got meatballs and garlic knots for appetizers, and both were delicious but we both liked the meatballs better. We also got a pesto chicken pizza which was great. Every dish was very fresh and straight-from-the-oven smoking hot, which I love. During happy hour, the total for 2 apps, 1 pizza, and 4 drinks was less than $50. We'll definitely be back!
