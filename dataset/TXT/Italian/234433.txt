tR4VVIdzcJCQus4GUFq3IA A total gem of a fine in North Scottsdale! Owner George is personable, extraordinarily talented in the kitchen, and someone who gives you a big warm hug when you walk in the door :). The food is absolutely delicious, the restaurant is comforting and inviting, and I eat here at least once per week! 100% recommend!
