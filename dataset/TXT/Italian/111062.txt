g-nzfTvso3-4c4gkhkmGbQ OK this is place is huge and has lots of verity don't get me wrong but for and "Italian" food place it falls flat. 

There is barely any flavor in the food, and most of it is either over cooked or very oily.

I was so disappointed. It was my first time and it came recommended so I came her on a double date.

Both parties left not feeling satisfied. 

This is suppose to be an Italian experience, where are all the spices!!!???!!! If you like bland food because spices are to much for you this is your new favorite place to be... The only good thing I found we the pizza. Surprisingly is was nice. I wish they would use the tomato sauce on the pizza on the pasta too. 

They have a lot of desserts and a few sugar free as well.

This places is a toss up for me, but some people might really like it so I wont completely pass it off.
