JH3zKlfslbSVeA_KsAaRRQ This place certainly lives up to its great reputation. We went there for my husband's birthday, and they couldn't have been more hospitable and charming. The food was fantastic, but it was the personalized service that really blew me away. The knowledgeable, attentive staff, the attention to detail, everything was exactly as a fine dining restaurant should be. 

I once heard something about class that I think applies here - true 'class' isn't making sure everyone sees your superiority - it's the ability to make everyone around you feel truly comfortable in your presence and with themselves. I think Splendido's team accomplished that yesterday. I will definitely be going back, and often.
