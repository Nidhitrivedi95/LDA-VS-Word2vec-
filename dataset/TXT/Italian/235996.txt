Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA Flash back to about a week ago. My friend invited me to dinner here because she had a coupon and they had a special going on. Double deal (we thought). She raved about the pizza so I was pretty excited... Who doesn't love carb night?! We sit down right away and the waitress flies by and explained the drink specials in a way that didn't make sense to even my friend that had been there before! We wait and wait and finally put our order in. This is the last time we see the waitress for a long time. Some other guy brings out our wine and we quickly realize that the table/sidewalk is slanted and the bottle and are glasses are headed in the direction of the ground. Same guy finally brings out our pizza. Pizza is super soggy and my friend had to ask for ranch 3 times. It was just ok. Disappointing actually with it being so soggy. 

Waitress dropped on bill and disappeared for another long period of time. We put out my card and my friends coupon. Waitress says they can't take coupon during a time they offer "specials" even though the coupon does not say this at all. She looks at my friend and asks if she just wants to run HER card. Big mistake. Never assume who is paying the bills, especially with her bad attitude. She runs my card still and I asked to speak with the manager about the coupon issue. Waitress says "I just keep striking out with you guys!" I respond yes even though her interaction was so minimal it was rather pathetic. This manager could care less about any customer satisfaction. In fact I don't think he cared about the business in general. All I got was a smug look that he got what he wanted. In the end I didn't give the waitress who didn't do anything a tip (which I hate doing). 

This was truly a heinous experience.  And with the sheer number of people that talk to me everyday  about where I travel and restaurants I visit I have so far and will continue to tell everyone to avoid this place. Go to Cibo (or Pizza Hut) instead.
