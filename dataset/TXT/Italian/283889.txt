z4KriCQPuPJnFr0NGgApbw The last visit I overlooked the $25 gnocchi special. The reason it bothered me was they tell you the specials but not the prices. Okay, shame on us for not asking.
My daughter wanted to try here again for her birthday. So I've decided I'd go against my not go there anymore and appease her.

We've been here 30 minutes and just got our water. Our appetizer has yet to come out. The bread is apparently just as scarce. Hey but we have a full cup of fresh parm cheese. 
I ordered the chicken marsala and I was informed there's an up charge for pasta with my meal. Really? Potatoes or pasta are always included with marsala. 
Hooray the appetizer finally comes out and half ass warm and horribly bland. 
We asked for a manager and the waitress overheard us and asked us is there an issue. Ma'am please just leave us alone as we will speak to the manager. 5 minutes and crickets, yep you guessed it, no manager to our table. And to boot the waitress stood there staring at us which is why the ma'am please leave us alone. It was like she was a demon possessed. 
Before I imploded, we had to walk out. Never ever again will we return here. Time to find somewhere else to enjoy my daughters birthday.
