B7G_2Hx8Rx8l6oQ6K3n5Uw Sauce is probably my favorite 'fast casual' place in Phoenix and honestly the world.  I love it.  

The service is what one would reasonably expect from a place where one orders from the counter, fills a drink on one's own, and sits to eat.  There aren't unnecessary frills, that annoying bro who comes by and asks if everything is okay, and the place doesn't get super loud.  
I like most of their pizzas but you can always hook me with 'caramelized onions' so that pizza with the sausage has been a favorite of mine for years.  I also like salad with chicken and walnuts; I normally share that with my friend Vicki when we go.  I've had their pasta dishes and other pizzas as well, I've never had something there I didn't like.  I've never had a bad experience.  

Sauce routinely has specials to draw you in or give you an excuse to treat yourself to something nice.  I don't need an excuse to go but I do need to be in town.  This is one of the places I miss the most since moving from Phoenix.  I visit often, this is always a stop.
