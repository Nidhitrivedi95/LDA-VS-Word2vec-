iJpTpE9A8WDWvUlvUcFZuA Being an Italian girl, I am very picky about the Italian food. When I go out to eat, very rarely do I opt for Italian since I can make most of the dishes at home. However, I had a BOGO coupon for this place and decided to check it out. It was a gorgeous night so we had a short wait for the patio area. I like how they have cushioned seats outside where you can get drinks and also eat if you choose to instead of waiting for a table. They had an intriguing selection of wine and I had a smooth, robust pinot noir while waiting for our table.

The service could have been better as our waiter wasn't too attentive. He did the job but forgot an item or two that we requested however the artichoke crusted beef medallions redeemed the bad service. They were absolutely perfect---cooked just how I ordered and they melted in my mouth. It was served with mashed potatoes and a hearty portion of fresh veggies and I couldn't have asked for a better meal. Others got the pasta which wasn't drowning in sauce, which is a nice change of pace compared to some Italian restaurants in the area. The chopped salad was wonderful as well-it reminded me of a greek salad.

I absolutely love the patio area, selection of wine and was very happy my meal along with the variety of their menu. They had traditional Italian dishes along with more modern Italian dishes so you can go old school or new.
