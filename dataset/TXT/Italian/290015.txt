zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA We were there on Sat at 6:30 with 2 other couples. 6 total. If you want to be full when you leave, this is the place. But, if you are going out with friends to talk and have a good time- This is not the place. There was music  the night we had dinner.  The server and my friends had to talk over the music.  I believe music should be in the background.  The food was not the greatest.  It was bland. 

Other people within the restaurant were having a great time. But, for me, I want to socialize with my friends and not the 2 people supplying the music to have a good time. 

Each to their own.
