nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Our initial plan was to stop by Carlos' Bakery at Venetian, buy some cannoli and leave. However the line was kind of long and we decided just to have an early dinner at Buddy V's cross the hall and get the deserts at the restaurant.

The hostess was courteous and the waitress was very nice. We ordered Calamari appetizer, clam linguini and mac & cheese. Linguini was al dente and kids liked the mac & cheese. But the deserts were the reason we stopped by. We ordered cannoli and lobster tail. Sure they did not disappoint, the cannoli's filling was fresh and crust was crispy. The lobster tail's skin was crunch and filling goes very well with the fresh fruits. 
The price was the average Las Vegas casino meal price and the overall it was pretty good dining experience.
