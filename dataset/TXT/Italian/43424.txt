7ZBh-3wWVQ5zkd6KZytW0g Came here for winterlicious 2017! 
Food: baked eggplant and mushroom pizza, I highly recommend. I also tried the trout chocolate ravioli which were both underwhelming. 

I like the ambiance, decor, vibe, and service of CIBO a lot! But I feel like their menu is a hit or a miss. And I've been to a separate location and same - some things really amazing, other items kinda terrible. You really have to know what to order!!
