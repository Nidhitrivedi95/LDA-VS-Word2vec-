OThAF-lt6d7jY-pB1ajWPg Delicious !! . I had the Penne Vodka with Italian sausage, my son had the chicken parmesan. Both were fantastic The Italian wedding soup was seasoned perfectly and if we weren't in a food coma after that we ordered the Chocolate mousse and Tirmasu - both were delicious and homemade. We will definitely make a reservation nexttime . It is a small restaurant- but was worth waiting for a table.

So nice to have a great restaurant so close to home.   Everyone was very nice and welcoming.  We will definately be back.  Oh, and on Thursdays, kids 12 and under eat free with the purchase of an adult entree.
