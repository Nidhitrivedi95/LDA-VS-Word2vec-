MrmwDgMlL2GtthlAZsJwNQ Big fan of this place. I love the decor and the atmosphere. The food is very well priced (under 20 bucks for most dishes) and the food is phenomenal ( I always get roasted chicken and spaghetti ... Also tiramisu was delish!) All in all its one of my fav spots to eat in Mississauga.
