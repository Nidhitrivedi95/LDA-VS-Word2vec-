k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ One of the better pizzas around, easily top 10 in Phoenix, and arguably top 5. Not as good as Bianco's though. 
Been there twice for lunch and the service was horrendously slow. From being seated to getting our food, was about an hour. Doesn't exactly make you want to come back when you only have a short time for lunch during the workweek; its not like Bianco's where you know you have to wait 1+ hour to get a table, we were seated immediately....and then our waiter disappeared. 
But the pizza will not disappoint. Also had the short rib sandwich which was quite delicious - next time I must ask for no jalapeno, because it was covered in them and so spicy on the tongue that it didn't balance well with the very tender meat and the flavours I knew were there but could not savor. 
Great pizza, beautiful restaurant, poor service.  Recommended to pizza snobs who have time to take an extra long lunch - I will return then when it's more convenient.
