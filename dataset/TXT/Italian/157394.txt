Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA This "fancy" Italian restaurant at New York, NY def does not deliver on the quality of the real New York City has for quality Italian food.  The pizza as soggy mess..the pasta was something you get a Marie Calendar's.  The prices for this joint I would def skip and go to the other amazing food places located in other casinos you want for good Italian.
