yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg My team from work went here for lunch today, and had a great time. We ordered the fried zucchini and mozzarella, and I ate the lasagna for my main course. Food was tasty from appetizers to the main course. Service was attentive...our main server was the best, some of the other servers that were helping (we had a party of 13) weren't the friendliest but oh well. Overall food was great and seemed priced relatively well. The building is definitely older, but don't let it spoil your visit...the food alone made it a nice visit.
