9WIn1fMJoDPqkc5HOQdybw Went there last week because we just moved closer to the area and we had a gift card.   Food was awesome.  We all got something different and  tasted each others dishes.  The short ribs were perfectly cooked.  I highly recommend getting dessert.  The ricotta cheesecake was excellent.  If you have ever experienced Mikes Pastry in the north end of Boston, you will appreciate the ricotta cheesecake.  I would go back just for that.

We will definitely return.  The manager was super nice and thanked us all for coming in and the atmosphere was casual and classy.  Our kind of restaurant, and local, no going uptown for good food.
