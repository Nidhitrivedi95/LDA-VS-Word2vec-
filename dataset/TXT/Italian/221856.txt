SeQXxtKhqgr5SHw4VIjaLw Horrible service. Ordered a pizza at 7pm. They didn't show up until 10pm. I called to see when it would be delivered after waiting 1 hour and 45 mins. They said a half an hour longer and that my pizza was still there. An hour later I called again and they ignored my call the first time  and turned off their phone the second time. 10pm my pizza arrived... By this time however I had given up and went down the street to grab alternative food. Horrible customer service. If you want good Italian, I recommend Paolleti's.
