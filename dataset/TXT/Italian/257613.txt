w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A Great pizza, friendly staff, clean restaurant, and reasonable prices.  What more could you want?

The best times to come by are for weekday lunch specials (11-2, I think) and happy hour (2:30-4:30).  Lunch specials come with a drink (and are enough food to share, in some cases), while happy hour = half price pizzas.

Do: try the buffalo chicken pizza, Modesto, Skyline, meatball sub, baked ziti, and artichoke spinach dip.

Do: ask for Maria or Hugo.  They're the best!

Don't: come here in a rush; they can get a bit bogged down at peak volume.

Happy eating!
