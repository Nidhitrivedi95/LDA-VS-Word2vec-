Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA I asked my girlfriend is she wanted pizza. We searched by reviews as well as a new place to try and found Federal. Tucked in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood, it was daunting at first to see a full parking lot. As we walked up we noticed a Drive Thru of a sort which makes to go orders fast and easy.

FIRST THINGS FIRST:
If you want a hole in the wall, mom and pop, Italian kitchen greasy pizza, this isn't your spot for today's meal.

HOWEVER:

If you want something filling, light, gourmet, and unique to your taste buds, I highly recommend Federal Pizza.

Pros: Everything tastes as if it's made in house. Flavor crossovers I didn't think would work on pizza, but absolutely do. The cooks can be seen making your food. There are handmade wine coolers for the day drinkers. The plating is lovely and the portions are good. The atmosphere is very hip. *Emily is a great server.* There are yummy vegetarian options.

Cons: aside from the alcoholic beverages in which I do not partake, there are limited drink options to the fountain standards. There aren't jalapeños or blue cheese which are a must when I snag a pizza (but on that note, this is the kind of place where every meal or pizza is specific for a reason, and that works in a place like this.)

We got the lunch which is just under $10 per person for a half pizza and your choice of salad or soup. Girlfriend got the soup which was a cauliflower fennel combination (weird but satisfying and vegetarian.) I picked a salad with citrusy stuff in it. The pizza she chose was a cheese pizza (she fears change sometimes) and I snagged one with goat cheese, lemon zest, OMG other goodies.

4.5/10 give it a shot for new and hot.
