Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw My lunch appointment was canceled today, so I decided to head to Cugino's and try their Pizza and Cappicolo/Salami/Provolone Italian Sandwich (#2 on the menu).

Their Pizza is a traditional NY Thin Crust Pizza (see pics).....very good!  Easy to fold...(like it's suppose to be)....Fuggetta-bout-it!  I had a slice of Cheese Pizza to get the lunch started while I waited for my sandwich.

The sandwich came out and was the perfect portion, not too large, not too small.  They use Boar's Head deli meat, which is one of my favorites.  The bread is good and there's just the right amount of oil/vinegar...not too overwhelming like some other sandwich joints.

What a great lunch.

Will I return?  What's the mattah you!....of course!
