TLbx_MR2dyFztoyR5d9H2A We had a thin crust sausage pizza and it was amazing! Felt like we were back home in Chicago... The staff are also very friendly we will be back! Best pizza around here!!!  
My only issue is the lighting is kinda annoying. It shines right in your eyes and it seems to be the same at every table.
