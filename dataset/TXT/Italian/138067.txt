JBivZu1L1VpYf6kwspXYIg My family has been a fan for years. Pizza is fantastic, as close to "New York Style " as you can get here in Charlotte. Portions are huge, you definitely get a lot of food for the price. There is a reason why they are still in business after all these years, and why they have more than one location. They have a great selection of other items as well, you won't be disappointed.
