Z6_gRH_m8FQlKgsNkZKmTg Lucca was amazing in helping us have a beautiful wedding - they saved our wedding night, along with the staff from Phipps, when our original plans at Phipps changed on the last minute due to flash floods and power outages!! 

A few weeks ago, on Aug 19th, the staff at Phipps found a wonderful back up plan in Lucca.  They were willing to take us and our 40 guests into their venue on the last minute, without one hitch.  The Lucca staff was so gracious, attentive and flexible in letting us come to their venue, and they took such good care of my guests.  Everyone had such a beautiful night, and Lucca really ensured that I was happy with everything.  It was the best night of my life, and Lucca really helped to pull it off!!

Excellent staff, wonderful management, I can't say more to praise this place!
