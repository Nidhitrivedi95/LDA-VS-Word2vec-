The Caesar salad was properly dressed and served with anchovies in the side. We had the spaghetti and meatballs and shrimp scampi. Tomato sauce was thick, rich and generous. Meatballs were moist with just a hint of garlic and cheese. Mama would be proud. Highlight of an already fantastic meal was the scampi. Not the butter and garlic drenched monstrosity served elsewhere. These were succulent shrimp seemingly baked in garlic, butter, white wine and parsley, with a seasoned bread crumb crust. This was the kind of dish that makes you smile. Simple Italian done right.
