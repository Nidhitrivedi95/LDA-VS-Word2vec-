RbkY7e79CEoj6YMjXSc02w I was hungry after getting a few needed items at Shoppers Drug Mart. I decided to check out this Pizza Pizza that was a few doors down. 

I have to indicate that I don't eat at this chain these days. It has to do with working extra hours on Saturdays for a month to get a software release out. The folks are work were kind to provide lunch. However, it was the same pizza toppings and fries for four consecutive Saturdays. I have only had food from Pizza Pizza twice since then.

This store is nice. I felt at ease when I first walked in. There are plenty of tables and chairs for you to sit down and eat there. 

I ordered a meatball sandwich. I was told that it would take five minutes. I was also asked whether I wanted cheese in it. Yes, please!

It was warm and toasty when I got it. The sandwich was okay. I've had better. The meatballs weren't great. The marinara sauce and cheese couldn't help them. 

I'd come back here to try something else. The pizza slices looked good. Perhaps I should have had one of them instead.
