7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ I remember when LGO was a new concept. It was like...'oh they have this big table and you can sit there with the person next to you and they call that community style dining'...

LGO has so much going for it. Yes the food is good and the Avocado Pizza Add Prosciutto is hands down the best. Yes the coffee is also delish - order the Cuban. 

But the grocery section should not be overlooked. The assortment of scarves and housewares and hipster sketchbooks and girly jewelry holders should not distract you....... From the WINE and the CHEESE! Oh my gosh. Grab some Edam and a bottle of Cannonball and call it a night. They really have some good vino and eats here for dinner making. Oh! And get some red velvet from the bakery case to go. Salivating now. 

Thank goodness they finally setup an overflow parking lot.  Now you have no excuse not to come here.
