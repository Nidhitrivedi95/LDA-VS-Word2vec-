8EvgKu_VpVXJ0KUvrxS7BA First time going here tonight. The wings were tiny but so fricken good!! And their wing sauce was amazing! The Mediterranean salad was delicious, with olives & artichokes. The original crust pizza was alright. It was very greasy in the center and made the crust soggy. Sadly I feel like that is how it is at most pizza places in AZ.
