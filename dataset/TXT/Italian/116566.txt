GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q I lived in this neighborhood growing up. Every now and again, I would write down my family's order, grab the cash, and peddle my way up Granite Reef to Casella's. My mom and my favorite is their chicken salad sandwich, my brother's favorite is the pizza sub, and everyone loved their AMAZING potato salad. 

The family-owned business is exactly the same today as it was when I first starting eating there nearly 20 years ago (admitting  how long it has been is hard). 

Everyone complains about them being cash-only.  They have ALWAYS been cash-only, and I like that about them.  They have quality ingredients, are always friendly when you walk in the door, and time and time again, give a great product. 

I live in Tempe now, and I go out of my way to order from them instead of the chain down the street -- gotta keep the local businesses alive!! 

LOVE IT!
