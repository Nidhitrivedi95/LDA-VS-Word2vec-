5HjmnWOtBYAYW-jjdZ3aKA We were sat at a dirty table, and menus were filthy. My husband ordered a baked potato, server came out and said they didn't have baked potatoes. My husband then ordered wild rice, server came out and said they didn't have wild rice either. Server did not know the menu well. Our dinner rolls were frozen in the middle. There were flies and fruit flies flying around our food the entire time we ate. Chef was eating at the cooking station and kitchen staff swore loud enough for us to hear while dining. We will not be back.
