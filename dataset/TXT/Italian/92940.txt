Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag Fantastic pizzas and service.  I came here with 2 girlfriends.  We ordered 2 pizzas and 1 salad; the wild mushroom pizza, prosciutto and arugula pizza and the butter lettuce salad.  The wild mushroom pizza with bechamel sauce was out of this world.  So creamy, so much mushroom!  It was so good.  The prosciutto pizza was also very good.  Lots of prosciutto and thinly sliced.  The butter lettuce salad included bacon, blue cheese, hazelnuts and cranberries.  Great mix of flavors.  Service was great - our waiter came back to check on us frequently and made sure we had everything we needed.  I would definitely come back again for pizzas!
