iwzVhM5CirzkNS5wTxwZeA Went with a group of people prior to the Fleetwood Mac concert.  We had reservations, which was an excellent thing to do!  Started with the calamari, which came with one sauce and not the two on the menu.  It was typical calamar, nothing to write home for.  Friends had the much recommended Lobster Mac and Cheese and neither finished their plates...kept saying it was very fishy.  I had the chicken piccata, which did not come with nor was I offered soup or salad as the menu says.  Very salty dish and did not finish it.  One other person had the Linguini Pomodoro and she said it was "ok".  Apparently the air conditioner wasn't working because it was extremely warm inside and we actually had words with the hostess when she kept closing the big door.  Most likely won't be back...this was one of those try and not again places.
