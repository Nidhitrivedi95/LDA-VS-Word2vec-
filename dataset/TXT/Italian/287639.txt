zmfa8RNxqSuOJ9Nx-CMs_Q The sheer number of restos in the Davisville area of Mt. Pleasant will knock your socks off. The problem is that they're so nice that most of them don't do takeaway. Sick to death of eating sushi for my weekly meetings in the area, I decided to try Positano after seeing a bunch of Zagat stickers on the door. I'm so glad I did!

The menu isn't classic Italian necessarily -- they have some different takes on things. I ordered the Farfalle Rustico -- roasted butternut squash, chicken, arugola, and fresh plum tomato sauce. The portion was generous and they also give you fresh bread and freshly made tomato sauce to dip it in. For $16.50, it's a steal.

The Best Part?! Right before walking out I asked if they had plasticware since my food was to-go.  He didn't even blink and offered to let me take one of their pieces of silverware. All he asked was that I return it if/when I had time! How frickin' awesome is that?! Of course, after my meeting, I popped right back by and shoved it into the mail slot just like he told me to.

Excellent food, excellent prices and super excellent service? A definite must-try.
