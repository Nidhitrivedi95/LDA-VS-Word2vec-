4HeS4zlbf-IbwEItbrISlw Just had a great experience here, everything was perfect! I don't know much about wine but I asked our waiter for a recommendation and he chose one that really hit the spot! Food was delicious, atmosphere was really pleasant, and staff... the staff was the best. Such friendly and genuine people! I'm glad we got talked into ordering dessert after stuffing ourselves.. it was probably the best desert I've had all year.

Easy 5! Definitely coming back. Also, I thought our bill would be really hefty, but it was very reasonable
