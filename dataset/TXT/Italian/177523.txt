No7l4LinY1tu-bCL97qi1A Fresh, authentic Italian. I travel all over the country and this is as good as it gets. Right when I walked in I was greeted by a friendly host and bartender. Ate at the bar and enjoyed the game. Had the veal parm which was spectacular and lemon dessert that finished the meal off perfect. Thank you.
