bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg You can find me here once a week or so... because its that good. My boyfriend and I frequent here for lunch and I always get the same thing. The Prosciutto Panino. This amazing sandwich consists of Due Forni's pizza crust for the bread, Prosciutto, buffalo mozzarella, Fig reduction and mixed greens. It is seriously one of the best sandwiches you could have. and its less then 15 bucks. 
The Carpaccio appetizer is also amazing. its carpaccio rolled with mixed greens with fresh Parmesan and balsamic reduction. heaven in your mouth. Pair those with some Badoit water and youve got the perfect meal. The Paninos are huge so its wise to split one :)
