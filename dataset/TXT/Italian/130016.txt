I8QpDTJUZ6Mk5IQuQSG2pA I just ate a large thin crust pizza from here and it wasnt very good at all. The crust was extremely hard and the pizza wasnt hot at all. It almost had a cardboard taste, not to mention we just got cheese on the pizza and it cost $18. Very disappointed we spent that much money on this sub par product, and we wont be returning customers.
