aidcfUzZLOjWgwlxfv3UlA Wow! Ordered from this location and I must say that the food is fresh and yummy. Didn't try the pizza yet, but the burgers fries, wings and garlic knots are so BOMB! My husband said that the fries reminded him of the Coney Island spots in Detroit so we will be trying the coney dogs next. They are open late, the prices are reasonable and the delivery was quick.
