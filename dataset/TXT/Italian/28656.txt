565uVvO-hFqbajFNkt0hnw Pleasantly surprised. Wasn't sure what to expect because of previous restaurants in this space. But staff was friendly, place was clean and food was good. We had: lobster ravioli, chicken breast dinner and the beer batter fish dinner. Chicken was tender and moist. The salads that came with a couple of the dinners were a good size side salad and had tomatoes, cucumbers, cheese -- nice size salad. The beer batter fish was amazing---I didn't order it but I ate half of my Dad's dinner because it was so good. Probably the best I've ever had. The French fries were also awesome! Fresh cut fries - a good rival to the fair!!! We will definitely be back!
