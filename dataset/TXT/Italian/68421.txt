BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner on a Sunday night.  I had been a few times (once for brunch and once years ago).  It was busy, but not chaotic.  The set up allows for a quiet conversation w/o having to scream to hear each other over the other patrons.  I like that.

We ordered the burrata appetizer-- TO DIE FOR!  The burrata was decadent, and the tear drop tomatoes were perfect, not overripe, not bitter-- just right.  We also had the calamari app, which was great.  Not heavily battered, which is best.

I had the skirt steak with herb butter-- heavenly.  The herb butter was a great compliment and I could still taste the grilled meat.

My boyfriend ordered the seafood linguine (black linguine- nice touch) and it was super yummy, he ate EVERY bite.  It had a rich tomato sauce and plenty of great fish: scallops, mussels, clams, shrimp and calamari.  Very very tasty.

I told our server it was my boyf bday, he brought us a complimentary panna cotta dessert  with a candle that topped the night off just right.  I had never eaten panna cotta before and I was pleasantly surprised!

For the amazing meal we had plus an alcoholic beverage for each of us, the price was right.  Under $100.00 for appetizers, two meals and drinks.  :-)

We will be back time and time again!
