FA-FJyVkMsgsLsoQWe4QFg I am a bit conflicted writing this review. 

First VPN pizza is a different experience than New York or Chicago style.that is representing the oldest and most famous Neapolitan pizzerias. 

I always start with my baseline pie, the Margherita, this is VPN pizza simplicity which allows the purest and freshest ingredients to shine. In addition, the dough and sauce are really the  stars here and everything should just compliment them. 

DeSano;s  Margherita D.O.P.: San Marzano tomato sauce, basil, garlic, scamorza, mozzarella di bufala, pecorino romano
   The Crust: thickest firmest crust of any Neapolitan style pizza that I ever had
   The sauce: the lightest and driest of any Neapolitan style pizza that I ever had
   The taste was good however it the experience was more like VPN Flatbread and not pizza

Bianca: Garlic, mozzarella di bufala, scamorza, ricotta, pecorino romano
   The same as above

DeSano: San Marzano tomato sauce, sausage, pepperoni, garlic, scamorza, mozzarella di bufala, pecorino romano
      The same as above but the saltiness of the meat made it even better

Last note:6 of arrived 20 minutes to closing on a Sunday with no one else in the restaurant. While the staff was prepped the place was cleaned and ready for closing. However, the staff was friendly and accommodating. 

Bottom-Line: While this place can boast a friendly staff and good food however this isn't my favorite interpretation of VPN pizza making and probably won't go back.
