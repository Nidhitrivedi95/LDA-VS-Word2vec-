y0QzKWNVoXCbZpk6uhEgGA I don't give 5 stars here and there. This is the real deal. If you come and there is a line up... line up. It's worth the little wait. 

First of all, there's private parking . You had me there.

Second of all, service is really good. It's a family affair it seems and it works and quick.

Third and not least, the food is A-MAZ-ing. I'm not exaggerating. I had the chicken parmigiana with the spaghetti and Bruno Salad. The pasta was homemade and fresh. Soooo gooood .  Comfort food. Homemade sauce was soo good.

Highly recommended this place. But I don't want it to get too popular that I can't get in
