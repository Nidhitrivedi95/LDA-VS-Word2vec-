yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg Who are visiting from Southern California. We drove to old town Scottsdale were looking for place to eat. We saw a sign outside a restaurant that said "we have here since 1977 and we must be doing something right". We looked at the menu posted outside the restaurant 
and decided that it was okay to go in and eat. We walked in and the place was empty. We were seated and given menus.  When we looked at the menu I realized that the menu we had  been given did not match the menu outside. The menu we had been  given had prices that were double the ones on the outside menu. I asked the waiter if we  could be given the menu that  outside. He just told us that certain items on the menu we had were 8 dollars. He  never gave us the menu outside. When we were ordering our meal my son asked if you could add shrimp to Alfredo. The waiters that said that he could not do that.  I told him that we were going to pay for the shrimp. The waiter responded that he would have to charge $17 for the extra shrimp. We said thank you but no thank you. When he brought our meal  to the table he asked if we wanted cheese. We said yes and as he was poured cheese on our food he also sprinkled it all over the table.  Food was okay. We will not be returning.
