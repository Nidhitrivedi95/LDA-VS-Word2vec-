Gh-qmVwvibLnNdqEZXcQHw The best lunch and Cafe food in the Euro genre in the Phoenix metro area. Seriously. This place is stellar. Try their basic gyro pita and fall in love. Try their penne carbonara and be transported. Try their Marco Pollo main dish and be amazed. 

What's more, the soups and salads are perfect and fresh. And their deserts are rapturous. I go to lots of restaurants in Arizona and your won't find a cafe with a more complete and we'll done Euro menu that wins on literally every dish. 

And everything is a home made , customized and perfectly fresh rendition of each dish. My wife's favorite place. 

And if you're into wine they also have a large cabinet of expertly curated wines.

You won't miss by going here. Honestly.
