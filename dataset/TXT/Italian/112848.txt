Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg Metro Pizza has always had great food and great staff, and tonight's dinner was no different!  Make sure to check out the monthly calendar specials every time you come in...Tonight was "Free Nuke Fries Night" - And they were delicious!!!  I also recommend asking for the bottled, homemade Italian dressing as a dipping sauce for the bread you're given at the beginning of the meal.  And of course the pizza, ranch dressing, (and Nuke Fries!) are a must-have!  One of the better pizza restaurants in town.
