oX7lSVsg4j7-SrSZVGWVnA I had a chance to eat at Babbo with a couple of old friends from high school last night and it was very enjoyable!  We met up at 5:30; the place was packed but my savvy friends were waiting at the bar.with wine glasses in hand and names on the list .  We were seated promptly and commenced to catching up. While looking st the menu.

Contrary to what previous helpers have said, service was attentive and pacing was good.  Friend 1 had penne with vodka sauce, friend 2 had pasta with a lovely cream sauce, and I had spaghetti and meatballs   All dishes were pronounced tasty and portions were large enough to take home leftovers .

I rarely eat pasta but I can happily recommend Babbo for pricing,  service, and palate-pleasing.  Everything was yummy and our party spent less than 25 dollars each including wine and tip.

Babbo is a place worth trying!
