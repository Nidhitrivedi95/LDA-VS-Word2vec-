0O3H5plJx-Cq2A80qFVW5w L.A.B. was on my short-list of places to try for quite some time and I finally got the chance to check it out this week.

The decor is refreshingly young & hip, especially when compared to the "same-same" type places that flood the rest of the Little Italy strip. There's not a lot of seating (a good thing, in my opinion) and they did have a very small front patio with 2 tables.

The menu is equally inventive. A few too many vegetarian options for my liking (where's the MEAT) but to be fair, it was about 50/50 on the menu so I should not complain. Vegetarians would be pleased to have options for a change.

L.A.B. offers a $30 prix fixe a few nights a week (Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday) but the selections were pretty limited (choice of two apps, two entrees and two desserts).

There were four of us and we managed to order quite a diverse selection. I tried the long bean salad ($10) for my appetizer and was happy with it - portion size was large, some of the other apps weren't. I had the pappardelle bolognese ($18) for my entree - thick fettucine noodles with both pork & veal added to the bolognese and a lot of fresh tomatoes. Again, portion size was was good and it was a tasty dish.

All food was presented very nicely, lots of pretty dishes coming out of the kitchen. The desserts also came out looking quite creative (passion fruit panna cotta and a chocolate pudding with salt caramel mousse). I'm not a big desserts person but didn't think these were especially worth the $10 price tag.

Service was excellent and the chef comes out to explain a little bit about the food before you eat. 

I'd go back, top pick for College Street!
