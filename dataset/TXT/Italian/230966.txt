Tf13Wexrt6WmNw-CDW5Gyg For a place with the word "meat" in its name, the vegetarian meatball was better than most. I normally wouldn't order vegetarian meatballs, but it came with the meatball sampler I ordered. The sampler had one of every kind of meatball they make. Most meatballs were dry, lacking seasoning, bland and definitely needed sauce to mask the taste. The surprising exception was the vegetarian. It was pretty good. The classic meatball was also tasty. The classic has beef, pork and veal. 

If I ever go back, I'd probably order the classic again, but I'd doubt that will be anytime soon. The server we had was well-intentioned, but has no business being a waitress. She took forever to take our order, bring drinks out, even get glasses of water to us. We even saw her talking with a friend who'd stopped by to visit. When she saw us staring, she yelled across the patio, "I'll get your water in just a little bit."
