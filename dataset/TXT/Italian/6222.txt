_Z3XGVbiDn1VbgETp1pwLQ Cute little hole in the wall.  Very quaint and the staff is super nice.  My husband got the salmon: it wasn't as fresh as he would like but still was tasty.  The minestrone soup was soooo fresh and so yummy.  The best I've ever had.  However the pasta was meh.  I definitely will be trying this place again.  I think maybe we didn't get the right dishes?  There were so many options to choose from and most could be made vegetarian (huge plus!).  Bottom line:  I will definitely be going back just because the staff was so nice and amenable.  Maybe next time I'll find my perfect dish!
