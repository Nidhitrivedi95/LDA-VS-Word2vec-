Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A This is one of the few "nice"places on Mill Avenue.  This is a great place to go for happy hour, but not so good for dinner. The dinner menu is way overpriced.  But I loved coming here at happy hour  time and sharing some cheese, salad, and pasta (definitely enough to make a meal).
