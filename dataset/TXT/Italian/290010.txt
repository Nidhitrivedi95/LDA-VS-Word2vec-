zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA Ahhh - as an Italian from New York, I have been on a search for good Italian food since moving here 38 years ago.  I think VinciTorio's is it.  My go-to dish is always eggplant parm.  The eggplant was thin, not soggy.  Not greasy.  Just enough mozzarella.  The sauce - well, it was LIGHT, not heavy, bitter tomato sauce.  The chunks of tomato were sweet (spoke with chef and owner - he uses fresh Roma tomatoes). The pasta was perfect - not so al dente that you crunched your pasta, but not mushy like it had been sitting in water forever.  The garlic bread was hot and had a nice crunch to it.  My house dressing on the salad was okay - nothing to distinguish it and disappointing.  Maybe use kalamata olives instead of regular black olives.  Service was excellent.  Restaurant was crowded, make reservations.  Wednesday is 1/2 price bottle of wine.  We will try again, with different dishes and see how it holds up in a repeat!
