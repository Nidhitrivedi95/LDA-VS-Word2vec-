KvXE8Ln6dl-MMO2XisQOqg Can't say that I've been to a better worst attempt at an Italian restaurant. Not only was the food pasta clumped up together with cheap tasting beef and the salad too soaked in vinegar, the soup was also extremely salty and the pizza tasted exactly like frozen microwaveable pizza. As if the experience wasn't bad enough, there was one particular young waiter that was just absolutely disgusting. He was extremely rude both when serving and clearing the table. He grabbed utensils out of our hands and had very noticeable attitude; clearly, he has anger management issues. He also was so abrupt in his movements that he spilled a lot of sauce everywhere. His "too cool" attitude was absolutely despicable and I don't see how he is even slightly qualified to be a waiter. All in all, this dinner was able to ruin our trip to Stuttgart. Props to the older waiter for being professional though. The younger waiter should learn from him.
