G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Really like the decor.  It's a good mix of vibrance, comfy and contemporary.  The service was excellent, and, the view of the Bellagio Fountains was superb.

I really enjoyed all of the food!  We had an appetizer sampler platter with more things that I can remember (mushrooms, bread and tapas, roasted peppers, olives, bruschetta with pancetta, meatballs and so much more).  All of it was delightful!  I could eat the lemon mascarpone spread they gave us for the bread every day.

The lamb was absolutely the best any of us had ever had.  My short rib pappardelle pasta was amazing.  Friends didn't really care for their spaghetti (it has a rich white sauce, not red sauce) or the ravioli (again a white sauce).

We were all quite disappointed in the standard dessert menu.  We begged our waiter to let us order off the dessert tray that's solely for the four course tasting menu (and he agreed, but, we saw him get in trouble from a manager...POOR GUY.  Don't blame him, blame us)!  The little bite sized desserts were way better than what the options on the menu.

I will definitely be back!
