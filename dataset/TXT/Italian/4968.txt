_myTPlWa8QRN5eavs-hNPg With the low reviews, we have avoided Pacino's. After a great night next door at D'Vine last week, we saw there were quite a few people in Pacino's and decided to give it a try. Walked in to less than half full dining room and waited to be seated. By the time someone came to seat us, there was another couple behind us. Live music was nice, but the noise level was very high and we decided to sit as far away as we could so we would be able to talk. Took forever to get menus and water. I noticed on the wall that Wednesday was half price wine night, only we didn't get a wine menu. We asked our server and she said she couldn't find any wine lists, but would tell me what the had at half price. The half price is more like what normal price should be. We settled on an Argentine Cab, although I really would have rather look over the list myself. Bread was a focaccia bread that was not impressive at all. Walls have a lot of marks/dings that need to be repainted. The best item of the night was the bruschetta. Sampled three different types and they were all very good. Salad was standard and nothing special. The sausage and peppers with risotto is misnamed. It should be risotto with a little sausage, peppers, and mushrooms. It really was a plate of risotto more than anything else. The other flavors barely came through. Desert was cannoli. Three small cannoli's that were very good. Entire service was very slow and seemed disorganized. Much better choices in the area.
