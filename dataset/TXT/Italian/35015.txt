6I27BTuHI5PMvOBG4WS8NQ #1 rule if you're an italian joint: make good pasta!

I should preface this review by noting that this only speaks to the quality of the food.  Indeed, this is a nice little modern space staffed by friendly, knowledgeable and attentive people.  Maybe I will come back in the future and try something else.  If my opinion changes, I will update this review.  But until then, here it goes.

I came here last week with an out-of-town friend and ordered the insalata romana and pappardelle with lamb bolognese sauce.  The salad was decent.  Came with nice orange vinaigrette on it, but way too much of it.  It was also supposed to come with white anchovy, but I could barely detect it.  Sad because that was the main draw for me ordering this.

Now here comes the big FAIL - the pasta.  Both conceptually and in execution.  Let's talk concept first.  I love bolognese.  Love it.  But in their attempt to be overly creative, they put carrots and raisins in the sauce.  Carrots, okay, fine.  But raisins?  Really?  Raisins?  The sweetness totally ruined the sauce.  There were so many of them that I couldn't eat around them either.  The pasta was also super disappointing.  A restaurant holding itself out to be italian must be able to make fresh, al dente pasta.  This stuff was cooked to death.  And it was all stuck together in a giant congealed ball in the center of my dish.  So much so that I could barely break it apart to eat it.  It was so overcooked that I couldn't tell if it was made fresh in-house, or came out of a box from the grocery store.  Truly disappointing especially considering I'm on a wedding diet and I let myself indulge perhaps once every two weeks.
