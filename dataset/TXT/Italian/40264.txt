I picked this restaurant over all other steakhouses in Vegas because I wanted to try the Riserva steak, aged 6+ months in Carnevino's own facility in Vegas.  And the Riserva did not disappoint.  It was really interesting to say the least and distinct from your regular dry aged steak.  The meat was so intensely beefy!  It tasted so strong that I would probably not get it as a steak for myself in the future but would share it with others because it's such an experience to try it. 

I also tried the lobster appetizer, the BBL ribeye, the signature mashed potatoes, and beans and everything was excellent.  The olive oil they drizzle on the steak is so fragrant and rich and really compliments the meat which is top quality and so well prepared.  Because the meat is carved table side by the waiter, it gets cold pretty soon after you start eating it but don't worry, it'll still taste fantastic.   

One thing I was not happy about was our seating.  We were seated in the little library section across the way from the main dining room.  The room was small with 10 tables or so, with a view of the prep area and left me with a feeling I was eating on the side of the casino.  Even though we had a reservation, got there with plenty of extra time, and saw empty tables visible in the main dining room, we were told that nothing was available in the main dining room.  I expect better atmosphere than eating on the side of the casino for a great restaurant.  This is why I am taking away 1 star.   The staff were very attentive and did everything to make it a memorable experience however.  Our waiter and sommelier were both very friendly and knowledgeable.  

Tip: Corkage is $50 but is waived if you order a bottle.
