JlMYSLiLnpWiihmzZkQS-w On 12/19/15 my wife two kids ,and I stopped in the olive garden 2626 N. 75th Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85035 (Desert Sky) for dinner.

My wife and daughter ordered shrimp Fettuccini and I decided to ordered the "create your own pasta option" Rigatoni pasta, Primavera sauce and chicken. My son decided on the kids pizza. We occasionally dine at different restaurants throughout the valley. The food arrived 20minutes later. My wife and I where completely flabbergasted with both dishes we ordered. My wife shrimp in her dish were very small over cooked and tasteless and tasted raw. The dish was very bland. It was so bad that she could not finish eating it and left it on the table.

I don't know if this was normal for this location or not, but I will never eat here again.

My server asked how my dinner was, and I told her that it was not very good I asked for an additional side Primavera sauce to try to possible help this poor dish! but she said unfortunately they had no more sauce??. I then stated I was very unhappy and embarrassed for them, she then stated she was sorry to hear it, and reported to the manager on duty.

I was shortly contacted by the Manager on duty by the name of McKenzie. I expressed to McKenzie my horrible experience and concerns of the location. McKenzie apologized for my poor experience and stated he was from another location and was just helping out. I was accommodated with one meal completely removed from my total excellent customer service on McKenzie part! But this location definitely needs a visit from whom ever it concerns ASAP.
