Honestly, I wouldn't even really call it inventive - it was almost like one of the owners were at their neighborhood Portillo's and thought, "I can throw all of this stuff on a pizza crust!" If that's what really happened, we should all be kicking ourselves in the ass for that one.

It's kinda the same as Cici's Pizza Buffet except with more inventive flavors and better quality (for $5 I'd still go with Cici's!). However, it's much closer to drunken pizza than gourmet. Thus, the 2:30am close time. We had a BBQ Chicken pizza, Breaded Chicken Alfredo pizza, Philly Cheesesteak pizza and a Pesto Alfredo pizza. All, from the sound of the flavors, screamed delicious. Unfortunately, all of them lacked flavor except for the the BBQ Chicken pizza. It was pretty decent.

Overall, definitely go after the bars for Ian's and hit up Pizzeria Uno's down the street for dinner instead.
