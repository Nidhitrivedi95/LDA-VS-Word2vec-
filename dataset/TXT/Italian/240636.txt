UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ Don't judge a book by its cover. On the outside and even inside this restaurant isn't exactly aesthetically pleasing. The place was packed and people are everywhere. They have more tables then they know what to do with. Don't give up though the food ends up being worth it. The wait really wasn't that long for being a Friday night at dinner. Waiting is somewhat of a cluster though. You have people all over the place waiting. It was a cluster for sure. They should work on that. Once seated our waiter was friendly and accommodating. We all heard the pizza muffins were to die for and they lived up to that for sure. I wish I would have just eaten a bunch of those for dinner. They ended up being better than my main course. I wouldn't be surprised if you were full after those though. I ordered a pizza and it was decent, but nothing worth ordering again.  The people I was with ordered the calzones and absolutely loved them so next time I will have to get that. They seemed a little small for my hunger on a Friday night but not if you ordered the pizza muffins before. Overall this place was pretty good though. Definitely get a good amount of food for what you pay for. I will come back.
