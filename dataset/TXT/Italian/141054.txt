jluEI1ZDQDeJlbl-M3YH3Q First time here, and I must admit I'm shocked by the past poor reviews. We just had 7 dishes (salad, soup, 4 entrees, 3 desserts) and they were all excellent. Price is appropriate for the quality and location. Service (Sherif was our lead server) was outstanding; Italian music in the background the perfect touch. I will be coming back for sure.
