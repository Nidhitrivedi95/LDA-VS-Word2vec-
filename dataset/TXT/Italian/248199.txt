Our waiter and the rest of the staff were all very helpful and professional. When we asked for a recommendation on a wine, Franco gave us a wine that was like none we had previously tasted, and then there was the food!.... It was incredible and the flavors blended so deliciously. The food alone will bring us back to Franco's. The quaint environment, the great service, and the wonderful wine is what will bring us back again and again.
