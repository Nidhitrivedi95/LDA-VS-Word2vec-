j54J0Ky4ruVbN_NTJ3daFg Amazing, amazing, amazing. I went with my boyfriend for a birthday dinner late November. It was a cold Sunday night and Girasole looked too busy to seat us; yet, we were seated instantly. I indulged in a glass of white wine - pinot - which was divine. For dinner, I ordered Ravioli. Truly one of the greatest dishes I<U+200B> have and will have ever eaten. 

Of course, we ordered dessert. We got a tiramisu. Though smaller than expected for the price, it was absolutely amazing. I would eat here every day if I could. 

Great wait staff, amazing kitchen. The only<U+200B> problem for me was who I presume to be the owner walking around so much I began to feel slightly nervous.
