w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q We stopped here for a steak dinner, we always try out new places each trip to find the best steak. We started with a potato soap which was awesome- good flavor and consistency. The mashed potatoes that came along with the steak was not the best but the steak was divine. I enjoy a well cooked steak while my husband enjoys something medium. The meat was well flavored and savory. We would recommend for anyone to come here that is looking for a good steak meal! Skip the potatoes and stick with the steak!
