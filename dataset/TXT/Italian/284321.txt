zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA I dont mind paying for good pizza and wings. I do mind paying for average pizza and average wings. There are so many good pizza spots in vegas I'm disappointed I payed 40 dollars for a pizza and dozen wings that was average at best. Im not from chicago so maybe  I get it but the crust on the pizza not very good. To be fair the rest of the pizza is good. The wings were clearly frozen and then tossed in sauce. Nothing great, and then to cap it off, my biggest pet peeve for a pizza spot is when they water down the ranch. I know we are in a recession but quality should not be the first thing to go. I do have to give credit to the delivery guy, i love when i dont have to ask for parmesan and crushed red peppers. With the variety of choices for pizza available in summerlin I probably wont order again.
