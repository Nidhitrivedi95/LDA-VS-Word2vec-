vExvdgUbU377-Fry2uuv_w Went there with coworkers for lunch.  There were 15 of us in the restaurant.


Pros:
+ spacious restaurant.   Great for large groups
+ decently priced

Cons:
- portion sizes between different meals very inconsistent. 

Food: (4/5 stars)
I ordered veal picatta, it was quite smaller than i expected, but was just enough food.  (If i was more hungry, I would have been disappointed).
The meal was a bit sour, otherwise good.  (3.5/5 stars)
A few coworkers ordered chicken parmigana and hadock and chips. They were very satisfied with it.

Service:
Good, they set the tables up for all of us.  The waitress did some recommendations and they paned out. Did not interact enough to give a more detailed review.  

Ambiance (5 stars)
Great for lunch for large groups.  
Looked like a place that would be good to watch a sports game.  Very spacious.  

In conclusion  good for large team lunches and for watching sporting events.
