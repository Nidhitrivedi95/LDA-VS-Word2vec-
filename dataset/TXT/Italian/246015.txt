UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Would have liked to try the food here but we wait at least 20 mins for someone to come & take our orders (& this was just drinks) the people that got seated after us were already getting bread & appetizers. & still no one approached our table, even though my aunt made eye contact with some of the waiters who still probably couldn't get the hint that we we're obviously waiting for someone to take our order. Of course we just left & just went for Yard House. Disappointing for a nice restaurant.
