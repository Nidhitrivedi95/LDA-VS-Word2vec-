2bK1ng2mnRdtTh_BDNGmIg We got pepperoni pizza and it was good. However,  the sides we got we're less than desirable.  We ordered the mozzarella sticks, garlic knots and fried dough. The mozzarella was completely solid inside and not melted at all, the garlic knots were hard and could be used as hockey pucks and the fried dough was so greasy that it was sitting in a puddle of grease in the Styrofoam container, I couldn't even taste the powder sugar or the cinnamon.  What made everything rude was how I was treated when I called to complain.  I was told there was no manager on duty, the guy on the phone made excuses for everything and said there was nothing wrong with anything and that he liked all of the items I complained about, then didn't offer to fix the situation, he just hung up. Very disappointed.
