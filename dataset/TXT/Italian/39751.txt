7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ I took my husband here for his bday. the service was awesome, our waitress was very helpful explaining the menu. we started with grilled octopus, OMG that just melts in your mouth. I wanted to lick the plate! I just wanted to order another plate. Then the husband & i shared the dry aged rib eye bone in they cut in to great serving sizes & leave the bone for you to chew on lol. I want to come back & try the beef cheek! its a place you have to try when your in sin city!
