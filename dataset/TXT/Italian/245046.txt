UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ We decided to give this restaurant a 2nd chance for dinner.  We started off with a shared Caesar salad. My wife ordered the crab and shrimp cakes that were accompanied by roasted vegetables and creamy horseradish. My entrée was blackened ono served over garlic mashed potatoes with a trace amount of Hollandaise sauce and topped with a spoonful of a delightfully spicy charred tomato relish.  My fish was overdone and there was very little, if any, garlic in my potatoes.
