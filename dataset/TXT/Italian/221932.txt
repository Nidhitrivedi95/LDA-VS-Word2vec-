sfzX4Ndds39mhS-Chr2lJw We were treated like family.
On the way out of Vegas we stopped in here and they weren't open yet but were catering a private event.
We were ready to walk out and the guy,Don says. "Wait a minute,were you just going to have pizza?"
"yes" we replied
He sat us down we asked if we could get salad too and he got the salad and served it to us as if we were his own personal house guests. The Italian dressing was to die for served with fresh baked Italian bread that was the most perfect texture of light and crispy outside and melt in your 
Mouth on the inside.
Our pizza arrived just as I pushed my empty salad plate away.
I could tell by looking at it that it was going to be exquisite and I was not disappointed.
This was the best new York pizza I've ever eaten topping some of the most well known places I've eaten in new York.the crust was perfectly crispy flaky and the cheese was so fresh you'd think they keep the cow our back and make it fresh every morning. As we are finishing up we tell Don how happy we are and compliment the food and he shares with us that his chef has won many awards for his food and asked us where we live. We tell him where we are from and that we came here to celebrate my birthday;he immediately grabs an ice cream cup and scoops a large scoop of butter pecan ice cream for me. Seriously? This is too cool!
We then tried to square up the check and he won't take our money. He insists that it's on the house and just tell our friends what we thought of his food.
I give him a hug and thank him and my boyfriend shakes his hand. As we say goodbye he asks us to wait and walks to the back. Returning with a hat he hands it to my boyfriend and says "I like people who appreciate things, this is for you, wear it in California"
We will definitely go back. For the amazing food, for the atmosphere and to visit our new friend who made us feel at home.
