KuxDPl6UYNLxFChPm0_MNw I tried the Brownstone today after it being recommended by the front desk at the Marriott.  I was a bit skeptical as I walked down Yonge Street, but I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into the place.  It's well furnished, and has a posh modern look to the inside.  It's also very open, so you don't feel cramped in it (granted it wasn't very busy for a Wednesday night and I sat at the bar, which is small).  

I tried the grilled calamari as an appetizer, and you have to try it.  Much healthier than the fried style, and very tastefully prepped and cooked.  I also got the strip steak, and it was very good by any standards.  

The service was also very good and friendly.  My drink was never empty, and they even talked me up a bit.  

The only thing I would recommend is trading the paper napkins for something a little higher quality or linen.
