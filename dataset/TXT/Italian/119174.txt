h-bBnFFTZ2cNiuBMFu2UaQ Finally great Italian food in Phoenix! Move over Olive Garden, there is a new kid in town! Yes, I did go there in High School... Anyway, my husband happened along Tommy's and wouldn't stop raving about it so I decided to give it a try. They have a motorcycle floating from the ceiling and beautiful glass pieces and chandeliers. Super quirky and colorful. This place is so wonderful! An ambiance unlike most restaurants, there is so much to look at and the food was delicious! 
We started with the meatball appetizer and split a caesar salad. The caesar dressing was homemade and one of the best I've had in a long time. The meatballs were so moist and flavorful also. For my dinner I had a white wine pasta dish with potatoes, artichokes and chicken in it. I describe this in detail as I can't pronounce or remember the name! I will level with you- I can't stop thinking about this pasta. So authentic and it is officially on my illustrious "Meals I Remember" list. Any food lover has one even if you call it something different! My picky 4 year old loved her fettuccini alfredo with chicken and broccoli. She thought Tommy's was cool and so did I! We will be back, maybe tomorrow.
