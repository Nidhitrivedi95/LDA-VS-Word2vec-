Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A Found a Groupon for this place and decided to give it a try.   From the moment we paid to get in, the employees seemed apathetic and disinterested.  The food was average at best.   The selection was OK and the preparation was mediocre.   

We purchased all you can drink wine and beer, which was not worth the price of admission.  The selection of wine and beer was limited to red or white wine (2 choices total) and the beer selection was similarly anemic.  I wont explain the quality of the beer and wine, as I'm sure you can guess on your own based on what you've read so far. 

Even with the Groupon I do not recommend this buffet.  In fact, my impression of The Palms in general has been significantly tarnished.   

Maybe you'll have a different experience, but if you don't,  you can't say you haven't been warned.
