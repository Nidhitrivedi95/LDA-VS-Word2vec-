FygWGVRGu9iBdoNU5f2rBw The atmosphere and the decor is very clean and comfortable. The staff were very helpful and explained all the possible food choices. The mushroom risotto was fantastic. The lamb on the other hand was out of this world, I enjoyed every part of my dining experience. This is my first time here which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars.
