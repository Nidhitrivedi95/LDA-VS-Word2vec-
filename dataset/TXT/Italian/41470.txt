7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA I haven't written a review of Lady Marmalade? Let me change that immediately. This Leslieville brunch spot is best known for their legend-and-you-WILL-wait-for-it-dary queues for weekend brunch. I declare the long wait worth it. And if you have the luxury of going on a weekday afternoon, you will feel like a king or queen amidst the Toronto public, and feel compelled to brag. On Twitter. Like I did this afternoon.

It looks like they scored all their furniture by pointing a Time Cannon at the 70s and zapping indiscriminately. It's a collection of mismated chairs and tables between avocado green walls. With the Curtis Mayfield playing in the background, I half-expected double-digit inflation and triple-digit sideburn growth. Neither occured.

I enjoy every single thing I have had on their menu. From breakfasts, and their bennies, to their bowls and sandwiches. Today I had a bacon, brie and chicken sandwich ($15.45) and I am still thinking about it. Coupled with a cup of their soup of the day (tomato), it was a deadly combination. So good. I washed it down with a tall (really tall actually) glass of hot apple cider ($3.50) served with a cinnamon stick. 

The service here is always kind and attentive. I love this place.

Obligatory Title Pun: Voulez-vous BRUNCHER avec moi?

Menu Readability: Courier on a natural brown stock.

Need to mention: Very definitely cash only.

What this place teaches me about myself: Sometimes I will wait for brunch -- but I don't have to. #don'tbeajerkaboutit
