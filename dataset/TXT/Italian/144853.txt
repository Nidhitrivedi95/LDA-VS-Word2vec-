k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ Let me preface by saying that I'm not a desk jockey that writes reviews on restaurants based on portion size, wait time and how important they made me feel. It's about the food! My credentials are: 10 years back of the house fine dining experience and 6 years dining professionally as a fine wine distributor.
I've never had a bad meal at The Parlor and generally find myself talking for days about whatever the latest seasonal menu item I've tried is. That said, any restaurant  is destined to have an inconsistency now and then...  It's just never happened to me here. 
Let me get to the point. I'm a very adventurous eater but now and then when I find a classic dish that is executed in superb fashion, I'll fall back to it time and time again.
THE PARLOR MAKES THE BEST CAESAR SALAD IN THE VALLEY. It's such a simple preparation yet somehow 95% of valley restaurants do something to screw it up. They either deconstruct it and make it a chore to eat or put there own twist on it that completely takes it out of the realm of what a caesar salad is. How arrogant. 
Too all other PHX restaurants: Just because you use romaine doesn't make it a Caesar. 

Lesson:

Caesar Salad = Chopped or torn Romaine hearts, Creamy parmesan and anchovy emulsion, fresh toasted (and seasoned) croutons and some shaved Parmigiano Reggiano.

THANK YOU PARLOR PIZZERIA FOR KEEPING IT REAL!
