4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ What can I say, we were extremely impressed! My husband and I have lived in Southern Highlands for many years but just decided to give them a try for lunch. It's really nice inside, clean and open. The booths were comfortable and it's an inviting atmosphere. 
We were promptly greeted and escorted to our booth. The server was upbeat and sweet which was appreciated. The menu was very diverse and offered a lot of dishes besides the "normal" Italian cuisine. 
We decided on the fried calamari to start..when it arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to see that it came with 3 shrimp as well! They were lightly seasoned and fried and were delicious! I don't think we would order the calamari again because it was chewy, but we asked if we could just prefer the shrimp and they said absolutely! 
We decided to split the Chicken Parmesan and I'm so glad we did. Not only was it delicious, but the portion was perfect for splitting! 
The owner came and introduced himself and talked a bit, that really speaks a lot of the establishment. He invited us back for happy hour, which is 4-7pm nightly at the bar. Can't wait to take advantage of that! 
When we were leaving our server gave us complimentary Canolis which were delicious as well. 
Overall we were really happy with everything and will definitely be back!!
