wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g Still a great wonder of las Vegas dining. Pure delight with ambiance and food. Next to the square with music and  dim light. Active gondolas nearby and a bar. Other Italians food in town is fine this is better. We had wedding dinner here 11 1/2 years ago and it was amazing. Get to this first not last. Ask for desert too as it is the finest.
