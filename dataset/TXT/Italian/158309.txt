LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Great Italian food, Great service, what more do you need? 

Ordered the family "classic" style to share between four of us. There was wayyy too much good food to share! I was stuffed before the desserts even came out! Not sure if you are allowed to bring food home or not considering the family style menu you can keep asking for more as much as you want, but our waiter was nice enough to let us take the desserts home. 

This place can be on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for: great food and great service! Highly recommend!
