4YKU46PNs-wCi3TAafrRaQ I've been a fan of Barro's since I was a kid...better than most national chains, great place specials for lunch, delicious wings, a pretty decent gluten free pizza for a decent price. Service is always friendly; Been a fan for 20 plus years and plan to be a fan for 20 plus more.
