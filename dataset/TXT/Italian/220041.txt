SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Originally came here for the Mixology part of things, was not disappointed on that front. First 3-4 times I came here was perfectly happy... but then the patron to my right ordered food, life had changed. Steak happy hour I discover is between 4-8 and 12-4am you will be more then satisfied 50% off steaks that you would be happy to pay 200% for. Between the steaks, the calamari, the chorizo meatballs... this place is a gem! Doesn't look much from the outside but crack the door have a seat enjoy a "everybody knows my name" top knotch experience. Granted even with the happy hour steaks a 2 hour visit normally rings in about $130 with all the drinks you won't be able to resist, I pay it with a smile and shake the bartenders hand with a gracious tip of the hat. Favorite place for dinner in Vegas hands down. *Pro Tip* Rebel Republic is right across the street one of the best craft beer spots in LV pay them a visit first to wet the whistle, great beers friendly staff, tell Wendy I sent ya ;).
