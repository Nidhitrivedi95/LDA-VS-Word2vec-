Nqs4_gT6nKyeTOJ_rgu1mg We stopped up at Frankie's for a family dinner last week on Thursday kind of on a whim. This wasn't my first time so I kind of knew the drill that I would be getting a filling Italian meal.
 
Frankie's is in a strip mall close to Great Northern Mall in North Olmsted. The décor is dated, the servers are friendly and you really get the feeling of a good local business. We had no wait to sit down on that particular night but most nights around dinner time you will have to wait for a table. The menu is pretty much Italian classics and they do hit the mark. My lasagna and my fiancé's manicotti were fresh and filling. I like the complimentary bread and salad that comes along with the entrée (nothing special but free!). I have to say that the pasta and the lemon chicken they serve are very good. I hope to try their pizza in the near future.
 
Also, props to our waiter who brought my 4 year old son's meal out early (such a smart gesture that lots of restaurants can learn from). Thanks Frankie's, we will be back!!
