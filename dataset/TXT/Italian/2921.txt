I don't even know where to begin.

The sommelier was so extremely helpful in navigating us to the correct wines for our taste and mood, and when we hadn't yet hit "the mark" on the wine of the evening, she continued to put forth excellent choices. At one point, the manager assisted us with even more insight. 

As for food, we were welcomed with marinated olives and decided upon two dishes for appetizers: the scallops and the mushrooms, both of which were exquisite, particularly the scallops which were perfectly seared.

Our entrees were the steak and pork tenderloin. Here's where we had a bit of a complaint. The steak was AMAZING. Medium rare to a T! Beautifully seasoned and a texture that melted in my mouth, then pair the wine with it and BAM! WOW!
The pork was another story. In fact, we questioned if it was the same chef who cooked the steak. Pork tenderloin medallions over a bed of white beans and chorizo and pearl onions. The tenderloin was overdone and dry, and there were supposed to be figs in the bed. There were three slices of figs. This dish wasn't even in the same ballpark as the steak. 

I would comment on the dessert, but we opted for bubbles. Quite a lovely selection of prosecco and brut, we landed on a brut rose that closed out our evening. My goodness, what an evening. 

It was an absolute pleasure to chat with the sommelier and the owner, and I sincerely look forward to dining here again.
