LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA We chose Maggiano's to celebrate my birthday while on vacation in Las Vegas.  We got a table right away and our server was Nick.  He did an excellent job!  He was very friendly and helped us selection our dishes.  The appetizers are somewhat expensive, but the food was excellent.  A great place for special occasions.
