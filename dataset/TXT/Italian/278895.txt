YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ "No problem" is a problem because it is apparently replacing "You are welcome!" The service is forgettable, the food is forgettable... the price and stomach ache isn't.

This is a beautifully designed restaurant housing macaroni containers and beautiful scenic artwork on the walls. The restaurant was very clean. However, it was empty when I walked in and the cashier acted as though he did me the favor of taking my order. The cashier Patrick had no personality, but robotically said "sure," and "no problem" several times with little or nothing more to say. 

This was a to-go order. Overall, the Pepper Jack dish $8.65 with added sausage (6 small slices) for an additional $1.95 was nothing special. The sausage was flavorless. I honestly wondered if it was colored tofu. 

The Spinach Artichoke Mac was reportedly good from a teenage standpoint - but he just got braces and was thankful to have something he could eat! My thought - $9.50 for a small bowl of cheesy macaroni is ludicrous. I could make a huge pot of goulash or macaroni with sausage for less - and I wouldn't have to hear "no problem" in the process.

Afterwards, we both had stomach aches.
