ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg Awesome place to go for very flavorful Itallian at a very reasonable price. The rusticas are unique and tasty; I recommend the eggplant. The brushetta is also a great way to try many flavors in one order by picking 4 different kinds. Service is always good and it's an easy place for takeout as well.
