z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ I had previously reviewed this restaurant and gave it five stars.  The second time, a Sunday evening, not so much.  The great, the good and the bad:  The Great: Calamari appetizer, very tender ($9);  Great filet mignon, done perfectly, ($40) delicious. The Good:  Beet and arugula salad ($8), large portion, enough for two.  The Bad:  Salmon and Peas pasta (highly recommended by the waiter) very salty smoked salmon, in sauce lacking flavor, all in a thick doughy pasta ($28) inedible; Italian wedding cake, excellent the last time was tasteless this time, perhaps old;   the "service":  the waiter was attentive at first but then disappeared,  The busboy definitely lacked training.  When clearing the dishes he spilled some of the steak sauce on the table in front of my wife and made no effort to clean it up, leaving a large spot for the remainder of the meal.  He served coffee and never asked if a refill was desired.  He cleared the dishes from our table and an adjacent table on a large tray directly in front of our table.  Definitely not first class!  I would add that this time the manager never stopped by our table to inquire about our meals, which he did on the last occasion.  I was totally disappointed this time in comparison with the previous visit and would have to think twice about going there again.
