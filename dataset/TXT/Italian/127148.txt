hUHIahAcew5i39D_6ZqEmQ On  a  cold and snowy Friday night in the burgh....not much was happening anywhere. However a few brave friends of mine ventured out to hear one of our favorite Pittsburgh singers perform in the lounge area. Picture this scenario; restaurant empty, tables in the bar with reserved signs - empty, not a lot happening. My 4 friends and I easily secured one of the also empty seats at the bar, we ordered dinner and appetizers. The food is passable as well as the service as long as you don't get Christopher, he only caterers to the "A" list people women are invisible. (May I kindly add that  none of us are economically challenged) About our group: None of us are heavy drinkers, in fact given the icy weather conditions getting seriously buzzed was not a particularly responsible decision. I was taking an antibiotic my other friend has a disability and cannot drink and the other ladies decided not to tempt fate. Our average bill was a respectable $70.00 per person. Imagine our horror when we were asked to leave because we were drinking water, coffee and tea with our deserts. I know I don't drive a Bentley and I assume the owner David Tasone can boot people out of his playground whenever he so desires. As for me and my friends we are taking our money where we get treated respectfully, like the Fairmont, food is better there anyway. As one of the world travelers in my group the general consensus was the have never been treated so rudely. Do not go here if you do not have a man in attendance and at least one alcoholic.  You  will be disappointed.
