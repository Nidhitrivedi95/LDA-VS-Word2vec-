z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ My boyfriend mentioned wanting to go to Joe's about five times in the past month, so I finally made reservations for our anniversary. Before we were even halfway through our meal, we were talking about what we planned to order next time- that's how good of a first impression they made!

We started with a gratis cold app of roasted eggplant and olives in San Marzano tomatoes with the bread basket while we reviewed the wine list. They have a surprisingly small selection of Italian reds but Levi guided us towards the Palazzo Della Torre Meritage and it did not disappoint. We ordered the giant meatball app recommended by so many other reviews, and it was great- robust sauce, ample fresh ricotta, and a flavorful blend of meats. The nightly special app of a grilled porchetta with peppadew vinaigrette, also recommended by Levi, was pretty spectacular too!

We shared the house Caesar, a huge portion with a great dressing but no anchovies, followed by the 24oz porterhouse and a side of the truffle mashed potatoes. The steak was huge, great char, paired well with but did not need the house zip sauce. It was exceptionally tender and immediately absolved me of the guilt of not ordering a pasta dish at an Italian restaurant. The potatoes were a shareable portion with a pronounced truffle flavor and a smooth texture- if you are a meat and potatoes kind of person, this meal will make you quite happy!

Our server brought us a complimentary Grand Marnier creme brulee for our special evening, which was totally unnecessary but much appreciated. Service throughout was attentive and warm. Looking forward to another visit to try the pastas or the 32oz Tomahawk!

TIP: Sit at the bar to avoid a wait, it also has the best lighting. You won't be able to get your Caesar prepared tableside but they will waive the 2-person minimum.
