PxTKXsdYqoFHWAG2amz0XQ I have to applaud the amazing staff at Nook for handling our large, boisterous group of business travelers with both amazing service and friendly demeanors. We were there for roughly 3 hours and they kept our drinks full with smiles. The food was excellent. We had 10 diners and everyone was very happy with their meals...a feat not often achieved with this size (and assortment) of people.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll be back.
