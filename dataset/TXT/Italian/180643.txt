NvG2KYObJujUeswSDmww_w I guess I'll be the dissenter in the group in the sense that I liked Wild Vines better under the old management. I like the idea of a wine bar because it's not the same as going to a sports bar or a sit down restaurant. In my opinion, it should be a place you go with a small group of people (2-4) to have some wine and enjoy conversation with your friends. 

Wild Vines is still small, well decorated, and boasts a nice menu, but it is also louder and has a different atmosphere now. I understand that's a personal preference, but now instead of going out to try a new wine, I'll probably stay home and uncork a bottle with my family instead. 

On the bright side, I've never been disappointed with the food, and this most recent visit was no exception. The mini cheese plate ($5 during happy hour) was delicious!
