jW4-bGuymLGlB9OBsTq3TA I'm going to be short and to the point with this one. 
   The location was out of my neck of the woods. However, when I arrived I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is on the corner of a little plaza with other bars and little shops. Nice place across from consol. I'm sure the location is still up and coming because it wasn't extremely busy. 
   It took maybe 3-4 minutes for the host to seat us, not sure why. The server was professional and helpful with questions I had on various items on the menu. We ordered the bruschetta to start. I ended up going for the Salted Caramel Apple martini and the Smoked Formaggio Blu pizza. My date went for the Chianti and pistachio salmon. 
   The Martini was very good. It has a perfect blend of all, the salt, caramel drizzle on the rim and the beauty of the martini. It was not strong but still had the martini effect! The Pizza wasn't huge. Maybe the size of a dinner plate. It had a good amount of prosciutto, artichokes and pistachios. I'm not a huge fan of Blu cheese, but it was tastes with the pizza toppings. I ordered a side of marinara for dipping.
    The salmon was served with an herbed linguine. The salmon was a decent size and was drizzled with a balsamic glaze, which my date ordered more of. The food was served on such a big plate that it did not look like there was a lot, but it ended up being very filling.
    The bruschetta was served on three slices of bread, ended up being just a wee bit tough, with the diced tomatoes, a little chunk of mozzarella on each piece and drizzled with their awesome balsamic glaze. Over all, it was good. The calamari is supposed to be very good from what I hear.
    For a price range for  just myself:
2 drinks, half of the app, and the pizza including tip came to a little over $40....
Not really short and to the point, but I try:)
