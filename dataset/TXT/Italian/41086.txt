7JWWeXqil03Ua_wV9KN8ZQ EDIT: as I was finishing my review I noticed the restaurant offers 20% using the Yelp app if I would have seen that I would have certainly not had issues with the prices.

Overall the food was good but shy of spectacular, the service was decent and I found the prices on the higher side but the portions are certainly large. Some of the details:
We were staying at one of the resort by lake Las Vegas and decided to stay around the lake for dinner. We read the mixed reviews and wasn't sure what to expect but decided to go Italian instead of French although the French bistro had better ratings. The hostess was welcoming and our server was pleasant. He wasn't too wordy but I certainly didn't mind it at all but some people used to more attentive service might not appreciate it. I would maybe describe it service with a European flair or lack of it. We ordered a glass of wine, a glass of beer, sparkling water, one of the specials - fettuccine with meat sauce - and a sausage pizza. The rose was quite approachable and good but not spectacular (FYI - it is listed under whites). My pizza was quite large, easily shareable at least 20 inches if not larger. The sausage had a nice hint of fennel and the pizza dough could have been a bit saltier but overall pretty good. I'm still deciding if it was worth $24 but not bad at all. The whole wheat fettuccini was a bit thick for my taste but the meat sauce was quite good and needed a little something to make it great. Again the portion was quite big and my partner could not finish it. We also got a basket of bread with baguette slices and (I assume) focaccia but I didn't try it since I was told something weird was going on with it. Finally the bill came to $88 for two for food and a drink each. Overall that's not bad especially if we consider the amount of food served but I feel some might find better value at another place closer to the strip or downtown.
