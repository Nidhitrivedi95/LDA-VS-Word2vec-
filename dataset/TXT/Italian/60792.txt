AWJhMTYsIYzCIYAIUA-waA Went here yesterday for the first time.   I cannot say enough praises.  I haven't had such excellent service as I received yesterday.  Cheryl was our wait person.  She was very attentive, even made suggestions from the menu and spent a good amount of time answering our questions.  I ordered the Shrimp Portofino (my friend had a chicken dish).  I haven't had Italian food this good since I left Chicago!!!!

Want to make sure Cheryl is recognized for her outstanding service!!!!  Thank you Cheryl for making our visit so enjoyable!  We'll be back!!!
