OghZizVgCAs1mOTbUr3SyQ I went here for dinner with a couple of friends, I have to admit I wasn't all that impressed. Yes the staff were friendly, which is nice, however I found the food uninspiring, average, and bland - and isn't that one of the main reasons you go out to eat, to have good food? 

Maybe it's due to the fact that I've been watching a lot of professional master chef lately, but when I go out I expect to eat something that tastes great, which I would have trouble cooking on my own (I'm not a good cook so that isn't hard to do).  The food was just average, and kind of expensive for what you got. We also ordered a bottle of wine, which was not cold enough - this is a pet peeve of mine... I hate complaining about a place as everyone's experience is different, but there you have it (I had the chicken, maybe you'll have better luck?).
