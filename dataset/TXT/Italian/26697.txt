4Odbtgh9g8XUKorRg7MTHg This is the way it is suppose to be in Las Vegas. I will take business clients and my wife here so they see I know where all the locals go and for good reason. The waiter was excellent and this place makes you feel like family with the best live singing I have heard at anyplace. It doesn't get better than great food & great music it will blow your mind as you see what new vegas is missing! This is what vegas should be all about. The Ramsey's and other celebrity chefs could learn about making a special night not just churn em and burn em out of your troff. Thanks for keeping it real special
