9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Went here when traveling for work as a local colleague recommended. Excellent spot fresh pizza. Fresh salads  and nice atmosphere but the most memorable part of the meal was their deserts. Nutella crepes were unbelievable.  We went with a group of 15 and service was outstanding. Next time I am in Phoenix, Cibo is a must stop.
