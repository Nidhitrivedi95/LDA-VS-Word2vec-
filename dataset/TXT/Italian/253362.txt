VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w My husband and I had dinner here courtesy of Jason, the manager, earlier this week and we had a pleasant experience.  We had the Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta Cheese and it was delicious.  The creamed spinach had a Parmesan crust, the garlic bread was good, and the Lobster Fra Diavolo Bisque was spicy.  Great place to go on a date night.
