qBXfNxSpo2_8cP_WHQRvOg We have been to many Olive Garden restaurants many times.  We like the soup and salad lunch along with the fresh, hot breadsticks.

Three of us stopped again for lunch.  We were seated fairly fast.  Server took our order timely but getting her back to the table was a little difficult.  Salad was good and so was both of the different soups we tried.  However, we were disappointed with the breadsticks.  Even though they were hot, they were crusty and hard.  They were very unlike ones we'd had in the past.

Thus, the 3 stars instead of the normal 4 or 5.
