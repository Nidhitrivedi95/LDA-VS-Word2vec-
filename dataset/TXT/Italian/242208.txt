UlSvQqRRzrqRy5i5hHlQaA I went here on Sunday (8/3), and I've forgotten the waitress's name, but she was a young blonde girl. Anyway, I had a fantastic time at this restaurant.

Waitress - I think she was the best waitress I've ever had, so I really wish I remembered her name! Incredibly polite, really funny and charming, returned to check on us multiple times, brought out new waters without having to be asked, etc.

Anyway, on to the food. The bread and olive oil she brought out at the beginning was good. Nothing spectacular, but certainly good. I ordered a caprese appetizer, and while it was smaller than I was anticipating, it was delicious, delicious, delicious. They used some of the best basil I've ever tasted. For my salad I chose the "creamy parmasan" dressing, which was really disappointing. It had an almost fishy aftertaste, which I wasn't expecting, so next time I would choose something different. And then for dinner I ordered the "tag pic pac." It was also really good. The portions were really generous for that, and I had some leftovers to take home.

Five stars for service, four stars for food. I'm rounding down to 4 stars, rather than up to 5 stars, however, because our table was kind of dirty when we were seated.
