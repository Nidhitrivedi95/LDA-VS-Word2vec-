qrCWmo0o3On13ltqOdRgkw My first time here on the evening of 12/9/17 was pure disappointment. The menu TVs were in the wrong order. The first one was just an ad. The rest were closer to the register than the first place you order. The menus were also too hard to read due to such small font. As my family and I were trying to figure out what to order and trying to squint to read the menu the worker kept spouting out "What can I get you?" impatiently. So...we left. Doubt we will be back. Thumbs down. Penn station got our money last night.
