Hjfp1i2kVSyZCH5d-MC42g Stopped in for lunch on a whim... SO glad I did. Delicious pizza. Got the "Hatch chile" pizza and was not disappointed. They use a wood burning pizza oven which gives the crust a great char. The hatch chile had a kick, but didn't destroy my tastebuds. Very friendly staff, who were quick to answer my random questions and made my visit better than your average "pizza joint"  10/10
