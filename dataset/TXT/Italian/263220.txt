wWDNwNb6ygJorKujOuifhA Fantastic place. Their Heirloom Tomato, Mozzarella & Prosciutto Panini was the best I have ever had. I liked it even better than Bianco's. My only wish is that you could order a half sized or side salad to go with it. I think the Panini's are better than their pizzas but I have only had one. The service is great and the prices are reasonable.
