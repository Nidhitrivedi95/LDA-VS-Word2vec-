2F0Z9dDJpNgeO-naxgJ9Fg Do yourself a favour & go to Chiaro ASAP. I can't praise this restaurant enough. Firstly the atmosphere is beautiful. I've been a couple of times & both times it was a warm summer night & the front windows were open with a light breeze coming in swaying the curtains & it felt like I was in a place far away. The first time I went there was live music & it was fabulous. The service is spectacular. We've had Johnny both times & he is knowledgeable and personable. Christina the manager is wonderful & wants your dining experience to be special.
Now for the food - WOW!!! DELICIOUS!! ORIGINAL!! There is so much love that goes into every dish. Your mouth will be so happy after every bite. Octopus appetizer is beyond any octopus I have tried. It's very hard to find a restaurant that cooks octopus properly. After you have this appetizer, it will be hard to find anything as good. The fried calamari are perfectly done. My friend had the lamb chop appetizer & commented on how great they were. We've tried 3 of the 5 salads & they are all extremely yummy. The flavours are original and you can't go wrong with any of them. All of our mains have been incredible. We've had the seabass, salmon with lobster & the salt coated fish. They are all delicious and I would recommend them all. If you are there on a night that they have the salt coated fish, order it. It is something different & it melts in your mouth!  The deserts...I don't eat dessert, however I had to try one since everything else was so phenomenal. I had the Vanilla creme brulee with the nutella ganache. Oh my goodness!! It was so sinfully delicious. 
You can tell there is a lot of pride in the presentation because it is outstanding. Every dish is a work of art.
There are many good middle ground restaurants that are good but this place is special. It is a diamond in the rough & somewhere that you must try. You won't be disappointed & you will be talking about the food for days.
