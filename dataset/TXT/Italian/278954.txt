YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ Where's the Beef??

We've been curious for sometime and today was the day.

People have short attentions spans so I'll keep this review brief.

Upon entering there was no line and we went straight to the register at 2:05pm on a Saturday afternoon. Our cashier later turned out to be the "manager" We told him this was our first visit and asked for a walk through. He pointed to the menu and explained "I guess they call these the pastas" he made no mention of their $7.99 lunch special, or their rewards program. -first time visitor-fail!

$27 for two people eager to try out the goods. I ordered the philly Mac ($9.95) and added mushrooms for .65. See the photos for details, all proteins here are portioned out to 2.5 ounces. I paid $10 for the philly, and only received a drizzle of meat. What a joke.

The staff was busier singing along to Justin Beiber and playing with the stereo system than cleaning. The benches are torn and there's trash all over the floor. As I write this review 38 minutes after walking in the door they are finally making a half attempt to sweep.

***training tip*** the worker who is sweeping also delivers orders to waiting tables. Please train her to keep her thumbs out of pasta and soup bowls. A minute ago she was sweeping trash, and now she's got her thumbs inside of food bowls. There was no hand washing in between, I watched!

It's an interesting concept, and the food wasn't awful, but the portions sizes are a joke (tons of Mac, a dribble of anything else) the staff is young and inexperienced and the facility is quickly going downhill.

Next time I'll save my $27 and go elsewhere.
