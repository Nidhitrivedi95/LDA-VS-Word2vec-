BrhyYc1-gn3lPuhlkqNk2w We will see...just got here, told 15 to 20 minutes for pizza. 15 minute wait so far.

To be continued...

Yum! Okay, worth the extra 5 minutes wait!

I got the extra large, regular crust with garlic Vegetarian with no Green Peppers and added Green Olives. OMG...so good and cheesy!  The crust was perfectly crispy and not chewy! 

This pizza was GREAT! Don't know why I haven't been there before...it's right behind Burger King on Baseline and Stapley. 

Go, go...great price and I'm glad to say, it is better than Venezia's.
