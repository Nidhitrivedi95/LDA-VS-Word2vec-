j54J0Ky4ruVbN_NTJ3daFg The food is incredible!! Despite getting caught in a thunderstorm, and having to wait in an awkwardly crowded area, it was totally worth it!! This was my first visit to Girasole. We were a group of 5 celebrating my daughters engagement. Shared a bottiglia di vino.  All of our dinners came with a fresh salad with sunflower seeds and a nice vinaigrette dressing and blue cheese. I ordered the fish, which was salmon. Unbelievable!! It was served over an artichoke purée and was cooked to perfection. Everyone tremendously enjoyed not only the food, but the atmosphere as well. A man was playing acoustic guitar Italian music. I am Italian, and this was the real deal!  I will definitely be going back!!! Love this place!!
