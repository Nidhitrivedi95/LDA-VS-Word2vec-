JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A 7 West Cafe is a gem in the Yonge/Bloor area with a warm and cozy ambience. I decided to finally write a review for this place, because I think a restaurant is worth a good review when you've been 5+ times and always leave satisfied. What keeps me coming back? Read on...

THE GOOD:
- This place is open 24/7. Let that sink in: 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This is huge, Yelp friends. Whether you're looking for a cute date spot, a place to catch up with friends, or somewhere to end off your night in the wee hours of the morning, 7 West Cafe will fit the bill. I even saw someone studying there last night.
- I would best describe the menu as "gastropubby" - you have options for pita pizzas, pasta dishes, burgers, sandwiches, and all day breakfast. Last night, I went with the mac 'n cheese with bacon, and it was one of the best mac 'n cheese dishes I've ever had (a close tie with the one at Local 1794 in the Danforth/Coxwell area). It was super cheesy, a generous portion size, and who can say no to bacon on top? 
- The desserts at 7 West are heavenly - particularly the cakes. Make sure to try a slice of the red velvet cheesecake (I hope you aren't counting calories today!). 

THE BAD: 
- I'm docking one star as the main dishes here can be a bit of a hit and miss. My friend got the grilled cheese and was a little disappointed - it wasn't bad, but it just wasn't great either. If you want to play it safe, take my advice above and go with the mac 'n cheese!

For me, 7 West is the perfect spot for those long, overdue visits with my girlfriends - and given that it's open 24/7, we know we have all the time in the world to catch up.
