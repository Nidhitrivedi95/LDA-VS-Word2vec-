Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA Yesterday my wife, granddaughter and I went to Joe's New York Pizza with my granddaughter's service dog.  My granddaughter suffers from PTSD and severe depression.  Upon entering this establishment, the manager came out from behind the counter and told us we couldn't bring the dog into his establishment.  At that point, he began to raise his voice while telling us to leave.  I attempted to tell him it was a service dog to help her, but he drowned me out while yelling over me.

We left the establishment without further discussion, and my granddaughter was forced to take her meds to calm herself down.  Three hours later she was still visably upset and crying over the incident.

Whether you go to this establishment is totally up to you.  My point for writing this post is to warn other individuals with disabilities to know in advance this establishment does not follow the ADA Laws that the Federal Government and the State of Nevada has established for people with disabilities.
