tYbK94fl50os3h_RjpY4gw If I could use one word to describe Rocco's it'd be: HUGE. The size of the pizzas and slices are hella big! There's no way I could eat more than 2 slices, and it's a shame, because I don't want to stop eating cuz it's so good! So far I've tried 4 of their toppings: cheese, pepperoni, meat lovers, and supreme. All very delicious. My favorite has to be meat lovers because the sausages they put on it taste like real authentic Italian cooked sausages.

Another thing I have to mention are tier garlic knots. We get the order of 6 knots for $3.99. & Just like the pizza, the knots are pretty big. It comes with marinara sauce but the knots are made with such a perfect blend of butter and garlic that they taste perfectly fine the way they are.

They have daily lunch specials for really cheap. I got the 1 slice of cheese pizza + side salad and my bf got 2 slices of cheese pizza and we also ordered the garlic knots. Our total was under $17 which is pretty good if you ask me, considering how much food we get. 

Last but not least the service was great. The people there are super friendly, they gave the place a homely vibe.
