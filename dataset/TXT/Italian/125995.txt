HrR_2-HUE6cqnoz1zMN9AQ LOVE THIS PLACE! Had been wanting to try it for a little while and this was my first time going. Got the bruschetta for an app which was fresh and delicious and very reasonably priced. I forgot the name of the pizza I ordered but it had eggplant and zucchini on it, very good and is a personal size (still had one piece leftover because I got full). For dessert we ordered the special which was a Nutella pizza with strawberries, amazing! Shared it with my friend since we were both already pretty full. Would absolutely recommend for not only the food but the atmosphere. Also very glad we decided to sit outside since it was such a nice night!
