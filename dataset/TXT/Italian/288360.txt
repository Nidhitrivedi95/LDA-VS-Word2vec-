Zps5RW0brl-s43OvlCgZAQ Fresh,  Fridley,  and fast delivery!  Thank you for providing this town with delicious  food.  My favorite is the salmon bow tie pasta with marinara sauce and veggies! The salmon is so tender and perfect. The soups are delicious and you can't go wrong with them. Try the pastries they have, always fresh! Everything is reasonably priced too. Thank you La Bella!
