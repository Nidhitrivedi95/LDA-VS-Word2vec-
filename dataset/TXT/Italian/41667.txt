As mentioned, it's a hot day so naturally, our server has decided to turn her polo into a belly top. Kinda weird to be face to face with someone's naval as you're ordering food, etc. But she was really great! Always on top of things with coffee and water refills. 

I ordered the blue cheese, chicken and bacon baguette sandwich. Also on the sandwich was spinach (cooked), tomatoes and red onion. The bread was nicely toasted and I like how it was just right, size-wise. The blue cheese didn't overpower the chicken or bacon. Everything sung together well. One snag was the bottom bread was a little soggy for the filling's moisture. Anwyho, I would've loved to eat my leftovers the next day but unfortunately I left my them on the table! Grrr. 

On the side was a little salad which tasted like the green salad at Japanese restaurants. Some iceberg lettuce, purple cabbage, black seseme seeds etc. It was all very fresh and tasty but kind of an odd combo with the sandwich. 

I kind wish I went for something a bit more breakfast-y but this is what I was feeling like at the time! We sat by the kitchen so I could see all the plates coming out and everything looked beautiful. I'd pop on a streetcar and visit this joint again.
