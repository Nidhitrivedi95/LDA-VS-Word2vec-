YOD9dXrnpu8HTRILpF0onw Have been here 3 times over the past few months.  Two times there were issues with our orders.  The first, they included chicken on the meal in which we did not ask for. We ate around the chicken, and the waitress had the dish comped on the check.

The second time my meal took about 25 minutes to come out of the kitchen.  The waitress (can't remember her name but she had an AK-47 tattoo) kept coming back to make sure we had our beverages topped off, and to keep us posted on the status of our order.  She also asked her manager to comp the dish on our check.

They've earned my repeated business with their great service and good food.  Would definitely recommend!
