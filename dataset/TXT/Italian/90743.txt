eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA I have been to Brio a dozen times or more and I think each time, my experience lacks  more and more.  At dinner tonight, my salad was dripping with dressing and the calamari had some horrific sauce glopped all over it.  What's the point of frying calamari if then you drown it in some sauce that is incredibly heavy and masks any taste of the squid.  On top of that, the service was less than average.  Other than a nice place to dine al fresco, I don't have any interest in returning.
