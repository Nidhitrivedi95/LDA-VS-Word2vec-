eHhBGqQbDpCcSpz7SZPTbA We found this place from the awesome Yelp! Reviews. It did not disappoint!! From my husband's fried mozzarella to my gluten free spinach artichoke dip, then on to the fabulous gluten free pizza, we left stuffed. We were celebrating our honeymoon in the area and through conversation they found out and gave us an appetizer on the house! If we lived here this would be a go to spot for us! Thank you NYPD! You made us feel so special and full!
