VVeT1XqQYwrB_fbp3efdUg last night we received the wrong toppings on our hot dogs and our sides were reversed (we just picked off the incorrect toppings and traded our sides) we got the Chicago style and Carolina. they were just okay. the fries were pretty good. I was actually pretty impressed by the atmosphere. there were tvs everywhere, the lighting was nice, lots tables/booths, a small bar with local beer on tap and it was clean inside. I want to go back and give it another shot, I really want to like this place!
