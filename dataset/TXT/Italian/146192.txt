K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ I was a guest at the bellagio and I was unimpressed with this club. First off, people who let you in, take that job way too serious.  You would think I was going into the white house.  Inside,  typically new age phoniness, table service everywhere, with no where else to sit .Dj apple mac computer spinning,  expensive drinks,  rudeness in the air. .all hail old school..
