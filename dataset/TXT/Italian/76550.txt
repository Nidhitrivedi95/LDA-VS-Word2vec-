cvLS5XdoeNluAiwBBm6opA It is consistently difficult to find any fault with this neighborhood superstar restaurant.  My companion and I had the pleasure of being served by Lisa for the first time the evening of 9 May 2017.  She could not have been more attentive, gracious, welcoming, and kind.  She did a lot to make the meal memorable.  Special mention to owner Joe, who always goes out of his way to make the meal great, and to one of the restaurant's gems: server Lori, who came to chat with us.  There are so many reasons to enjoy Franco's.  You
are cheating yourself if you do not try it.
