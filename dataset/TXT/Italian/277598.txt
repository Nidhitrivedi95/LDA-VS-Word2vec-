YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw The atmosphere of Bottiglia is so modern. It's almost if like Kate Spade could transform itself into a restaurant, you'd have Bottiglia. When you walk in (especially if you don't walk in from the Casino) it doesn't even feel like you're in Las Vegas! 

That being said, the food here was average for the price. My boyfriend and I came for brunch and had the lox and bagel (3.5/5), an omelet (2/5, serving sizes were small), and bread pudding which was the best thing that we tried. Presentation of the food was beautiful, but we both had the most terrible upset stomach after we left! So disappointing because we really wanted to love the restaurant due to it's beautiful ambiance and location.
