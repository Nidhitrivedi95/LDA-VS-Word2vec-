VfFHPsPtTW4Mgx0eHDyJiQ The drinks were a bit small & watered down for the price but the burger I had was pretty good!  Upon the recommendation of other yelpers, we also got the potato appetizer.  VERY good.  A friend also ordered the fried mozzarella & that was also tasty.  The waitress we had was friendly & was quite attentive in the beginning but as time went on, we had a hard time finding her & she forgot a few drinks people had ordered.  I will say that I was super impressed that with our large party, they had no problems with splitting the check up.  A lot of places scoff at you for asking but they were great about it.  We'll go back if we're invited but I can't see us going there purposefully without someone requesting it or a fantastic special of some type.
