rS3KdecMS-EF4H3VtmkxBw I've been to this place twice now both time with my boyfriend . The first time I went it was lunch time two ladys where there at the time the ladys where rude had a nasty addituted. Their customer service bottom line just sucked . Decided to go again tonight maybe give the place another chance, I regret it . We got there we sat down we must of waited 15mins before we got a menu all the employees were  on there phones . The guy brought us our drinks we placed out order they brought us our food. We never once got asked if we wanted a refill or if we needed anything else . Overall I'm very upset with this place . I don't see myself ever going back !
