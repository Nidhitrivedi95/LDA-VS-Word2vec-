R_epGBO7Cr1M0Ftc0JKV7w Gusto! No, thanks. Today marked my first and last visit to Gusto. The food was bland and the service was non existent. I get better service at Vapiano where they do not have wait staff. Angel was our waiter but did not wait on us after taking our order. I had to waive him down as he gingerly passed by our table to request salt for my tortellini and drinks for our table. Drinks finally showed up when we got our check. My wife ordered the gnocchi. It was over salted and bland. Worst gnocchi she has had in a restaurant.  I ordered tortellini with pesto cream sauce. Honestly, I think buitoni tortellini tastes much better than Gusto's attempt. What a horrible experience.
