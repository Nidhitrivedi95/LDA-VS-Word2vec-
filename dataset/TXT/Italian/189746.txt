P034NqfS_1sf-pC51170Kg If I dine here 10 times, nine of those times I order pasta bravo. It's all good. Most often I get it to go which can be an adventure. The to go area is sometimes manned by 1 person, the hostess stand usually has 4 young ladies waiting to take names and lead guests to their respective table, the problem is when things are slow at the hostess desk THE hostesses should keep an eye on the to go stand but they never do, maybe they resent the fact they are upper st Clair or Leno people and hate the idea of actually waiting on someone but this continues to be a weak spot, the bread is boring too, they used to serve 2 types but they abandoned the better of the 2 types.
