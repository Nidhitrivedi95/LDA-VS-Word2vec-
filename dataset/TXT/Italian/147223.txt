K99GG6-YZp5JbIe4oPbRsQ Great atmosphere and views. We went for Valentines Day so we could enjoy a nice evening on the patio but of course it was frigid and drizzling that day so we moved our reservation inside with no issue. Waitress was very friendly and personable. Our food was delicious- shrimp scampi and caprese salad were fantastic! Our waitress even brought out a dessert for us since she thought our food took too long to come out (we were in no rush and hadn't even noticed). Definitely will go back especially when the weather warms up again.
