BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg I so don't get it. Soggy pizza with terrible crust with such great reviews. There are certain restaurants that I just don't get the hype when I go. I see the atmosphere is pleasant and it's fancy for what amounts to a pizza place. I had an arancini (rice ball) and a pizza. Arancini was a lousy version of the many I've had elsewhere. I'd mention where they're better but that's not right on a review for their restaurant. The pizza was some of the worst in town. This is what I don't get. Even my wife liked it which kind of annoyed me.  How can you like pizza where the crust is mushy. Maybe I'm just a pizza snob. But, atmosphere doesn't matter to me. I want a good slice of pizza. There are plenty of good pizza places around despite everyone saying that none are good. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.
