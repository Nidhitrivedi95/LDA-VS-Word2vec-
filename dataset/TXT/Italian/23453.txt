Perhaps it was because the place was a little emptier.  Either way our server was fantastic and kept us entertained; in fact, he even put on a juggling show worthy of the movie "Cocktail" for us as we were finishing up.  This time I had the grilled calamari and it was excellent.  For my main, I had the gnocchi bolognese; it was pretty simple and didn't totally wow me, but I have to say, for a rustic pasta dish it was exactly what it should be.  I didn't have dessert, but others at my table did and they claimed it was fantastic.  Five apps, six dinners, four digestifs, and three bottles of wine later, our bill came to $400.  I have to say, I think it was worth every penny.
