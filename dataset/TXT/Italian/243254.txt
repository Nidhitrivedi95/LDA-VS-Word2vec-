UQiUVCtG-rJxoriuEv1RRQ Great family owned cafe on Main Street. Sid and Pat are super nice and always remember me when I call in my orders. Some truly great food I have had at Cafe Forte include the baked Brie in pastry, their baked chicken dinner, egg salad sandwich, chicken salad sandwich, the village salad, and an assortment of amazing soups!  This is a great place but it's especially great because it is a unique business, locally owned, and you can feel the love in their food.
