bRR4gsjHv0F_RnRGjQBqlg Recently fell in love with Italian ice at another chain in the area, decided to see how CJ's compares- cool to see that they offer grab and go options, and also have additional desserts in the form of ice cream sandwiches and customization options like specialized toppings and waffle bowls.

Black cherry and chocolate ices are solid but I went with my favorite standby, root beer, which always tastes perfect when topped with custard. Here, they pack the cup with ice then top it with a tower of custard- a bit too much for my preferences, but good value at under $5 for a regular which was three servings for me.

I prefer a smaller ratio of custard to my ice, but the custard here (vanilla) also had a weird metallic aftertaste that I wasn't fond of. Not sure if it's specific to the vanilla, something to do with the ice-and-custard flavors playing off of on another, or perhaps an issue with the machinery, but I'll be by to try again.
