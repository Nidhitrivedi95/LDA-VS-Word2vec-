2S-NV3clYHDbDEmqT8fuGg Found Davitino's via Yelp.  Read the reviews and sounded like a good place to try.  Overall pretty good.  The dinners were above average.  The Chianti was excellent and well priced.  Our server and service was a bit off out of the gate, but improved as the evening went on and we got her engaged with the table.  She was actually the bartender reassigned to handle several tables.  Not a happy camper at first, but did come around.  All in all, a good place with a nice menu.  One suggestion, at their price point, they need to invest in table cloths and a bit of ambiance, like Italian music instead of the rocker that serenaded us most of the evening over the speakers...
