I went during my lunch break from work and ordered it to-go because it was a gloomy day and it was beginning to sprinkle outside. I didn't want to get caught in the rain so as soon as I got my food, I headed back to my building. To my surprise, when I opened up the box at my desk, the Abura Soba turned out to be bland noodles with charred, blackened pork. It was so burnt, my co workers could smell it from 15ft away. It looked like leftover meat that had been scraped off the grill and dumped all over noodles, like trash. Never have I been so insulted with my food. How can they serve this poor excuse of a dish to customers? I wouldn't even feed it to my dog! I regret not opening the box while I was still inside the restaurant. I would've demanded a refund. Waste of $10.50.
