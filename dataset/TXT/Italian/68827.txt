BtLDbNfpwdwHSmyBJF2-RQ i went there with my husband and a few friends, and we couldn't even believe this place was located in Richmond Hill! LOL this was def. an upscale downtown restaurant. 

service AMAZING! 
food AMAZING
price overpriced

but really youre going for the service and ambiance. 

i would go there again for sure! 
not every week as i would be broke! lol 

but once every  6months for sure!
