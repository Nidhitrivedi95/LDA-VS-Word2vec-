First you must understand that I don't like Italian food, nor am I a huge pizza fan, in my world Papa John's is good.

But I went to take my son, and because my best friend said it was great. When we got their the place was packed but no wait. (By the time we left they were lining up at the door)  As soon as we sat down our server got our drink order, and finding out it was out first time gave us some history of the place. I really enjoyed that.

We started off with their cheesy garlic bread with sauce on the side. My son who states hates garlic bread loved this, even stating he'd come back here just for that.

We followed up with each of is getting a personal pizza, mine was their "Get Meaty", my son had a pepperoni & pineapple, both on their version of thin crust. For the personal ones, to me this seems like standard hand tossed crust and it was divine.

We each ate half and brought the rest home. Totally stuffed!  With our two drinks, he a soda, me a tea, our bill was just over 20 bucks. Well worth it in my mind. Our glasses were never empty, never did plates lay around on our table but we also never felt rushed or bothered.

My new favorite place to eat near my house, as we walked out I got a glance at the pasta dished, I think they might be next on my list to try.

Another bonus, they not only have take out, they deliver!
