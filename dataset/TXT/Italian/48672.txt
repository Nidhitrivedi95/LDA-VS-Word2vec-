99j5vhhtFJIefXDLsmA29Q Finally this style of pizza is available in Charlotte! I have been craving this for years after moving here from New York, and having lived in DC in the past. 

Excellent pizza with high quality ingredients. I just wish they had a location closer to Uptown. 

One suggestion would be to offer a smaller size individual pizza-their offerings are great, but they have to be shared. 

Can't wait to go back-definitely worth the trip.
