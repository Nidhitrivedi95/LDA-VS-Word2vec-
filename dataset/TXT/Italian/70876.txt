C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA We went to Kalendar the other night because Utopia was full. Kalendar is a little bit more expensive than Utopia but it was well worth it. 

The ambiance is really nice, the lighting and decor were very warm and romantic. We had the lobster ravioli and I had one of the scrolls with salad, which had chicken, avocado, tomato etc. in it. 

Both dishes were great, I especially liked the ravioli, the sauce was creamy and the ravioli filling was filled primarily with lobster and not cheap fillers like a lot of lobster ravioli is. The portions here are huge which is also nice, especially when you are dining with someone who will end up eating half your meal if he is not satisfied with his, like I was. 

We also had some sort of three-layer fudge cake for desert that was really delicious, the middle layer had a salty taste to it which I always love in sweet desserts. 

The service was friendly and quick, I'll definitely be going back.
