ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Tried this place out and it's an interesting concept. I liked the inner courtyard setup with grassy area and a few outside seating areas. We opted to sit inside the main dining area which seemed a bit odd and was rather bright and a cold environment with little decoration, but I think they are trying to be modern. 

After being seated it took a complete 10min for a server to acknowledge us which was ridiculous considering it wasn't that crowded. However once we did get a waiter he was fairly nice. We ordered a roasted sweet potato plate that had a Indian curry sauce which was an interesting twist, and a duck confit small plate for an appetizer. Both were excellent and a good portion and could easily have been a meal. Flavors were not overbearing but very good. One thing that annoys me though is that literally half-way through appetizers, about 5 mins in, our main meals came out. We weren't even halfway done. One thing I absolutely hate about restaurants is rushing a meal, especially a pricey one.

Next up we had the pork tenderloins with polenta,  and a pasta with a curry ragu. The tenderloins were cooked well and tasty but the whole dish was absolutely swimming in butter and oil (check out the photo). In my opinion if a restaurant needs to add that much butter they don't know how to cook properly, or the chef or line cook etc messed up and was in a rush and didn't bother redoing the dish. Either way not good and takes this place down a notch. The pasta was good and very different. The Indian curry ragu was unique and spicy and loved it, however the pasta was way to thick and chewy considering the ragu is already very rich. A thinner pasta would have worked better, but overall very good. Desert was a strawberry compote with biscuits and was excellent and not too sweet.

Overall decent place but they want you in and out quickly and the service is a bit spotty considering the price tag.
