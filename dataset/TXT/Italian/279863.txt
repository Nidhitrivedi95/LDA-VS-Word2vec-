yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Wife and I showed up without a reservation @ 8:15 p.m. Battistas's was very busy on this Wednesday night. Signed in prepared to wait (1 hr) , sat @ table in the bar. 
"Super"cocktail waitress Kayla took our drink order and served us from the bar menu, our request. Which consisted of Chianti (me), Moscato (wife). She had the Calamari frit appetizer, I had lasagna (best ever). This was as much food as we could handle Along with some garlic bread and salad, we were very full & happy campers. We've gotta get back soon to listen to the roving accordion player, as we dine Italian style. 
Battistas food is very good, and reasonable. We also loved the old school vibe. 
Viva la Italia & Battista's, molto grazie!
