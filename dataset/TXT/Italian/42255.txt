7qo6rqDjlHds8ObxzxBD4A FANTASTIC!!!  This is a great little find.  tucked in the corner, real mom/pop feel.  The bread knots were a fun appetizer (amazingly priced) and my family enjoyed a pepperoni pizza.  the red sauces were fantastic!!  Vito himself even came out and chatted with us for a few.

Nice atmosphere, great food, great price.  You've got a customer here!!! We'll be back!!
