Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA Wow Upward Projects, what can't you do?  Congratulations on your take over of Central Ave.  With Federal, Windsor, and Postino there are choices for all.

Federal's pizza is baked deliciousness.  Unique combinations on each pizza and excellent starters to choose from compliment the menu and my stomach.  Sandwiches are great and all can be washed down with a great selection of draft beer.  My wife prefers the wine coolers which are very tasty I must admit.  

Take home a Chub and anything from the menu.  Enjoy discounted drinks before 5pm.  Take your date here for a nice dinner.  Enjoy the outdoor seating and people, car watch with good food and drink.  Any way you choose to do it you should not be disappointed.   Thank you Upward, and my apologies to Windsor and Postino for the transfer of my business for the time present, but we will be back.
