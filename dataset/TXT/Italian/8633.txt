0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ I just discovered Novecento Pizzeria and I am so happy I did!  My all-time favorite type of pizza is wood-fired and it's hard to find that type of style here in Vegas.  No need for all the toppings as the crust, sauce and cheese should stand on its own, and they sure did here.  We ordered the Neapolitan pizza and it was just like I hoped it would be.  Crispy charred on the bottom but still soft enough to fold your slice in half, sweet tomato sauce, creamy mozzarella cheese and fresh basil.  We inhaled it!  We also ordered the burrata salad and it was amazing.  It came on a bed of arugula and chopped tomato with a balsamic / olive oil blend and a balsamic glaze.  Food is definitely fresh and flavorful. 

I have only one suggestion for the restaurant- add basil under toppings.  

It was my first time ordering via Uber Eats and I needed to add some delivery instructions since I must have missed it when placing the order.  Catherine answered the phone and was super sweet and offered the drivers number so I could personally tell him the directions.  Bill was our driver and was extremely nice and appreciated the phone call.  From placing the order to delivery was so speedy fast.  Very impressed.

Overall, it was a wonderful experience.  The food is fantastic and the staff is great.  I'm going to order again tonight - 2 days in a row!  I can't wait to introduce this place to everyone.
