lAFCW5rCTRCIDQWzEpysbA Every time we visit Las Vegas my husband has to have this, since we live in LA and hes from Chicago, he always looks forward to it. We ordered the peperoni classic on deep dish...it was meh, it was more dough than anything and more pricey, I prefer their thin crust. my husband of course loved it but Ive tried better deep dish in LA and of course Chicago...ill give you ONE more chance the next time I see you..
