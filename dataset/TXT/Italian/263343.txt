wWDNwNb6ygJorKujOuifhA Me and boyfriend Michael went to have dinner at forno and we were more than satisfied with the food and the service. Michael is an Italian native and his dad lives in a Naples so he always has big expectations on pizza. We have tried Bianco pizzeria since we heard lots of people raving about being the best pizza in Phoenix. Well that was an unpleasant experience and a restaurant that didn't live up to expectations. But Forno was delightful ! I had the daily pasta dish which was just the right portion and the pasta was cooked perfectly. Michael had a margarita pizza and he gave it two thumps up and said "this is the real deal." Roberto the owner was so welcoming and made us feel like we were home. The whole staff was just so friendly. The atmosphere of the place is very relax and intimate ; which we love. They do have a bar. We thank Roberto for such a good first impression and we are definitely having many dinners to come at Forno.
