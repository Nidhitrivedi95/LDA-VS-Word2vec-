q4mx-ff4_LvU3NnMvNIrZA Sometimes pick up food from here, have dined in a couple times. The service is always... decent. They have kids working the front which always seem more interested in talking to each other than seating you, but waiters are fine. I've never had anything I didn't like, but it's WAY expensive for what you get. Like, I think I could probably make the majority of stuff for less than I pay here. But I can't complain about the food, so I guess you're paying for convenience.
