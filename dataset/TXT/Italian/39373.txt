7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ My boyfriend and I came here during EDC weekend in June this past year. Still dreaming of that steak...It was so good, we came back for lunch before I flight left for LA that Sunday,

We will definitely be going back. Service was great, ambiance was great, food was amazing! Also try the beef tartar.
