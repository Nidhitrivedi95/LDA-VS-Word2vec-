sKy8HkP6X-8dCKq_SzeIpw Yikes! I really wish I had read the reviews before coming here. The food here is pretty good, but the service is not great. 
We came in on a Friday night and stood in the front for a couple minutes before someone told us we could seat ourselves. Once we picked out table we sat for almost 15 minutes before we were taken care of. We tried to flag down a few people but no luck. The manager finally stopped by our table to ask if we had been helped and then found a girl to help us out. 
Ok, in our servers defense she looked really young like 16 or 17 and this is probably her first job. She just came off as a little timid and when we asked her questions about the menu or what was on draft her response was always, "um, I'm not sure!"

I ordered the bruschetta and my bf ordered the meatball sub. He said his sub was fine but I thought my bruschetta was delicious! It's a bummer because I really don't see us ever coming back. Judging from the other reviews, poor service seems to be the normal here. I watched the manager with his staff while we were there and the vibe with them seems to be very lax. Which is totally fine as long as long as stuff is getting done and taken care of, which unfortunately it wasn't.
