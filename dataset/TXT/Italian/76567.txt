cvLS5XdoeNluAiwBBm6opA I've been going both to this location and to the one in Dormont for several years on holidays and other trips to Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, things seem to have gone way down over the last several years. Someone would have to twist my arm hard to get me to go back.

What really stood out on my first few visits was the quality of the meatballs. On my visit the other day, I thought they were below average. They were mealy, as if the amount of bread crumbs has been pushed as far as it can go.

I had linguine with meat sauce. Honestly, I'd have been happier with a Stouffer's entree cooked in a microwave.
