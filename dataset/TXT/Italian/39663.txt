7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ The Emperor Has No Clothes!!! This has become a grand tradition in Las Vegas, a city that has a grand tradition of wretched food. Rent a big name famous chef to stick on your casino restaurant and declare it fine cuisine. WHAT COMPLETE B*** S***! 

We had a $700+ dinner for 4 that was inedible in every way. And on top of the lousy food the service was even worse. Now that's a real accomplishment. 

We sat down, ordered some cocktails and two stunning wines. The cocktails took about 20 minutes to be delivered without explanation or apology in a half empty restaurant. On top of that our friends knew Mario Batali personally from New York which was known by the waiter. Do you think we might have some personal service knowing that fact? Certainly not!! 

The food was ghastly!! The salads were drenched with dressing. The side dishes were exhausted from sitting in warming ovens. The fingerling potatoes were stale, dried out and tasted like cardboard. The Veal Picatta was dry, limp, oily and has not a hint of lemon. My charred rare Bone-in New York steak was charred as I ordered but lifeless and devoid of flavor. 

After dinner we ordered another round of cocktails that we had to re-order 20 minutes later. 

We had researched for the best steakhouse in LV extensively and this was the most highly rated by more reviewers. It was a huge mistake! It makes me very suspicious of the myriad of other Rent-A-Chef places that the visitors bureau is trying to con us with.  If this is representative of the food this town has to offer, it's seen the last of us.
