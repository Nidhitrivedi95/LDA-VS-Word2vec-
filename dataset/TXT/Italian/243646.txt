UsFFaNUWG5u7f9rHpJBHRQ Good pizza,Sure it's Dominos. But the manager I spoke with when part of my order was forgotten was out of control. Basically if they forget to deliver something you paid for prepare to be blamed for it by the manager. First it was the drivers fault, then my fault for not staying on the phone long enough. I called back a third time and they said I would be getting a credit for my next order. I said I at least needed the dipping sauces for my breadsticks that were now hard as rocks and not edible. The manager yelled at me for hanging up the phone the second time I called. I didn't realize I was to stay on the line until the driver arrived. I assumed that since they had my number and address it was ok to proceed with my dinner. I've never been spoken to by such a blame shifting 'man' while giving them business. Fast delivery,  managers a bit of a loose cannon though.
