KsNZgnE0tFblW4Rfu72mZg Who doesn't cut a 24 inch pizza and has rude ladies answering their phones? This place does!

At first I really liked it there - but today shows how well they deal under pressure.

Last week we ordered and they forgot the ranch - spoke to Eli and said no worries ill put it on your account for next time - called today and the lady said well I can't give you the ranch if it's not noted on your account!

Ended up giving me two out of the 4 for free that I had paid for in the first place.

Also took an hour and a half for them to deliver the pizza.

For the non cut pizza and inconvenience of cutting it ourselves didn't offer a credit for next time or anything.

Good food but crappy customer service!
