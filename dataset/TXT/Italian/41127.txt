7JWWeXqil03Ua_wV9KN8ZQ This restaurant was a pleasant surprise when we visited The Village at Lake Las Vegas which is full of closed or vacant restaurant/office spaces. The staff is very friendly and attentive, making room for our party of six without a reservation and during a busy 4th of July weekend. They have a great menu/wine list and the food is terrific. We started with Calamari Fritti, Prosciutto & Mozzarella and Caprese  Salad, then had Lobster Raviolis with Tiger Shrimp and Linguini Pescatora for our main course. Everything was great and we couldn't have been happier. They view from their patio is nice, right next to the lake, but The Village is pretty much a ghost town and remaining businesses are struggling. I hope they continue to stay open as they are worth visiting if you get the opportunity.
