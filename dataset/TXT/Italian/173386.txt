N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg Another terrible dine-in experience. That's 2x now.

So let me get this right. Standard on take-out is to cut the pizza in squares...but NOT dine-in??? And I guess standard is to serve it undercooked and doughee...hope I don't get sick - gross! Didn't realize I needed to order it not only cut in squares, but cooked!

And the waitress is completely rude.

The worst part is...I touted this as the best pizza, and convinced a friend to come. So embarrassing; guess I'll be buying, can't expect him to actually pay for this crap.

Ugh.
