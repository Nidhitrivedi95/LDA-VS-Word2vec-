pHpOuNf02eMyhdCnvMQGhg The blackened shrimp appetizer was pretty tasty. The shrimp bisque was delicious. The fettuccine alfredo was a bit bland, and the chicken on top was bone dry. The filet mignon came out well done instead of medium, but the server was very gracious about having it redone. However, the replacement filet was absolutely rare (although it was very flavorful).

The decor and atmosphere is a bit dated (muzak and all), but it's not totally unpleasant. The service is generally pretty nice. There's a bit of a summer fruit fly problem.

Altogether, although the service is nice, the food quality varies too much for what you have to pay. Wouldn't recommend it.
