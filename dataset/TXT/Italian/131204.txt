iFZpyiDUgwldTWuW-5YW6A Meh.  Just meh.  Stopped in here to get out of the heat while checking out the local art festival.  To be fair, they are only usually open at night, but they opened for lunch with a limited pizza menu and drinks.  I was happy to get out of the hot weather, but wish I went somewhere else to eat.  Their sirloin and gorgonzola pizza was OK, but nothing to call home for.  They put the wrong drink specials up on their board outside and wouldn't honor them, so we just kept to water since their prices were nightclub prices for 2pm on a Saturday afternoon.

The service was pretty slow considering there was literally seven people total to serve.  I wouldn't go back, but I'll admit the decor was nice.  i could see it being a nice lounge spot at night.
