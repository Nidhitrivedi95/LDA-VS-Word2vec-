eRjcli4nDHRwhByViUz9Ow Craving Chicago Style Pizza?  Well look no further, just bring a truck to get your leftovers home.  Their breadsticks are to die for.  Garlicky, yet not greasy, small, almost french fry size but light and crispy.  We got an antipaasti salad which wasn't very creative but was delicious.  I should have stopped there.  Salad and breadsticks would have filled me up but we came for the deep dish.  My wife mistakenly ordered the medium deep dish.  Having had Chicago Pizza at its birthplace in Chicago (Gino's or Giordanos??? another time.), I was certain a medium would be about the size of a normal plate and deep.  Instead it was about the size of a large flat crust pizza except deep!  The crust was perfectly crisp and the dough light.There was a lot of flavor and not a lot of grease which is good for a deep dish.  The dining area is small but the Pizza worth the wait.

Ok, we aren't done yet, my daughter wanted pasta so we got her Penne (knock knock Penne, Knock Knock Penne).  Another truck arrived at our table and delivered a trough full of delicious pasta.  They will alter the dish as my daughter wanted melted mozzerella on top. They happily obliged.

So, we carted home 1/2 a salad, 6/8 of a pizza and 2/3 of the pasta for lunch and dinner for the rest of the week.   Did I mention that with drinks the whole meal for three cost $49.00. 

Why not five stars?  Well the atmosphere is not the greatest, the place is small and they don't have as many topping choices as I would like.  But if you are craving good pizza and pasta that won't break the wallet, this is the place to go.
