NVC1MFGTobWxYcuo_z7BGQ It's really very average, and I think completely fits the Yelp tagline of "meh. I've had better." There was nothing wrong with our meal. Service was prompt. Salad was generously proportioned and the tomatoes were pretty good for the depths of December. Ravioli of various types were decently filled and filling.

But. First, the website lists several dishes and a whole menu structure that just aren't present. Second, the sauces are a total fall-down. I cannot distinguish their red sauce from supermarket Ragu. No spice, no sense that something has been simmered for any length of time. I have no idea whether the ground meat in there is boar, beef, veal, or crumbled sausage, because it just doesn't taste of anything. Companions were similarly unimpressed by an eggplant and a tomato cream sauce. 

The ambiance is nice, it's very small and intimate but in a pleasant way. I appreciate that sort of "old school family restaurant" atmosphere. I just would like it to taste good too.
