q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ This place was "so Joel V." it was incredible! I'll go to CAPO'S every time from now on when I'm in Vegas. What not to like?? A mobster themed restaurant... Sign me up!

There is a little surprise waiting for you when you knock on the door, but I won't ruin any surprises...

The restaurant is dark with red leather big booths, with dark red velvet walls. They had a Sinatra styled singer performing, and we even had a magician stop by our tables and BLOW OUR MINDS!!  Seriously, one of the trippiest and straight-up scary performances I've ever seen. This dude was the son of satan.

Now on to the food... We started with a few appetizers. Ma's Meatballs, Calamari, and Bust a Cap Mushroom Caps. All were great, but the very spicy meatballs were my favorite. The warm breadsticks served with garlic butter were bomb as well. I ordered the Chicken Parm with Spaghetti con Suga and a creamy garlic salad. The salad was so tasty! The spaghetti fantastic! And the chicken parm so on point, it was perfection! The salad was one of my favorite salads I've ever had, and the chicken parm was possibly my favorite ever.

Now, onto the dessert... The chocolate covered cannoli was the best cannoli I've ever had. This place was a clean sweep! Awesome ambiance, cool theme and schtick, good entertainment, and fantastic food.

5 stars and a must stop for me next time I'm in Sin City. Highest possible recommendation.
