4qQVf2lt-47VcQ4v54PEXQ On a Saturday afternoon we were looking for a place for a late lunch, and based on the Yelp reviews, we picked Basil & Garlic Bistro.  I've driven by the little strip center hundreds of times, and never given it a glance.  What a gem!!  Fantastic little italian bistro, we've been back virtually every weekend since!!

Claudio and Nadine and their staff are very friendly and welcoming.  After that first visit learning that they were BYOB, we bring a bottle of our favorite wine with us for a great little dinner out.  Love their Pizza (grabbed one to take home and watch the Super Bowl!!), their Stromboli's ... the Chicken Parm sandwhich ... were both fantastic.  We are working our way through their menu, really enjoyed the Pasta dishes I've tried too.  

Just reading through other reviews as well, and realizing that we weren't the first to stumble upon Basil & Garlic!  I agreed with all the positives I was reading in other reviews!  If you're in the area, don't hesitate!
