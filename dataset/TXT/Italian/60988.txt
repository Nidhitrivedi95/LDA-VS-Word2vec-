Recently my uncle and I stopped in for dinner at Roma's and I have to say that I left very impressed with the food and the service. I ordered a shredded chicken pasta with peppers and onions and it was perfect. The sauce was spicy enough and the portion was generous. We were given a generous basket of fresh bread before our main dishes came out. Overall, it was the best Italian dinner I ever had in Vegas.  

The management of this restaurant/deli is exceptional. The owner (Massimo) came out to talk with us and was very professional and personable. The atmosphere is intimate and "hometown" feeling, not at all like what chain restaurants feel like. The location is a bit out of the way down in Chinatown, so I can see how most people miss this place if they are staying somewhere on the strip, however I would say it is worth the drive to eat here instead of the bland, overpriced, and overrated food you can get on the strip.

This restaurant had a very "local" feel about it. In a good way. In one corner was a young man and woman on what appeared to be their first date, in the other corner was a two of Las Vegas' finest eating as well, and then of course there was the large Italian family at the long table enjoying their night as well. It really had a cozy feel to it. At the end when the bill came, I was delighted to see that it wasn't overpriced either.  

Overall, I would not hesitate to come back to Roma's. In fact, I will request that we go back anytime I am in town. It was that good.
