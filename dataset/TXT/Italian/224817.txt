sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg We have been regulars at Emporio for a few years.  It's a fun concept and the fact that they use No Wait to manage the host stand allows us to make last minute plans.  While I'm sad that the recent menu refresh eliminated the spinach almond pesto the additions of crack sauce and spaetzle more than make up for it.
