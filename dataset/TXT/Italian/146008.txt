K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ Went last week on Friday. My friends and I were so hyped about this first time experience and I was sadly disappointed. The DJ was not anything special he just played random older music and in the middle of a decent song he played a slow song by Meghan Trainor and killed my vide. I knew as soon as soon as  I got there I probably would not like it but I went in with an open mind and left less than pleased. I will never return to Hyde unfortunately thank god I did not waste any money or I would have been mad. On a plus side if you gave them your email or something you got a free glass of champaign and the line was short and fast.
