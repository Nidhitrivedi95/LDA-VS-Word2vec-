9XLH_grfIYKR7d5ZT9ZX_A Melanie's Bistro is wonderful. Almost perfect. Sometimes when the gastro planets align (as in a beautiful Saturday at the start of a long weekend, a table open on a very small patio that seats only 4 people, a perfect double shot latte with honey, great food and great service), you get to write a 5 star review. 

Why is Melanie's so good? This is why. 

1) You can sit where you want to sit
2) The environment is definitely "bistro" with a warm charm and the hustle of a small kitchen making fresh food. 
3) You ask for honey for your latte and they bring you some in a small metal cup and not packets of Kraft honey or a leaky bottle.
4) The accompanying mescaline greens that come with the smoked salmon eggs Benny are almost better than the Benny. 
5) The perfect portion of eggs Benny to greens and fruit
6) Prompt and friendly service from the hostess to waitress to the food runner. 
7) You ask for a menu after you start eating just to see what else they have. 
8) A perfectly crafted brunch menu with eggs, burgers, fruit and salads. Small but perfect. 
9) The rest rooms are CLEAN!
10) The prices are very reasonable!

The eggs on the smoked salmon benny were absolutely perfect and looked like they just arrived from the farm. One of THE best smoked salmon eggs benny EVER!

So my review is perfect but why do I describe it as almost perfect? Because the gastro planets don't always align and I will have to go back again just to see if the same experience holds true. And I look forward to doing that!
