Jpyh7MfaNysY3geXjhzqJQ First time ordering, I was pretty excited since restaurants are sparse out here in Peoria. I looked at their menu online and decided to give them a call to order take out when I was out and about doing some errands. I planned on trying a few salads with the pizza's I ordered, but was rudely told by the girl on the phone that they only took paper coupons ('printed only'). In the days of digital coupons, they should put this disclaimer on their site so one is not confused that they can take advantage of the coupon without printing- or maybe save a tree and go digital. Ordered a few chewy pizzas and one salad that was drenched in dressing even though I asked for it on the side. The pizzas were bland, tough, and the toppings were sparse. The fig pizza was way too sweet and the figs were cut too large.  The servers seemed uninterested and bored. Even my pizza loving kids were underwhelmed, and my daughter said hers gave her a stomachache.  I think my $42.00 would have been better spent next door at Papa Johns, at least their pizza has some flavor.
