-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw I went here the other night for my wife's birthday with 10 people total and the general consensus was that the pasta dishes weren't good.  I split my wife's pasta dish, shrimp and pasta and the pasta wasn't cooked correctly and the sauce tasted bad.  Other pasta dishes at the table tasted the same since we shared dishes.

The service wasn't great either, and we had 2 servers.  The food took forever and one of our friends didn't get her food until well after we did, which is never good.

We tried this place because it looked good and for the location, but there's plenty of other places I'd try before ever going back here based on the service and quality of food.
