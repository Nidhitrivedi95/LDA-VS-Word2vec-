GWhp4fCu-NWR9PTJBi4Ifg The other night after picking my kid up from day care and too tired to cook, I decided that I wanted pizza and was curious to try NYP&P.  Since that evening, I've been back a second time because the pizza is pretty good.  They serve large slices, have fresh toppings, great sauce - not what you'd expect from a strip plaza in Indian Trail.  

BUT don't forget that half of New Jersey and New York live now live in Union County and they're opening some pretty fabulous restaurants.  

A big surprise are the deserts.  For $3, you can have a monster slice of cake or cheesecake and both are delish.  There's even a buffet for lunch or dinner.  

I think what I like most about this place is that it's a great place to just enjoy a slice, enjoy talking with friends, without the distractions of a million tv's.
