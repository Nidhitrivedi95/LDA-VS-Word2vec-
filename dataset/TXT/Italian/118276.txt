gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw Great atmosphere! Nice and lovely setting! Pretty upscale. Good service.

Breadsticks & bread while we were waiting were good and as expected.

Appetizer: We tried the fried calzone and prosciutto balls.  The calzone wasn't as expected.  It didn't have any marinara sauce inside, but just a bunch of ricotta cheese.  It wasn't fried very well either.  Too oily.  The proscuitto balls were fried well, but wayy too salty.

Entrees:
*Bucatini pasta with tomato/cured pork/onion - sauce is tasty.  pasta is cooked very al dente, and is extremely good.  small portion, but good!
*Braised pork shoulder with apple reduction and cucumber - large entree with tons of pork shoulder.  inconsistency in the tenderness of the pork though.  some pieces were very tender and tasted great, others were pretty dry and harder to eat.  the outside glaze on the pork was good.  plan on sharing this dish, unless you love tons of pork!

Overall, it was a good dining experience.  there's def better places in vegas though and this place is probably not one that stands out, except for its awesome location in the middle of the venetian...! :D
