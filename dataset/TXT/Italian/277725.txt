YjJnGaqvCpxspBLxXrOA9w Pleasantly surprised by this hidden gem. My fiancee and I had enough time to grab lunch together last Friday and after rummaging around her glove box for coupons and cross checking yelp we settled in for Gia Visto.

We found are way to a small unimpressive strip mall at first unsure if it was even open due to a lack of lighting we could see from the outside. We walked up and went in the find it to be cozy and romantically lit. You walk in and first see the kitchen/prep room, which isn't so great but their expanded dining room was very nice and cleanly decorated. 

We looked over the menu and each picked an entrée- my fiance chose the chicken risotto with spinach and I got the eggplant parm spaghetti. The bread we got was a little burnt and left us underwhelmed. However the food was absolutely incredible!! We both couldn't stop eating the delicious entrees that we had ordered! We were so satisfied that we even ordered dessert on the spur of the moment- which was also delicious might I add.

Overall food is 5 stars worthy. The reason for the 4th star review is just for average service and a pretty outdated exterior. All in all, you definitely should add this to a must stop for any date night or outing in the Monroeville area.
