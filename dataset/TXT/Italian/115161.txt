GQAvKHDfuBws7312iIqX6Q I'm so glad I read the reviews AFTER I purchased a Groupon for take out.  This pizza is delicious, and I would have missed it had I read the reviews & not bought the Groupon.  I guess people only take the time to review when they are upset?  
Anyways, I called in my order, told them I'd be there in 25 minutes, pizza was ready & hot.  The small was about the size of a smallish large.  Delicious chewy crust, right amount of sauce  (order extra if you like it saucy), and WHOLE MILK cheese.  They gave me a container of grated parmesan, even it was top quality.
The person who said this pizza is comparable to a grocery store pizza must be on drugs (not weed, he doesn't have the munchies)
My new go-to pizza place.  Looking forward to trying the wings.
