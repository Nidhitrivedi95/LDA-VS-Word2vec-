zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g Came here on a Sunday to have lunch with my boss, he was craving pizza so we decided to give this place a try. 

We got a sicilian pizza and new york style (Di fara special and pepperoni for the new york style). We also got an order of the meat balls which were tender and the sauce was perfect. The pizza was okay - wasn't the best I've had. 

One perk - we saw Nicholas Cage here with his family :)
