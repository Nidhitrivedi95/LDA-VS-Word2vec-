mY9tk1ZVMf9Zco9SaXMk6Q Wow talk about getting treated like a loser as soon as you walk in the door. First off the only reason I even went to this place is because we were about to see a movie. On any other night I would never suggest this place. FIrst of all the waitress seemed as if she was on crystal meth , she was very rude and not informative at all. Salad was vintage, my entree was absolutely terrible. All the waiters had chin straps looking like a high school football team . Sucky atmosphere. Sucky Music. This PLACE SUCKS!
