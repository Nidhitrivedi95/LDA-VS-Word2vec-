sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg Good ambiance. Enjoyed the concept. Service was lackluster at the bar downstairs at best. It wasn't even that busy! I ordered a salad and a meatball trio. Food was average at best. Presentation good. Terrible that you can not order a meatball smaller without ordering multiple items as each order can not mix and match. They should be more flexible so one can sample with the thought that finding something you like, might bring you back. However, not a place I'll be rushing back for.
