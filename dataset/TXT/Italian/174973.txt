ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw I think it's a good place to eat the food is good, drinks not so much. As a bartender myself, it would be nice to see experience behind the bar instead if cute and young. It's sad when a restaurant can't make a proper margarita! Also why no reservations???!! It's hard to get seated on a weekend night.
