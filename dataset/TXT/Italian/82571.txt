DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw $10.95 lunch special - choice of soup or salad and entree choice of salmon (small side of rigatoni with simple red sauce), pesto chicken (small side of the rigatoni pasta) or pasta dish with olives, tomato sauce and anchovies.

Ordered pesto chicken with pasta fagioli soup. The soup was one of the best I have had. Good bean to noodle ratio and broth was not super runny. Good use of fresh ingredients.

Chicken with pesto sauce was okay - thinly pressed chicken but the pesto was missing something. Pretty plain sauce for pesto. The small rigatoni pasta side (comes with lunch special ) has a good tomato and basil homestyle flavor.

Bread basket and olive oil is good. The olive oil has oregano and pesto in it - good taste and the bread is fresh!

Good, attentive servers, hosts, managers and staff.
