nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow i thought the pizza was really good. yeah, cleveland is most DEFinitely not chicago or NY... but maybe after going to all these so-so places in CLE my standards - for that day at least - lowered a bit.

in any case, i think it might be safe to say that this is one of the better restaurants in cleveland's little italy...for pizza at least!
