Right away I notice my friend inside this really cute and small place that only had like three tables. Right away an employee at the cash register greeted me. My friend had already order for us so our food didn't take that long. I had the "devil went downtown to Georgia". It was really good and spicy level was on point. Loved the music they were playing and even tho it was only my friend and I in there at the time I loved the vibe I was getting. Can't wait to come back again and try something new.
