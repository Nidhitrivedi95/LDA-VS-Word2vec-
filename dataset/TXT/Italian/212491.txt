There are so many great things to choose from and I have that to look forward to.

My last few visits have been awesome once I got my order in, that's the hard part as there are 2 order stations and each one is for it's own items. First timers will be confused, as I was as the lines snake through the tiny grocery lined dining room. stick with it and focus, as the payoff is amazing

It's ultra casual for sandwiches and Italian dishes this good. Quality sliced meats and cheeses are priced well and the specialty grocery items like San Marzano tomatoes and great Italian wine abound.

This is one of those hole in the wall gems! trust me and check this place out.
