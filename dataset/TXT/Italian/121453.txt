Hb7mHNnGD0dyJs2hScihOA We decided to try Amici and we were not disappointed. Our food was delicious and everyone we were with thought it was great. The owners were very personable and greeted us right away. While we did enjoy the food, a few of us got the "Around the Boot", and felt that we did not get large enough portions for the price. But all in all, a very good experience!
