jpn329BeGpfAa9n1uPYOrA I went to brunch on Sunday here and it was amazing!!! Excellent service, atmosphere and food. I got a frittata and it was delicious. Large portion sizes with quality ingredients! We got the brunch Groupon so we were able to bring in our own champagne and have unlimited OJ - highly recommend!
