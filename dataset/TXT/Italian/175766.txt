NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ The food at Montesano's is superb! My husband comes here specifically for the sausage and broccoli rabe. Their wedding soup is so hearty and hits the spot, just don't order too much with it because it will fill you up! We always get a couple of cannoli's to-go, it's a must! 
The only 2 downsides is that they don't deliver and sometimes the wait is a bit long. That being said, the wait is usually long because they are so BUSY! Their staff is always so helpful and check on you even if you are waiting for to-go food. I recommend Montesano's if you want authentic Italian food and desserts. The location is a bit ad a pain to get in and out of, but worth it!
