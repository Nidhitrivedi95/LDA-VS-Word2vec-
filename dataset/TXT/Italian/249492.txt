VjaHHmV-rSkFaOAnU3faxg Awesome pizza in a nice cozy house-restaurant! While they call them tomato pies, they're very similar to the pizza you're used to, so don't let that scare you from trying out this place.

The place is fairly small so it may be easy to miss, but you'll generally see a pretty crowded front patio-like area. In total, I would estimate about 7-8 tables inside with 4-6 smaller tables outside. For how popular this place is, that's certainly not enough. I noticed a lot of people get pizzas here for take out, which is probably a good idea if you're not a fan of waiting and it's a weekend night. 

Now on to the food: given that multiple people have told me that this is the BEST pizza in Madison, I was SLIGHTLY disappointed. Now that's not to say that Sal's was not good - it's excellent pizza. They do price the pizza at a higher amount than most people are used to for pizza, but I think it's worth it to try some of their more unique specialty pizzas. I really enjoyed the Forza! The crust was perfectly flavorful, and the toppings tasted fresh and well-cooked. 

I would recommend this place if you're a pizza lover for sure! I'm sure I'll be back here, and perhaps after trying other popular places (like Pizza Brutta), I'll see which one truly deserves to be crowned the "best pizza in Madison".
