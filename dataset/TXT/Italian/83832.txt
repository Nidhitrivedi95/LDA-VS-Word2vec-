DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q I was very surprised to find good quality and/or healthy choices at an airport. They offer a wide variety of foods from sandwiches to burgers to pizza. I had the Stacked Turkey Sandwich and I was shocked it was very good and it came with a lot of meat. Included with the sandwich were pickles and fruit. The prices are very reasonable, especially for an airport location. One gripe I have with the place is the order pickup. I can't entirely blame the workers because there are just so many people, both patient and impatient, ordering food. The workers are completely lost on orders and can't keep up calling the order numbers. If you can look past the questionable pickup, I definitely recommend this place if you have time and need food at the PHX airport (located at Terminal 4).
