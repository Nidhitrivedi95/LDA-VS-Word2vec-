UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ My wife and I went here in Saturday night and it was packed. It was a 20 minute wait for two. We got a couple of drafts at the bar, which was full so we were standing by the bar...drafts were $4....My wife asked the man working behind the counter, who was taking care of to-go's if we were in the way because we were clearly standing by the service Area and to go counter because it was just that packed. He immediately said no and struck up a conversation and discovered that Jeff was one of the owners.My wife asked if they had wings , which they did not but he immediately suggested the pizza muffins and because it was our first time there hooked us up with a half dozen. This was totally unnecessary but very much appreciated. We were sat in our estimated time and our server introduced himself and seeing we already had an app and drinks asked if wanted another round of drinks and   walked us thru the rest of the menu. The Buffalo Chicken muffins were awesome and filling so we went with a medium 12" pizza with sausage, pepperoni & mushrooms. The pizza was good ....better than all the chain stuff...Dominos etc...not Grimaldi's or Bianca's but not that price either...this is a great neighborhood place serving a good meal at a good price.
