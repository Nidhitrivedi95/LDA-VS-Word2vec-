JTKzGJvIK9yuoUf-erV2qQ This is a good lunch spot in the Strip, Pittsburgh, PA.

Smaller menu that includes some 4-5 Subs, 3-4 Salads, Pizza (Custom or by the slice) and 1-2 Pasta dishes.  Everything is easily under $10 per person.

I've had the Italian Sausage sub, it was quite tasty and a lot of food on top of a serious Italian Roll.  Go for the wrap option if you are more interested in the meat.

Salads are by far the highlight for me.  They really pile on the veggies for $5!  Add chicken or steak for another $3, (good, but pretty obvious they had been strips in the freezer earlier that day).

Decor leaves something to be desired, service is friendly enough.  Overally, fairly solid but nothing that really gets me excited.
