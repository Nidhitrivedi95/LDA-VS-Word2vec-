G2hTYYzvlg75BisWSHarLQ Decent little Italian place in the quickly developing area by the outlets, but the atmosphere is too fast-casual for the more extensive menu. 

Similar to many other strip mall Italian restaurants where you see pizza options displayed when you walk in, the minimalist decor and lack of sound absorption made this a bit louder and less comfortable than expected. 

An $8 10" vegetarian pizza was chock full of toppings and the crust had a nice crispness on the bottom, so a good value. The pasta dish we ordered was tasty and filling for $13. Bread and salad were run of the mill and unfortunately the service was a bit lacking, as we had to ask three time for our drinks (water), which were finally brought out with the food. 

Nothing outstanding about this place good or bad, it just seems to blend into the background when considering the variety and quality of culinary options around the metro area. Could be good for families or groups and the small patio could be nice in the warmer months. Local beers represented on tap.
