J5puhDnVL9WetWnWWDMhQw If i could have more than 5 stars i would!!   This was the best italian restaurant outside of Italy.  Its small and quaint and the food was absolutely amazing.  I had the veal picasso. My husband had veal marsala that wasnt on the menu but they were very accomodating when he asked if they could make it.  Even as full as we all were  our party of 5 each had different desserts.  I thought that the dinners were amazing but WOW the desserts were to die for!!!  The fantasy was almost too pretty to eat.  The cheesecake was the lightest best i ever had.  I really could go on and on.   You just have to come here!!!
