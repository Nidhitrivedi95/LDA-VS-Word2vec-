Kykw3ho8wHtLV6gr9qbWTg Really great.  All gluten free (except the beer) I think.  Happy hour was 50% off all apps and dollar off drinks entire restaurant not just the bar.  Meat balls with artichokes and the wings were great.  Caprese salad was great.  A few vegan options too.  I'm a meat eater with a gf wife so awesome place for me!
