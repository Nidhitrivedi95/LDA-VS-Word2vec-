2XHQdSM_FvQ7-PUUKaNDCw We had a 20 minute wait on a busy Friday night. Crowd was mostly loud groups of 50 somethings. I realised why when I looked at the somewhat pricey menu. We're not at Olive Garden.

Surprised to see the bread served with just butter on the side but they will provide olive oil when asked. My manicotti was good and heavy on the cheese and the portion wasn't overwhelming for 17 dollars. Service was also fine.
