bCrMHwCLZzyKsAUOiAL0OA First time having Ray's:  We ordered the pizza to be delivered and it was VERY GOOD!!  SO happily surprised after being so disappointed with other delivery pizza.  The portions are HUGE ! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I'm from the East Coast and I still long for that super thin - crispy bottom. (maybe ordered in the restaurant it would be crispy; that's usually the way it is).  BUT - for Arizona, this will do just fine :))    WINGS are super yummy too!! We ordered way too much than we needed because we're used to the sizes from other pizza places.  No complaints here.  We'll be back !
