GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA I have had some of the best food ever at B&B. I loved the wild boar papardelle. The lamb's brain ravioli was surprisingly delicious and the branzino was great. The only thing that was questionable was the tripe Parmesan, but I just simply didn't like the texture. Some people who are familiar with tripe might like it. All of the food was well cooked and had great flavors. If you are a picky eater I wouldn't necessarily recommend B&B. But if you like complex food it's a great place.
