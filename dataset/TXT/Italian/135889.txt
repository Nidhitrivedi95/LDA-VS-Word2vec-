Excellent pizza. I'm pretty picky about pizza and I'd have to say, this one is the best pizza places, hands down! I highly recommend the Pizza Primavera, which comes with roasted, seasoned red peppers, red onions and freshly grilled zucchini (I watched the lady grilling right in front of me - now that's fresh!) 

The dough and sauce are both home made - sauce has nice blend of Italian spices in it. 

So far, I have been here 4 times and I will be back for more.
