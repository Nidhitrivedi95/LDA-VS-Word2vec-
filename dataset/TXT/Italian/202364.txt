Speakeasies change the dining experience and this one doesn't let you down. The steaks, pasta, appetizers etc. all are amazing. 

The service is impeccable and the entertainment is first class. 

Earlier this month, I brought customers on back to back nights. This time I brought my family. Awesome all 3 times.
