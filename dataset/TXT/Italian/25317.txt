4HGVxC-zIeQnR1CsD9GePQ I have to agree w/ most of the reviews that are listed about Tutti Santi!

Fresh Bread and butter- very good.  excellent whipped garlic butter
The Homemade Potato Gnocchi is excellent!! A must try!
 I've had Chicken breast in noodles, cream sauce with tons of veggies!!- great! ( Remembering names- not so much!!)  
 Tiramisu is Excellent.  It is homemade and very good.

At the end of every meal is the complementary shot  sambuca.  

BIG TIME TIP  Go to http://Restaurant.com and get a gift certificate for a couple bucks and save yourself $25.  Well worth it!! (Thanks to other Yelp's who had this too!)

NUTSHELL- Above average food, A little above average prices. Always a special offered, always a great dish. You will never be disappointed here!
