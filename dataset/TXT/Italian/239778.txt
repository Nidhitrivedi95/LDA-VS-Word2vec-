u9R0_pvEkl7QGPJYH3j1sg Was in AZ a couple weeks ago and was told about this place. Always up for some good food, so went to check it out. Not too crazy busy since it was midday. Our server was Teresa. Now service means everything to me. And I'm really glad she was who we got. Attentive, friendly, efficient. Knowledgeable about the menu and helped us make our selections. Everything was yummy! I will definitely come back to try more items off the menu. And hope we get Teresa again. She really did make our experience here memorable.
