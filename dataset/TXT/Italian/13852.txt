1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ Good food. Always consistent.  Friendly servers.  Nice atmosphere.  Fun place for happy hour.   Great people watching.  The only thing they need to fix is the AC system.  Every seat in the bar area tables always has a blowing cold draft coming from vents and ceiling fans above. Asking to have it remedied we are always told there is nothing that can be done.    I would stay longer and spend more if it didn't have a gale blowing on the back of my neck!!!! Better wear a scarf or neck gator if you go.  Sadly it's like this in the winter and the summer. I live in Scottsdale so I know this to be true.
