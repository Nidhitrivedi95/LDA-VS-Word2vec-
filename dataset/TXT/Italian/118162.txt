gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw Service was fine the food was substandard. Canned tomatoes on Caprese and tasteless pasta. Cold Meatballs. A very poor meal for a good deal of money and they do not reply to complaints. I think a restaurant that at least replies to a complaint should be given another chance this one does not and beware a superstar chef who cares so little about a customer to serve you canned tomatoes on a Caprese!
BTW the waiter told us the tomatoes were canned when we asked about their strange taste, so we didn't make it up!
