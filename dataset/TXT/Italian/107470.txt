fxZOOJtT6Zau7Asmppigkg A hidden gem!!!  Had no idea this place existed until I placed an order online with GrubHub.  What a great find!

They were quick, the pizza was cooked to perfection (I'm a basic cheese pizza gal so this was by no means a crazy specialty pizza), and my hubby's chicken parm hoagie was both ginormous and scrumptious (he said it has been a while since he had had one that good).  Great combo specials on the pizza/hoagie too!  I highly recommend giving this place a shot!
