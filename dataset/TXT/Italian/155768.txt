L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw Came here today for lunch (Tuesday) they were not busy at all, and I love Jamie Oliver so I was very excited! The service (the waiters) were great, however for one appetizer and two entrees it took THREE HOURS. The crab bruschetta sounded delicious, yet we were so disappointed to find that it was 99% anything other than crab. Entrees were average - I got the honeycomb cannelloni, my friend had the superfoods salad, both very average yet presentation was great.

Maybe I'll go back if they speed up meal time! But for now I'll stick to the moxies in Yorkdale!
