xYy54Y2VTBAG5k7WJcaH4A (4.1) - An initmate little French (and some Italian) locale tucked away next to a Starbuck's off Providence road in Charlotte, quite authentic with a French owner. The wine list was well curated..we found a nice Loire Valley Cabernet Franc (unbeatable at that price point), and also finished off the meal with a lovely Sauternes. The black grouper (caught fresh from the Atlantic) was the star of the show. The duck confit was good, but the leg was a little on the small side and the brussel sprouts paired with it were not really a match made "au Paradis" - that was the only blemish. The apple tart dessert was delivered warm and delectably delightful.
