9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw I went here for my 31st birthday through a recommendation from a friend.  I was happy I did, they accomodated my request of a party of 8, that went down to a party of 6 then 5.  We dined al fresco and it was a fabulous nite for it.  We shared 3 appetizers: pear salad, bruschetta and the caprese salad, we also went with a margharita, salsiccio, and did a half rustica and half di notte.  We all got to try a little bit of everything and was throroughly please with the quality of the ingredients and the deliciousness.  I really wanted to have the crepes but my friend surprized me with cupcakes that were were fabulous but I digress. This place is perfect for a variety of things, a date, a group of friends or a family dinner.  I definitely will be back to check out the crepes.
