4LXZzgsrM1ZyS_-uB9Od2Q Walking into this space the vibes were great! A little casual, trendy and throw in some hipster aura. Out back in the minimalistic patios, it's quite nice even under the blistering afternoon sun. This was going to be a good one I felt. The menu just looks fantastic with interesting items and of course their own signature Lil' Baci dishes.

How can anyone resist gourmet meatballs? Especially one with their own name on it. With alluring flavours like truffles and turducken how can anyone possibly resist?

Two words would describe these balls; unfulfilled potential. Turducken in a ball sure sounds a lot tastier than it did. While the ball was tender it seriously lacked in the flavour and texture department. I wish they had used some herbs to elevate the flavours. The mish-mash of duck, chicken and turkey was difficult to decipher; what am I eating really? It all tasted like chicken in the end. Somehow, meatballs were void of any substantial meat flavours or that meaty texture. The cream sauce that it's bathed in is well...creamy. Void of much salt, herbs or any flavours for that matter. But perhaps the greatest disappointment of all came down to the duck fat potatoes. I could live or die by those words. The very thought of this stuff gets my pulse racing a bit and sweat coming out of my pores. Not these potatoes. Dried and void of any flavours is really the theme here. Last but not least, it was like salt on the wound to have my egg fully cooked; yes, a pan fried egg with a yolk solid as a snooker ball. I was confused and in a bit of disbelief but long behold my partner has her eggs the same way. Perhaps, I am just bringing drama but I haven't met anyone who would ask for their egg yolks well done in my life recently.

It saddens me a little that such a fantastic space with a cute name, great menu items and fantastic service would serve up mediocrity so well.
