So132GP_uy3XbGs0KNyzyw We went here last night and ordered the lasagna and vodka penne pasta also the cannoli and got a free shirt! The wine is half off on Mondays on full bottles and we ordered our favorite type of Italian wine sangovase. Tony was our server and he was one of the best servers I've ever had. We loved the experience so much I can't get over it!... We will be back ASAP!!!!!!!! Total the night was 100$ which was great for a bottle of wine, dessert and 2 entries
