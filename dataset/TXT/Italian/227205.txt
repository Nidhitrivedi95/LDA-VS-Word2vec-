SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ This restaurant is located by the Trevi fountain in the forum shops. of course not the real Trevi fountain dont be silly! Ive eaten here twice. First time, got the spaghetti and meatballs and 2nd time got the spaghetti and meat sauce and it was good both times. Our waiters were very attentive and their drinks are good!
