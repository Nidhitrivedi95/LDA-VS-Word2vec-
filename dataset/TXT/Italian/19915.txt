2Zeh89IUg7T4dUFjRfqtdg We ordered dinner from Guido's tonight and we were delighted with the food. We have been there several times before but I never wrote a review until now. As in the past the food was delicious. We had pesto ravioli- cheese pasta cooked perfectly and served in a creamy pesto sauce that is delicious. Made even better by the garlic toast that came with dinner to sop up every yummy drop! 
The eggplant Parmesan with spaghetti was covered in a very good red sauce. I'd have liked a little more mozzarella on top but very, very good. 
Both meals came with a nice crisp salad with a terrific house made Italian dressing. So good!
Tonight we did take out. There is frequently a wait for a table and the reason is obvious- terrific food!
