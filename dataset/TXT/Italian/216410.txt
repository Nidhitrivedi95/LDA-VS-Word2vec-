RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ As compared to Aiello's Pizza down the street, at least Mineo's looks like a pizza shop! The decor was typical of the kind of pizza places I grew up with, so that was definitely a plus.

The pizza itself was decent. Nothing special, but not bad either. If pressed, I would go again, but this certainly wouldn't be a pizza joint I jump for the chance to visit.
