crFb3X-Kz0gLnoiSqg_dvg The food at Campola's is pretty good. They have a philly cheesesteak that is fantastic, but is not on the menu, so you need to ask for it. The pizza bones are good too, definitely a good appetizer. 

However, I was not happy with the service. They recently changed their website and their menu. When I called for takeout, they asked me if I wanted fries or chips with my sandwich. I assumed that the fries or chips were included, but when I arrived, they were an additional $2. It's not the $2 that is the issue. I didn't want them in the first place, so don't ask me which one I want, as if they are included. Poor form. Then, when I got there, it was a $12 minimum for credit card. Not many people carry cash anymore, which makes this an issue. However, the guy who gave me the bill understood and let me use the card. Campola's is one of the better food establishments in Mentor, but that is not saying much.
