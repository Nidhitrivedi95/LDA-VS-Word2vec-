Mq1_dvcg5mbeplEmCEoUtQ We couldn't have had a more pleasant dining experience!!  My kid sister, visiting from MI, & I, visiting from AZ, were greeted at the door like family!  When our server heard we were from his home state, it was like meeting an old friend.  Our house salads & minestrone soup came with a loaf of fresh-from-the-oven, homemade whole wheat bread.  We enjoyed the PENNE a la SICILIANA and SPAGHETTI (I substituted Fettucini) a la CARBONARA--couldn't have been better.  And then we shared a bowl (yes, martini-glass style bowl) of Tiramasu that was scrumptious!  Each course was served from a quaint wooden cart--nice touch.  

The only thing potentially off-putting were the warnings posted here & there--turn off your cell phone (they seem to be allowed at lunchtime to accommodate working lunches); "If you decide to alter our menu, it becomes your responsibility.
Either you like it or not, you will be CHARGED FOR IT!!!!!!!," etc.  And the overall '80s decor could use updating when the economy improves.  But save the murals!!

In summary; the FOOD was top-notch, the SERVICE was impeccable, the ATMOSPHERE was divine!  I will make sure to visit every time I go to Las Vegas and tell my friends for their next visits!!
