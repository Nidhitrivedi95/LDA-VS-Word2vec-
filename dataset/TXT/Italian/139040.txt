jEqsHSLzQraqG1qaMNjsBA I had the pleasure of eating here last month. Beautiful atmosphere. Like eating in an Italian living room. The whole place is warm colors and hardwood details. The wine list was reasonable. I had a bottle of Chianti for under $40. The food was the centerpiece. It is broken up under different pricing categories. I had the grilled calamari and it was perfectly cooked. The husband is the chef from Italy and his wife a gracious hostess. This place is a welcomed addition to Beach eateries.
