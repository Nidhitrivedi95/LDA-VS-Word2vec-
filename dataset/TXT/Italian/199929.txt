PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA The hubs and I stopped in with friends this past weekend without knowing anything about this place. Holy moly, we love this place.

The service is awesome, starting from the hostesses to the waitstaff to the support staff. Our reservation was actually ready ON TIME and we were seated at a round table in the middle of the restaurant. Great ambiance - and it was just loud enough to be bustling, but not so loud that we couldn't hear each other.

Our server started by telling us that the portions are smaller and you order a few plates to share. Sounded fun to us!

We started the night off with a bottle of Malbec from Argentina (I don't remember the name) and it hit the spot. We took our server's suggestion and went with the focaccia di recco. It came to our table warm and oh my gosh, it was delicious. The honeycomb was such an interesting touch and added the right amount of sweetness to the focaccia & cheese. 

We then ordered the house special ragu, which that night was a bolognese served over polenta. Again, delicious. 

Our table then went a bit nuts and ordered a TON. Of. Stuff.

Here is the list, that I can remember:
- Orecchiette (SO good, with a spicy kick)
- Pork Belly
- Prosciutto Pizza
- Soppressata PIzza
- Grilled Asparagus Salad
- Gnocchi
- Davanti Sundae for dessert (of course)
- Peanut Butter mousse

We left incredibly full, and so happy. The menu is different the food is delicious, and I can't imagine ordering something that didn't taste delicious. I can't wait to go back!
