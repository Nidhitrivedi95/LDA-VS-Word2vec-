The three-storey restaurant is not wheelchair accessible, the stairs are steep, and the seating is small. Nonetheless, it's got cute decorations with a rustic feel. Each floor seems to have a theme and caters to a slightly different kind of audience. The first floor - quick and casual patrons that can't be bothered to go up a floor; second - more relaxed patrons looking for a drink to accompany their meal; third - quiet and classic space, good for a chat with one or two friends. As we went up the floors to find a good table, we were greeted by the waitress on each floor. On the third we were told there's also a patio area! The roofed patio is almost like the inside of a cottage/garden house - it's a little bit chillier (heat lamps in place if needed)?but there's ample natural sunlight.

Walking in you notice signage indicating 7 West is open 24/7, which got me hopeful for a reliable and diverse menu that could make it a convenient stop if I'm in the area at any time. I wasn't disappointed by their lunch options, so I'm looking forward to returning at a different time of day to compare. 

The menu is simple with a fairly wide selection - pastas, pizzas, sandwiches, salads, coffees, wines, and desserts. A traditional casual Italian cuisine that looked fairly authentic. Prices were reasonable for the portion,  being in Yorkville I would even say it's a good deal.

Lunchtime has lunch-size pastas with a starter house salad - the portion was perfect for one meal. The salad was regular - nothing special and a decent portion. The pesto pollo penne was flavourful and the pesto was tasty. The chicken wasn't too dry thanks to the olive oil from the pesto. It was a good ratio of pasta and sauce so I was satisfied.
