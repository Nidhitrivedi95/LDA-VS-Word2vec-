Ov68TVizW1d2Hqm2M2FKVg Another Vegas place I need to knock stars off for.. sad. We had another one of those $50 giftcards to burn, so decided to give them another shot. Fiance ordered wild board stew pasta.. it was just OK.. pasta was too al dente and didn't have a very good flavor to it.. sauce was just alright. I ordered the Gnocchi.. gross! I adore gnocchi and order it frequently, but this was the worst gnocchi I've ever had. I kid you not, chef boyardee crap tasted better than this gnocchi did. Seriously disappointed! Drinks are still pretty good and no complaints on service... I'll stick to drinks in the bar next time and mb try the pizza.
