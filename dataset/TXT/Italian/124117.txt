HNQzWfhR8kIgTsoxLKCcSw Before I tell you how much I loved this place, let me say: THEY CANNOT HAVE ANYONE UNDER 18 IN THE RESTAURANT/BAR. We brought our 13 year old with us and had to sit outside (cool July evening so it was fine). Just know you have been advised.

The food was so delicious (order several items and share, the servings are perfect size) and the service fast and friendly. Price was great and we could not have been happier!

One last thing, order the homemade lavender lemonade, seriously delicious!
