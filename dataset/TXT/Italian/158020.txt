lDVrw4kaua2W4GeP4Cy-EQ I took my wife and son there for the first and last time. Aside from our server being nice and on top of her game, the food was not what I expected. We started off with the calamari which came to our table with a strong fishy smell. The calamari was saugy and full of old oil from the deep fryer. There were little black burnt pieces of breading and oil on the bottom of our plate. Maybe try changing the oil occassionally. My son ordered a pizza which he enjoyed but I didnt care for either. My wife ordered the stuffed lobster ravioli but they did not have any available so she ordered the stuffed spinich and ricotta ravioli which was ok, nothing special. I had the saltimboca (veal) and it was overcooked and too salty however the pasta was good. Overall experience was negative and we will not be going back.
