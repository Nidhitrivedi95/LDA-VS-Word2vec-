Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A I've been to Caffe Boa on two separate occasions at this point.  I ended up spending a good portion of my Saturday evening here.  We arrived and informed the hostess that we had four in our party.  I could tell she was irritated that we just assumed that we could walk in- she asked if we had a reservation.  We didn't (more expensive spot in a college town?  I didn't think it'd be that busy) so they offered us a seat outside.  We ended up waiting for a half hour for a table inside, which would have been fine had we gotten the table.  It still wasn't ready at that time, so we ended up grabbing some seats at a table in the bar.  

Our server was a cool, knowledgeable chick who has worked in the service industry for most of her life.  She used great adjectives to describe the items that we had questions about.  She was great when she was around, but there were definitely a few times that we felt a bit ignored.

My meal was simply amazing.  I ended up having the Fettuccine Alfredo sans the chicken.  It had chunks of cauliflower in it which totally made the traditional meal unique.  I tried really hard to eat all of it, but eventually had to give up.  I'd totally go back for this meal.  I think it is worth the $15 price tag for homemade noodles and all that goodness.  

I also had a couple Pama mojitos which were top notch.  All of my dining companions raved about their meal choices.  Overall, we had a wonderful experience but I would say that I'd put that heavily on the actual food and my company.  I think it'd be perfect dining spot if the staff was just a tad less snooty.
