tuR2vl6WMAL6tzJvt2Tqdw Decent pizza. This was my first pizza in Montreal and it was alright. I loved the taste of the cheese and liked the taste of the crust. As for the sauce, it was nice, but it did seem to taste more like sauce for spaghetti than for pizza. While the crust did have a nice taste, under the cheese and sauce it was very soggy and impossible to pick up. Therefore, a crispier crust would have been nice. Finally, the toppings easily came of the crust. But the overall taste was fine. Again, it was a decent pizza but pricey for what you get. Also, they are cash only. Seriously, this is not the 1800s!
