L_thK7r3K_h5M4tV7amEKQ I came here for breakfast with my boyfriend because ... well, we were craving breakfast food!

I got the bacon and cheese omelette for $5.99. It came with home fries, rye toast and a few slices of oranges. Overall, the meal was okay, nothing I will come running back for. I was quite disappointed that the omelette was made with processed cheese instead of cheddar cheese. However, I can't really complain because of the low prices. My boyfriend got the working B breakfast ($9.99) and he got the turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. This was my first time trying turkey bacon and I'm not sure that I can go back to regular bacon... Lastly, we had the assorted dim sum. It was good, but I would suggest going to a regular dim sum place just because it'll probably be cheaper.

We also came here for dinner one night because I was curious to try their pasta menu.

I got the black seafood squid ink spaghetti ($16.99) and I added $3 to make it a combo which came with a soup or salad and dessert. The sauce on the spaghetti was very creamy. They were also quite generous with the amount of seafood. I opted for the soup which was carrot that night and it was quite a generous portion. I was almost full just from drinking the soup. With such generous portion of the first two dishes, I was surprised that the dessert was just a square slice of cake.

Overall, I think this is a A-ok cheap eat type of restaurant but I won't be rushing back for anything in particular.
