Wq0cWwBkapXOUP5QPV034Q I had a lunch meeting at Bambino Bistro today and was pleasantly surprised by the crowd dining both in and outdoors when I arrived.  Though it was not well marked, I did figure out the location based on the address...

We waited what seemed like a really long time to get water and to order... this place is a two man operation.  It was just Chef/Owner/Manager Leonard and one other employee when we were there.

The service was far from attentive but the food was enjoyable once it arrived.  I had the Greek salad.  The others at my table  enjoyed their sandwiches once they figured out which was which.  (They mixed up the two of them and served them backwards).  The fresh bread was a treat and the hummus was an odd texture, but it was tasty.  

Would I rush back to Bambino?  Probably not.  And I definitely would not go if I were in a rush.  But if I felt like a Greek salad, a panini sandwich, or fresh bread and was not in any kind of a hurry, I would give it another shot.
