bLlcotXx91dw-U8R3HPrZw I decided to try Jack's because it is a little bit closer than my usual place. I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and dessert (tiramisu). The order was ready really quick and the old Italian man that owns the pizza shop is very nice. However if you are looking for great NY style pizza etc this is not that. The pizza tasted like a subpar heat and serve grocery store pizza and the tiramisu was not anything special, it was a small slice and was still frozen. For great NY pizza go to Brooklyn Pizza parlor down the road in Wesley Chapel. I won't be coming back to Jack's.
