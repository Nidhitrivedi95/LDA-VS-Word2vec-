F56TiSa71Tk4PIQ0HN8oag I get nostalgic for Pizzazz. Hostessing there was my very first restaurant job back when I was 16 was at the Solon location (no longer open) and I used to love sampling everything on the menu. 

This location of the mini-chain is a nice mix of families and college kids, giving it an eclectic cozy feeling. 

I love that they have a variety of sauces for your pizza, and I've never had a bad one. By far, my fave is the diablo (red sauce with roasted hot peppers...spicy, but not too spicy to enjoy). The raspberry vinaigrette they put on the mesculn salad is pretty noteworthy, as well.
