========================
You'll pay a prett y penny for good quality Italian food and wine. If you're from a metropolitan area that has great Italian restaurants, B&B Ristorante will not stand out nor will be worth the money. It's noisy and the rock music will flow from the bar right in to the dining room, so be prepared for upscale Italian with loud bar music. Service is very good.
