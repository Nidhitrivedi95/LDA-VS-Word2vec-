7YpipG1N4nsvQZ_WGiV9PA Driving through an area of town, where we normally aren't, looking for food, without a preference, my wife and I both spotted a sign for PameZan Subs at the same time. Hooking a quick U-turn, we pulled into the parking lot and almost didn't go in. 

The front doors were both propped open, an extension cord was through the entrance, to where staff members were hanging a sign/banner on the side of the building. Not sure if they were actually open, or almost ready for business, we walked in, and were prepared to have to leave.

A nice lady walked in, and had someone who was still on the clock come up and take our orders. The cashier/order taker was a very nice lady, with an interesting accent. They turned on the TV when we sat down, and I asked if they could put it on a specific channel. Not knowing if they had the channel or not, she handed me the remote, and said I could pick something to watch. 

Before our food arrived, the cashier said/did something that drew the ire of who we are pretty sure is the Owner, Christopher. Christopher decided that on the line (which butts up against the dining area, with an open-air kitchen) was the perfect place to berate, and belittle this employee. A moment later, another employee came in, and asked the cashier a question. Christopher again was loud enough for us to hear, as he told the inquisitive employee, "Don't ask her that, don't ask her anything, ever. She doesn't know anything. Ask me if you have a question." Or something pretty dang close to that.

My wife's food came out first, a few minutes later mine was delivered, Christopher made light that he forgot to make my food when he started making my wife's lunch. 

Neither of our meals were above average, they were disappointing even. 

Maybe it was a case of the "just openeds" - or their recipes are just bland and unappealing to us. 

Not sure if we will give them a try if they make it, until we are in that area, and hungry again.
