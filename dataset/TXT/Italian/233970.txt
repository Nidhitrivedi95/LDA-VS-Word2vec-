tpesKzKbcPFekdThYZ4UpA I'm not a particularly picky person when it comes to food but I love seafood. I was looking fo something walking distance for a Winterlicious date with my boyfriend and when I saw they had a seafood option, we decided to come here. We made 8pm reservations and were worried it would be busy but it was mostly empty when we arrived around 7:45pm. We were seated by a waiter but most of our service came from the manager. The first course arrived quickly, but I received the wrong main dish - rigatoni instead of risotto. I wasn't fussed about waiting, but we were offered complimentary glasses of prosecco for the confusion and the correct dish arrived quickly. 

Menu-wise I got the minestrone soup, seafood risotto, and chocolate cake while he got the insalata, steak, and cheesecake. My only complaints were that I found the soup a bit bland and the slices of cake were really small. The seafood risotto had lots of seafood, the steak and its sauce were very flavourful as was the salad, and honestly it was better that the slices of cake were small after the amount of food in the two previous courses.

Overall, I thought it was a very good deal and was really pleased with the service and how very sweet our server was in taking a photo of us when we asked. We didn't feel rushed to leave even as the last guests (though it wasn't yet 10pm). I'm not crazy about the regular menu so I'm not sure if I'll be back but it was definitely impeccable service on Superbowl Sunday 2017!
