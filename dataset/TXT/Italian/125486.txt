Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A Liked their wine list.  Pasta made in house (although I didn't actually try it) - I'm a sucker for any opportunity to have Cioppino since I'm too lazy to make it myself - which was super tasty, although a bit over salted.

Thought it was a bit overpriced - especially for Phoenix.  Come one - if you have low overhead, pass that along - if I was still living in SF, go ahead charge me these prices, but I'm eating in Phoenix - I want Phoenix prices.

$12 wine
$27 entree
$15 solumi
