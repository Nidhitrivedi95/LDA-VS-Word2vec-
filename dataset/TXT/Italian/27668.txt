4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ This was our first time to this quaint, small intimate Italian restaurant. I have recently moved to  area and I have driven by a number of times and finally thought that we would come by and try it out for dinner. Am I ever glad that we did!!!

From the welcome we received at the door until the heartfelt goodbye when we left, the entire experience was absolutely excellent. 

Our waiter, Clemente (sp?)was authentic and engaging. He made a wonderful dining experience even better. He really went over and above. 

What can I say about the food - absolutely the best Italian I have had in Vegas. The sauces were superb. The tiramisu was sublime. 

If I could offer one bit of constructive criticism (and I'm only doing this out of respect for their obvious expertise in the area) I think they could perhaps look at the "wine situation" as an area of possible improvement. Instead of only selling wine by the glass or bottle I would highly recommend that they adopt the method utilized by Batista's hole in the wall- that being that they offer a decent of house wine and utilize the small traditional " tumbler" style  wine glasses found in authentic Italian restaurants. Having the option to get a decanter of house wine would be a major addition to an already wonderful and authentic Italian experience.  

I am not one to give high Yelp reviews. In fact, I have been accused of being very harsh . But, I have to give a A-  to A rating ( only the wine situation preventing it from being a solid A!)

This is now our "go to Italian restaurant "in Vegas.
