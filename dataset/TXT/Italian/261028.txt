WPV0ucYjnb2HOrNxSopv6A Worst calzone ever (and calzones are my favorite thing to order at pizza places, so I've had a lot before)! Crust is sloppily folded over the ingredients inside and there was barely any ricotta to be found in the ingredients. You typically find calzones pinched together at the edges so as to create a baked "pocket" of ingredients, but this one was not.
Do NOT, absolutely do not, order one with spinach in it because, unlike normal pizza locations, they use frozen spinach instead of fresh spinach leaves. It made my entire calzone taste absolutely terrible. 

Super disappointed in this experience!
