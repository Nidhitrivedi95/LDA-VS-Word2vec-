nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg My friend and I wanted dinner, I was game for whatever, he wanted a nice restaurant. He mentioned this place and got us reservations. We were seated quickly, really no need for reservations when we went anyway. 

We ordered the bruschetta for appetizer. It was pretty awesome, I wish more for of that at least. I ordered the grilled salmon with vegetables. I was surprised at the portion of the salmon was pretty decent. It was well seasoned and flaked perfectly. The vegetables were quite seasoned i must say, I focused on my salmon more so. Overall I enjoyed my entrée.
As for my friend, he ordered the Penne alla Norma. First bite, he stops mid-bite and  says "OMG, this is good!" I had to laugh. I agreed, it was pretty tasty. 
Dessert was tiramasu, which was pretty nice as well. Although I wished the marscapone cheese was distributed throughout rather than be the first thing one digs into. I was had to shovel out the yummy lady fingers.

we debated at the end of dinner. I said it was pretty good, but not awesome. Not that I would go running back for more. I would definitely try again, but you won't see me running. The other menu items still look delectably pleasing.
