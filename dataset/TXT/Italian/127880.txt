hX3qKoTnpzxTGiPuO2YVTQ This restaurant had probably the worst service we have ever experienced and it was all the waitress because normally the kitchen has some blame but not this time. The only thing the waitress got right was the drink order. I ordered a panini and got the wrong one my husband ordered mac and cheese and it never did show up. She comes by and says oh sorry it'll be awhile. Omg it's mac and cheese and after waiting as long as we did it should have been put at the front of the line. She spent the whole time we were there running around like a chicken with its head cut off and actually she was a chicken with its head cut off. VERY disappointed
