hRkZHnKHVuIZWmF258sbCw It's a beautiful restaurant with some amazing staff. The food is prepared fresh and they make most of their pasta from what I can remember. 

But it's just ok. The risotto fungi was ok. A little bland. The ravioli were ok. Too al dente.  Spaghetti with meat sauce was ok. Nothing memorable. 

Go to Andiamo three doors down, much better and more flavour.
