DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw This is a great italian restaurant that is off the strip, but not too far from everything. I've been here a couple times and the food has always been excellent. I had the caesar salad and fettuccine pollo, both were excellent. The service is very good and usually very friendly and attentive. We never have had a reservation, but they are always able to seat us pretty quickly. I'll be adding this restaurant to my list of places to eat when in vegas.
