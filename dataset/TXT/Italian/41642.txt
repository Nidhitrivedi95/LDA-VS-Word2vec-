7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Make time for lineup ! I tried lining up 3x, third time was a charm to finally get in.  During weekend hours, I had waited over and hour to get in!  Make sure you are prepare to wait for your brunch!

As other yelper recommended , ordered the avocado egg Benedict's. They do make a mean Benny.  It comes runny, perfect to dip toasted bread or the side potatoes.  The home fries portions are huge, but crisp to perfection.  Our whole table got a various variation of egg benedicts, and all meals were wonderful. Definitely will reorder everything!

Star deduction due to the wait.  Everyone has to arrive to be seated.  If you are pre-waiting for someone, make sure all your parties arrive by the time you reach the door!
