mDiFWhywAziq9SKnj6am_Q Finally, after years of ignoring Il Posto and not being happy with the food, menu or staff, this place is back to its original finesse, quality and delicious food as in our Gang.  We met Greg, the new owner, and we could tell he is committed to bringing this place back to way it used to be, but with even better pizza.  I had to go back to my old standby...Cavatappi Matriciana , corkscrew pasta, spicy italian sausage, prosciutto in a light sauce.  Perfect!  My husband ordered the special, shrimp scampi on linguini with mussels.  He loved it!  Our waiter, D.  was helpful and attentive.  My birthday dessert (on the house) was a Caribbean rum soaked bread pudding.  And another nice little touch was Pauline, the adorable singer/acoustic guitar player that added to the ambience.  Nice touch, Greg.  We will definitely be back.
