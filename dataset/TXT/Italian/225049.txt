SN6mvy2vbXL0F_CYFkx8zg Went there on recommendation of a friend who lives in Vegas and WOW! I was so happy that I went. It is one of the most intimately beautiful places in Vegas and the food and service is superb. They are open 7 DAYS A WEEK for lunch and dinner (but no lunch on Sat and Sun). I will be a steady customer from now on.
