Ava9H-t4scVmP7u_onh7pg I came to Napa on Providence for restaurant week with four hungry men ready to eat their way through wine country. I assumed this restaurant was California-inspired fare based off their name and some word-of-mouth reviews, but not quite sure it fell into that category...

Anyway, I opted to order off the regular menu. I had the Heaven in a Bowl salad which was delicious (although my waiter led me to believe otherwise...odd). A very good size portion of frisee tossed in a bacon vinaigrette, topped with grilled onions and a poached egg. It was delicious. I also had the pork pizza which was fine but nothing special. 

The boys had the short rib (which they loved, I thought it was fine) and sides of mac and cheese. As other Yelpers have pointed out, this mac and cheese is divine. Big, curly noodles, creamy Velveeta-like sauce, topped with crispy breadcrumbs? Yes.

I'll come back, but probably just for wine and snacks. The atmosphere is cool and the portions are generous. Thanks!
