lgWB0yGXpZvupYREWxtV7g I really enjoy their lunch and dinner. A little known secret is that they serve pizza after 4pm. The pizza is the reason that we first tried this place. Now that they have opened the option to sit inside, it is a great place to take out or eat in. I am a huge fan of their Marinara Pizza while my boyfriend swears by the Margherita. It's the same price you will pay at Pizzeria Bianco and basically the same quality, minus the Pizzeria Bianco atmosphere and wait. For lunch I have the Housemade Mozzarella, Local Tomato & Basil sandwich or salad. The Mozzarella is fresh and delicious and I do not normally eat cheese. One more thing, I love that I can buy a pizza here and go next door to Lux, order a lemonade and read a book while enjoying my pizza. Great place! The only caveat is that the wait at lunch time can be up to 20-25 mins during peak hours (downtown Phoenix lunch crowd).
