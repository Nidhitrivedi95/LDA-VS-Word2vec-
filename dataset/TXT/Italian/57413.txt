1) off the beaten path
2) old school Vegas

Very cool!  Reminiscent of the old Venetian restaurant that used to be off Sahara, just West of the 15.  I just dropped in for a few classic cocktails and was swept back in time to what my imaginary view of Vegas in the 70s would have been.  Great old-timer bartender who likes to chat.  An eclectic mix of people from various walks of life and history all enjoying the somewhat dim, yet lively atmosphere.  I feel like I should have been in a disheveled tux with an untied bowtie and long lost cuff links, sipping straight bourbon while smoking a Camel.

Extra points awarded for the primate art adorning the various nooks & crannies!

Definitely on my "cool spots to hang out" list....which does not yet exist on Yelp.
