YJS7cXGLAvWw9DUDXpw84Q Excellent Food, Excellent Service and Excellent price. This place hit the ball out of the Park. Open kitchen concept with just a little urban contemporary feel to it. I didn't visit the bar but it appeared to be hopping also. Great open lay out with views of the entire place.

As for the food we had the Mushroom Appetizere, Awesome!  My wife had the cabbage and bacon dish, Delish! I had the Chipotle Alfredo and true to form, perfect! Add a couple of glasses of wine which were only $5.00 a piece and you have a Excellent meal for under $45.00. Unheard of in this day and age....thank you Babbo we will be back.
