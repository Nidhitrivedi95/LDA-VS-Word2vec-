8v66rFpXa87u2jRGOn8ZfA Ordered the Spicy Pub Cheese Burger with the jalapeños and not only was it overcooked (asked for "pink" I.e. medium) it was the biggest slop house of a burger I've ever eaten.  Couldn't even pick it up to eat.  A train wreck of a burger if I've ever eaten one.  Do yourselves a favor, folks.  AVOID CHAINS LIKE FRIDAY'S LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!  I've had better sandwiches at McDonald's.  At least they bothered to comp me a dessert and gave me a free app for next time.  Too bad I won't be returning.
