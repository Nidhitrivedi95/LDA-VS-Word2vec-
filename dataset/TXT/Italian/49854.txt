9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Cibo is a cozy little gourmet pizzeria hidden away in an old neighborhood. The pizza is excellent. I would encourage you to try anything on the menu, even if it doesn't sound appealing.  They really know what their doing and if they've put pear on a pizza, you better believe it was for a good reason. The ambiance is great, especially outside when weather permits. they have a respectable wine selection and this is a great place to take a date.
