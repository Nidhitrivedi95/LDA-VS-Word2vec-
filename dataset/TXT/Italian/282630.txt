Z072pEHdos2Gjj3nMdR6uA Just had a wonderful meal at Luce.  They were very accommodating for a party of one... and I had a great view of all the action in the restaurant.

The bread with cannelini beans was stupendous.... though I could have gone for a bread refueling at some point.  

The Cozze (Mussels) were tasty, if only a little salty. My standards for mussels however are REALLY high... think Seattle's Herbfarm high. 

The Osso Buco however... was TO DIE FOR. It literally fell off the bone and melted on the tongue. Best I have ever had. The accompanying risotto was also outstanding.

A side of roasted potatoes was good, if not inedibly hot for most of the meal.

A wonderful finish with the bread pudding.

Service was personal and efficient.
