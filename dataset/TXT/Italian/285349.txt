zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g I wish I could give it no stars! 

This place was horrible!!!

Me and my BF sat at our table for AWHILE before a waitress (who was VERY grumpy!) acknowledged us and got us some sodas (which tasted flat). besides us, there was only one other table of four...

When they finally took our order, we got the antipasto, a small pizza, and the clam linguine.

It took forever for the antipasto to come out and our food came rate after it (I thought the point of an appetizer was to have it before your meal not with it....). my bf's pizza had a weird aftertaste and was really greasy. My linguine had no flavor, and overcooked clams that were rubbery PLUS I asked for the white sauce and got the red...

To add to all of this, we were seated by where they make the food and had to listen to a couple of employees gossip about some shit and the hostess just had a mean look on her face the whole time. Does nobody want to work here? or did we just come at a bad time? well we wont be back, that's for sure! Such a sad disappointment cause my bf has been wanting to eat here for awhile.

So for horrible service, an hour of our time, 2 sodas, antipasto, a small pizza and clam linguine we paid $60!! NOT WORTH IT!

Yes. We were there for an hour if not longer...

I can go to a wolf gang puck restaurant in crystals for the same price!

We went 9/21 between 2:30p-4:00p

So if you're going to go, avoid that time!
