z8H4Mdzl4jS9pYswj6Jf9w I came here on a Friday night with my husband. The location was a bit difficult to find because the entrance was on Yorkville, not Scollard. 

We got a pasta and a pizza and they were both equally delicious. I would've given this restaurant 4stars but I wasn't too happy with our server tonight. 

Our server barely checked up on us. When he finally came with our bill, I asked him who would get our jacket and he said he would after he finishes with our  bill. He never came back. I had to ask somebody else to get our jacket.
