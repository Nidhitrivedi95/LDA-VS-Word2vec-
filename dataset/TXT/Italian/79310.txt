D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg Good atmosphere, decent service. Food is mediocre and way over priced. I've had far better meals and paid half the price. The overpriced beer selection was pathetic (2 or 3 options) and the overpriced wine was average. We sent back the salads the waiter raved about as they were terrible (bitter). We had a table of 6 and only 2 of us were happy with their meals. Overall, very disappointing. BTW, we did not have any coupons or deals. Unfortunately, we paid full price.
