1VDP92FU2p8AqJw9vU11sw Unfortunately I am done with this place.  Went last Sunday to meet a friend. When I got there they called me and said they were going to be an hour late.  I mentioned this to the hostess.  Apparently at Lakeside this equals no service until your dining partner shows up.  Host brought one beer.  Complained about service after sitting there for 30 min. Asked for check said server would pick up. They didn't.  They charged me for the $2.50 beer which I thought was tacky.  Left called friend and met somewhere else.  There were 20 people in the place max so there really was no excuse.
