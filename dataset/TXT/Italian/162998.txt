lvv9Vv_5i4IwvDdofO_rKg I came here for lunch today. I wasn't impressed. I ordered margherita pizza for my little one and they refused to add chicken. I guess they work on a line and there is no room for real cooking or options in the kitchen. After that exchange with the server I opted out of ordering more items from the menu and they missed out on orders for a cocktail, appetizer, and dessert. Prosciutto pizza was decent. All the pizzas are soggy and you can't hold it up to eat because of the thin crust. I had the pork scallopini and the chop came out pink and raw on the inside. I told the server picking up my plate and he said he would mention it to my table server. They did nothing and the bill came. Pork was also super salty tasted and bitter. I had this dish here before and this very same location and I know they can do better. Pizzas were bad today. Very disappointed at the food and service. Not returning to this location.
