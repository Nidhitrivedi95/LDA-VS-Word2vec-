F4zvnOsgjEV9aVbKqBYRng If you have great qualities to sing, this can be one of your favorite places with great karaoke for those with a great voice, but also for those who sing badly. The sounds of this Karaoke have a good quality. The drinks are good and cheap in this place. The server that night was very nice, fast and very efficient.

I did not have a chance to eat here, but I am looking forward to take a bite of the menu when I come next time to AZ.
