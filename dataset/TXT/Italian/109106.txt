G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Happy! Two of us had three cocktails,quite average, should go straight to the wine. The octopus and beet salads are great, eggplant salad is a okay, so is the artichoke arancini. The risotto with crab and scallops is good. Service is 5 stars, and the restaurant is quite new looking, good window view. Do not know about the desserts because we were too full to order, but the coffee is pretty good. Ah, the drinks and food came very quickly, so if you are in a hurry, you will get going pretty fast. We had dinner the night before at another Italian restaurant in Caesars, this restaurant is much better, and has better service. So if you like her show, this is the only restaurant she openned. Yes, go for it!
