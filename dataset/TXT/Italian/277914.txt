YJS7cXGLAvWw9DUDXpw84Q We have eaten at Babbo a few times now and it has been going downhill. The first time we ate here was a few months ago when my father-in-law was visiting. We went in with 4 adults and 3 children. The food was amazing and service was pretty good. I would've given it 5 stars. We went back last month and service okay and food was mediocre. The restaurant wasn't busy. We thought maybe they were just having off night. We decided to try it out again last night. Made it in at about 6pm, and there were only a few tables seated. The host greeted us and asked how many. After I said 4 and a highchair, he grabbed some menus and walked toward a booth. He set the menus down, went to get a highchair, and as he was walking back up he told us "it's ready for you" then moved on to the next group of people that came in (he walked everyone else to their tables while we were there). We sat down and waited another 5 or 10 minutes before the waitress came by to take our drink order. Not that it was a super long wait but she walked past us a few times, not busy and never said anything. She returned with drinks and took our food order. We didn't see her again until after someone else brought our food and she asked how it tasted. We said we just got it, but it looked good. And it did look good. However, once we started to eat, we noticed the meatballs from the kids meals and my chicken from parmesan chicken were all very overcooked. My chicken was hard to cut through and the marinara was way too oily. We only saw the waitress 2 more times: once when we had to stop her to ask for a refill and then when she brought us boxes and the check. I don't think any one thing would have made for a bad night, but all of them together just wasn't worth it.
