hX3qKoTnpzxTGiPuO2YVTQ I'll never award five stars at an airport, but this place might be close to one anywhere else. It's good sized, with a few high tables, bunch of standard ones and a lot of bar seating. Several large televisions for taking in the sport and just the right volume level. Quite a good selection of beers, though why you'd chose anything other than Moretti at an Italian I don't know. Food is fresh, tasty and comes in decent portions. Service is fast and efficient without being impersonal. Prices are steep, of course, but in comparison with the competition, nothing too eye watering.
