nDKcQkh8vZkY_u1kyww44g I was def expecting more out of this place. The service was amazing though - so attentive and friendly. The food on the other hand was pretty bleh.  I won't go back because all i could think about was eating something, ANYTHING other than what i was eating. My hunny said his sandwich was basic and was pretty underwhelmed.
