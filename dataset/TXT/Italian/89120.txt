The food was divine & the sauce with scallops was from another planet. The restaurant is beautiful with a comfortable amount of space between tables. Absolute perfection! + they actually have roses in a gimlet glass (for the roses +gimlet connoisseurs)...If vacationing in Vegas, this is an absolute must go to place..I can't wait to return to Sinatra's! Out of this world delicious!!! Outstanding , absolute perfection!
