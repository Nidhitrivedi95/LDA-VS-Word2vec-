OBG1j517k7aZRNC1HAL0TA Meant to write this review a long time ago...came here for a lunch meeting in the summer.  Service was excellent and the food was great.  We shared a salumi board to start which was quite nice and I had the chicken salad which was also very good.  The greens were fresh (nothing more annoying than ordering an entree salad and finding bits of brown salad or wilted salad - seems like a basic thing, but you would be surprised at how many restaurants just can't seem to get this right).  My co-workers also got different salads and they all looked really good as well.

I would definitely come back for lunch...
