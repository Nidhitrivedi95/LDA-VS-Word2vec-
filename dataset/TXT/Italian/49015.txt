9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw I don't usually eat Italian, or pizza ... or give Italian or pizza places 5 stars. But this place really took me by surprise. 

WARNING: If you sit outside during mosquito season, prepare to be bitten!! Otherwise, it is probably one of the most ROMANTIC cute outdoor dining spots I've ever seen. Perfect for Phoenix since it's perpetually warm almost all the time during the summer, fall and spring months.

We came here because of the phenomenal reviews, and also because everyone said it was better than Biano. 

I have to say, their daily pasta specials are amazing because the pasta is homemade! I am a sucker for homemade pasta even though I don't like Italian food for the most part ... sooo delicious. The food comes out extremely fast! 

The pizza here is the thin style wood-fired oven kind, which is great, and their overuse of truffle oil is totally ok with me. I loved the truffle mushroom pizza, and we got ricotta on the Diavlo. Recommended!
