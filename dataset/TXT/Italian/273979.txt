Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A We had free breakfast along with our reservation so of course we're going to eat.

For a little place and little price tag, the place isn't so bad. If you sign up for their players' card, you get $2 off or something. Note this...they will ask you to leave if they are ready for their next meal. We stayed there til 11am hoping that we can sample their lunch, but our waitress said that we would have to leave once the lunch group comes it. So, that kinda sucks!

Anyhoo, it was decent food. Just the typical breakfast food. Breakfast food stops serving at 10:30am.
