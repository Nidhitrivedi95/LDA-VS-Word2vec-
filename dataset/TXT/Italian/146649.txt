The server was amazing, and very knowledgeable about the menu. We wanted a salad, with our food, but he said the portions were huge, and asked if we wanted to share one. Not only did he make that perfect suggestion, but he split the wedge for us. Between the perfect buttery bread bites and the wedge, all four of us were in carb heaven. 
I ordered Chicken Focaccia, and it was perfect! The fettuccini that came with it, was light if you can believe that Alfredo sauce can be light. Omg! So good! My husband ordered the shrimp linguini, I think. It looked so picture perfect, but I didn't taste it because I had so much of my own. Our friends ordered the salmon and chicken dish and ate until they couldn't eat anymore! 
We will be back! We may need to wear elastic waistband pants, but it's worth it!
