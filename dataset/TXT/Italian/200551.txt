pvCcrHFAGCml492qoQBsQg For all of you that live in the Woodbridge area, hang out there or even just drive through you should all be well aware of this iconic restaurant Riccis.  For those of you that have not heard of it or have heard of it and haven't gotten around to trying it then you better set your self straight and try Ricci's ASAP.  This is no regular pizzeria where you get your pizza and wings.  Ricci's is a full blown restaurant with the pizzeria vibe.  Don't worry about dressing up to go to Ricci's as its a very casual place.  Quality restaurant food but with the pizzeria casual feel.  The menu choices are incredible and im sure there is something on the menu for you.  Every thing from pizza and wings all the way to fancy pasta dishes and gourmet salad.  The choices are endless.    Over the years I have been to Ricci's probably 100 times lol.  Just realized that I had not reviewed it yet.  I was there a few days ago so I decided to take pics of our food and get on to giving it a review.  I ordered a prosciutto and asiago sandwich.  The sandwich was huge great portion of meat where most places lack the portion of meat in sandwiches.  My wife ordered a ponzo and we also had a rice ball.  5 star plus to my last visit like i expected.  Just a word of advise Ricci's can get very busy at times so be patient its well worth the wait.
