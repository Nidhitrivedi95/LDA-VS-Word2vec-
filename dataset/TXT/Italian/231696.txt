THsU2vYT1sYm9amz9d0e4A We ordered food to go, thinking this was going to be an amazing experience.  I was so wrong.  The parking lot is always busy which lead me to believe this was going to be a gem of Gilbert.  Placing our to-go food was not difficult-everyone was pleasant and nice.  When it came time to pick up our food- we were waiting forever.  I understand that the patrons in restaurant were waiting as long as we were, but I was never offered something to drink while we were waiting.  If you order to-go and it is not ready you are forced to stand in a major traffic area that the staff uses.  I was constantly having to move to allow someone to walk by.

When we finally received our food and were headed home to enjoy the feast that smelled wonderful...I was let down.  Our food had no flavor.  From the salad--no flavor, to the pasta which seemed to taste out of a bottle.  I was not impressed, at all.  I ordered pizza for the kids and they thought it was like peter piper's.  Which I personally think is gross.  I will not return here as the food was nothing memorable.
