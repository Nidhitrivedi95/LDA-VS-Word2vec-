DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw The best food I've had in Las Vegas. One of the specials was a mushroom pasta with wild boar sauce; I was curious to try this, as well as the chicken vesuvio, so the waiter encouraged our party to split a few dishes. Everything was excellent and not one person was left disappointed. 
They make all their pasta fresh everyday, and the service alone is enough to go back for.
