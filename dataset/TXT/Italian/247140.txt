V6MWAv-xv4dgSUrDU1qxaA Nothing But Noodles is pretty good. They have a couple vegetarian/vegan dishes, which is great for me. The only complaint that I have is the noodles are always slightly undercooked (al dente). Or at least they are in the Japanese Stir Fry, which is usually what I get. But the flavors are good, the place is very clean and the prices are really good. I also like the fact that you can order a small or large portion of their dishes.
