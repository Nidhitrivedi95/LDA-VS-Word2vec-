LZSyWy4IHgXg6QhW2jrBlw The last Macaroni Grill that I ate at was back in 2008 with my boyfriend (now husband) and we LOVED it. The atmosphere was great and it was reasonably priced.

We ate here for lunch with my parents right after we got into Vegas because Urbanspoon indicated that they had gluten free options (for my mom and sister). 

And here is where I want to go into a little rant. If you're in the food industry, you should care about food. (I'm not talking about teenagers working as waitresses at a TGIFridays.) I'm talking about managers of restaurants who charge more than $12/plate. 

I don't appreciate watching someone become rude with my mother while she makes sure my sister doesn't get sick by eating YOUR FOOD. 

Management didn't help at all and the waitress couldn't have looked more bored. No one asked us if our food was good (because it wasn't...it was greasy) and I don't plan on going back to any Macaroni Grill in the near future.
