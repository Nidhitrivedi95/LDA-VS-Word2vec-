L9qDnDHSnINNjePwrJz-uQ What a great find. We were in Tempe for a Volleyball Tourney and were looking for a nice dinner. My daughter came across this on Yelp and we tried it out. As soon as we walked in the door we were sold. Nice atmosphere, the smell of fresh baking bread and a table with comfy seats. My chicken parm was perfect, my wife's Margherita Pizza was delish, and the Peronni on tap was cold. I'll be going back next time we are down for Volleyball!
