Don't get me wrong, it's not cheap by any means. But it's one of the less pricey places on King, and they have great Italian food. Inside, it's usually filled with bankers and people who eat this kind of food as often as I eat $5 pho. I'd say it's a dressier place later in the evening -- definitely leave your favourite jeans at home and maybe put on a darker pair but don't go in a prom dress.

The food is deliiiiicious. Pasta, pizza, steak, fish, everything with an Italian flavour but made a little bit modern. Lots of stuff with truffles in it...which usually equals pricey. Pizzas can go as low as $12 or $13, pastas start at around $15 and mains go well over $20. Pizzas are kinda tiny but the pastas are decent portions. I think my mom took half of hers home after the meal, while I scarfed mine down no problem and then had an aching belly for a couple hours.

If you're in the city, you want a fancy meal out, but you don't want to totally break the bank or be on a waiting list for 5 years, Il Fornello is a great option. It's also right across from the Royal Alexandra Theatre, so is a popular choice for food before a show. Make reservations or arrive early to ensure you get fed!
