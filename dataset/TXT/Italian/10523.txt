0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg I mangia'd molto bene at Scarpetta during my most recent trip to the Strip.  The ambiance at this sophistocated Cosmopolitan restaurant is very sexy, and we were fortunate enough to be seated by the huge picture window with views of the Bellagio fountains spraying in the background.  To enjoy your meal at Scarpetta as I did, follow these instructions and thank me later:

1) Start of with a glass of Gosset.  There aren't many wines by the glass to choose from on the menu, but a glass of Gosset (even if it'll set you back $20 for a singular champagne flute of this nectar from the gods) is worth it.

2) Sample the fritto misto and Wagyu beef tartare to start.  Sure, these are old Italiano standbys, but they do it up here, adding cured egg, parmigiano, toasted hazelnuts, and sea salt to the tartare.  SO GOOD.

3) Devour the black farfalle (with Maine lobster) and the spiced duck breast (with endive, preserved orange, and delicious cippollini onion).  I split these dishes with my friend and it was the perfect portion size, not to mention SCRUMPTIOUS.  Jersey was a good choice to wear during this meal.

4) Polish it all off with the Zeppole for dessert, if you're a fan of Nutella.

Grazie mille, Scarpetta, for a wonderful experience!  I will definitely be back to try your famous spaghetti.
