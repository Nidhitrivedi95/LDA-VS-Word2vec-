9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg Came here on a Friday night. We had the naked mozzarella for starters. It has a very fluffy taste and is great if you love Italian cheese. I'm not a huge fan. For the entrée I had the Capri pasta size small. It was a decent portion for dinner. I usually don't manage to finish pasta at restaurants but I was able to here. Seafood is very fresh. I really enjoyed the squid and mussles. The fettucine is so soft.
