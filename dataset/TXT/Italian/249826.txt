vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw My girlfriend and I were excited to finally find a great pizza place with all sorts of drinks and even some beer on tap.  She had lived in Chicago and was sorely missing. Chicago-style.  Of course we ordered pan.  Please know this is a great place!  We do admit to being VERY picky about pizza.  The biggest "OH NO!" for me is when a pizza is cooked in a convection oven.   Almost stopped right there because very-airy crispy cardboardi'ish" crust.  Big sigh. 

Almost tears..  Soupy mess on top that pizza. The amount of heavy-salted cheese used - just HEAVY salt- was extreme. Chewing a bite of pizza was a rough go.  Took me 20-25 minutes to attempt to eat 1 slice.  Finally had to quit.  Couldn't eat any of the remaining salt or the airy-no-flavor crispy crust.  Our mouths were literally dehydrated by the amount of salt.  Water, water, water with no relief.  Same this morning.

Make NO mistake, we will go back for other menu items.   And if your wait- person lets you know the small salad is big enough for 2 ...it's true!.  Big enough for 2 - you best believe it.  Definitely enough for 3. Maybe even 4.  Those we saw were incredible looking.

Wonderful wait staff.  Wonderful.  The menu - there are so many items we will go back & order.  Would take us going there daily for a month to cover items we wanted to try.  

Go.  Amazing place.
