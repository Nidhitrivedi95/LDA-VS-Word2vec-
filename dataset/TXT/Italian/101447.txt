fckUjXz1GKpafT4x7-MVJA We called at 8pm to order a to go meals. The Olive Garden staff that answered the phone was clowning around laughing and joking kept asking me to repeat myself and hung up the phone. We did t want to allow that idiot to ruin our day and went to the restaurant and ordered direct. When the food was done the idiot dropped the bag on the table and said $14.95. We asked him to go through the bag to be sure it all was there. The idiot threw a baby tantrum pulling the food out of the bag being rude stating the name of each item and shoved it all back in the bag and once again said, $14.99. We told him no thank you, you eat it and that he had a horrible attitude and we went across the street to KOBE where the food is fantastic and cooked tepanyaki style and the service is impeccable. The problem with Olive Garden is the service and food are horrible. Could have been a bad night for that idiot at take out area but that's all it takes. If I was the manager I would read this scathing review and take it seriously because where there's smoke there's fire! The rude idiot at take out needs to be fired.
