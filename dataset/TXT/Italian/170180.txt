MUjlAtBNJR--7ai5pITbMg Very much enjoyed the food. Would have liked better service. The waiter who greeted us didn't check our reservation, just asked us to wait at the bar. He pointed at the 2 bar stools for the three of us. We had to arrange our own seating asking the couple next to us if we may take the stool that was in the corner. When dinner is priced this high, I want service. Next he tried to seat us without realizing a group of 4 were ahead of us. Sloppy mistakes. Dinner was delicious but overpriced. Don't need to go back.
