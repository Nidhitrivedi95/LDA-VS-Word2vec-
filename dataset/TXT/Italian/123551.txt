hmfAdo6LuVOvBLiu75C8ZA Delicious food, great view, beautiful setting and wonderful people. On short notice, my daughter's boyfriend asked us to help him find a place to propose to my daughter. He also wanted family and close friends to share in the experience since it was also her birthday. Luca's manager, hostesses, waiters and even Luca were all excited to be part of the surprise. They were extremely cooperative and flexible. They helped us chose a table and decide how the surprise would work. They piped in their favorite song, served drinks and appetizers to the crowd that went from an expected 20 people to 30+ people without missing a step. The service was wonderful. The experience was great and they were FAR more cooperative than the other west side place on the water we tried to have the event at. I can't say enough good things about our experience. Luca's is our favorite restaurant!
