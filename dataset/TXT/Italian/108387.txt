fzxvmA3Ygu3yrQQ6-cEpTw So.. tonight was my first time at Mora. To be honest at first I wasn't impressed at all. We got there early for our reservation and said they would seat us soon.  The hostess put us outside in 100 degree heat with misters. We could deal with that but what I couldn't deal with is no service and water or offer for drinks in about 10 mins. So I walked up to the Manager and said we need to get a better table and step up the service because this is my first time at your place. Well.. he did. We moved in side and he apologized for the lack of service and opened the conversation with a bottle of Rose on house. My intention was not to get anything for free but to get good service. After the ice breaking, it was flawless. The waitress was amazing. We had two bottles of wine that were magnificent. I highly recommend the meatballs, octopus and cheese bread for apps. For dinner I had the black pasta with clams. The sides of beets and brussel sprouts were off the chart. For dessert, the Italian pudding and coconut cake were delicious.  The server even asked the Chef for fresh fruit because one of the guests wanted it with some liquor. And they did it. Highly recommend it. They stand by the service, quality and experience.
