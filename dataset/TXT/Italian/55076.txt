AFaUDCTQ8LC33Nfmb_KWhg I loved this place! By the outside I would've never even thought it was an option for good food, but thanks to Yelp we went.
CC's ambiance is a small mom and pop restaurant, giving you the amazing service you would expect. It is just that though, small. So be prepared to wait unless you have a party of +5 to make a reservation. 
We headed to the bar for a few cocktails while we waited and before we knew it, it was time to eat! 
First you start off with their bread and dipping sauce. Delish. Then you get your salad which they mix up right in front of you with their house dressing. Delish. Then came my parmesan scallops with pasta. Holy moley. Amazing. I do wish I would've gotten 4 scallops for their size but this homemade pasta made up for it. You had your choice on which type of noodle you preferred. We both went for angel hair. 
My fiancé got his ahi tuna pasta and this came with the entire tuna fish pretty much! It even came to his spice liking. The homemade pasta in our entrees made the meal.
Though our stomachs were more than satisfied, we knew dessert was in order to round out this tasty Italian meal. We ordered the butterfinger Oreo crusted pie, which was also homemade. I think that lasted all of one minute?
The owner or manager, Anita came over to talk to us and was so nice. You can tell this place cares about their customers. She laughed when I said I heard of them from Yelp bc she can't turn on a computer!! Haha!
Coming from an Italian girl who grew up eating Italian homemade meals this is the best in the area!  Mangia mangia!
