BcLFIr4wtd3GQ3fnz15yDQ If you want authentic Italian food right at home in Pittsburgh, this is your place! As someone who has been to Italy, I can honestly say that DiAnoia's makes the BEST gnocchi I have ever had -- they're perfect potato pillows of deliciousness, complemented by house-made meatballs, sauce, and the perfect amount of cheese.

Not only that, but the service here is always incredible. The staff is kind, and you can really tell that they enjoy providing such joy to people through food. I've been here for both brunch and dinners, and I've never found myself wanting for anything more. I'll definitely be back!
