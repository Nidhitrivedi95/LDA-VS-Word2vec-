e5WAfCqfd_66zgrHmn8CiQ I figured I would take a break from pizza pizza and go for some stuffed crust. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed with the quality of my pizza given it was $20. The crust was great, but the slices were extremely thin and dry.

I'm not sure if it was this location or Pizza Hut in general but I certainly won't be returning anytime soon.
