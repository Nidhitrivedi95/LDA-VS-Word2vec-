VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w CLUB: Although I hear the food is great I have yet to make it to the restaurant. The club is "cozy" a little smaller than your average Vegas club and always packed. Love the decoration, great ambiance and good music. Bottle service is attentive and I like that they keep the water bottles stocked at the tables because a Vegas local shouldn't be drinking themselves into oblivion every time he/she goes out. Sunday night is a fun night to go.
