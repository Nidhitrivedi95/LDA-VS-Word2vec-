nDfN1RkA40anfzjFGRO8qQ This was a great place to eat. There was no waiting-we got right in and our waiter gave us great service, but didn't hover. The food was great. They didn't have the bottle of wine we ordered so they gave us a more expensive one for the cheaper price. Great atmosphere-will definitely be back!!
