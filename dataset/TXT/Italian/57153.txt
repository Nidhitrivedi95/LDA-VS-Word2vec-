AN9sX6Dh8-QAoJssdyno8A The pizza at this place was so great. I could have eaten a whole pizza by myself, both because they are pretty thin, and because it was that good. I got the traditional margherita and I was in love. I also got the calamari and that was decent, the mushroom white pizza was good (I am not a white pizza fan though), and we got a basic spaghetti pasta to share, and everything was outstanding. I recommend coming here! I was very impressed.
