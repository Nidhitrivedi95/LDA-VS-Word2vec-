i0bD4WCmVHdK92L73CNbgQ The perfect place to grab a light lunch or relax with a coffee and pastry after doing some shopping. I make sure to stop by whenever I'm at Yorkdale! 

I've tried a couple of the pastries here but my favourite is definitely the cannolis - crisp, buttery shells filled to the brim with deliciously creamy ricotta filling, yum. Most of their drinks are pretty good as well but if you can't decide what to get, go for the iced white mocha. You won't regret it!! Sandwiches are cute and yummy but relatively pricey and not particularly filling. 

Prices in general are fairly high here but not unexpectedly so for Yorkdale; I'd say most of the drinks and pastries (except maybe the macarons) are worth the premium pricing though.
