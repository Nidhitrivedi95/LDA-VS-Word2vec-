-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw Pasta is okay, but the salad is really good I got a harvest salad the chicken was delish and so was the dressing. Service was great but I'm not a fan of their food the ambience is nice. No super expensive it's moderate. Love the location and the parking so close! Thanks to the yelp event I got $25 off yay! Thanks yelp! I don't know if I'll be back I wasnt wowed or anything. My friend did say the lemon drops were exceptional!
