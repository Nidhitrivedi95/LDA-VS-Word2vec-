bXbCGFk3ZjLcTdQQB-xPyQ After seeing the previous reviews, I was very anxious to visit Luciano's. Upon arrival, the restaurant has been truly renovated since the La Paz ownership & is beautiful. We sat outside and enjoyed the bread and sun dried tomato dipping sauce with proseco, which was very good. We decided to start with the octopus appetizer, which was undercooked, chewy and overall not something I would enjoy again. We explained the issue to the waiter and shortly after our waiter and the manager approached the table to apologize. The chef tasted it & realized it was very undercooked and threw that batch away. A few minutes later they brought a complimentary calamari, very nice, but that was just as undercooked as the octopus. 
On to the entrees...we ordered the chicken piccata & the gnocchi. The chicken was ok, however, the entire plate was oil, and I mean dripping! As for the gnocchi, another uncooked meal. They were doughy and mush.
I hate to write this, because I did expect better, but for now I will stick with a few other Italian restaurants that are much better, and maybe give them another shot after a few more months in business.
