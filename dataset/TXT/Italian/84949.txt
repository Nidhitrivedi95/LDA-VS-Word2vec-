DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA I was in town for a wedding. I was staying at a friends nearby and decided to come in for a quick bite before the wedding rehearsal mainly because the outside looked inviting. When I walked in the place looked very warm and comforting. Little did I know that was all that was so welcoming to customers.
i ordered a pizza that took 40 minutes to come out. By that time I thought I was hungry enough to eat anything...until I took a bite. the bottom of the crust was crunchy but the inside was doughy and undercooked. When I sent it back, the owner(?) came out and asked what was wrong. He looked pretty amped up and not wanting a confrontation on my vacation I said that my stomach wasnt feeling well and thought that a dessert would feel better. To be fair, the lemon cake was kind of tasty though a bit dry. About the time I finished, that same guy I talked with was raising his voice at another customer when she was paying her bill. I felt that was my cue to leave.
I cannot, in good faith, give this place more than one star nor can I recommend this place to anybody.
