0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw Love Joe's!  We took the kids for a late dinner, the weather was just right for burgers, fries and a shake. 

The burger was fresh, the tuna was cooked just right, medium rare and the Garlic fries were worth the trip itself. 

My only complaint for this trip was that I forgot to order the Garlic Fries and when I asked the girl at the window if I could add the fries to my order which was almost ready she said that I would have to go back through the long line. I mean come on, really. 

    Update:  I was contacted today by the manager who addressed the issue i had with the Garlic Fries.  To be honest it was not a show stopper, I just wanted to be fair and include the entire experience.  I was impressed with the Manager's effort and concern for good service.  I added an extra star based on this.  Thanks for reaching out Anthony!

Joe's is a very hip, relaxed, progressive (for Phoenix that is) and fun little dive and when the weather is right makes for a perfect ending to a busy work week.
