9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Why am I updating my review?  Dessert!  It finally happened!

I really enjoy introducing people to places they have never been, and I am happy to say Cibo recently gained two new fans of their charming outdoor patio and good food.

The three of us arrived just before the 5pm opening to ensure we could secure a table on the patio and enjoy the gorgeous first evening of Spring outside.  Everything we tried was fantastic, and I had the opportunity to sample two new-to-me dishes, the burrata appetizer (I have no words to describe how special and good this mozzarella is, especially when combined with the salty prosciutto, and a drizzle of aged basalmic) and dessert!       

After selecting a chianti and the burrata, we decided to share two pizzas among us - the margherita and the rustica.  Both were excellent, with that slightly doughy wood-fired crust I love so much.

Ah, the dessert.  I think the trick to getting dessert with any meal is dining with guys.  There is no dainty "oh no, I just couldn't eat another bite" but rather "which one do you want?".  I like that.  We chose the Nutella and Marscapone cheese crepe, which was topped with a light dusting of powdered sugar and chocolate sauce.  So good, so worth waiting for - like hot chocolate, but on a plate.  Manners and politeness went out the door as our three forks fought for position.  I believe insults were thrown.  It is all fun and games until you get between me and some warm Nutella.  Back away slowly and you won't get hurt...  ;)
