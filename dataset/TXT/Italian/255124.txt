vxTV73VIhjskiFcI-9zLOg We saw this restaurant for a few years since we moved into the neighborhood, but today we finally made the leap and checked it out. 

The food was superb!!! Very fresh tasting and authentic. Beautiful atmosphere, small and romantic. Staff also very warm and attentive. 

Our new favorite spot in south etobicoke!
