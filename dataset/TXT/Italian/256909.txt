w2b0ve7xpuCQkwYICFIUOg Really love it here.  Everyone is so kind to us. The owner is great!  I forgot my hat and left it for a couple months at least. The server remembered and returned it to me.  Yay!!

The artichoke is a MUST HAVE. drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, shavings of Parmesan and cracked pepper. Yum!!  Can't get enough of that soft cheesy bread.  

We came in before closing.  They served us, but we had no idea they closed at 8 on this particular evening. If the hours were different I would definitely eat here more often. I could name 7 times I've wanted to come but it was closed lol.
