Service - like no other. JILL was amazing! 

Table side mozzarella is a must!!! CJ was so so great with his presentation of it. Try the truffle sea salt on the side...yum! The scallops were cooked beautifully and were rich and full of amazing flavor. And the red velvet bread pudding was to die for. Jill went out of her way to be sure we were happy with everything. She was a huge contributor to our incredible experience!
