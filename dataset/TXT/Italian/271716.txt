Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ Love this pizza. Had Detroit style in Detroit, was racing about it so my wife looked it up and found we had one near us. Gave it a try and was not disappointed. Being from the east we like a cheesy greasier pizza. This fits the bill. Pizza that's like back east is a tough find in Las Vegas but we love this place. It's a thick crust, square pizza. We had the extra cheese and a guys and dolls and both were crispy around the edges and super cheesy. Guys and dolls was loaded with toppings and really good. 

You order at the window and they bring it to you. Nothing fancy but good pizza. Plus there's a pink box donut next door for desert
