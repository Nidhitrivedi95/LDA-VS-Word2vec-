lvv9Vv_5i4IwvDdofO_rKg I really like the Mercatto on Bay St. and used to frequent it often for lunch when I worked downtown. I friend mentioned they opened one in the Eaton Centre and we decided to meet here instead as it was a move convenient location for us.

We were seated on the patio which was remarkably pleasant. I had a view of the church and my friend overlooked a grassy park. The patio alone would get 4.5 stars. It was quite, pedestrian friendly, and really enjoyable.

The decor was also really nice, as other have mentioned they obviously gave a lot of thought to the atmosphere.

As for the food - it was meh. We both ordered pizza. Mine had olives, artichokes, prosciutto and mushrooms, however instead of being distributed evenly all over the pizza each quarter was allocated it's own topping. I know this was intentional but I like having all the flavours on each piece. I spent so much time re-arranging my toppings that by the time i got around to finishing the pizza (and yes I ate the whole thing), it was cold. Also - i found the crust too thin in places (the tomato sauce was seeping through) and both of our pizzas were quite oily.

As others have commented we had the pre-packaged breadsticks - now I was prepared for this thanks to other reviews, and agree that it's a bit odd. However on the flip side I have no self control when it comes to fresh bread served at restaurants and tend to eat so much bread that I'm lucky to get half way through my dinner. But in this case I was able to nibble a bit before my meal on aforementioned breadsticks, and then for a change eat my entire entree! 

Our service was fine, they were great about keeping our water glasses full, and we didn't have to wait long to order, or for our food to arrive.

All in all it was an ok experience, I would go back for the patio but wouldn't recommend it based solely on the food.
