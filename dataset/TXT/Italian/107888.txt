FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A Tried Mac Shack for lunch with my wife.  It's a cafeteria style concept with fixed menu items or design your own pasta.   I ordered the Angel Hair with fresh tomato sauce and my wife had the Caprese Grilled Cheese sandwich.  Food was just ok....my pasta sauce had a strange chemical like taste and was overloaded with garlic.  I ate about one-third of the large bowl full.  My wife's Caprese sandwich was better than my pasta, although the bread became soggy very quickly, from the tomatoes, I suppose. 

We waited what seemed like a long time for our meals to be delivered. 

The restaurant is spacious and has a nice, clean, retro-industrial vibe.  The restaurant staff was friendly and the overall service was very good. 

We'll probably try Mac Shack again; it's a great Pasta "fast food plus" concept that has potential and deserves a second chance. 

Suggestion to the restaurant is to put menus on the tables so diners can explore all the options. Currently, there's only a single large board menu hanging above the food line which is hard to read from the dining area.
