NvG2KYObJujUeswSDmww_w My friend & I happened upon Wild Vines by complete accident as our car navigator & phone weren't finding a local wine bar as fast as we were moving so we just finally pulled in & there it was. We had a long hot day in Phx & were heading north on I-17 but needed some refreshments & appetizers. Our server was excellent (also cute) & helped us find a nice house wine named One Hope (I think) we had the Happy Hr special Hummus & the cheese board. We're going to be back in Phx tomorrow & we've already decided we're going to try dinner. I hope we have the same server. I took her picture & wanted to post it but I'm new @ this so maybe I'll have to ask for help from my nephew Kyle.
