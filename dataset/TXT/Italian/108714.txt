G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q We tried calling for 20 minutes today and couldn't get through to make a reservation so we just showed up for lunch. The place was half empty and they couldn't seat us for over an hour. We sat on the benches in what looks like is part of the bar, hoping we could get an appetizer to pass the time, but they won't serve food there, even though it's a mere 5' from the bar. After we're finally seated, we learn they are out of 1 of the 2 pasta dishes they have on the menu. It's lunch, how does that happen? I ask for the muffuletta sandwich, they are out of that too.  Living in Las Vegas, I've gotten used to most celebrity chef restaurants providing great service and great food. The food was okay but there is no room for the "take it or leave it attitude towards patrons", especially on the strip. I'm sure the name will keep it open for awhile, but that won't last forever. Great TV show however.
