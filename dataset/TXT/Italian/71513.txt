C8jxNWv_I2pRJRAYY6C1yw Post-dating back to Summerlicious '10, Joey Bravo is a small Italian restaurant situated in the Scarborough area. Walking into this restaurant gives off a rustic feeling, with a central fireplace in the middle of the restaurant, wooden chairs and tables, and wooden panels all around. It certainly gave a more family-friendly environment, over a romantic one. There is also a nice patio outside when spring/summer comes around and a bar/pool table for game nights.

The restaurant itself was empty when our group of 12 came in, but we had no prior expectations as to how our night was going to end up. We had the choice of ordering al la carte or sticking with their Summerlicious prix-fixe menu. I opted to stick with the prix-fixe menu, hoping it was Joey Bravo's tried and true staple items.

Ordered:
Pan Fried calamari - Served with Tzatziki sauce which gives a tangy, citrus taste to the calamari. The calamari itself was soft, encased in a light and tasty batter.

Beef Tenderloin - Prepared with red wine cream sauce. The tenderloin was a bit tough, though the combination of flavours with the sauce made up for it. Overall, a standard dish.

Tiramisu - The presentation was terrible. It was as if someone just slapped on a piece of cake in the cafetaria line. I had higher expectations of the Tiramisu, as it is an Italian restaurant. There was nothing special about this one. 

There was one server for the night, as I'm guessing that this restaurant doesn't get too rowdy. 

Overall, I wouldn't be back for the Summerlicious option, but Joey Bravo is a good local joint for some good Italian food at affordable prices.
