L9qDnDHSnINNjePwrJz-uQ When the moon hits you eye like a big pizza pie / That's amore / When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine/ That's amore....Like Dean Martin, Meile's Bistro is a delight, a great weekday/weekend respite from the kitchen. I could be wrong, but it looks like the restaurant has been spruced up a bit recently, either way it is nice and cozy. 

The fresh bread that comes with every meal is great and the bruschetta is wonderfully fresh and flavorful. There are typically 3-4 specials every night and always a nice selection between a vegetarian dish and a fish dish. The wine selection is average but the by the glass prices are great and enough variety that I can chose something different every time. 

The service is absolutely stellar. The waiter in the evening is impeccable and the owner makes the rounds too, asking how your meal is and the like. I absolutely love this place for a nice meal, middle of the week, enjoy myself spot.
