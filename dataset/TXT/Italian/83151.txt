DhRJJ5aUUuBp3XR1JbLeuw I've been to Sauce several times and am always satisfied. I absolutely love the mozzarella, tomato and basil chopped salad. It is always so fresh and delicious. Perhaps I am just simple but their cheese pizza with mozzarella, fontina and basil is my favorite. Their crust is super thin and crunchy and the cheese is melty, salty and delicious. This isn't your normal cheese pizza, the slices melt in your mouth. I don't eat meat but my parents love their sausage pizza and the chicken noodle soup.
The iced tea is decent and I enjoy that I can get a bottle of Fat Tire. Staff, although high school aged, are accommodating and friendly.
