xly3K2HgsjvZs5Mu9kSFxg We never thought we'd get in on a Friday night during the holidays, but the hostesses did their best to keep our wait to a minimum. We ordered the basics...Mussels, pasta meat sauce, a pasta vodka and strawberry salads. The servings were huge!  Each meal was super tasty- a couple of the best sauces I've had.  Thrilled to find this nugget right in our back yard.  To top it off, great service. We'll be back!
