bVTWcZWhtJc4IjWy_74CYQ Absolutely horrendous hostess services. Every time I call to see if they do call ahead seating I get a different answer. Called veterans day they said they did call ahead, just not that day. That's understandable. I called again new years eve, they didn't do it on holidays but that they did do it. So tonight I call & I was told that they are not doing it since it is busy, I voiced my concern about how I get a different answer every time I ask. Then I was referred to the manager whom stated that "they are just too busy tonight to do call ahead seating, but normally it is done throughout the week". I asked what the guidelines were as to when call ahead was/wasn't offered. He said that they normally do it on slower days to get people in. I'm sorry, but why would I call ahead on a day where there isn't a wait. Call ahead seating is meant for people who are getting their name on the list prior to showing up. He referred me to do online check in, so I did & it said 41-50 minutes. I show up 30 minutes after doing this & I was told that the wait is 45-1hr. Somehow it magically jumped as if try are unsure how to operate the seating system. I was a hostess before as a 10th grader, it's not rocket science. Very displeased with their service.
