fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w We were in town for a friend's birthday and there was a group of ten of us. Our server was able to get us seated pretty quickly with such a big group but service was horrible. I ordered a Bloody Maria, it was really good, but it also took like 30+ minutes to get. I had to ask at least two different times where it was. I understand it was busy, I was a server before, I tried to stay patient, but it was ridiculous. I believe it was a manager walking around that I had to ask her to check the status of our food. It then came out like 5-10 minutes after that and we got a simple apology for the delay. After eating, it then took another 20 minutes to get our checks. The server added her gratuity to our group because of how big the party was. Lucky her because that tip was generous compared to what I would've given her. Long story short... food=good, service=bad!
