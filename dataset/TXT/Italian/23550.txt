3w22LbUT5fwHLT9-ytIXhw Nice place.  Food absolutely horrible.  I figured a simple original infused Italian menu would be easily executed however I'm wrong.  Risotto mushy and over cooked and dry. Proteins smelled funny.  And cooks not clean at all. Will not be back.  However across the street is the schnepf farms bakery and cafe and I heard they have a bad ass chef from multiple fine dining restaurants and resorts experience as well as celebrities.  Organic farm to table truly.  Olive mill could at least go across the street and buy fresh produce from the Schnepf's to at least have fresh ingredients?? I will go for oils but for eating and possibly weddings are banquets I'm going to Schnepf's farm and experience this awesome chef bring something we have needed and long over due to queen creek! Whomever found this guy deserves an award!!!
