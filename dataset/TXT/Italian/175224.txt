But I'll go on....

Oregano's is awesome on so many levels: portion size, price, staff friendliness, menu offerings, locations, decor, etc. etc. etc.

I've been to Oregano's more times than I can remember and I seldom have anything to moan about except maybe the wait time...and not being able to decide what I want ;)

If you haven't been there, go.  If you're there for lunch, grab a pablo picasso salad and a passion fruit iced tea.  If you're there for dinner make sure you try the bellinis, the pesto bruscetta, the thin crust pizza...and again, the pablo picasso salad!!!!  

The music is fun, the decor is great, the staff is ALWAYS uber friendly.  The only gripes (other than what's mentioned above) is they should maybe invest in better silverware and outdoor furniture.  Other than that, keep doing what you do, Oregano's, and I'll keep adding to my waistline.
