Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA This place is close to my apartment so I decided to order a salad one night when I was craving a quick, light meal. I got the harvest salad with chicken. It was mediocre - definitely nothing to write home about. It was on the small size, very overpriced for the amount of food. Doesn't tempt me to go back and try their pizza.
