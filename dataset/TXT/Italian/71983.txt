cbddL2q8uRA38RwycB0FJg I'm not really a big fan of going out and eating Italian since many of the pasta dishes prepared at restaurants seem like they came from the frozen section of the local grocery store, I can do that at home and save some money, thank you very much. 

Alexanders is very different. You can tell the sauces are all freshly made and there is a great selection of them. I recommend the Gorgonzola basil cream sauce. The menu has all the classic Italian favorites and the Specials menu always has mouth watering seasonal items on it as well. The whole family can enjoy Alexander's. 

Great Italian food, very reasonable prices and huge portions make this our go-to Italian eatery.
