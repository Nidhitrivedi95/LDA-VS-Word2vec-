VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w This is just for the Restaurant.

This was for our "special dinner" before going to see Phantom. 
Normally this is a little too "upscale" for us, but I really wanted a nice dinner. It was SO worth it. And we didn't feel out of place at all.

Amazing. That is one word to sum it up. We requested to be seated outside, and we were promptly taken out. Amazing table with view of the Siren Show at TI. BONUS! Plus just the vibe of sitting above the strip has such good energy!

The bread that comes out is great, the marinara sauce is a bit plain, but by all means is not bad. We shared a Caesar salad, and my goodness it was HUGE. It was a great salad. The dressing was so good. Quite enjoyable! Our server was excellent. Fast and not pushy at all. I ordered the Margarita  Pizza and my husband ordered the Chicken Parm. My pizza was exceptional. Flat bread, cheesy. Delish! His chicken plate was HUGE. It was very yummy. 

Tiramisu was great. Some of the best I've had. It tasted so fresh. 
I would definitely eat here again!! Well done Lavo!
