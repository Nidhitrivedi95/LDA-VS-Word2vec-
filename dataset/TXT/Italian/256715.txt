w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q I recently had a business dinner at the Palm Restaurant and we both had the 4lbs lobster. The staff was good (usually better). The food is phenomenal! The lobster is perfectly done and we very much enjoyed the food along with a glass of cocktail and wine. If you are in Las Vegas and have a craving for lobster, Palm restaurant has not only the best deal on it, but the largest and juiciest lobsters you can find! Definitely recommended! ;)
