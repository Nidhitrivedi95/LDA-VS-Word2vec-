G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I was looking forward to this restaurant and finally made it in for lunch one day. Reservations for dinner are at least a week away which I don't understand as there are usually empty tables around. Maybe they don't have enough staff or want to make it feel more exclusive. We easily got a reservation for lunch, but when we arrived their system was down and said they needed to wait until it was up again as they had no way to confirm I had a real reservation. I showed them the email confirmation and they said they would seat us soon. We had to talk to them a couple of more times and they sat us when we said we had to be out by a certain hour. After that hiccup, our server was extremely attentive and the food was at our table timely. 

I was craving the baked pasta (lasagna for Sunday) but our server would not recommend it as it had mixed reviews from other diners and the kitchen was still modifying the recipe. I ended up getting the muffuletta sandwich and was underwhelmed. The bread was not soft and fresh, and the overall taste was nothing extraordinary. I got the zucchini scapecci as the side and this was my favorite part of the meal. My friend got the tuna sandwich which was better than the muffuletta, but be warned it is not fresh tuna. 

I would like to go back and give it another shot. The space and decor are beautiful but so far it felt like it was more about the celebrity chef than the food.
