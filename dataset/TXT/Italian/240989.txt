UFvLouGNq5q3w-0Ud_HP7w Ordered 3 thin crust pizzas for take out, paid over $65 ($75 when counting the tip). Ordered their version of a supreme, a meat lovers, and pepperoni for the kids. Took about 40 mins for the order to come out. The pizza was good, but the price seems a bit steep. If you're doing 1 pizza, try this place. If you're doing multiple for a get together, go Domino's (or something similar). Don't think it's worth the price for multiple orders.
