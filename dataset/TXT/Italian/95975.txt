eQCYur0033RkZdh5VjbF8A The line a few doors down at Fran's was long so a friend popped over to see if there was a line at O&B and how much more expensive it was. There wasn't a line, it appeared to be a little more expensive and we were short time so we went to O&B.

Meal: I started brunch with the mushroom soup because that's how I start all meals at O&B and jump and it didn't disappoint.  However, the meal went downhill from there.  The Challah French Toast (with caramelized bananas, hazelnuts and maple syrup) sounds delightful and reasonably priced at $14.  It tasted great. Except the 3 pieces of french toast were each the size of half a broken hot dog bun (so essentially getting 1.5 hot dog buns). I get that quality is more important than quantity at places like this but brunch should not be a 5 course meal.  The flavours were right, but the size was not.  Finally, I also had a cheddar scallion scone because I LOVE the one at School Bakery. But here at O&B, it came out burnt from a toaster and cold inside. Worst of both worlds.

How much I paid? About $30. So it turns out that it was actually a lot more expensive than Fran's.

 If you're looking for somewhere "safe" in terms of cleanliness, location, parking, transit, and not having to line up, this might be for you. But there are tons of other places that serve a far better brunch So I wouldn't recommended going there if you're catching up with friends or looking for a great meal.
