G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Such a big let down. We had a very unpleasant experience at this tourist trap. The waiter way over sold the special appetizer options to us. Convincing us to order more food than two people can, should or need to eat before a the main meal. Then the bone in ribeye was so poorly prepared, we hated it. It was a less than good cut of steak and poorly cooked. The only nice part of dinner was the wine.  We will never go back.
