qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg I like the relocation here, it's more bright and roomy.  (Wow, this has been in draft since last year).  I know a lot of people like this restaurant style and set up but I liked it the old way, like how Lake Mead/Rock Springs has it.  But whichever set up they have, the food is still tasty good.  

I come here so often, especially during my lunch break at work, that the owner knows exactly what I like to order and always places my order in while I'm being sat down to eat, how cool.  I like to sit at the booths but they have many open tables available and a special room for larger parties.  Patio seating too.  

My favorite dish continues to be Pomegranate Chicken and Baklava for dessert!  A minor gripe would be the young and inexperience servers.  I give them the benefit of the doubt because they're young and new but wow, some of them continue to not improve.
