BBFRnGOH_3bUpIT4GYSApQ Came here because I was waiting to get my tires changed next door at Active Green and Ross. 

It was quite pricey, lasanga with potatoes, another kind of pasta, and cooked veggies. ($13.95 including a drink) The lasnaga was good, and the potatoes, but carb overload! The veggies were meh. 

They also have breakfast and sandwiches made to order.
