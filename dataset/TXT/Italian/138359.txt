JBrBsKpw0bbXK5nlrXVOYQ This is our favorite place for Italian food! Last night we had a small (10 people) birthday dinner for our granddaughter. We truly enjoyed our experience. Our server, Tricia, was fantastic, she exceeded all our needs. At the end of the meal they surprised The birthday girl with a HUGE ice cream sundae in a radio flyer wagon! Anzios is a small place with a big heart and great food. Thanks for making our dinner memorable!!
