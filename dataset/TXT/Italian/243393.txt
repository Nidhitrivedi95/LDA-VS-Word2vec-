uqYB53z5GrtzJq8WHTF-xg The food was excellent. The service however, left much to be desired. Our server was obviously having a bad night. It took almost 20 minutes to get our salad. At that point our drinks were empty. The server said she would be back with drinks, however it took around 10 minutes for her to come back.

Our server was very nice. She did tell us that she was having an issue in the kitchen. However, that should not affect our service. 

Overall, great food. Nice server. Poor service.
