5zjYrtSK1NdVoWNmo96rYA This was my first trip to Bravo, and I promise it was also my last. We visited this establishment as a large group for a company dinner outing. As a party of 10, in a fairly empty restaurant on a Monday night, we spent over 2 hours of our 2.5 hour meal waiting for items. A member of our party asked for a glass of water upon sitting down, and an hour later it was finally brought to the table when it was requested a second time. It took over 45 minutes to get bread, which was requested more than 4 times, and our meal, which took 30 minutes for them to even be ready to take our order, took another 45 minutes to come out. When we completed our dinner, and ordered desserts, two appetizers came out (which were ordered well before the meals and subsequently forgotten as a result of the slow service). At the completion of our meal, there was additional trouble with the bill causing multiple authorizations of a $300 bill on the credit card being used to pay. The manager was less than accommodating and the servers (even with two, the service was awful) only apologized after they certainly got into trouble after we complained to the rude manager. I hope that this restaurant has "regulars" to keep them afloat, because if this is how the service is provided to newcomers, during restaurant week no less, this place should be shut down.
