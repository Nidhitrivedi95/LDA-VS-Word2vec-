vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw Man this place does it right!  They hit my three areas for a review right on the money every time; service, food, atmosphere.  

I'm stoked that they have opened a couple more locations other than in the east valley.  I hate, hate ,hate waiting to eat, but for this place I make an exception.  It's worth the wait. I love to hit this place right around 2:00 or 3:00 and we walk right in and watch the dinner crowd line up as we finish up our meal.  

The drinks are good, the beer is cold and everything I have ever ordered was great!  The cheesy garlic bread is a must have.  I also really enjoy the holy guacamole dish.  It's a huge cheesy tortilla with a hefty helping of guac, it's awesome.  My go-to entre is the alfredo-the dark with chicken.  

The atmosphere is casual and energetic.  I love the quality of the servers.  It truly seems everyone loves working there.  It's always clean and the food is always consistent. 

I'm amazed at how reasonable the prices are for the portion size and quality.  

It's pretty simple, if you haven't been....go.  You won't regret it.
