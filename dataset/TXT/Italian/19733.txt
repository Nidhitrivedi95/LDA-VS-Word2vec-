2XHQdSM_FvQ7-PUUKaNDCw Had dinner there with my wife on Sunday.  Nice place with big beautiful windows.  I ordered a Caesar salad with the Flemish mussels and she ordered the Beef table d'hôte special dish.  Caesar was nice and light (not too garlicky). Also ordered Creme Brûlée which was delish! This place is very reasonable plus you can bring your own wine. We got there just before a huge lineup plus lots of reservations.  Will definitely return but will make a reservation for a weekend dinner!
