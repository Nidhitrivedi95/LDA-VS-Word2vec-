GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA The atmosphere is elegant and the service is impeccable, but the food is really just "meh."  I had $200 worth of comps at the Venetian for food and drink and I was disappointed that I wasted them on B & B Ristorante. If I had spent my own money on the meal, I probably would have only given the place one star. 

This being said, there is one dish that I would go back for. and that is Mario Batali's Grilled Octopus with Limoncello Vinaigrette. It was one of the top ten things that I have ever tasted. The octopus was grilled to perfection without any rubbery texture and the limoncello dressing added a powerful citrus flavor that brightened the entire dish. If you do go, order this for your appetizer and a second for your entree!

My entree of steak tagliata with roasted fingerling potatoes on the other hand, was HORRENDOUS. It was so so so so incredibly oily that I could barely finish eating it. I've had better steaks for half the price at hole-in-the-wall Italian restaurants. The potatoes were burnt to a crisp and also drenched in oil--I put one in my mouth and ended up spitting it out (a nice surprise for my waiter in the cloth napkin at the end of the night, I am sure!)

But aside from the food, I must also admit that the wine was delicious. I had a full bodied red by Bastianich and it was stellar (as it should be at $18 a glass!). 

Super unimpressed and would not waste my time or money here next time I go to Vegas. Sorry Mario, but it was a miss for me,
