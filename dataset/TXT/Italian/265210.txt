Yes, sometimes the wait is a little long, but I promise you, IT'S WORTH THE WAIT. I've been to a couple of other imitation locations and they don't even come close. 

Postinos East is a MUST-GO if you're looking for a girls night out, romantic dinner setting, double date night, sexy brunch time :-) ...whatever the occassion. We've had several small group bday celebrations here. Anything over 8 people is tough for them but they usually make it work. 

The outside grassy area is perfect for a picnic lunch or dinner. You bring the blanket and they bring the service. You can also arrange large parties out there but I think you pay/order all the tables and chairs. Not sure but I've seen it done and it seemes like a quaint space for the large group.

Postinos East delivers phenomenal service and food 100% of the time.
