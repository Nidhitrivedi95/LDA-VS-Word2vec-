IQVka-wzJmN3jw2W70aCzw One of the most romantic places I've ever eaten dinner is at Michelina's in Phoenix, and if you haven't been there yet, I suggest you set up your next date there now.

The Italian restaurant, run by Miss Michelina DiSibio, is a gorgeous fresh flower-filled eatery, complete with white linen-covered tables, pretty lighting and friendly, competent servers. And usually, Michelina herself visits tables to make sure guests are perfectly satisfied with what they're dining on.

The menu is classic Italian, with recipes Michelina brought with her from her native Italy. At a recent visit, I had the absolutely amazing pasta shells stuffed with spinach and ricotta ($17.95), which I covered in both alfredo and marinara sauces to create a divine creamy concotion. I've been there many times and also really love the salads and desserts, especially the tiramisu. Everyone I've dined there with has also raved about the food.

The place is so pretty and cozy, the food so delicious and the staff so professional and friendly, it's a guarantee you'll want to go back.
