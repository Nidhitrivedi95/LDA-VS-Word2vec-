qkDlRkNfrXE_4t2vMrTo0A The location is pretty sweet with some nice views of lake Monona. The interior is nostalgic w/ lots of wood, but not great.

The food is where they fall short. The menu is really boring: the appetizer selection is sparse and the pizza list is disappointing. I would put some time into that if I ran the place. The pizza was okay- fairly generic; nothing to write home about.

I have to say the tiramisu was pretty good. And they charge $.10 for andes mints! The nerve...

Update: (drinks and more)
(1) Word has it they have a $1 happy hour from 4-6 M-Th. I might have to move in.
(2) Drank there and they were pretty good - nothing to write home about, but don't shy away if you are in the area.
(3) Also, I got to meet the owner - nice guy, but he insists the menu is in good shape. I guess it gets packed during UW games- so I could be wrong.
