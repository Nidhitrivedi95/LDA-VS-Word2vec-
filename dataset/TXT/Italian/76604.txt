cVlW0omVTRaVJqnT-OBBsQ Came here on the 29th of March for the Lucky Gnocchi Night, which is basically all-you-can eat gnocchi in a variety of sauces.

There are specific seating times for this event - not sure of all of the times, but the dinnertime options were 5 or 7 p.m.

The gnocchi overall was decent, it was kind of hit or miss with some batches overcooked, or too cold, or just right. Our faves of the night were the bolognese, four cheese, and Pompeii (basic, crushed tomato sauce). The pesto one was quite good as well, but the butter sage was flavourless. Service was frequent, but they ran out of some flavours and returned with second rounds of previous flavours instead which I was kind of disappointed in. 

I probably won't return for the gnocchi event now that I've tried it, but may go back to try out their pizzas and other dishes.
