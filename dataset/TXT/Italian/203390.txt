Q4RSmF0s-AkaegrLFCLEbg The food here was exceptional, and the wine and wine selection were fantastic. When we arrived on a weekday evening as a party of two, it was a bit confusing at first when we walked in, and it took a bit for someone to help us. When they seated us, we were practically on top of the people next to us, which made conversation tough. The lighting is probably supposed to be mood lighting, but just made it tough to read the menus. Nonetheless, the food was beyond worth any hassle.
