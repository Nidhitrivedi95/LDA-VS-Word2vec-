xFOjC9yqSEecm3q9HZ1s4Q At first, I wasn't too sure about Amore Dogs.

The restaurant doesn't really look like a restaurant from the outside. It's very plain, very crisp and clean looking, and I wasn't sure it had the usual cosy, homliness I usually like in a restaurant. However, having tried the highly acclaimed Sea Dogs only a few weeks earlier, I decided to give it a go and see what I had been missing.

I have to be honest and say that I don't really like the bright, whiteness of the place, especially not for an Italian restaurant. I love the doggie art though! 

The food however, is right up my alley. I absolutely love Italian, and I'm always on the lookout for the next best place to visit. I thought the food was a little bit too fussy for me at first. With dishes like Ox liver and pork cheeks and trotter, which puts me right off to be honest. I stuck to what I know and love, and had amatriciana rigatone with bacon and chilli, which was delicious. It was very rich and creamy, with plenty of bacony bits, served beautifully. I was really impressed with the dish as a whole, definitely one of the best I have had. 

We were rushing so only had the one course, but they do a very reasonable lunch menu for a set price which looked brill. I think I might have to warm to the place, but the overall verdict is pretty good! Still prefer The Dogs though!
