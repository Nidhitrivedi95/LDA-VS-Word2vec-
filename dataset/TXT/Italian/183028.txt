OBG1j517k7aZRNC1HAL0TA Mothers Day2016. Ordered a bunch of dishes.  Appetizers were all good. Especially the duck bruschetta. Mains included pizza, braised short rib pasta, lamb porchetta and duck.  Flavours all on point but clearly there was a timing issue in the kitchen. Everything was cold. Considering the tab should have sent it all back.
