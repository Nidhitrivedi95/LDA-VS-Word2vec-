8dSIAoz_UphMGpZr_uMing I'm not a big Pizza lover so I had my 19 year old son choose what to order. We got the Godfather pizza. The pizza was AMAZING!!! Such a great blend of flavors that smelled and tasted fantastic!!! We also got the BBQ wings and spicy wings. They were delicious!!! The restaurant is very pretty. ..much more than I'd  expect from a "Pizza place". It was also immaculately clean which is very important to me. The service was great! The lady at the bar and the server were super sweet and attentive. I would definitely recommend the Rosati's on Rainbow and Windmill. This place has made me realize I AM a pizza lover!!!
