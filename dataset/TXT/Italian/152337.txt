Ks13abA-KZWAA6FMQagQmg This is a small Italian grocery store, not a restaurant so some of the survey questions don't apply such as "waiter service" which is really "counter service" in this case.

The Pros: I stopped in for a sub sandwich. I ordered the hot pastrami sub, with extra meat. The guy behind the counter asked if I wanted it hot...."yes."  The sandwich was large, so full of meat it was difficult to eat. The meat was really tender and juicy...the way you want it.

The Cons: After I ordered, he disappeared into the back, returned and asked if I wanted mustard. Yes, but I didn't realize that there weren't any condiments or condiment packages out, you had to trust that he would put on the amount you wanted in the back. The sandwich was "hot" but not because it was "toasty hot" it was because it was microwaved. The roll was so soggy that it wasn't easy to keep the sandwich together. 

Recommendation to owner: get a commercial toaster oven or alert your customers that "hot sandwich" means "microwaved."

This sandwich would have be extraordinarily good had I been able to add my own condiments and had it been heated in a toaster oven.
