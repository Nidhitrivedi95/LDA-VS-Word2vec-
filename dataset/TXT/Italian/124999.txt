Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ My first order was carry out and had a not so good experience so the owner invited us back to try them again so here we are.
The dining room is small but very old school so it's great. The light fixtures give great light and the music sets the mood. Large plastic wall lets you see the pizza being made...my kids loved that. 

Bought a jar of rosemary lemonade and it was pleasant to the taste. Not powerfully sweet like regular but good tasting.  

The pizza arrived pipping hot and the plates were hot too so it stayed hot longer. The 24 inch pizza will fill your belly quickly. This time around it was a lot better....no paper  This time around we were impressed with the explosions of taste while devouring the slices.

Then to our surprise the five cheese baked mac came over. Sublime is the only word that comes to mind. You must, nay, have to order this dish. We were all full from the pizza but the mac made us eat it. Talk about good torture, this is the only way to die.

Great joint to sit and enjoy good food. This is a must visit if you want to be amazed. Thank you for the wonderful tastebud vacation to chesseville.
