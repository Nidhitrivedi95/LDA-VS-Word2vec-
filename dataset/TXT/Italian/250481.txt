We were helped by one of the owners... Superb service!! We purchased meats etc... And then we could not leave without trying their sandwiches. 
OMG delicious!!! We had the pulled beef as well as the brisket. Both had the coleslaw and Mad Mayo....both were scrumptious!!!  Moving forward we will purchase our meats from this location and will not leave without grabbing one of their delicious sandwiches.  Service was GR8!!! Overall a very positive experience! Thanks to everyone who posted.
