My boyfriend made reservations Saturday April 1st we show up we're seated and our waiter was very nice took our drink order then food order the normal ya know! My bf runs to the restroom and while he's gone which wasn't long at all the food was delivered!!! Yes food before drinks???!!! Seriously Bootleggers??? Our waiter even made the comment as he brought the drinks he was very shocked our food was out! We had fettuccini alfredo with chicken which was not good at all. Who the hell puts pesto sauce all over the chicken for alfredo?!  I did not like it at all! We never got the bread so my man asked again and we got old hard gross bread! My drink was even bad compared to my mans drink! The only thing good was the lasagna! So I'm not sure I will ever be back. I should get a thank you for not calling out a manager!
