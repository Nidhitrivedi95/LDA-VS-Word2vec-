LH8S1sUwxg2_TotePOFLvg Got ripped off and didn't have time to ask them to fix it because I was almost going to be late to my friends wedding and they couldn't even keep my glass of WATER filled. Was not able to locate their health code rating which freaked me out a bit. Probably not going to go back there ever again
