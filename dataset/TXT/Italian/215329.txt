roz-ed8kvBF6fwKBPeJ49Q A group was in there on Tuesday night April 26 during an out-of-town business trip. Five out of eight got food poisoning and all 5 ate the Caesar salad. It's unfortunate because we liked this place. However when they were called on it they were in denial and would not own the issue. Never going back here again.  Sad thing is how many other people got food poisoning that night.
