GnODIDJz09LecpudDoynCg Just went to Greenbush tonight with a friend for dinner. I had been here once before and it wasn't so memorable. Tonight, it was memorable. We got the nightly special pizza - topped with Nueske's bacon and arugula, a couple types of cheeses and tomato on an oil-based crust.
OH MY GOD. It was so good. SO GOOD! I am pretty picky about the way I want my bacon cooked - crisp but not burnt, and this bacon was cooked perfectly. It was amazing! I am a huge fan of thin crust pizzas , and this place did not disappoint. I saw one other review where the person mentioned the pizza was similar to New York style pizza. I completely disagree with that statement. New York style pizza, while thin crusted, still folds in half. The pizza at Greenbush doesn't fold in half, the crust would break. It's burnt in some places and chewy in others. Perfect!
We also got the fried calamari appetizer which I liked. Some pieces were a bit chewy, but most were tender. They were dusted in a cornmeal batter of some sort and served with a creamy horseradish sauce which was a nice change of pace (I don't like marinara with calamari).
Also, the have pretty cheap wine by the glass (pinot grigio was $5), and a number of cocktails all priced at $8 each.
There was a wait to get a table at 8pm on a Tuesday night - can't argue with that!
