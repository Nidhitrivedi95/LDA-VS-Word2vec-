WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw One of my favorite things to do is order a pizza in person and sit at the bar and have a beer. The beer at NYPD is really great, as well as the atmosphere. The pizza is really outstanding for take out! I love the friendly service and would recommend NYPD to anyone who has never tried it!
