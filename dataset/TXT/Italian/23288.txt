3QS2Wgedv3jjKC5vJXJTcA I pass by this place every now and then and it is always packed, not surprising as Terroni seems to have a handle on Italian food establishments all over the city and the location is quite central.
Reservation was via open table though it will show up under Le Bettola Osteria. For starters they don't have the prix fix menu anymore. Never mind they have combined the menu of both spots so one can order things from both sides. 
I was a bit early so went through it again as had to rethink what to order. 
After a bit of contemplating we settled on ordering Burrata cheese pizza as an app to share I ordered a halibut for the main. My friend ordered a pesto pasta. 
We were given some good bread to start with a nice olive oil for dipping. Good start. The Burrata pizza is served with cold topping and was good. Then the wait started even though we were checked on regularly there was no sign of the main courses.
Halibut though cooked well was nothing special. Not much seasoning which is fine but the sides could have elevated this dish a bit. I did taste the pasta and being my jaded self when it comes to pasta dishes didn't care for it much. 
For what one pays here I would say I expect better.
2.5 stars.
