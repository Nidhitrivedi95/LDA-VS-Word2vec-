GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA B&B Ristorante was a bit of a disappointment. 
I have been to Chef Balali's Osteria Mozza on Melrose in Los Angeles a few times, so I thought I would try B&B on a recent trip to Las Vegas. Bad idea. Let me tell you... B&B isn't near to the same class as Osteria Mozza. 

The ambiance was nice. Comfortable. Had a familiar feel.

The service was... Lacking. I guess the question should be, was there service? Minimal. 

Homemade Orecchiette with spicy lamb sausage and rapini was fair, not what I would have expected from a Batali and Bastianich restaurant.
Bone Marrow Ravioli with osso bucco ragu was a little better... But still nowhere near mind blowing.
Whole Grilled Branzino with herb and fennel salad was HORRIBLE. The fish did not taste fresh and was a compete waste. Just plain bad.
Veal Chop with pancetta, spinach, and torpedo onions was actually the best item I tried during this visit. It it was just okay. Actually it saved them from a one star rating.

Usually, If I have a bad experience at a restaurant, I will give them a second chance. But this wasn't a minor issue, or one item that wasn't good. It was everything. From the moment I walked in the door. To leaving and heading back to Table 10 to eat a good meal.
I tried it once, but don't think I will again.
