VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g Food is on point, atmosphere is dimly lit romantic fancy and food is authentic and high quality.  Waiter Herb was attentive, friendly, funny, LOVED HIM!  If you're lucky you may hear someone playing their piano while you enjoy your meal.  This restaurant is a must when we go to Vegas.  Perfect for dates or families.
