I had the pasta special (spaghetti bologna) and my wife had the gnocchi. They were good. The spaghetti wasn't $25 good but the gnocchi was fairly priced. The old fashioned I had was not very good. It was almost pure bourbon which I don't mind, but it wasn't the best old fashioned I've ever had. My wife's wine was good too.

We probably won't be back for dinner but I suggest checking it out. Just order something that's worth it and don't drink an old fashioned.
