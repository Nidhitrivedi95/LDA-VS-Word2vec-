QDJBn7I1EdtP9w4nYT24Pw I ordered food from here from Grub Hub. It was delivered fast, so I assume the food was prepared fast. I had the Walnut Shrimp. It was pretty good. I ordered fried rice.  The fried rice wasn't fried at all. Just basically dried up white rice with a lot of soy sauce. The rice was dark brown and pretty gross. I couldn't eat it and had to throw it away. 3 stars because the Walnut shrimp was ok.
