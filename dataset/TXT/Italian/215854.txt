RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ We came here for the quality food and great view. And they delivered on both fronts. It was a little exciting drive up the hill getting there, but it was easy to find. Once there with our reservation, we were saddened to see our table was not next to the window, but we nevertheless had a great view. We had the duck ravioli, seared scallops, pork tenderloin, and blue cheese risotto. Oddly the risotto had previously unmentioned mushrooms and didn't taste like blue cheese. Overall, the food didn't disappoint and the portions were more generous than we're accustomed to for this kind of restaurant. Staff was friendly without issue. We would definitely come again for another special occasion.
