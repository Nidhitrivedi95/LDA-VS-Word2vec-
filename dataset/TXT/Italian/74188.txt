cpkBJhBujpBFZ0rOItE-4g We had dinner at Trattoria D'Amico last night and had a wonderful meal. The food was excellent and the staff was knowledgeable and charming. From one local business owner to another we can really appreciate the attentiveness to detail and care that is put not only into each plate but the entire dining experience. A true gem in Ahwatukee!
