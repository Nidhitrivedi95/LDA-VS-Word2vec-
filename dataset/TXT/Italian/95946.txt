eQCYur0033RkZdh5VjbF8A Even though Oliver and Bonacini is a chain, I really enjoy their brunch.  Keep in mind that these are the same owners of Auberege Du Pommier, Canoe and Luma.   It is on the high end for price but the quality and care that goes into each dish separates it clearly from its counterparts.  Waffles are not just waffles and crepes are not just crepes.
