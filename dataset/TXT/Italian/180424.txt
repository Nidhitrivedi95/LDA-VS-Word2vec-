nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Food is so good, and the prices are reasonable...same prices as Italian chains. Service was excellent. My husband had the chicken parm and it pretty much melted in my mouth. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I wish there were more options on the menu, and options for gluten free individuals (besides salad).
