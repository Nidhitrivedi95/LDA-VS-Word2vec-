Italian place in Griffintown. Its in the Alt Hotel, and while Griffintown is literally an area in transition, this place offers some nice scenery, atmosphere, and views if you can get a window seat. Great place for an after work drink, casual lunch or dinner, or heck just hanging out. Expansive menu and lots of drink selection. 

Sat here for drinks and first thing you notice is a ton of natural light everywhere due to the windows. Lots of contemporary and modern restaurant finishes with rustic elements. 

Menu has enough selection for mains and snacks though we just had wine. Was happy to be here and would like to come back for a proper meal.
