f_R4-FMtQ2Dj6m8LNuse1w My family has been going to this place since it first opened and we love it! It is not your authentic Italian feel, nor is it a nice quiet dinner. But it is good food and a friendly staff. 

The white pizza is amazing (sorry to the other reviewer that did not like it). A quick call on the way home from work will ensure it is ready for you when you arrive to take home. The staff is very friendly and quick to respond to any need you may have. 

Try the penne palermo. It is my standard if I am not in a pizza mood. The sausage and penne are topped with freshly cut mozzarella (delicious!)
