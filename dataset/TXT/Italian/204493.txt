qBXfNxSpo2_8cP_WHQRvOg I feel a little funny leaving a review for an Olive Garden. After all, it's a major chain and they are all pretty much the same. However, this location has provided me with some of my best experiences at an Olive Garden. The staff is always very friendly, the place is kept clean, and the service is prompt. 

About once a month we have a family dinner here. I always get either the Shrimp Alfredo or the Garlic Rosemary Chicken. After eating a ton of salad and some breadsticks I usually only can finish half of my entree. The good news is that I have leftovers and it always heats up nicely! One area of disappointment is their water and fountain drinks. They must not have a great filtration system because the water definitely doesn't taste good. The solution? Order alcohol.
