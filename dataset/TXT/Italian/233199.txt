Tn1KXPi4gtPrt6DyepUQzw The last few times I have order a pizza for delivery the pizza has not been done! The order is sent out like 6-7 minutes after ordered online. The toppings and cheese is melted but the dough under is not done AT ALL! I understand fast delivery but I want my pizza cooked and well done!
