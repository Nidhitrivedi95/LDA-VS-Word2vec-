tuR2vl6WMAL6tzJvt2Tqdw Hi. Meet the best pizza in Canada:

Next time you're in Montreal, get to know it. Amelios has been around a long time because they serve really, really, really good pizza (and pastas and subs).  It's the kind of pizza you eat hot and fresh for dinner, and then wake up the next day to eat a nice cold slice in the morning...you know what I'm talking about it.  Dreamy sauce, old-fashioned crust, and traditional toppings.

Worth the wait?

Oh, I KNOW it is.
