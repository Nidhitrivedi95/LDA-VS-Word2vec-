pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw The pizza is simply amazing which I give 5 stars.  Everything else about Pizzeria Bianco is 3 stars.
Expect to wait and then wait some more for a table.  The neighboring Bianco-bar...or whatever it's called will help passing the time, but if you are a fan of beer, there isn't much to get excited about.  
If you love pizza, you need to go.  If you've never been, you need to go at least once....just don't go hungry because by the time you get a table and start eating, you might pass out of starvation.
