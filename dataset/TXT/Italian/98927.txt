EXt8OOwNE2CjoShPgLNdlg We came in with a Groupon and sadly were told that even though the fine print had no exclusions, we could only order a pizza.  I was hoping to order a pizza and a calzone or hoagie and pay the difference.  But nope it was pizza only on weekends even though the place was empty and we were getting carryout. I did want want to argue with the abrupt person taking our order.
The pizza itself was quite good.  We ordered the pesto chicken. Without groupon I never would have known about this place which is quite close to Robinson Mall.  I no longer live in the Burg but come here often and would return .  But shucks, why wouldn't you let me get a calzone!  Incidently the 3 star rating is the average of 4 for the pizza and 2 for the service.  Never understand why a person in the restaurant business can't be pleasant and if you don't like Groupon then don't offer it.
