CPgyfcsyPegLha1ajaSRoA I'm afraid I agree with the reviews that this restaurant is all about quantity of portions rather the quality. All of the dishes our family ordered lacked any kind of distinctive flavor, but there was a lot of it. Potentially long waits, no reservations, cramped dining room, difficult parking.
