Seafood linguine for $18.95 - (3 large shrimp, 5 oysters, some small scallops and squid. Noodles were cooked perfectly which made it a bit chewy just the way I like them and sauce was very flavorful (4 stars)

Arugula salad with veal and mash potato for $16.95 - didn't like this all that much as the sauce for the veal was not really my taste. The dressing on the salad was good but overall I found this dish a complete rip-off. I went to a grocery later on and found a pack of arugula for $4. I know the restaurant needs to make money too but for $17 I was expecting much more (2 stars)

Asparagus cream soup $5.95 - this was the soup of the day and it was really tasty but nothing really worth noting (3 stars)

Meal also came with some bread and some kind of spread which I really can't describe the taste

Service was fairly good for one person serving the whole restaurant but the place isn't really that big with maybe around 15 tables or so. Lots of parking available.
