PJvuzeEyZLLqaX8NAw64cA Very disappointing. We ordered takeout for Valentine's Day to avoid crowds, but won't order from here again. The soup was the best part, them went downhill. I ordered veal parmigiana and it was the worst I've had. Drenched in sauce and cutlets were overlooked with coating almost burnt. When I went to eat leftovers the second night, I ended up discarding most of it. My wife had linguini with marinara and hot sausage. Linguini was overlooked and sausage was bland.
