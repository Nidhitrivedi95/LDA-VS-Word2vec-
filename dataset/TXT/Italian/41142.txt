7JWWeXqil03Ua_wV9KN8ZQ For being one of only a few restaurants at Lake La Vegas Village, it's not a bad choice. The service we had was pretty good at the beginning, and then rushed and annoyed at the end. After we got our food, the waiter didn't look at us once. Still, the handmade pasta was fresh and tasty. Cream sauces are heavy, so share unless you've got a big appetite! Salads were simple but fresh. Prices are a little high, but, again, there's not much choice here.
