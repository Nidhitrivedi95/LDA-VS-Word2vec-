NFHlMOEyVsbqY_VQNJFafQ Thought it was casual pizza place, turns out it's quite nice. Other than that I have nothing good to say about it. Pizza came wrong, got sent back, and when the right pizza came back it was mushy. Two of our 3 orders aside from the pizza were correct, food was just alright. Nothing spectacular. They offered us a free dessert because of their mistakes. We ordered the chocolate mousse which turns out to be a store bought chocolate coconut cake I believe. They said they would take off the two items they messed up on, and didn't, so we had to dispute that. Whoever says it's a 5 star must be a family member or a friend.
