dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA I want to warn you first that I normally DON'T LIKE PIZZA.
I'll eat pizza, but it's nothing I would normally go out and get.

With that said, after reading so many great reviews in the various newspapers about their Northwest location, I decided to try the new Southeast/Henderson area location that just opened.

I was pleasantly surprised.  This isn't your normal pizzeria.  It's sort of laid out like a Subway sandwich shop, where the ingrediants are displayed directly in front of you and you choose what you want on it.  All of the ingredients are fresh.  The pizza dough hand crafted right in front of you as well.  After topping off, it's cooked for 90 seconds in a 900 degree oven, then topped off again with stuff (like Arugula) that shouldn't be heated.

I had the Bianco.  Very good.  I'm kind of in the mood for another one right now... even though it's PIZZA!
