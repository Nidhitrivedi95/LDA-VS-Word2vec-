LMdUoR00jPxQDWLYRq93FA Absolutely delicious and artfully served gourmet menu! We reserved the brick oven private dining and enjoyed the chef's gourmet menu with wine pairings! The ingredients are all locally grown and harvested and the meats are produced locally too. Chef Dustin has been trained well in Tuscany and creates some beautiful and tasty delights! Well worth the money!
