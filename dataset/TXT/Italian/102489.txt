Bread and Sun dried tomato oil - you have to ask for this! It was a pretty good sour dough bread. If you want butter, it's available by request. 

Cheese pizza - it was decent, I've had better. The sauce was a bit much. It also came with a pesto swirl on it. 

Fettuccini Alfredo - good sauce, but on the watery side. I asked for no parm on top and a side of mozzarella. I got a huge bowl full of mozzarella. That was pretty good.
