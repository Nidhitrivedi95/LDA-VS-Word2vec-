My Experience:  
By far, my favourite pizza spot in the GTA. I typically get the Special Pizza, and sub out the onions and green peppers for other toppings (yes, you can do that). The crust is neither too thick nor too thin, but the sauce is layered with a ton of toppings and some top notch cheese. Thanks to the great amount of toppings, every bite is filled with flavour. Abruzzo shines in their ability to give a good amount of toppings. 

The chicken wings are my next favourite thing. Great size, fried perfectly and the right sauce. Matches up perfectly with the pizza.

The pasta dishes are good, but nothing too special. Personally I come for the pizza and wings, and do without the pasta dishes. 

Service is friendly and take out is quick. Best pizza in GTA hands down.
