Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA Just relocating from the Seattle WA area back to the valley I have been missing the trendy retro places that are not over priced with good food. And I scored with this one! Excellent job with decor and coziness. Outdoor eating is an option with warmers when it gets chilly. 

Had the pizza with artichoke and also the pizza with pepperoni. The kids loved the pepperoni it had a great flavor. The Brussels sprout pizza was great but you really need to like the flavor of Brussels sprouts...which I do, so marvelous! Another great touch when the kids asked for Parmesan cheese they brought out fresh Parmesan and grated it over the pizza. So yummy!

The servers were very attentive and worked well as a team. My glass or my kids glasses were never empty. So well that I was not sure who exactly was my assigned server. I loved that!
