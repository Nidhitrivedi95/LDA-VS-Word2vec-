QReGruZEFxovIm9FJVa1kw Well, the secret is out. The jig is up. 

Last night, we went to Zio and had a near 45 minute wait. While that isnt crazy, this used to be a place where you were almost assured a short wait for very good food. I am definitely happy for their success but miss when it felt like only a few people knew about it! 

As far as the food, we both had pizza. The pizza, of course, was excellent. It's the best pizza in Charlotte!
