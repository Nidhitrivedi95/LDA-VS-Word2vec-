LshaX0O-8opp655146mrpQ By far my favourite restaurant! 
The staff is very pleasant (Louis especially) The food is always so full of flavour and the portions are always large! The Antipasti for two with calamari, bruschetta and sausage is dynamite and every table d'hôte item I have tried I have loved! 

Loyal customer for the past 11 years! 
We came across this gem after a cold night of sledding up north, all other restaurants had closed but they welcomed us quickly with hot chocolate and delicious meals! 

Thank you! 
(Can be loud at times as they being in numerous groups however it's definitely worth it)
