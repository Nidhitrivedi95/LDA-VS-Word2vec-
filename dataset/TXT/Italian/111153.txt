g-nzfTvso3-4c4gkhkmGbQ I dont even know where to start. I went on a Wednesday night and it was packed. The waiting area was pleasant and I can see why kids like to come here (cheesy decorations and areas for picture taking). 
I heard this place was managed by Italians and it's true Italian cooking in a buffet style..... I don't think so! It was the worst food I've had in a long time. 

From the time I put the pasta on my plate and sat down, the food was COLD (didn't sit far from the buffet mind you). The flavor was bland and the pasta all stuck together into clumps (the ravioli, shells, spaghetti). The only thing that was close to decent were the rice balls and potato wedges. 

The pizza was too doughy (looked almost raw in some areas) and there weren't any Italian seasonings! I'm not Italian, but I've had Italian in Italy and THIS my fellow yelpers is not Italian. 

We were disappointed in the quality of the food mostly. The ambiance is cute and cheesy and the service was pretty good. Our waiter was very attentive. But if I'm going to pay that much for food I'd love to leave the place full, not hungry.
