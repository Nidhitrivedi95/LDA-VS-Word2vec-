tUjyGFSN8wQqLgKp5Q0CUA I can see the potential, but would be hard pressed to want to return. Had the tasting Bianca menu and it was pretty uninspiring. Nothing stood out, but could see some originality in a few dishes. The fired polenta with the charcuterie was nice, but too much butter and the pickles were too salty. The salt came back in force with the mushroom course. The best course we're the pastas: gnocchi and rigatoni. The meats (duck and sardine) were good but nothing more than ordinary. The biggest disappointment was the service. Three bottles of wine and I think we had our glasses filled twice. OK at The Olive Garden, not so much when you get a bill for $427 for two. Also the waitress never considered an accommodation on adjusting the beverage pairing  or the "revisiting" course to our taste. As for the pairing, a simple adjustment to tilt to white from red would have been appreciated. Not necessary, but a reasonable expectation based on the price. My recommendation would be to drop the tasting menu. Focus on what you do well, pasta and a few key items, and train up st staff a bit more for this calibre of the restaurant. The young man who brought the courses was very well informed and excellent. The young lady who seated us and offered a the 'revisit' was less so. The revisit being the same course you already had and liked, you can have it again (as long as it's not the gnocchi or sardines). But they won't exchange it for a drink if you didn't enjoy the previous courses.
