XD0LjNuPPwJPsTAHecUh7A Came here yesterday for my cousin's 29th birthday. They actually handled the 16 of us really well. I think Terroni's does big parties well, as there was numerous large parties around us. 
We were seated at 2 long table beside each other. Hard for talking to everyone but obvioulsy better for space. I love round tables for groups but 16 is a big one!
I warned the ppl that haven't been there that they don't make substitutions (esp dressing on the side for salads) but the waitress showed us the salads they actually do put the dressing on the side. I couldn't stay the whole night so I had 1 bellini, 2 glases of white wine and the Ricchia Salad (arugola, fresh mushrooms, parmigiano reggiano shavings, lemon $9.95). 
There is parking right across the street which was $4 maximum on Sats (great!)
I've been here 4 times now and I have yet to see it not busy. One of my offices are right beside it and I'm here Thursdays so I am making it my goal to come Thurs post-work for drinks/dindin!
Def try this place if you're debating it!
