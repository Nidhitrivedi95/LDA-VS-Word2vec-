aYKicBsSzLKr76_bvsURZA what kind of place doesn't have their phone number anywhere on the internet months after being open???? Walked in for dinner in early January and wasn't overly impressed. Maybe they were still learning how to use the wood burning oven? Ordered margharita for my child and quattro stagionni for myself; I know it's supposed to be thin crust, but the pizza crust was SO thin that it was burnt yet soggy at the same time.Plus, the Hostess wore so much perfume that i couldn't even smell the pizzas, and the place was so cold that we had to wear our coats while eating! But the pastas look tasty and I promised my child we'd go back to try their dessert pizzas.... now i can't find a phone number anywhere to make a reservation!!!  come on guys, i'm dying for a great pizza place in the 'hood but so far you aren't it.
