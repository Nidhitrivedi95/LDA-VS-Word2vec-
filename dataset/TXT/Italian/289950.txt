zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA This has to be one of my very favorite spots.
Their cream of mushroom soup is excellent. In fact I once began craving it in Glendale and drove all the way out just for that. 
Their bartender is knowledgeable and is happy to help you pick out something you'd like. (Also, let you try and write down the names) 
The waitstaff has always left something to be left desired and the place is always packed. I'm not a big fan of their bread. 
However, their from scratch pastas and ravioli is all I've ever ordered outside of the mushroom soup & wine. Which, I must say is amazing. 
I highly recommend to anyone.
