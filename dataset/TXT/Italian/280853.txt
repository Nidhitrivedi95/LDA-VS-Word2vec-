I ordered a primavera pasta with seasonal vegetables (spinach, artichoke hearts, broccoli etc), and I cannot express how good the sauce was. It was a lemon cream sauce but it wasn't heavy, just light and tangy and acidic and the best. For the quality of the food, it was pretty inexpensive (although I'm from chicago where prices are outrageous). 

I am taking a star off for the decor and the Caesar salad, which was authentic with the egg and anchovy, but overdressed in my opinion. It also had this dark mystery dressing in addition to the traditional Caesar - we could not figure out what it was. All in all though this place was great and I would definitely come back the next time I'm in town.
