TIYnquDIPdYmVJK4GNeXSQ I've been here many times, but this is the 1st time I have ever gotten mediocre service.  The waiter was clearly loaded, but the greeting was half-hearted, the service more than extremely slow and I really could have ditched on the check if I wanted to because it took 10 minutes to get it after my hubby took the kids out to the van just so they don't disturb the other diners.  The food on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful.  They changed their belini tea which made me mad.  It's super sweet and don't taste like peach anymore.

This location changed a lot of things since last I was here.  They changed those comfy, arm-rest on wheels chairs for a more regular, wooden back, sans wheel type of chair.  The kids' menu also got a face lift.  They offer sides now that are slightly more nutritious.  My kids loved the grapes but they come in a dinky cup.  About the size that you would get a side of ketchup in.

All in all, it's still an Olive Garden with the same 'ol menu and drink selection.
