Being staying in Cosmo gives us easy access to this place. We're glad we did pay a visit! We had an early dinner so we were able to sit without having a reservation during a holiday long weekend. 

Their PRIME BEEF CARPACCIO* was mind-blowing! The best I've ever had! The beef was sliced so thin and it's so tender! It's cooked just right! When it's put together with the greens and cheese,, that's what you came to Vegas for! We really wanted to get a second order of this but we were too full after finishing all dishes! 

I didn't know broccoli can taste so good until I had GNOCCHETTI SARDI.... The way they did it made it such a good combination of broccoli and pasta! Best pasta ever! Very tasty, creamy but not greasy or tasting too heavy! 

Their STRAWBERRY SOUFFLE was another sweet surprise! We were a bit hesitated about getting this one as we thought it's some gelato on it. But we didn't regret after we got it! It's not too sweet but just the right amount of sweetness. The souffle is so soft and puffy. Love it! Will definitely go back again next time we in Vegas!
