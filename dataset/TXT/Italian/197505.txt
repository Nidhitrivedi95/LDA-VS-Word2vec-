Pr1ZfdThbeJolnTGfbrpmQ Updated from my previous review. I agree with the other groupon visitors. Wednesday night during Spring training and place was empty. One person working besides the kitchen. This place still had a Christmas tree in the middle of the restaurant. The food is subpar. It appears the owner has given up on this place, avoid going here.
