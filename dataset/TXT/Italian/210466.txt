qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ My husband and I just moved to Gilbert from Massachusetts. We visited this restaurant after reading rave reviews on Yelp and our expectations were still exceeded. Right through the door we were greeted by Tony and Noah as they identified us as "first timers." As such, we received free garlic knots that were enough to bring me back. We ordered what Tony recommended - half white pizza with spinach and sausage, half red deluxe. There was a minor mishap with our order but they immediately rectified it - and some. I can't wait for their new, larger location across the street (with beer and wine!). Tony and his crew made us feel at home in our new town and we can't wait to come back every Friday night for our "pizza night."
