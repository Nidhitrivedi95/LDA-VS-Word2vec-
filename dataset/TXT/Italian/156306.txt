L6ZPG8lO1tMGmHimSjuEMg Great Noodles!!!!

The Italian noodles are pretty good (except for the ravioli and they are NEARLY exceptional).... the Asian noodles; however, are the best thing on the menu! Yakisoba with pork was flavorful, pork was tender, and made with fresh ingredients.... The meatballs are on the cusp of good (too much pepper (and I enjoy spices quite a bit)).... The gyoza would be excellent if not for the dipping sauce (WAY TOO SALTY (and I love love salt))....

Solid choice, staff is pleasant and helpful. Parking might be an issue but we walked so I can not comment further. A whisker loud inside but lively and a great casual dining spot!
