1VDP92FU2p8AqJw9vU11sw The food was so great, I went back and ordered it again the next day.  Brought my dog with me both days.  They truly are dog friendly.  A special menu just for your dog is on the back of the menu.  

Just one suggestion, if they are reading this.  Corn is in the dog stew, and this item is not healthy for dogs...might want to consider removing this one ingredient.  

I will be back.
