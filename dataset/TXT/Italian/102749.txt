FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw What a difference a visit makes! 
I have been to TOCA once before and had some concerns. However as I have said before, it's not whether a restaurant will ever have a bad day, (because sometimes that kind of day is just out of their control), but rather how they address those concerns. 

In TOCA's case, the management heard and responded to my concerns and addressed them head on. My second visit was superb and there are many reasons for that. However here is what you need to know to have a wonderful experience at TOCA. 

If you haven't been there, and you are in the area, walk in and ask to have a look at the seating options. There is an area with lots of daylight which is basically on the outside the restaurant. Inside, while there is less daylight, the seating options are much greater. The lighting is softer, there are tables as well as round benches and there is a private room for power lunches. The benches ate great for intimate dining. 

Although I wish that's restaurants published a seating chart so you get a feel for the seating options, the next best thing is for you to ask to see what they options are once your there or to was reviews like this one that describe the seating. 

Yes, the meal at TOCA is not inexpensive, however the prices are fair for the location, quality of the food and the professional service. 

The Zuppa Crema (butternut squash soup) was excellent and the Branzino was tender and flavorful. Served warm with some greens. And the expresso macchiato was properly served in an espresso cup. Service by Stephanie was very pleasant and professional and we never felt rushed. I do believe my faith is once again restored in a world class brand in the Ritz Carleton and TOCA. 

If you like cheese, they have a cheese cellar and they will gladly give you a tour. The wine selection is also extensive. And they will subsidize your parking at the Ritz for 50% of the total. 

Well (re) done.
