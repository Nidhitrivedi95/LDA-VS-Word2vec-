DZwXQUa5KGUcJ0y4TO1pFQ I went back to see about the dine-in service questions I had from my first visit and to try something that had more range for rating than wings.

This time I walked in, saw the same sign to seat yourself, so I did. Almost immediately a the server came over and asked what I would like to drink. When she returned with the drink she took my food order. I ordered lasagna.

The lasagna is served in a soup bowl, a square of lasagna in the middle and covered with marinara sauce, with mozzarella cheese. The sauce was alright, a little on the sweet side, but tasty. The lasagna was nothing fancy, no ricotta cheese, just lasagna noodles, sauce and a little mozzarella on top. It was served with two pieces of garlic bread.

As I said in my previous review, the lasagna, bread and soda was one of the lunch specials, so it was $6.99.

Was it good lasagna, no not really. Was it worth the $6.99 price, definitely. You get a bowl of marinara sauce with pasta in it, some cheese on it, two pieces of bread and a soda. It was a filling lunch for $6.99.

I will probably go there often when in the area, I liked the lasagna, and the wings from my last visit. Maybe I'll work my way through their lunch special menu, there are 15 items to choose from.
