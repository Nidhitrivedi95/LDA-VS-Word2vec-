sbm0jmhWui8YrvFgxnJ4kQ We recently stopped into Glass Nickel after a night out at around 12:30am. We asked to see a menu and were told that they wouldn't take our order because they had received too many online orders. We asked again if there was any way we could just order one pizza. The answer was no. We took our business elsewhere and will do so from now on.
