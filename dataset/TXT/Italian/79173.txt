Their beautiful scenery could only be topped off by the wonderful food & excellent service. The steak, pasta and appetizers were superb.  Their deserts-just heavenly! 
Mr Marquez, Ernest, & Eddie @ the bar & rest of the staff are a fine example of what great customer service is about making it the finest dining experience.  Definitely looking forward to my next visit.
