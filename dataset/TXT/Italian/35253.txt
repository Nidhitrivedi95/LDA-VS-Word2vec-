6jDD-Z8QcsKTdIDWwM8gog We went here for lunch today.  This place is awesome! We were greeted by friendly staff as soon as we entered.  We were promptly seated and given the drink selection.  We ordered Calamari as an appetizer.  It was perfect and served in an attractive serving platter with slightly spicy marinara.  MMMM.  I had the calzone with spinach and garlic.  It was the best calzone I have had.  The spinach and garlic were perfectly done and the outside was crispy.  She ordered the Italian sub.  She was quiet the entire time she was eating which is a rarity .  All in all this was a top shelf dining experience and a place I will definitely be back to.
