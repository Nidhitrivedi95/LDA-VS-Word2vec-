nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ First time here and had a wonderful experience. We sat at the bar and Bethany was our bartender. Service was spot on. We started with a couple glasses of red wine recommended by Bethany. They were exactly what we were looking for.
We only wanted an appetizer to share and Bethany recommended the meatballs. This was a good choice as the meat was flavorful and the pomodoro sauce was divine.
At 7pm the live music started and it was a great touch. Hi quality lounge music I would call it. 
Great food, great service, great atmosphere.
We'll be back soon!
