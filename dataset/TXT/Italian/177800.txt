NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA I've visited Proper yesterday with a large work group. My overall experience was A-Ok.  The special sauce of this restaurant is obviously its pizza. Not the biggest fan of pizza and wasn't in the mood for it. Instead, I chose to order one of their pasta dishes (Gamberetto). So felt like I played in part in not getting the best experience. I wasn't impressed by the Gamberetto dish. The flavors that I thought would be jumping out of it fell completely flat. The jumbo shrimp were overcooked and chewy. I could barely discern the flavor of garlic. The veggies (asparagus and spinach) were overcooked. I had to salt my dish a few times, something that I very rarely do.

I was kind of surprised by all of this because the apps we ordered were more solid. The prosciutto wrapped shrimp on top of wilted spinach was very flavorful as was the broth that came with the beer mussels.

I have to say that our server was on top of his game and made the night enjoyable. When he walked over to take our order, I could see a look of confusion on his face because we had not received any menus when we were seated by the hostess. He took care of that like stat! We were almost 10 in our group and while she gave us all dinner menus, she only left two drink menus, but our server quickly took care of that as well. He made the evening run smoothly. And for that reason, I will try Proper again, but ordering pizza next time!
