Egd-0nDgzZGEVA0R09yyUQ I have been eating here for years.  I drive 20 minutes to get here each time and it is always worth it.  

I love the homemade Italian salad dressing, the fresh baked bread, the eggplant parmesan, and the chicken fettuccine alfredo (minus the mushrooms, gross).  My husband loves the BBQ chicken pizza and the chicken parmesan and he is super hard to please when it comes to red sauce that isn't his Mom's.  

They always have a great selection of desserts, which are made locally (although I don't know where), but generally I am too full by that point to even consider dessert.  

All in all, great place, great staff, great food, worth the drive every time!
