ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw Horrible experience. Having tried some of the other Little Italy restaurants, I figured I'd come here for some cheap pizza and italian appetizers. Walked out angry...

Let me start out by saying that it's clear this place's specialty is pizza, and that's really what we wanted. Maybe it's a unspoken rule that you must order to-go and call ahead for the pizza, but that's definitely a well kept secret. So when we sat down to order pizza, she told us that "it would take too long" and asked us to order something

Atmosphere: Not wanting to take out (only can afford / make it to Little Italy so often) we wanted to sit down in the dining room. We got lucky, because there's normally a long line down a crowded hallway, but they were able to sit us right down. Unfortunately they then sat down a table with numerous children pretty much right next to us, making enjoying the dinner hard. 

Food: Tasted like frozen food heated up. No non-red sauces for pasta. Pasta was watery. Bread was cold (?)

Not so good.

UPDATE
============
I finally got Mama Santa's pizza and I'm definitely feeling the place much more then I was after eating in. Delicious crust, a lot of cheese and pretty good sauce. Large Cheese = $6. 

Still, it's clear that this is a cheap option. Toppings are sparse when you add them and the sausage didn't taste great. Just get the cheese and deal with the fact that this place isn't anywhere as nice as the other places in Little Italy. Don't go  for eat in.
