YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ Mac Shack isn't a computer store, it's a cafeteria-style restaurant that serves pasta dishes and soups. I had the "Philly Cheese Steak Mac" ($10/$13) and pureed corn chowder ($4). Total bill came to $40 for two large pasta dishes, two soups, and two large soft drinks. The soup was out of this world, maybe consider serving this or other soups cold (as I write this it's 110 F degrees in Las Vegas). The mac and cheese was well seasoned, the amount of beef was underwhelming. 

Although the atmosphere is light and airy, we were beset by houseflies, having to swat them away the entire time. I've lived in Las Vegas for three years and I've never seen a housefly here, anywhere. I swear this place had flies like the outhouse at Grandpa's farm. What this tells me is that 1) there is a sourcepile of nourishment for them that 2) doesn't get cleaned up. According to the signage your restaurant is sustainable! natural! etc. etc. so maybe a couple of Venus fly trap plants would be in order.
