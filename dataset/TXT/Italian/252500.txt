VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w we went to the restaurant and the club, so i'll review both. 

love, love, LOVED the restaurant!! i was a little nervous after reading all the reviews but we were so happy with everything. the decor is stunning. i went with a party of 4 girls and it was fantastic. we had reservations at 8, and they kept us waiting at the bar until 8:40 or so, so we got a free round of drinks - we'll take it. got sat and ordered a pretty cheap bottle of wine (for vegas especially). delicious garlic bread!! i ordered the tuna tartar - AMAZING!!! it had tuna and avocado with an amazing cilantro lime sauce. so refreshing and delish. then me and my friend split the salmon - herb crusted with some sort of zucchini salad. so yummy. my friends enjoyed their meals too - one ordered penne vodka and the other ordered... um... well i had a bottle of wine so i forgot. so yummy. 

they came around and stamped our wrists and then we went outside to go upstairs. there was a long line but i guess we said the magic words because we were let into the club first. we could sit anywhere until that table was claimed, so we camped out at a sweet table for 2 hours til we decided to leave. the club became super packed and played pretty good music. i wasn't blown away by the club, but i think that had to with my company and not the club itself. loved the bathrooms. and loved the decor! 4 stars for you, lavo. i will definitely come back for that tartar.
