k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw Excellent food.  The service was a bit odd on the night we went.  We had reservations and they were late in the evening.  We were greeted with warnings from the staff that the kitchen was slow.  Seems that a lot of their kitchen staff had recently walked out do to a request for higher pay after being on one of the TV shows. The meals we ordered were fantastic so they must still have some of the good staff. 

It was a bit pricey for my tastes and we were scoping them out as a possible after weeding meal place.  We may go back for that meal as they did give us a buy one get one coupon.  

If you don't mind paying a bit more, I would truly recommend their food and ambiance.  Hopefully they will have worked out the kitchen staffs attitude and patron's won't be required to wait so long.
