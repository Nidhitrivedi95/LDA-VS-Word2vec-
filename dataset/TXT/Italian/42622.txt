7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg This is probably the best Italian food I've had outside of Italy.  Growing up in an Italian family, I have unreasonably high standards and expectations for Italian cuisine, so I usually just avoid Italian restaurants altogether because it rarely measures up and I usually leave full but disappointed.  But the food at Bruno's was a delightful surprise.

It's as authentic as it gets. Everything, down to the pasta is homemade. The flavors are robust and the portions will satisfy even the biggest Sicilian appetite.  I had the lasagna and my girlfriend had manicotti.  The ricotta filling was creamy and savory. The sauce is just perfect: not too thin, not too thick; not too sweet, not too bland.  Beautifully seasoned.  We also had a very nice Chianti recommended by our server.

We had to have a little patience with the service but the place was very busy so that was fine. All in all, they took good care of us. You can't do better for Italian food in Cleveland.
