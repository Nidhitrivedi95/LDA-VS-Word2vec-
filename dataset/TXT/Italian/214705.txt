rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg First timer at San Gennaro Feast. I decided on carne asada-dog and horchata. They had Italian food made in big pans, everything Italian, but it was cold (my friend ordered pasta). They had the pans sitting over bricks but it seemed like the food was just sitting their throughout the day/night without anything below keeping it warm. I would have had the shrimp scampi pasta but after my friend said her pasta was cold, I decided to go with the asada-dog since they made it in front of you. Only thing was their horchata was nothing like horchata. Also, I would suggest bringing a bottle of water or drink if you don't want to pay $3 for a cup of water. I've been to festivals/feasts where they had a water refill station, at no cost (you just bring your own bottle). I think it's a little ridiculous to charge $3 for a cup of water. Carnival area was fun. Lines weren't long.
