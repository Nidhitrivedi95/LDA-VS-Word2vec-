qpBfYbkPmXIFWVQ7pLkQ_w Came in last night to have dinner with my sister and niece. We were originally sat at a table that was right were everyone walks by from waters to customers. Not a fan of the table. We sat there for close to ten minutes and no one i mean no one came by to say hi, drink nothing. I looked at every service that walked by and they walked by like we were not even there. Then comes Jackie, she asked if he had been helped yet i sad no and asked to speak with a manager. The manager came over we told her the problem I asked if we could be moved and she made it happen. Thankfully she moved us to Jackie's section.  It completely changed my mood.

The only reason they are getting 4 stars is because of this server. Jackie  was awesome, friendly and sweet. When i go back i will make sure she is working first. Thank you Jackie for turning my night around.
