GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q Excellent food and FANTASTIC service! We were visiting from out of town, 11 of us including 5 kids. They quickly put tables together and made us feel at home. The food arrived quickly, and everyone enjoyed it. We'd come here regularly if we lived here. Highly recommend it. Thank you, Casella's!!
