wQMw6kc24uUQqqUGxe3Ztg Guess this is a late review. 
Was here a couple times. One for a work brunch... it was good nothing spectacular.
And the other was a lunch date.
I didnt have much time so I had the cesar salad with chicken and my date and some meaty meal. He seemed to think it was ok. My salad overdosed with burnt garlic and dry chicken. I didnt eat much of it, thus I must have appeared to be those dainty date eaters (Im not). 
So that is why I have not been back here. Even though Im so close to this place. 
And the date - he turned out to be just as bad as the Salad. I should have been forewarned just by the salad alone.
