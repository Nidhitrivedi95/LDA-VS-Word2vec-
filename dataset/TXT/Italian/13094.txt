12P7GjIoq6oj7qCyJ_c0Ag "Hot and ready" is a joke, but even more so on busy days (football Sunday/probably weekends in general). Unprofessional staff that doesn't know how to monitor and call out orders correctly. We watched as people who came waaay after us get their large orders before we did. It was ridiculous since we ordered one thing. The young lady tried to lie saying she called my name, probably to cover herself up in front of her manager next to her. Funny thing is we never left the waiting area, and no name sounded anything close to mine. Only gave two stars because the pizza is good for the value.
