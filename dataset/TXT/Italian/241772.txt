The staff is all visible because the kitchen is at the front, so all their antics are on display. I actually had tip money thrown at me inadvertently, which was all part of the fun. 

The french cut pork chop was awesome, topped with caramelized onions. Grilled rapini was excellent, as was the shrimp with spicy pea puree. 

As a gluten intolerant person, my options were limited. I prefer their other restaurant, 5 Doors North.
