"That was our introduction to Crust Pizza & Wine Cafe. The wait staff was buzzing around. Constantly asking if you wanted something, or if you were done with that plate.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers, a salad and two glasses of wine. The food was excellent!"

I wrote those words about twenty months ago. It was through my own procrastination and laziness that I never finished my review  Not a lot has changed though in the interim. Just forty Yelp'ers reviews talking up the place and a even harder parking lot to navigate on a Friday night at 5:30. LOL

The place has a very New York feel to it and the pizza is very close to the real thing.   The only drawback was the over abundance of sauce, which made it sloppy. But the place has a good buzz to it. Things go smoothly and as I've noted the wait staff is on their game. It can be a very loud restaurant and depending on where you sit, you may not be able to hear your companion.

Tonight we tried the olives appetizer ($3.00), along with the white bean bruschetta ($5.00). Both were good. We agreed to order the twenty inch New York pie ($15.95) to eat and to bring some home. It was a good decision said our oldest!

The Kendall Jackson was a good choice and for $5.00 a glass an even better deal. A pint of their IPA was a steal at $3.00 and was a nice bitter. A Brit would be very happy here. Our bill came to $43.53 including taxes, but before gratuities.

Enjoy!
