PFt0wew2GqfPpesuUC9-cg Anyone that says "best burgers in town" has no concept of what a "best burger" should be, if it is the best burger in town shy away from Bridgeville.
Go ahead and let them cook it to shoe leather, I ordered med/rare and because the burger is so thick, and more likely the experience if the chef, I got a burger with 1/16" inch of sear and 1" of raw chuck two times until the third time when it was cooked to well done.  The patty is packed too tight to allow for proper cooking. The fries were adequate, nothing mind blowing.  My girlfriend ordered the skillet mac and cheese which seems to be the signature dish and perhaps Sauce should claim a little more "best mac n' cheese" and not so much "best burger".
Ambiance of a dive bar, under lit, clean, and the staff is accommodating and friendly.
