7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA We usually get pizza delivery, but tonight decided to dine-in at Pizza Heaven Bistro.  We were pleasantly surprised to have live music during our visit as well as an extremely attentive waiter.  Service was very quick and the owner even stopped by our table twice to see how we were doing.  The pizza was excellent as always, and my husband liked the wings so much that he ate the whole plateful by himself.  We finished off with the brownie ala mode, which was devoured in a short time.  Overall, the quick service, excellent staff, great food and affordable prices will bring us back again!
