FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A Perfection. From your Togo containers, to your lighting fixtures-- my husband and I are in love. The food selection for me, a vegetarian variation that eats fish, loved the "make your own" pasta with Alfredo, shrimp and broccoli. It was amazing. Your food runner looked like Puck from Glee, and I liked that too. The mother load of soda machines is there as well, offering a vast amount of drinks; my favorite- Cherry Vanilla Dr Pepper. So good! My husband and I will be back very shortly. I think maybe tonight. Mhmmmm
