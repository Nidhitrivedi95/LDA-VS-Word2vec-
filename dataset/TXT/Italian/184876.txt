OilKQPdBj3rD7eZDF5OENQ Impromptu lunch cravings sent us to Pizza Express at Stockbridge. At 1pm the place was moderately busy and we were greeted by a friendly and efficient waitress/front of house lady who sat us downstairs with a lovely view of the Water of Leith.
We were served by waiter Dawid a very polite and cool dude. 
Our order comprised: 
Calamari as a starter, a Calzone Classico, a Pizza La Reine (sic), a kinder/small Margherita and a Pizza Romana Basilicata.
My Calzone Classico was perfectly "formed" and its crunchy dough was delicious and properly baked. Its filling, even though tasty (with Coppa, Finnochiona, salami Milano, spinach & Milano cheese) was rather scarce as only occupied 50% of it being the rest just expensive "hot air".
My mates' pizzas were tempting and yummy but the pizza base was wafer (too) thin even for Neapolitan standards which mean that they got cold really fast if you don't take action "presto". 
Minor cons: a bit overpriced and there's room for improvement in the food department.
On the pro side: the good service & front of house, families and kids friendly, the flavoursome meal and the Pizza Express food consistency as you will get the same decent level of food and service irrespective of the branch that you're visiting.
I wouldn't mind to pay an extra visit in the future.
