6I27BTuHI5PMvOBG4WS8NQ Mercatto thrives in its atmosphere. The space is large and designed in such a way that you feel like you're close to fine dining, but without the snobbery. Clean, light colours and plenty of seating; upbeat music, but lingering at the perfect din to just enhance the vibrance of the room.

Service is top-notch. Our waiter Kevin was well-versed in the menu and had the perfect wine suggestion to match my meal. Fresh bread was never empty on our table, and my water glass was seemingly bottomless.

The food was tasty but this is where Terroni comes out on top, which is hard for me to say cause the service at Mercatto is so much better! My margherita pizza was nice but not amazing, and my friend's pasta was also good but not to-die-for. BUT WAIT, the tiramisu was decadent and the espresso worth two buzzed thumbs up. And dessert is most important anyway, Y/Y?
