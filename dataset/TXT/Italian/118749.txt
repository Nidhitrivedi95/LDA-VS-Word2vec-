GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ 5 stars only because it wasn't what I expected to get.  This joint looks like a food court joint next to the Venetian sport book and poker room.  We sat down just to try it.  The burgers were incredible.  Not as good a Bachi Burger, but way better than expected.  Medium rare is medium rare, not medium.
