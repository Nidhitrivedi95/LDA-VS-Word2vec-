Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA Was wondering....had passed by this location several times and thought I better try it....I did...and was PLEASANTLY surprised!  Got a slice of plain cheese...and it was FRIGGIN DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Best pizza I have had in ages....I'm from New York,..and I must say KUDOS to Joe's New York Pizza!  :)  !!!!  A little pricey... :(  ...but I will still be back ....because good pizza is hard to find in this city!!!  Especially when you are FROM Brooklyn!!!! :)  Thanks Joe's!  :)
