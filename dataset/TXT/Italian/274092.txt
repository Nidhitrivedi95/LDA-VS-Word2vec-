Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A This Buffet was recommended by a friend that said it was similar to the buffet at Cosmo. It was definitely not the same as Cosmo. However, it definitely surprised me. Service was really good. Each person ordered several drinks including wine! 

The Prime Rib was a juicy and obviously a good cut. We didn't go on seafood night, but they still offered crab legs, which were good too!
When we talked to the manager, we found out that they recently remodeled last year. So, that may explain why everything tastes good and the service is excellent. Hopefully, they can keep this up in the future.

One last note,  don't forget to use your players card to get a discount off your meal. when we went it was $13.99 for dinner!
