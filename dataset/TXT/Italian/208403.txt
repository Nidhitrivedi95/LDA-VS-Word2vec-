qpBfYbkPmXIFWVQ7pLkQ_w We visited on a busy dinner night with 9 people and were lucky enough to have made reservations. The waiter was friendly and helpful. After we ordered it took awhile to receive our food, but time passes fast when chatting. Everyone seemed satisfied except for those who ordered Alfredo dishes, which they sent back to have more added. Overall it was a typical olive garden experience with no major problems. I would visit again.
