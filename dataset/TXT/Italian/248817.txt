VfxlkvZQkLr9tu_w1SU_iw I ordered the chicken triple decker, cheese cake and a lemonade. This review would be 5 stars because the sandwich was great and so was the cheese. The few problems were that the bread was pretty burnt, and it wasn't cut so that made it a bit hard to eat, the lemonade was super sweet and It was a pretty long wait so I'll just order sooner next time but other then those things it was good.
