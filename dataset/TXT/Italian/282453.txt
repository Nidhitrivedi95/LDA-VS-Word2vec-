YzMUZjUMcgI-NSGu48-nIQ The food was average at best and the service was horrible. Our waiter acted like we were putting him out. He was very unpleasant even though our table of 6 had 2 bottles of wine and spent over $200. Unfortunately for us, this restaurant automatically adds a 20% gratuity for a six top which is ridiculous in and of itself, let alone the waiter did not deserve it. 

If you are looking for over-priced, so-so Italian food and rude wait staff, search no further.
