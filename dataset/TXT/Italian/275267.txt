yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg Went back to Grotto for the first time in many years.  I was a fan then, I still am.

The restaurant is loud.  It's crowded.  And the food is good.  We started with mussels portifino (a white wine and garlic broth).  I liked that the dish was available in two sizes, the small being perfect for an app for two.  A little more bread to soak up the broth would have been nice, though.

I also had a special of sea bass over ravioli topped with marinara.  I liked all the components except I never seem to learn I'm not so big on seafood with marinara.  The sea bass was a generous portion, and cooked perfectly, as was the ravioli.  I had a little bit of plate envy over my husband's halibut with a lemon butter sauce.  I had this dish the last time and loved it!

Service was average.  Our waiter was relatively attentive, but not really friendly.  He oddly never made eye contact (not sure if he was always looking at something/someone else or just weird) and he rattled off the specials way too quickly.   Certainly not bad enough to deter me from going again.  But someone remind me not to order seafood in red sauce!
