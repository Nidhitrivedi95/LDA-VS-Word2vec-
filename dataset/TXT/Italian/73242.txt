CKJnoUSWocdVIj6Fqbgm5g *I admit, I was invited to an event for their new pizza menu (not Yelp event), so if this review is against the policy, please let me know and I will remove it :)*
*I would have given this restaurant a 3/5 because the pizza was some-what decent, however I gave 2/5 because of the attitude and professionalism of the staffs.
*Staff talked behind my back (literally) for not finishing my pizza crust... 
*Refused to serve me food because it was only given to food bloggers, however on the invite it did not mention anything about that, and I am a food blogger... 
*Social media manager gave my friend an attitude because she was not a blogger. 

-"The Hangover Cure" pizza - Tomato, Olives, Soppressata, Double Smoked bacon, Fresh mozzarella, Grana Padano, Chillies, topped with fried eggs
The first one we got was the hangover cure pizza which I quite enjoyed, however it was extremely salty and there wasn't anything to cut down the salt level at all. Not sure if I would want something overly salted as my hangover food, but overall it was decent.

-Peking Duck Pizza - roasted duck breast, enoki & shitaki mushrooms, fresh mozzarella, hoisin drizzle w/green onions, crispy duck crackling: 
This was my favorite of the night. The moment it arrived, there was a strong aroma from the sweet and pungent hoisin sauce, and duck was moist and tender. It tasted just like a real Peking Duck but on a pizza instead of being wrapped in a thin pancake.

-Pork belly pizza - Slow roasted pork belly, roasted sweet balsamic onions, fresh mozzarella, balsamic tossed radicchio: 
The pizza was a bit too oily from the fatty and succulent pork bellies, however the balsamic onions and radicchio brought some tanginess and helped to cut some of that down.

-Prosciutto pizza - grilled artichoke pesto, fresh mozzarella, fired roasted sweet pepper & arugula: 
The prosciutto pizza had the potential to be good, however I was slightly let down by this. The prosciutto wasn't salty enough so the entire pizza tasted bland, maybe it would have been better if the prosciutto was slightly cooked to bring out more flavors. The sweet pepper was a bit ... too sweet and contrasted with the savory pesto sauce, not really a good combination.

-Smoked Chicken - tomato, mozzarella, caramelized onions, sweet peppers, chipotle BBQ sauce: 
I couldn't taste any "smokiness" from the chicken, however I thought it was pretty good and the chicken pieces were juicy. The sauce was a bit sweet but had a slight kick from the sweet peppers, I quite enjoyed it.

-Margherita pizza - tomato, basil, fresh mozzarella: 
The tomato sauce was tasteless and there were barely any cheese.... I thought nothing can go wrong with a classic and basic pizza right? Oh boy I was wrong.
