SN6mvy2vbXL0F_CYFkx8zg Reasonably priced off-the-strip family-owned Italian restaurant.  Its an old-fashioned cozy & quiet place with a small bar.  Dining room is romantically lit and divided from the bar by a wall rack of bottled wine.  Meals are home-made and prepared fresh to order.   We were offered & thoroughly enjoyed a red Malbec grape Argentinian wine with our meal.
We were in a large group so we got to sample most of the appetizers.  The stuffed mushrooms and the calamari were delicious.  I also liked the antipasta and mussels.  I had the raviolis. My friends really enjoyed the lasagna. The tiramisu was better than the Italian cheesecake.
Service was attentive and professional, so don't be afraid to bring a date or business guest.  You won't be disappointed and the pocketbook won't go broke.
The owner is from Argentina and is a jolly young man making the American dream come true by opening a restaurant in the USA in 2009 (circa).  Why Las Vegas?  Because he spent his honeymoon in Sin City and loved the town.  (I know this because he drove me back to my hotel in his own car! We were in a large group and he was concerned that we were waiting to long for a cab.  Who does that?!  Someone who really cares about his customers!) He got an extra star for the ride home.  Lol
