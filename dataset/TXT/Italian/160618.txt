liCPyfxs-CYXAV_zAmB9dw What a fun event!!!
Friendly bar staff, bottomless tequila and vodka cocktails and delicious risotto Parmesan cheese balls delish!
The 18tj century converted home has an exquisite view from the floor to ceiling windows in the bar. Heritage wood floors and mouldings create the old Toronto charm indicative of this neighbourhood. The Keg Mansion sits nestled across the street. 
Thank you so much for inviting us to such a fun event!!
