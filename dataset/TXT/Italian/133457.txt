Im0hMcWaqWIzuBM8xILDsA First timer recently at Trivs. The entertainment was on point with a guitar player. The wait staff was pleasant to look at just not pleasant to interact with. 
When you're going to charge me $28-$30 the expectation for quality is there. I paid Pomeroy prices and received TGIF's quality food.  I question what it considered fresh and would love to see what they keep frozen that's passed off as fresh.
I don't think I would be so disappointed if they were not trying to present themselves as a higher end establishment. 
Lastly, a couple things I noticed that didn't make sense. Try dusting the vent in the bathroom. No reason you should have dust caked up in that vent, doesn't anybody clean the bathroom notice that? Also, who advertises on a soap dispenser the contact info for the company that supplied the soap dispenser? Bars in Lakewood, that's who. Tacky for a place like this......
Lengthy and brutal but I had a high expectation when I walked in the door and was disappointed from first contact by the staff and lack of communication skills and friendliness....
