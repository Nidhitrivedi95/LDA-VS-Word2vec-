ewEDv_q-K0fV0FepkHB8sA Been going here for 12 years. Steak is great service friendly, can you please clean the men's room so it doesn't smell like urine? Every time I go here the smell of the men's room reeks of urine.. Funny thing is it's always been this way and I'm not really easily turned but for the $$$$ they charge and the great food I would think this is pure laziness..
