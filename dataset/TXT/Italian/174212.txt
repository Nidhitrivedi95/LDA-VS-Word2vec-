nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g I've been wanting to try this Toronto Institution ever since I first moved here and finally got my chance last night. My first biggest dilemna was the location, it was either Queen St. (the original) or Adelaide and ultimately I chose Adelaide given feedback about the building at this location. My choice was definately on the ball in this old courthouse that converted into a very spacious restaurant with a strong metropolitan vibe.

The service was standard and very down to earth. The food was amazing, my S/O both tried a pasta, the Spaghetti in Canna a Mare (seafood) and the Papperdelle al Sugo di Cinghiale (wild boar). The pasta is made fresh daily and cooked to perfection. Both dishes were spectacular and I would definitely recommend. We also tried their desserts, Tiramisu and the Panna Cotta. Both equally good I can't say it was the best I've ever had of either. Overall it was a relaxing dinner experience and the prices don't break the bank. I would be back for the pastas and maybe next time try their pizzas where I hear is the rave.

PS. They don't servce balsamic vineger as the waiter explained to me the olive oil is specially made and adding any vineger would ruin the taste. I can honestly say the olive oil is different but i'm for one who still enjoys good balsamic with my olive oil.
