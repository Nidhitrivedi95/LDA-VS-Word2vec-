fhx1yUZlC1QwovIjdYeGiw I was so disappointed with our experience with Tavolo. We went into the city for a concert labor day weekend and knowing it would be busy I made a reservation at Tavolo for an hour before the concert. The spectrum center is right there and the headliner would go on later so I thought we had plenty of time. Boy was I wrong.

We showed up 15 minutes early for our reservation to a sign stating the bartender was seating people. So we queued up after a couple people and waited and then waited some more. Politely told the growing number of people behind us that yes we were in line. The line was at least twenty people all the way back to the door by the time the bartender pointed us to a table that had been open the whole time everyone was waiting.

We sat down and made our dinner choices and decided to skip the appetizers since we were sat late and the restaurant looked busy. We sat at our table a full 20 minutes after our reservation time before a waiter came to give us water. We had talked about going somewhere else during all the free time we had but being a holiday and a Sunday there weren't many options. Which was the reason I made reservations. None of the tables around us had food in the 35 minutes we had been in the restaurant. While I am glad the waiter was honest about it he said he couldn't get us out in the remaining 40 minutes we had. At that point we left and frantically ran around the city trying to find quick food. 

I have never seen such a disorganized restaurant and I doubt we will ever return.
