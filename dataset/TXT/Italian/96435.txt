eRjcli4nDHRwhByViUz9Ow The last time I got pizza to go from Rosoti's a few years ago I thought it was pretty good. This time we dined in for happy hour and I was very disappointed. I had received a flyer about their happy 10" pizza for $6. The server didn't know about that special and apparently the manager didn't either because he made her show him the flyer I brought with me. We ordered onion rings, a fried dough appetizer served with marinara, and the pizza. The onion rings were great. The fried dough appetizer was terrible.  We were expecting something similar to garlic knots. That's how they were described on the menu. We each ate only one and they had given us a huge serving. When it came time to leave we asked for a box for the pizza. The server asked if we wanted to take the dough things and I told her we didn't like them at all. I'm pretty sure she tried to get the manager to take them off the check. They weren't and we paid for them. I won't be back. And being in the restaurant business myself I can tell you a $4.50 item on the check is not worth losing someone as a customer. It looks like a lot of people feel the same way because we only saw one other person in the restaurant while we were there. Also the restaurant was freezing and smelled strongly of cleaning chemicals. Not a good dining experience and I don't recommend their pizza.
