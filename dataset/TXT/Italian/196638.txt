pOhX1XjbBdPoO2Fyy8RGJg Came to Cleveland via a road trip from California,  decided on a pizza. Took a moment on yelp to read reviews and this is the place to eat. Our server was extremely nice as was everyone who we were in contact with, and the pizza was exceptional! I normally don't review but I thought this little pizza place deserved it.
