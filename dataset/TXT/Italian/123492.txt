hlSj3nHeSNHujnagbWXlhg The best thing I can say about this place is some of the decor is nice. I say some because for the price I shouldn't have to eat on a paper table cloth. The drink menu was terribly out dated but their food menu looked delicious. I ordered the shrimp capallini and my bff ordered the seafood primavera. The food was out within 10 minutes of ordering which made us immediately think the food wasn't fresh. The shrimp in both of our dishes were slightly rubbery and tasteless.  The crab in my bff's dinner was intolerably fishy and her veggies were not even close to being cooked! The waitress was rude and seemed bothered by any requests! Don't waste your money on this place!
