w2xwgqHM7dJlHfyu4ouhBg Azzip Pizza was running a promotion on Hooked last week for 50% off pizzas. I was pretty hungry after class that day so I decided to give it a try.

The line was nearly out of the door and it wasn't even 5pm yet, but seemed to be moving so I figured I'd wait it out.

I got to the front of the line and tried my best to recite a very specific order. I had a big zip which was half just red sauce and sausage, the other half was a chicken pesto with literally every topping.

Since I had two different meats, there was an upcharge and my 11'' pie still only came out to about $5.50, which was a pretty good deal, I'd say.

My more "traditional" red sauce and sausage half of the pizza wasn't bad. I thought it needed a little more sauce, and the sausage wasn't anything special but still alright. I feel like coming from the suburbs/Chicago my pizza standards may be a little high in general.

The other "everything" half was better, I'd say. The pesto sauce was pretty good and most of the toppings tasted fresh. The chicken was kind of buried but it seemed to be tender and blend well with the other toppings.

Overall it was great for $5.50 and definitely a unique concept as far as the build-your-own pizza goes, but I think I'd prefer a more traditional style pizza place if I had to pay full price at Azzip.
