The pasta is freshly made ... and you can tell. Excellent quality. We also got a couple of appetizers.  The tomato with burrata was amazing. Also, had the meatballs in a marinara sauce. It too was really good. 

We shared a pizza too which had such quality ingredients and a fantastic taste. 

The meal was finished with a canoli.  

I'm from Chicago. My mother is Sicilian.  I feel confident that I know great Italian food and this is it.

Nothing pretentious,  very casual and neighborhoody.  Fabio himself is making pizzas and greeting customers with his broad grin and wonderfully inviting Italian accent. 

This is what dining out should be. Quality, fresh, reasonably priced and so welcoming.
