With an eclectic bistro menu downstairs and traditional chop house upstairs it has something for everyone. I had the grilled Mahi with quinoa, but also had tastes of the stroganoff made with fillet, the chicken parm and the gyro cheesesteak. It was all amazing. With some of Caesar's Palace's and Las Vegas' top restauranteurs, this place has all the makings of a home run. The    level of detail in the decor, food quality and bar offerings really is like no place I have ever been.
