nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A We were so excited about eating here, and the food was excellent.  I can't give it a higher rating because the service was absolutely terrible.  We were seated in about 10 minutes during lunch hour (1240ish).  We were seated at a table overlooking the strip (great) in the bar area (no problem).  The problem was that our waitress was the bartender, and despite only having one or two people at the bar the whole time we were there, it took ages to get anything done, including ordering drinks, our meal, dessert, etc.  It took almost 2 hours to have an app, a split meal, and a dessert.  The hardest working person in there was the busier, who was busting his butt the entire time!  He deserves a raise. :)
