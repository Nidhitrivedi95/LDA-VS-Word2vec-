JFNv5sKeKAf1ZVPnfbzpXw Ordered a lunch special.  2 slices and a soda.
Took 20 minutes to receive the absolute worst pizza I've ever had.  The cheese was either fake or really old and the sauce was really watery.  The place looked really nice but the food was terrible and took a really long time. 

Save your time and money and go somewhere else. 

Yuck.
