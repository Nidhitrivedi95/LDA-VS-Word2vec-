5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA We decided to have lunch here at the suggestion of a co-worker and to check out their banquet room (we are currently debating on a wedding venue and heard good things about their event services).  First of all, the bread with balsamic vinegar and oil is so delicious.  I could have eaten that alone as my entire meal and been satisfied!  I ordered the Ventano Tortellini and my fiance ordered the Fettuccine con Funghi.  The portions are huge and have that special homemade taste about them!  We definitely needed to go boxes.
Our server obliged us in showing us the banquet room and patio (where the ceremony would take place).  He answered all of our questions professionally and even had a packet put together with pricing etc.  He gave us the event coordinators information (we came in on a Saturday, so he was not there).
We are not sure if this is the place for our wedding, but we will certainly be back for the food!
