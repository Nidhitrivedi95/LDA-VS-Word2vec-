15YuEFO59yXd7BTO5NZgYw I love the margherita pizza here!! Right amount of sauce, chunks of mozzarella cheese, and big leaves of basil! Delicious, hot, perfect!!! They get their bread from the Breadsmith off Power and McDowell. Its great!!! They have great wine, pizza, drinks and desserts! Come check out this adorable place! There is a wait on the weekends so try and get in early on the weekdays!! Their cappuccinos are delicious with some decent tiramsu! Enjoy!!!

To bad they don't deliver!!!
