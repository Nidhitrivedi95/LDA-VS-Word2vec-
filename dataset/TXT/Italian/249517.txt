VjaHHmV-rSkFaOAnU3faxg I love their use of local ingredients.  They've got great staple 'za like tomato and Fat Uncle Tony, and interesting specialty pizzas.  In SP they are also expanding from pizzas- tacos look amazing!  Follow them on FB for pics of daily specials.  
A few notes: 
Pizza's only come in one size, 
the SP location is a bit small, so they do a lot of carry out- but 
we love that they deliver!  

I'm glad they are doing so well they were able to expand to a second location- but I hate that we have to share them!
