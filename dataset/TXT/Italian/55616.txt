aJK0MWXKgXIgQUCM9fqSJQ Pizza buffet!!

Since Pizza Hut buffet closed Ive been in search of a pizza buffet. This is a hidden gem by madhouse coffee. Its pretty large and has a great selection of food. My son and I opted for the lunch buffet its 6.49$ for adults and 2.49$ for children. If you want to add a soda its .99cents for kids and 1.89$ for adults unless you go during their "happy hour" which i already forgot what time it was haha. 

The place itself is pretty large, the tvs there are super old and placed in weird positions. Like next to the ceiling lol. Anywho on to the food.

The pizza here is meh, nothing spectacular. I liked the chicken they had, it was a nice change to just pizza and salad. They also have calzones, sandwiches, 2 different types of breads, soups, and an AMAZING selection of items on the salad bar. My def fave was the garlic knots and the salad bar. Ahhhh the knots were soooo sinful! I kept wanting more, but it all goes to my belly so I had to restrain myself. The salad bar is also delish, I love the romaine salad they offer, and I like that they allow you to put your own dressing and items on. Cicis better recogniiiiize! Haha. The sandwich was ok, dry so you need to put mayo or whatever on it. They also have desserts that werent too bad. I like how they have hot sauce for the chicken, a def plus!!

Grazianos also offers an arcade area for the kids, its pretty rad! They have a ton of games that all take tokens and once youre done you can cash in your tickets for prizes. The guy working there is seriously THE BEST CASHIER EVAR! Hes a sweet dude who actually converses with you. 

Another plus is that they always have a check in special on the Yelp app!!

We will def continue coming here for our pizza and my garlic knot addictions!
