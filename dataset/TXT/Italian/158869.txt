LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Hostess was completely rude about my lace dress, I understand policies, but there is much nicer ways to saying my lace dress want appropriate. No apologies were offered and she completely tried to embarrass me. I'm sure someone could've handled my situation way better than she did. I love coming here but until this hostess is gone I will not be coming back ever.
