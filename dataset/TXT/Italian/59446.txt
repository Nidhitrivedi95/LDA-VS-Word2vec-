AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw Have already been twice since their soft opening last weekend! Love this new neighborhood place from the team behind crudo. Have had the Tennessee hot fried chicken, the stack salad, chicken wings and a focaccia flatbread....all of it delicious! The drinks are great and the atmosphere is perfect for a low key dinner at the bar! Okra will definitely be in my restaurant rotation from now on!
