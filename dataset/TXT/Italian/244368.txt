USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg I SO badly wanted to give five stars to this review -- however I had to deduct one due to all but TWO dishes (out of about 8) being average.

I came here Saturday night with my husband and another couple.  We started with a few appetizers -- Escargot, Scallops & Foie Gras.  Everything was amazing.  All the flavors were so well balanced, the dishes were flavorful and we were very pleased.  The Scallops were cooked PERFECTLY and I know that's not an easy ingredient to perfect.  For entrees we ordered the Grouper & Lobster, Elk Chop, Veal Chop and Truffle Ricotta Ravioli.  The Grouper & Lobster was AMAZING.  It was served over a Saffron Risotto which was delicious and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The lobster had a delicious flavor to it but you could also taste its inherently sweet flavor.  However it was definitely a small portion of fish and lobster for the price of $42.  The Elk Chop was disappointing.  The sides that it was served with didn't complement the dish well and also the meat was very dry.  My husband sent it back and ordered Scallops instead which were good, but not great.  At $37 for 6 scallops, it should be great.  I didn't get to try the Veal Chop but it looked amazing and my friend had rave reviews.  The Truffle Ricotta Ravioli was a BIT on the salty side -- but delicious none-the-less.  For dessert there were so many delicious things so we ordered three items -- Peanut Butter Pie, 5 Layer Red Velvet Cake and Beignets.  I thought the Beignets were the BEST.  They were freshly fried and served with a delicious cinnamon creme and also accompanied by a scoop of coffee gelato.  The sweet beignets with a bite of the coffee gelato was to die for.  The Peanut Butter Pie was good as well, I loved that it was served with a caramel peanut brittle.  The Red Velvet Cake was good too -- more chocolatey than red velvet though, which is a good thing to me.

I would definitely return if we come back to Charlotte!
