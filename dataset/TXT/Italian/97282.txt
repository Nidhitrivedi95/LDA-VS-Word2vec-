EtLmuDIMsBCmqdgpysz60Q I have been to La Strada twice and both times left a bit empty.  The atmosphere is a little different and the music gets loud at night. The food itself is good but very overpriced for the quality. Pesto pasta was good, but come on 18 bucks is a bit much.  I just felt like I overpaid for something I could have made in my home. Great location and patio if the weather is nice.
