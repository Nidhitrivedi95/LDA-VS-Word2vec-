pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Love Nora's! Been coming here for over 5 years, even after becoming vegetarian, is still a good place to hangout!
Love the fact that they can accommodate my 'needs' Crazy Alfredo is just as good without meet :) the only problem I have is their garlic bread, totally addictive! :)  
Must try the Lemon Drop Martini!
