8lZtLSeJVg28Gb75iklmmQ I found out that this place was just purchased by a father/son duo so I wanted to go in and give it a try. Upon entering the restaurant I noticed that it was clean and inviting. Amber, who took our order was very sweet and patiently answered our questions. 

My friend ordered the mild wings which were crisp but a little hot. I ordered the lasagne which came with a nice sized side salad and garlic bread. The salad was crisp and fresh and lasagne was absolutely delicious. I found out that the pasta and sauce are made in house on a daily basis so you know you are getting fresh quality food. The zeppoles are amazing!

The new owners are in house and greet all customers. The service we received was continuous and amazing. Can't wait to go back and try another dish as this place is sure to become the BEST PIZZA PLACE IN BOCA PARK.
