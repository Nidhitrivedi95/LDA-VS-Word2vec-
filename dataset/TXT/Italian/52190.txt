9S7RUjzkdpU4MDxUxkvLvg This is the worst food I have ever had from a Fridays - there was no hostess for 20 minutes and then the bus boy told us we would need to wait another 20 minutes for a table.  He tried to seat us then a waitress told him no and then we were paraded to the other side of the restaurant and seated.  The waitress was great but the food is horrible - never coming back here again.
