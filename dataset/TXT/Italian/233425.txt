TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q Some of the best pizza I have ever eaten.  The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are explosive! When I order for take-out, even after only 10 minutes of a drive in my car, my car ends up smelling like the pizza for 2 full weeks! The antipasto wasn't much to write home about as the house Italian dressing wasn't very flavorful, but the 2 spinach pizzas are AMAZING.  I also just tried the Chicago last night and it was so so good.  Check this place out for eat in or for take-out.  Just expect your car to smell like this stuff for 2 weeks.
