fOKeVUHC7nb6c8G5sILdHQ I didn't like the pizza. It lacked flavor. I had the medium Tony's style pizza. The customer service was great. Everyone was nice. Bit if I spend $25 on a pizza it should be bursting with flavor. Especially when I get a pizza with various flavorful toppings.I was very disappointed in the pizza. I probably won't be back to waste any more money!
