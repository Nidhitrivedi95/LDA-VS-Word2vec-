xAxdrUpIVOvxl0wjp45w6A This family run restaurant has really good food, but it's quite pricey and the portions are small. Love the old school Italian atmosphere, but don't love having to pay for more bread when what you were given in the first place was skimpy. Service is rather slow even when it's not busy, almost like eating in Europe. Sometimes closed when sign says should be open.
