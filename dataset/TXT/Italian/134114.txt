IqH-J1D0HIP9wyJs2q_uGQ It's probably more of a three-star rating, but I've been pretty impressed by the Epicentre and Ballantyne locations.  Besides, I didn't get a chance to check out much beyond the bar.  Me and the mouse scurried over here after catching a flick that ended as 12AM - which is awesome bc this place is open until 3AM!  We split a pepperoni & jalapeño pizza which was decent, but didn't blow me away.  Looked like a bunch of locals would drop in for a late-night beer and pizza - I know I would.  Oh wait, that's pretty much what I did.  Hm, is it sick that I kind of want to go over there right now at 1AM for late-night beer and pizza?  

I like this place to wind down the evening.

dmo out.
