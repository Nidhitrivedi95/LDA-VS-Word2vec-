GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA service was fantastic.  server Shannon was personable, helpful, knowledgeable and did anything but rush us.  
food was good, my steak dish was delicious...best skirt steak I've ever had.  being Italian it was hard to not get a pasta dish, but I didn't want to be overly full and we also ordered multiple pasta dishes as our first course.  
the pasta dishes were great , but this place really came down to the service.
