klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw The Food here is to die for! We went here on a whim when looking for breakfast at around 10am last Friday morning. I had the waffle and it was one of the best I have ever had. My cousin had the frosted flake french toast and we all heard about how nothing could ever compare the whole rest of our stay. 
The restaurant itself is delightful and the decor is like something out of My fair Lady or Gigi (I give you serious credit if you have a clue what movie I am referring to but basically its like something out of the early 1900's high society places.) I couldn't stop talking about how cute the place was. So the combo of cuteness and amazing food wins again! Society I miss you already.
