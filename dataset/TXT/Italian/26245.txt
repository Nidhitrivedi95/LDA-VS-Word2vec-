4LB4xtFAwfvJRachr6Eaxw I have loved sauce since the day it opened. That is why this four star review is so painful for me to write. I simply cannot give my once five star impression all because of what was once one of the most desired cravings amongst the people of Arizona - the Mac n' Cheese. Ever since the type of noodle used has been switched from a decadent shell to an ordinary macaroni noodle, it just isn't the same. Fortunately, the salads are still as fresh and flavorful as ever. No matter where I go, no salad is as satisfying as the roasted vegetable salad - packed with big bites of veggies and dressed to perfection - or the classic and crisp turkey and feta salad.
