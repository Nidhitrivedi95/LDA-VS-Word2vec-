fbLYRHIZAt3q839whhaBUg We love Oregano's. We hate their wait times. Their stuffed pizza keeps us coming back, despite having to wait over an hour most times. While their regular stuffed pizza is good, their stuffed pizza using their Big Rig sauce (from their Big Rig pasta) in place of the normal pizza sauce makes it something you can't get anywhere else. It makes the pizza a little creamy and gives it a bit of a spicy kick. The server is always a little confused when we order it this way, but they always comment that it looks amazing when they bring it out. And it always is. 

If you somehow have room left for dessert, their pizza cookies, slightly underdone, are the perfect way to end the meal.
