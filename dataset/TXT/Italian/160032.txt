LH8S1sUwxg2_TotePOFLvg I was starving after working way past lunch and I stopped for a hero sandwich at Lorenzo's.  I was helped by a man who I felt I was interrupting his day to get a sandwich.  I asked for dbl meat on the hero sandwich and when I got home there was one layer of meat after being charged $11.33 which included dbl meat. Either they missed it or they just put small portions on their sandwiches.  I bad part was my sandwich was sitting on the counter from the person who made it for 5 minutes before he bagged it.  Why couldn't of the guy just called my name.  So much for topping $2 ahead to get it quick.  The sandwich was good but lack of service and no dbl meat made me write this.  I do like their pizza.
