fbLYRHIZAt3q839whhaBUg Let me preface this with a statement: I usually LOVE Oregano's!   

This particular Oregano's is terrible.  The wait seemed a bit long for a Thursday night,  but that could have been a sign that the food was going to be amazing... Not the case.  The service was pretty bad; we had our food picked out for about 20-25 minutes before the server came back to us to take our order.  We ordered the Cheesy Bread as an appetizer, Garlic Chicken Lasagna, and Pasta Basta with Meatballs.  We were not given the opportunity to order drinks after looking at the menu.  

Our cheesy bread was fine- not great, too much cheese... but out on time.

When our entrees came out, they got it wrong- the Lasagna was the wrong type of lasagna entirely.  My boyfriend was starving so ate it, as the waitress was not going to come back.  Eventually, someone from the kitchen came out with the correct lasagna for my boyfriend.  The waitress apologized and asked if everything was okay and walked away before I could tell her that the Pasta Basta was terrible.  I ate a small amount as changing orders was not going to happen.  

Crappy food, crappy service.
