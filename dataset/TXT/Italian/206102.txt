qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA Wow! Great Food and Great Service. 

Ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti was perfect and the meatballs had excellent flavor. The sauce was perfect. 

The garlic not were served cold and would have been much better if served hot. 

The waiter recommend an excellent bottle of wine and I ordered another to go, perfect. 

I would definitely come back here to try some other food.
