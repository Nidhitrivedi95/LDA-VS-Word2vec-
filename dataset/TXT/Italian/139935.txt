JHrZlJBq8QNdugfmxug1rg I have lived only a handful of miles from Emilia's for 30+ years and just went there this week.  Don't make my mistake and dismiss this wonderful restaurant!  Although outdated in décor and atmosphere, the quality of the food more than makes up for it.  Your meal will be served piping hot, and in large portions. BYOB and enjoy your dinner.  I will go back SOON!
