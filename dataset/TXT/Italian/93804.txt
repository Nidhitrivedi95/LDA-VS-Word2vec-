eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ Went here for the first time last Monday... for a Monday night... this place was doing pretty good business.

When I walked in, I was greeted with lots of yummy smells... bread, garlic, butter.... everything that makes my mouth water.

So... they have some really nice wines.... from low to high end.  The only drawback that I encountered with their list was that what they had on the list wasn't entirely accurate... basically... what they need to do is update it based on what is current in their stock and NOT what they had carreid in the past or what was on order to be delivered.  It makes it hard to select wine when the menu isn't accurate.

In any case, the wines we did have were quite nice.

The tapas plate was perfect for 3 people.  
And their entree salads were big but not too big (like Cheesecake Factory).  The steak salad is almost a while steak on top of a bed of salad greens.  So... if you want steak and a salad.... get this one.

I got the chicken copped salad.... it was a little bland and I was disappointed in the avocados because they were hard and plain... usually avocados add a rich, creaminess to everything and these were just not ripe yet.

I'd try this place again if friends wanted to go... but it won't be my first choice.  Too many other places in Vegas to venture to.
