Jadp-zRKLOmav3aECRjALw Great, fast-casual Italian restaurant with a little MTL flair. A great first experience in this lovely city for our first trip here.

We began with the sunshine dip which was a delicious concoction of cheese and wine accompanied by thin pizza bread wedges. Delicious!

I had the multigrain pasta with bolognese sauce. Delicious, meaty, flavorful, and very filling. It came with a side bread stick (the thick and soft kind). He had the roasted salmon with rice and vegetables. Delicious.

We topped off our dinner by sharing a slice of Tarte de sucre, which was a regional specialty apparently via its use of maple syrup. I thought it would be too cloyingly sweet, but it was an amazingly balanced treat.

Great staff, fun surroundings, lovely clientele. Good MTL soccer match on the tele as well.

I would go back in a heartbeat!
