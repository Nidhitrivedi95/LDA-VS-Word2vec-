vxadNrpTY7OHNmWsrEpNnA There is rarely a negative thing to say about a late night diner that is open until 1 AM all nights and 3 AM on the weekends.

With breakfast, lunch and dinner all day and night, you have a huge selection of options.

From roast beef to turkey to shrimp salad to tuna melts to gyros, they got your covered.

Our waitress was so incredibly nice, even at 11 PM at night.  

The onion rings were a little too thin and over fried, but other than that, no complaints at all about the food.

Plus, they were featured on diners and divers.
We selected this place because it was open late and only 20 minutes from where we were staying and we were not disappointed.
