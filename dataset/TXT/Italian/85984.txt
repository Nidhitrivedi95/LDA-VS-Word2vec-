DRJzfAuSzgoBJeSuwfdPow Stopped in here ..have not been in 4 years.. Really a nice decorated place .. Food was good .. Two of my party had hamburgers and loved them.. juicy, cheesey and fresh. One had Manicotti. she said it was good and it was a vegetarian offering. I had the Manzo Beef sandwich, pretty good sliced steak with cheese and peppers but was a little dry till the waitress brought the aujus..By the way April the waitress was absolutely one of the best servers ever !
