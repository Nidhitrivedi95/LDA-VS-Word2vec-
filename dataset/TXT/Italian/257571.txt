w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A I wish this was in my town! The pizza was really good. The crust was delicious as was the toppings on the pizza I wish I had tried some of the other appetizers or had more time to try a calzone. We got the Gotham pizza with no mushrooms. I could only eat a slice since it was so filling. 
     The bread that you get at the beginning was delicious as well.
