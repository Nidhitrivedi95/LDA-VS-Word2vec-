Were quick to get our drink order and it quicker with our food, the calamari for appetizer was glorious. I had the lobster carbonara and I absolutely loved it, keep in mind there actually big portions so I wasn't able to finish it. Got a to go box for sure, you don't let good things like that go to waste. My friend got the ravioli,  he was pleased with but seemed like a smaller portion it had like six or seven or so raviolis seem to fill him up though. Bread they brought out with the balsamic  was amazing I now want to go to the store and do that for myself. I very much enjoyed this last night and intend on going back, today I went to Hooters for lunch and even though I'm stuffed from it I have the lobster carbonara in my fridge I refuse to go bad so that's what I'm eating now, i'm a fat ass.
