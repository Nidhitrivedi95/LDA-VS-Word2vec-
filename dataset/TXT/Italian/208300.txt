QnZ7YUoAJNP99oFkS9IpXw I've been coming here for years. I like to stop by when I have to make a Fry's Electronics run. My favorite, beside a slice and salad, is their eggplant parm sandwich. I think they are one of the best in the in the Valley. (See my photo) I order the eggplant sandwich with a side of pepperchinies. Highly recommended. 

Staff is always friendly. A real family operated business, and always
friendly.
