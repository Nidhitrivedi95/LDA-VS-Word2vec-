qdnR6gD22YZWlI-jkQ1vUg Definitely worth going out of your way for this place... But if you are already in the neighbourhood... You have to go.  You won't be disappointed.  Staff was friendly and accommodating to our very large group on a Saturday night... And the relatively small place was full!  Food was excellent, prices fair, wine list OK... But the warmth of the owner and staff made dinner very special.
