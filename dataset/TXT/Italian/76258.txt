CSaVK9wgqe2_tQuuCDINyQ Good pizza made fast, friendly staff, great prices! Everything is fresh!

They seriously hook the food up here. Everything is always LOADED with fresh ingredients. I've become a regular here. A quality pizza that can feed 2-3 people for under $20 and ready for pickup in 20 minutes or less? I'm in! A great neighborhood option.

I like the Hawaiian best. I tried their meat lover pizza once and if you order that, you better LOVE meat because they load it up so much that it was actually too much meat for me! Their salads are well made also, unlike a lot of pizza places.

Girls working the phones and front counter are always friendly (and cute)! I'm happy to support this family owned business. Keep up the good work guys! Maybe add a few more pizza configurations to the menu sometime soon?
