dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw Fiamma has a trendy casino restaurant atmosphere with inventive twists on Italian classics.

It almost goes without saying that it's overpriced. With that being said, we were also paying for service and atmosphere. Fiamma delivered on both for my group of 13's recent visit.

I was worried this would be the type of restaurant that doesn't provide bread. Luckily that was not the case, as my group was thoroughly able to enjoy the sourdough olive bread and twisted rolls. The two spreads were much more exciting than butter, although I don't recall exactly what they were. 

A few us split the burrata with roasted red pepper. It's a good thing we split it because it was actually a decent portion of cheese. We had to use some of the above mentioned rolls once we depleted the supply of bread that came with the appetizer. The burrata was a little bland, but I believe that's just how burrata is by nature. 

For my main, I had the Mezzaluna. I can't believe I paid $24 for a pasta dish, but I can't say no to pesto. It was definitely unique to me, as I've never had basil filled pesto. The cherry tomato sauce was more exciting than a traditional tomato or marinara, and the aged ricotta was a nice touch. In the end of the day, it was just a ravioli dish. 

I also had a glass of "Ronco del Cero" Sauvignon Blanc that I didn't care for too much. That's on me for ordering a Sauv Blanc from Italy when I prefer them from New Zealand. 

We were stuffed and had a long night of drinking ahead of us so passed on the dessert. 

So my group had a lovely time and enjoyed the food. Fiamma doesn't return a return visit in my personal opinion.
