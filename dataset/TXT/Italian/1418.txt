-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q Very tasty pizza and we will definitely be going back. 

I went with a group of four and we were one of the first tables in there when it opened for lunch. The menu is full of many tasty sounding dishes and a couple across from us over heard our discussion of splitting pizzas and not agreeing on which ones. The advised us to get our own, the pizzas are a giant plate size and we agreed that leftovers wouldn't be awful to have. 

I ordered the margarita added prosciutto, it was delicious but a little too salty- next time I'll skip the prosciutto or ask for less of it. The crust, sauce and cheese was amazing. Everyone loved the pizzas they got- two ate the entire thing and two of our had only two slices left. 

I am looking forward to trying it again! Service was a bit spotty, but there was one waitress and three tables. She was definitely on top of her game, it seemed like that kitchen was running a bit slow. Regardless, it was delicious and we got back to our meeting on time. We were just sad that we couldn't order wine.
