VeRHiEbUe_vHprYn8mnezA The food and service were excellent. Had the halibut which was a special that evening. The place is small but that does not take away from the experience. The restaurant has a separate, brick enclosed eating area. Because of how busy they were I was seated in this room. The sounds echo very loudly off the brick and so I got to enjoy the large party next to me and their wild conversations. Back to the food, fresh and well prepared. The prices are a bit high but worth it. I would recommend this mom and pop restaurant for a nice meal out.
