lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ I'm with the others, why would anyone give this place more than 1 star?

 First, it would be awesome if they knew how to cook a pizza or just even serve it hot. 

Second, at a slow bar, it took over 10 minutes to even be acknowledged. 

Vegas has seen a lot of my money , but this awful place never will again.
