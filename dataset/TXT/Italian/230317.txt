tdo6JvAKwmMAKU8T5jfORw AYYYY I love the feels of this place! It definitely has modern, chic vibe. I love the decor(white) it makes it look really so clean! Also BLESS them for adding the blankets out in the patio, I thought that was a really sweet addition(: I also love their wine wall, pretty creative, if I could drink I would've deff checked it out haha! Anyways I ordered the caprese pesto panini and my cousin ordered the meatball cone. The best part of the panini was the Bread, oh god it was BOMB. It was so crunchy and soft, and all the flavors were all there! It wasn't dry and bland, it was moist inside. I didn't try the meatball cone since I'm a vegetarian but it looked so good & my cousin said it was pretty good so I'll just take her word for it since she's a picky eater! We also tried their chocolate/fudge cake, I'm more of a dark dark chocolate typa gal so it was a tad sweet for me but still tasty of course! Check this place out of your ever in the area, you won't regret it. Bring a couple of friends, it's a perfect environment to just chill & relax with some gals! (:
