nYkbkUkhJA3oa71HkrjObg It's a freak thing that we were back less than a week later, but we wanted to meet up with some friends we hadn't seen in a while and lo and behold, this is their regular Friday night hang out. We were pretty excited to replicate our experience the previous Saturday...but, well, it sort of ended there. 
Wine again, excellent, salad was good (I had the mixed greens) but Honey's Caesar was just okay. Onto the tagliatelle with bolognese and veal with prosciutto and sage. Honey's pasta was really disappointing. We were both drooling over the description on the menu and I was excited to share plates (again). It just did nothing for either of us. It was sort of like the night where you didn't feel much like cooking so you just defrosted something from the freezer and went on with your life. 

 My veal was thin sliced - which I love, but the sauce made the light breading pasty and it just wasn't good. It seems my experience with good veal is extremely limited. Is it that tricky? Should I learn my lesson(s) and just stop ordering it? Plus, I would rather not have mashed potatoes with my Italian meal. A side of buttered noodles would have fared better for me. 

All in all, we are bummed. It is a pricey place and now that we're on the fence, I'm just not sure I would spend that kind of money on a plate of pasta unless it consistently blew me away. Unfortunately it's the second go-round that I will remember the most.
