zOmz8CM5SVFGklGRSsV5mQ Well as you can see from the reviews, all recent reviews are stating how terrible this restaurant is I saw that the reviews months ago were five stars, must have be different owners or management, I've never been in this restaurant but I've ordered delivery twice and each time I had a problem with missing items I purchased and how long it took to be delivered, close to two hours they are 10 minutes away, for simple items like salad, Philly sandwich, cheesecake, chicken wings, Pizza and everything taste like items you buy at 7-Eleven or Circle K... Ridiculous! They will not get another damn dime from me
