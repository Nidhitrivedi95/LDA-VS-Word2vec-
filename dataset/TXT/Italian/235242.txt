TVKenh65WwJX3zEr36zKCA so I've been hearing a lot of good things about station casinos Oyster bars and been wanting to try it out. My fiancé and I finally made the trip to the sunset location. As we walk in the place was already packed but gladly there was two open spots at the bar. We were greeted right away by Darrel and took our drink orders. He also cooked our food infront of us which was very cool. I had the fra diablo pasta, dozen oysters and she had the crab pan roast. Oysters were fresh, my pasta was well cooked but that pan roast...OMG that pan roast was so good! I can't stop thinking about it and she even dreamed about it lol. It was that good. I'll be coming here more often just for this. we topped off the night with bananas fosters which was perfect to cleanse the palate. overall great experience. My only complain is dirty menus and they have there bus tub of dirty dishes facing customers for everyone to see while dining but I don't care for that lol as long as they have good food.
