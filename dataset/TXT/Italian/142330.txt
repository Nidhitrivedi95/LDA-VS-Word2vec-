I set up a dinner meeting here in August for a group of doctors. I booked a month ahead for the private room. I called a few days ahead to set the menu and could reach no one. Repeated calls got me no response and I was completely left in the lurch, invites out, RSVP list taken. I never heard from them. 

Thank god for Pasquale's on Sahara. The owners fit me in last minute and I was able to contact all my attendees about the venue change. I would have looked very bad to my customers without them. 

If this place is still open I urge you not to go.
