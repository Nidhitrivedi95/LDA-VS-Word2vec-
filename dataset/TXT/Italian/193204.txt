pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ My wife and I were doing a brief get away in Vegas. We can only handle one or two nights of all the Strip has to offer, and were really wanting something more mom & pop'ish. We found this place on Yelp and saw several great reviews. We decided to give it a try. 

We made same day reservations and they seated us within 5 minutes even though we were running a little late. When you walk in you're hit by a great smell and the place feels like a happening local food spot. 

We had over-eaten all weekend a weren't terribly hungry, so we ordered a little lite. We split the Veal Marsala. Incredible sauce and great meat. It was the best Marsala sauce we've ever tried. It came with a side of spaghetti that was good as well. We also had a bowl of pasta soup (Farmagiano?) that was huge, hearty (filled with beans and pasta shells) an was great. I had a gratis glass of house red via our friends at yelp and we were out the door for $30. 

If you're looking for a friendly, home style change of pace from the big-ness of Vegas, and are craving great and affordable Italian food, do yourself a favor and check this place out. Highly recommended.
