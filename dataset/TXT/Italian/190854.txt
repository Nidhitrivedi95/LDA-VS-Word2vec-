pC4iDpFVTZWwhNEofv1W8Q The servers and food are fine! The owner on the other hand has no business in this business! He was rude to my coworker when she asked for help with the wi-fi and then I asked for a substitution! Oh my goodness you'd think I asked for a kidney! I offered to pay an up charge or something but he said I'd have to get what I didn't want and buy the other item(spring roll versus summer roll not a huge difference)!  I don't eat the fried items and didn't want to waste the extra food! The biggest problem is that we work in the same shopping center and have 100 office employees here that go at least three times a week and I myself go  about 3 times a week! $0.45 is worth losing loyal customers? I will not return and neither will my co-workers!!!
