di9rdjT71cYTlwKMYeVk0g My sister and I went here for lunch, and not surprisingly, they were pretty busy. We were greeted and sat immediately. Our server came right over and offered us a drink, then appetizer. We had a couple of questions in which she was very happy to answer. Our food was a little late coming out, but our waitress and then the manager came and apologized for our wait. Very classy and professional! Everything looked and tasted great. We had ordered additional food to go, and that came out with perfect timing. On our way out, several employees thanked us and wished us a great rest of our day. Amazing job guys and gals! We will certainly be back and will tell our family and friends!
