4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg We stopped in here on Easter Sunday night for dinner during our stay at the Wynn. The restaurant was pretty empty and we were seated almost immediately. 

We shared the Bianca pizza and Potato Gnocchi. Both dishes were just fine, but definitely underwhelming (especially for the price). The pizza was more like an extremely thin crisp flatbread than pizza. 

Our server (I think his name was Adam?) was super friendly and attentive. 

Overall, wouldn't come back here. Definitely better options within the Wynn. Overpriced for the quality.
