uOJ87zqbU1MtShCSHDkiyw We were in a party of about 20.  We had 1 waiter. We sat there over a hour for bread to arrive.  Service was horrible.  Hardly seen the 1 waiter we had.  At one point we wanted to change seats due the family of the birthday girl came late and we thought we would want to sit with her sons.   The waiter happened to be in the room when we did it and basically yelled at us like we were 5 years old.  It was so unprofessional!    When he arrived with my food, it wasn't what I ordered so I asked for at least another type of sauce to put on it, never saw the sauce.  Never came back after that  to ask if we needed anything. I finally asked him for our bill and he was very rude. Told me he was getting it but it was difficult with so many people and all having separate bills. With the party of 20 gratuity was automatically added to our bill.  Our server didn't even deserve a tip.  If you plan on having a dinner party I would not recommend this establishment.  Horrible!
