pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg Had a great experience here. Walked in during a holiday weekend with no reservation and a party of 14. We were greeted warmly and got seated right away with no wait! Our server Joey was kind and accommodating even though we had 5 kids with us and were constantly getting up to attend to one of them. Love the family style meals, as this suits our family perfectly. We ordered fried calamari and Caesar salad for apps, prime rib chops special and rigatoni sausage and broccoli country style for entrees, and tiramisu. I also got a red sangria. Despite dishes being so large, we did not wait long for food, a couple of people in our party waited a while for drinks. None of the food disappointed. My mom seemed to have a great birthday meal. The only thing I would recommend for them is to put bigger lady fingers in their tiramisu and to not let people stand near other people's tables to look at the menu.
