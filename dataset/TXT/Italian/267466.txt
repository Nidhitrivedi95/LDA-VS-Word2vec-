Xd3CvDmkW9tnOpgEZ3_MVQ I was not so impressed with this restaurant.  Went with 3 friends that night after NYE and was expecting much better. I think it's supposed to be higher end American cuisine.  

My first problem is that they wouldn't serve me alcohol.  YES, my ID and debit card did get stolen the other night, yet I had a copy of my passport with me which you could clearly see my birthdate.  The rest of the table ordered a bottle of wine and one of my friends ordered straight citron on the rocks, so I was able to have that :) HAHAHA, we fooled you.

The food was so so.  I highly recommend the olives as an app - they were delightful and seasoned perfectly.  I started with the beef barley soup which was great.  Another person at the table ordered the caesar salad which looked delicious.  It even came with capers and had a ton of parmesan cheese on it.  

For the entree, I went with the duck.  Eh, not so tender and a bit over cooked.  It also came with 2 different types of beets and i HATE beets. Maybe I should have read the menu better...

All in all, this place was OK, but I would've preferred to try the sushi restaurant across the way, which was closed :(
