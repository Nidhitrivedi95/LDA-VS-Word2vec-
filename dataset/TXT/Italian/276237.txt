Ye2WDL6sA66605igAbKGFg Toronto has a lot of options when it comes to Italian food so when it comes to quality we're spoiled a bit. I personally think pasta is a type of food that is very difficult to mess up but is also very difficult to perfect, making it a challenge for restaurants.

Food here were very typical and mediocre. It wasn't the best food I ever had nor was it the worst, placing itself right about in the middle of the spectrum. If they prices were a bit lower I think this place would have had a great value. If their quality was a bit higher I think the same would apply but it's at that ambiguous point where you think "it's not bad but I don't think it's really worth it either".

The seafood pasta I tried the last time had good amount of seafood but tasted a bit bland, as if they were steamed to the point where it lost all the flavours and the sauce didn't get a chance to seep in. Pasta itself was al dente which I love but after about 5 minutes when the pasta cooled a bit it felt like they were almost breaking apart from the brittleness. This might be due to the ingredient of the pasta since I believe it was one of those fancy squid ink black pastas.

All in all I think the place is a bit lacking. I would prefer it to be a more casual and cheaper eats place or a higher priced fine dining but at the moment it seems to be in that middle ground which prevents it from standing out from other establishments.
