9HC5xHX8QE8VmGd-wCKEaA Awesome new spot in Toronto for wood oven pizza! You can make your own or choose from their selections of pizzas. This is your classics on the go pizza place. You place your order and pay before you get your pizza. They make it right away and it's quick service. They also have fresh basil on the tables for you to put on your pizza. My fiancé and I really enjoyed this place! Must try!!
