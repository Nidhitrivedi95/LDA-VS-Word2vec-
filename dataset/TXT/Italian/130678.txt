icFXoKY9_U15RxkNbyroPQ Went on a recommendation. Very disappointing. Veal was not good! Breading and sauce were not good. Tasted as though it had been frozen and thawed. Sauce was watery And weak. Soup was good. The addition of spicy oil was not needed. My colleague had the same dish and just looked at me and shook his head, I hope it's a bad day here. We should have known since it was lunch and the place was not very busy.
