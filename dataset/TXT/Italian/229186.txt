T1J9PQXqfeG_skaaDV6O0Q I ate for the first time here for my rehearsal dinner. While the food was good, (my family loved their dinners) the service was terrible. It's not a big Restaraunt, but it felt like they only had 1 person working. Aside from our party there weren't many people dinning there. Our waitress took forever refilling our drinks and we waited almost an hour for food. I know people who love the place and swear by it, but it wasn't my thing, and definitely not the greatest Italian I have had.
