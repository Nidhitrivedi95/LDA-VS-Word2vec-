8yiLVWzJyyTEhYE0fVNvlA Always a great experience when dining here.  My boyfriend and I had a 5:30 reservation; it was pretty empty at this time and the service was on point.  We were immediately greeted with a huge wheel of Parmesan, among other appetizers.  The fried zucchini is one of my favorites.  

My boyfriend ordered the shrimp francese and I got the capellini arrabiata.  Both were delicious!  I received a pretty huge portion of pasta, so I was able to eat it after the nightclub.  I thoroughly enjoyed my leftovers as well.
