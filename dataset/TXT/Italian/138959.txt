The is absolutely no excuse for a wait for 2 people at 4pm on a Tuesday. After waiting 10 minutes we left.  Normally 10 minutes isn't a big deal, but again, it was 4PM. On a Tuesday. The place was practically deserted. The real kicker was being completely ignored while being the only people in the waiting room. No explanations, updated wait times, just nothing.
