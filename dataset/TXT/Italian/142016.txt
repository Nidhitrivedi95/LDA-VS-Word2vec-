JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A 24 hours is worth a 2 star bonus here. For a big city, it's surprising how early shops close. We're NOT the city that never sleeps, so 7 west is a rare gem.

7 West has a casual, intimate vibe.

1) VIBE: 3 floors, each with a slightly different feel. They keep the lighting to an appropriate minimum, with tasteful decor on each level.

2) OPEN: They are always open. And you will be just as happy to go there at 7pm as you will be at 3am (all alcohol levels being equal)

3) ANYONE: Bring a date. Catch up with a close friend. Bring a group.

4) MUSIC: shocking how tasteful the music is. They also hit the perfect volume so that it's always in the background, but loud enough to be appreciated.

5) SERVICE: This can be very volatile, especially when it gets busy. But normally the servers are friendly.

6) VERSATILE: You want alcohol? Dessert? Pasta? Dip platter to share? Cappuccino in a bowl? Done.

7) RELIABLE: It doesn't seem to have changed in many years, and that's a good thing. You know what you're getting.

7 west is worth far more than the sum of its parts
