dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg I Love Love Love Oregano's.  When I lived abroad I was terribly homesick for this place and to be honest, the thought of living further than an hour's drive from Oregano's puts me into a panic.

The food is Delicious and Generous and the prices are SUPER reasonable.  The Alfredo the Dark with chicken is wonderful, and my staple.  I especially like the roasted poblano chile on top, which oddly varies in degrees of hotness depending on the day.  There was one time that I happily snarfed the pepper only to realize a minute later that my lips were ON FIRE.  Like, I had to ice them for the next 20 minutes.  Still, I take full responsibility for that silliness and recommend that everyone be Very Careful when eating those little guys.  The salads are great, the belinis are yummy- the staff is crazy friendly, which would usually annoy the hell out of me but I find it oddly endearing.  *sigh* I cannot wax poetic enough!
