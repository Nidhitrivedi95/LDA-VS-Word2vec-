CKJnoUSWocdVIj6Fqbgm5g Stopped by for a quick bite to eat before a event.  We were told no tables available but could sit at the bar which was fine. Until we saw available tables. 

Anyways after being kinda ignored we finally were able to order.  We decided that the Duck fat fries and the jerk chicken pasta sounded good.  We decided wrong.

To be fair the Duck Fat fries were good - crispy thin fries with parmesan cheese fried in duck fat were hot, crispy and tasty!  I could have licked the plate clean until i realized i was out in public!

The jerk chicken pasta was probably the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth.  Overly salty dried up pieces up meat with some congealed looking sauce on the pasta.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten it but it was that or my socks.  I should have just eaten my socks :(

The restaurant is downstairs- decorated with cheesy lamps with red tomatoes on them.   Good place to watch a game but you aren't going to impress anyone here.

Service was slow as i felt we were ignored right up until we paid.
