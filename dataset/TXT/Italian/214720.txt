rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg The Silverton move seems ideal. 

- parking was crowded, though not a problem to find a spot

- Admission can be pricey, so search the net for $4.00 off coupons. Worth it!

- I was disappointed that the chicken parmesan left much to be desired. I came with an empty stomach and the notion that my taste buds were going to be in ecstasy with every bite of dripping marinara, but nope. It tasted like watered down Prego sauce, hard noodles and too-hard chicken. It might have just been the vendor that I chose. 

- I was bummed about my less than perfect chicken parm encounter, but that was almost forgotten when we went and rode the carnival rides. Lots to ride, lots to laugh about and almost pee your pants if you're not much of a thrill seeker in carnival ride form, like me.

- entertainment. I love the mix of entertainment on the 'main stage'. Older gentlemen belting out tunes I've never heard of, accordion acts, more older gentlemen dancing. I truly enjoyed this aspect.

- people watching was on par. Who wears tight mini dresses and 5 inch heels to a parking lot location? Oh yeah, people who go to this Feast. Was that Snooki and Deena I just saw? 

- I snapped out of my sad food mood when I saw BROWNIES, BANANAS and STRAWBERRIES DRIZZLED IN CHOCOLATE, ON STICKS! Had me one of those babies and also took a huge bite of husband's chocolate covered cheesecake on a stick. Left the feast with an empty wallet, but satisfied stomach.
