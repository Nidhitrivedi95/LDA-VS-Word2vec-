B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw I would come back again for the atmosphere and cheap in-house wine!

We came here on a Wednesday at around 6pm without making any reservations, yet we were able to sit by the bar on the rooftop which I didn't mind at all. The atmosphere was great. The service here was mediocre, our waiter was very friendly and gave us our space which was what we had wanted. 

I ordered the mushroom pasta and it was quite good however not amazing. The pasta was a little hard for my liking. But the sauce was very delicious. I wish there was more mushroom or a variety of mushrooms on side. The in-house red wine was okay. The in-house white wine was not as good as the red -- but for $1 an ounce, I'll take it! 

My friend got the kale salad with chicken which I also tried. The kale was quite tender and it was overall good, again, nothing mindblowing. 

As mentioned earlier, I'd come back for the rooftop atmosphere and a glass of wine but the food and service is very average.
