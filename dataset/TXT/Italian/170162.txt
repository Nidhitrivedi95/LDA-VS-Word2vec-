MuGSFckqsMI7mSZwTvsHhg I really want to like this restaurant because it's locally owned and convenient b/c they offer delivery in Windsor. However, the service is pleasant but sloppy. I have never dined in the restaurant (delivery only) so I can't speak for service in the restaurant.

I called in to order a pizza. The young lady on the phone was clearly not listening when asking questions about my order b/c she repeatedly got the information wrong. Then we were told the order would take 35 to 45 minutes.

The delivery person arrived an hour later with a brown bag. This was clearly not a pizza. Apparently the orders were mislabeled. 

Then we open the pizza and it's cold. The crust is very chewy and tough and does not taste home made. It reminded me of refrigerated pizza dough.

That said, the pizza toppings themselves were very fresh. 

One of these things along wouldn't have been a big deal. All of these factors combined resulted in disappointment. As much as I prefer to support local businesses, we will not be ordering from here again. I'd rather order from Pizza Hut for better service, flavor and consistency.
