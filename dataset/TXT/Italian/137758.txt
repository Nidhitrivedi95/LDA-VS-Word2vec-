This place has the best Beef 
Sandwich west of Al's Beef in Chicago! The beef is tender, the gravy is nicely seasoned, and the bread is outstanding! 

Pizza is a solid choice too. I haven't tried anything other than the pizza and the Beef Sandwich because I am so infatuated with...you guessed it...BEEF SANDWICH! 

Small restaurant cranking out BIG food!

Beef Sandwich! Get two. You'll be happy you ordered a second after finishing the first!

Remember. 
Beef.
Sandwich.
