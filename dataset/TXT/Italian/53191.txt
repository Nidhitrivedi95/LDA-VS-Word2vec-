a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w We wanted to find some good Italian food and saw the high rating and rave reviews on Yelp so figured this was a good bet.  We were right.  The place has that old school Italian feel and has a very family feel in the staff.  The visit to our table by one of the owners whom I think started out as a delivery boy? Kitchen help?  Not sure where he started but now as a co-owner he's a symbol of that family business type of venue.  

The portions are big and the food is well made and the prices are very good.  The only downside was locating it.  When you're not familiar with the area it's not clear on Google Maps that it's not a stand alone place with roadside visibility.  It's in a shopping center like parking lot and you cannot see it from the street.  We drove by a couple of times before figuring that out - just glad we didn't give up and miss out on the great meal!
