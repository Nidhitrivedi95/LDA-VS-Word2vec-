_myTPlWa8QRN5eavs-hNPg Went to Pacino's for the first time yesterday. The food was really, really good. The wait staff was fabulous.  The so called jazz/entertainment left a lot to be desired.  It wasn't that the gentleman performing was bad, but it was so loud for such a small space on the patio.  There were four of us and we had to raise our voices to be heard by each other.  We had expected jazz or a more calming line-up of background music.  We will definitely go back but will call ahead to make sure it's not during a time they have entertainment.  This restaurant leans heavily on Italian influence... maybe some nice Italian background music would work better.
