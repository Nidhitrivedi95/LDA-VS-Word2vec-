MLQeuiL9rqOq_rDKGEcU0A Our dinner was acceptable, not exceptional. It may simply have been our menu selection. 
But what has been consistent is the attitude in the service. 
On both occasions we have come to this restaurant we have been treated with indifference. Despite intentional efforts to be friendly with the waitress (I believe this is my default attitude, but definitely the best attitude to find out what's great on the menu, and to be well cared for) there's really seems to be no interest on the staffs behalf to engage the patrons.  Unfortunately that colors the whole experience in an unfortunate manner. Since we never felt welcome, much less appreciated, we wont be back.
