j7yI3qYRsbGBUv9rShLCaQ Grilled calimari was charred, tough and tasteless. Steak salad was soggy and bland. Also, they never asked me how I wanted my steak cooked- it was way over done and chewy. Most of the other customers were having pizza- I should of took the hint. I gave them two starts because the server was very nice.
