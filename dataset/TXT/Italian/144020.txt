Jv5NmXlB3XuLR3yk7B8amw We went there about Oct 19th.  From the more recent reviews nothing has changed.
We liked them when they were by Falcon Field.  Went a few times a year because they were a bit of a drive.  
When the moved to the new location we figured we would give them a try.
1: to much help running around with their heads cut off
2: he brochette what to have salmon did not. what we did get was god aweful.  Bread not toasted and not fresh.
While i am on bread, they are located next to a bread smith.  Would have been nice to get day old bread.  Bread was not warmed and it was stale.
3: one waiter tried to serve us a flat bread we did not order (help disorganized)
4: We waited well over an hours .. at least for our food after ordering.
5: our food was initially severed to the table next to us.
6: my wife order was lost.  they did get it out about 10 minutes after serving the rest of us.
7: the food was almost warm.  I think it had sat while they completed the order.  At best it was a 2.5 star.  

The owner came by several times.  Said one cook quit and another had a death in the family.  Ok I understand.  I came to your resturant which by the way is so loud that we could not talk (try adding some acoustic baffles).   The waiter asked if we wanted desert.  I'm sorry did you not comp me at least one desert for a table of 5.  

After 2 hours for a medioca dinner, i would think the owner would be smart enough to comp us something.  My wife meal that came while the rest of us were half way thru our dinners.

The owner moved to try to get people like me to come several times a month.  Wont happen.  I really hope that someone bought out his old lease and paid to remodel the new place.  I don't think he will be able to give the place away.
