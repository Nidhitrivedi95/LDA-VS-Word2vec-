RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ Amazing!!! My mouth is watering just leaving this review. We had reservations and were quickly checked in and seated. The restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. Tastefully done without being overwhelming. Our waiter came to our table and introduced himself within 60 seconds. After going over the specials of the day we asked for recommendations. Our waiter explained all the pastas that are made in house and invited us to take a look at their antipasto display. We settled on all of his recommendations. The antipasto was so fresh. All the meats and cheeses were fresh and so flavorful. We followed that up with a meatball appetizer. It was big enough to quarter and share with the couple we were with. Had I know how good it was, I might have ordered one for me and not shared. Next we had the caprese salad. The mozzarella literally melted in my mouth. For dinner I had the Truffle Tagliatelle (also suggested by our waiter), it was to die for. We had a round of Limoncello, which we were informed is made in house. Last, we all shared the Nutella cake, coconut cake, and tiramisu. Everything was perfect from beginning to end! I definitely recommend it!
