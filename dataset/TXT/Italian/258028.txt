w3PwDEbI0EDx4YI_BkFhIA One of my favorite Italian places in the city.
I usually go for the Chicken or Veal Parmigiana. They come with salad and bread so on most occasions I can make two meals out of these heaping portions making it excellent value.
Occasionally I will branch out and try other things and everything I had has been delicious and served quickly.
Most of my friends come strictly for the pizza. It is hard for me to order one with the afore mentioned items readily available. But on the occasions where I have ordered a pizza, it was really really good with an excellent crust. They also come in HUGE sizes so they are great for a family or a bunch of friends.
