nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A I came back for the croutons...wait, what? You read that right. Croutons. The little, dried-up bread scraps on salads. I ordered a Caesar salad to start with before my entree, completely unaware of the discovery I was about to make. When my salad arrived, I was immediately intrigued by the croutons - they were unlike any I had ever seen. These croutons were perfect, one-inch square cubes, caramelized to a perfect golden brown on the outside. Biting into one, I discovered a filling of warm polenta - also known as grits in some parts. It was apparent that these croutons had just come out of the oven, and they were HEAVENLY! I wished I could  have ordered a whole plate of them - they were that good. The rest of my experience at Buddy V's was outstanding - the main course, the service, the ambience were all great. It was those croutons, however, that brought me back for dinner the next two nights in a row.

UPDATE: I stopped in for lunch on a Thursday with the family. They had a three-course lunch special. I started off with a Caesar Salad with those heavenly polenta croutons...WOW. My main course was the Chicken Parm, which was delicious. An order of Tiramisu and a cup of coffee was the perfect finish. The service and atmosphere were impeccable. I may have discovered one of the world's best Italian restaurants. I will not miss an opportunity to return!
