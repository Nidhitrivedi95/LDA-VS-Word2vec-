cy3Or8iSsDOmHBBu2MwnOg We were very disappointed in this restaurant. To start, the waiter talked to us a total of 4 times. The first to take our order, second to bring our food,  third when we requested our check, and lastly to deliver our check (15 minutes after we asked for it). The food was expensive, they offer small portions, and the taste is lacking. I had a pasta dish that was so salty, I could not even taste the noodles. My husband had the Veal Marsala. It tasted more like burnt brown sauce than Marsala.  To top it off the portions were very small. When the bill came and it was $60 we were very shocked. I have no problem spending money on great food, but to spend $60 and to still be hungry is a shame. I wanted to give one star, but I felt bad, so two it is.  Save yourself time and money. Skip this place-
