A blind waiter leads you into the room and to your seat (double doors to keep out the light) by asking you to hold onto his shoulders. He asks you to put your drink close to the wall, which we supposed, was a method of minimizing spills. Only the two maison drinks (Mai Mai and Raspberry Dream) are part of the groupon. Anything else, you pay extra.

Food-wise: The appetizer I ordered was amazing (Pork croquettes and pan-fried scallop - yeup, just one scallop). The entrees (Lobster Pasta) was alright - but I wouldn't go beyond that. I was initially afraid that the lobster meat amount would be small, but what ended up being the cause of disappointment was the pasta itself. The pasta was over-done, too soft, and semi-mushy. Were it not for the big lobster chunks, there would be no saving this dish.

Any disappointment with the food, however, is never the focus of your attention because you're so concentrated on not dropping the fork and knife that's in your hand. I had my palms 1cm in front of my eyes and I seriously could not see anything.

I went in with a groupon and still felt that the meal was pricey. Granted, there was a "+4" beside the Lobster Pasta option, but it would've been nice had the hostess confirmed that $4 would be added to the total surcharge for ordering the Lobster Pasta over the other entrees. Sometimes it's not clear whether the menu used for groupon users is different from the restaurant's regular menu? After the surcharges and tips, the two of us paid an additional $20 on top of the $55 groupon.

Conclusion: You go for the experience, not necessarily for the food. But seriously, great experience.
