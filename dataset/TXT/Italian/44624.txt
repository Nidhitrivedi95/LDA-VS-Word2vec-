8cQc0BRbkSDSkLn6oFw3mw I am giving Nicks one star not based on the food but how bad I saw the owner Nick constantly berating his very hard working staff today. It really made for a uncomfortable meal as we watched the employees all running around working and Nick just constantly nit picking at them. I will not support a business where the owner has no respect for his employees who make him money...so done with this place unless there is a big attitude change by the owner.
