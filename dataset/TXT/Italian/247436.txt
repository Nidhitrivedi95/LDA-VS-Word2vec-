VA95qAV2PRH9gtTi2Vfv4Q This is such an amazing small Italian restaurant that I can't believe it took me this long to discover it. Located in Yorkville, there are sufficient parking spots conveniently located close to the restaurant.

Restaurant has two floors. We walked in on a Friday night at 9pm. A group of 3 still took us 15-20mins of a wait time. Book a reservation to avoid wait time. I did get a little bit impatient but the wait is wellllll worth it. Also, a group of 3 is always harder to get a table i guess...

*** Mafalde ai Funghi *** this is the hands down DA BEST mushroom pasta I have everrrr had. Mushrooms included: portobello, porcini, crimini, oyster mushrooms
Light cream sauce with parmigiano topped with some truffle paste
$19

First bite already got me!! Because it is so creamy, so rich, SO GOOD that I want to lick the plate. Portion is good too! You might think how special a mushroom pasta can be but I want to convince you that, the easiest food item def takes the most skills to deliver a rich flavored satisfying dish.

I ordered a coffee to end the dinner as I got so full from the pasta. The coffee also wow-ed me! Rich dark coffee with some amazing aroma. Also, the cream WAS HEATED WARM for us, so thoughtful!! Love it!!

Last piece of advice, avoid sitting on the 2nd floor. The servers keep running up and down to deliver food from kitchen downstairs to the upper floor. I just personally would like to avoid my food being travelled like that if you know what I mean... hygiene reasons.
