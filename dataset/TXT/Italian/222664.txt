SirdHmqK0LDKDQvJBYVLsA Came here with a few of my friends for dinner.  Service was sufficient and while everyone thought their dish was great.  One of my friends had the seafood risotto and thought it was one of the best risottos she's had so maybe it's the dish I selected.   I had the Penne & Sausage which also had spinach, roasted red peppers, sundried & fresh tomatoes.  I really like sundried tomatoes, especially in pasta but found that it really lacked flavour in the few pieces that were in my pasta.  Overall it was just okay and a bit boring half way through.
