yPgUkQxj8CYPKF89HV65kg Our group of 8 arrived on time for our reservation.  A party of 3 continued to sit at our table for 45 minutes after they had finished thier meal.  The staff refussed to handle the situation by offering them a drink at the bar, moving them to another table, or even letting US buy them a drink and dessert to move.  Unbelievable.  No customer service skills.  We are well connected business people in the community, and they just burned a very valuable bridge.  Too bad.
