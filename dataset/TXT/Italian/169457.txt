MrmwDgMlL2GtthlAZsJwNQ Great place. Came here for lunch today for a holiday gathering. Food was good (you have to try the butternut ravioli - to die for). Service was good, no hiccups. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is because it wasn't over-the-top fabulous. Solid 4 stars (and that's a good thing).
