0aw3HbxkZ4G7pkPYt10fhA Worst Meal Ever!!  Worst experience at an Olive Garden EVER!!  I know I should not expect much but I have never had an experience this bad at this location!  Sat next to a table of kids with babies who yelled and screamed.  Then one of them shit their pants and it smelled like a dump for 20 minutes till we complained and asked to be moved.  Never got the soup I asked for.....  Never got a refill in the bread sticks.....  $17 for three tiny chicken strip pieces and some noodles.  They called it a meal?!?!?!   I do believe this is my last trip to this location!!!!!!
