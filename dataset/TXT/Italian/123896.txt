HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE  REASONS THAT I LOVE TO STAY AT PALLAZZO. They have a drink called amore with an espresso shot at the bottom with some non alcoholic liquor and heavy cream at the top so essentially the drink looks black and white. Also I had an affigato here which was to die for.
