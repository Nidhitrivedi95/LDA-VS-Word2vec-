1Ok2EXqdH-R0sy-_tyOrMg Bad food, worse service. Skip it.
We went on a quiet weekend when there was plenty of staff and open tables but lack of organization seemed to be rampant. The food really wasn't anything special and the service was terribly slow and not all that friendly. Also, the trays that the pizzas are brought out directly on are thenstored ON THE FLOOR/SIDEWALK once we were done. Absolutely disgusting.
