N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg Mmmmmm yes. I'll definitely be back to this joint and excited that it's so close to me! A girlfriend and I decided to grab a quick dinner before an event we were going to. We sat at the bar and stuck up a conversation with one of the bartenders and he told us about the restaurant, based out of Chicago and all of their pizzas are made fresh to order. 

We didn't feel like sharing a pizza so we each got our own personal deep dish. The crust was with the right amount of crunch and flakiness that has me wanting more. My mouth is watering right now! I got the pepperoni and my friend got the cheese. Fresh mozzarella and the crust made me swoon. The personal pizza is the perfect size for one person. I think I might pre-order and pick one up tonight!!!

The ambiance was very cool, just look at the pictures. Next time I want to sit outside and just grab a beer, pizza, and watch a game.
