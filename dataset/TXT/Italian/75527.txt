CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA The pizza here is pretty tasty, and the slices are HUGE- my stepdaughter got three meals out of a single slice.  I think they put entirely too much cheese on their pizza.  I like to be able to taste the sauce, and not have to search for it under an inch of gooey cheese.  I recognize that I'm probably in the minority in that sense.

The sandwich I had was so-so.  It's called the "Italian w/ peppers" or something along those lines, but there were no peppers on mine.  I like that they serve Boar's Head meats, because as far as lunchmeat goes theirs has the least amount of junk in it. 

Their fries were awful.  They tasted like reheated fast food fries.  I paid an extra $1.25 to "upgrade" but I won't do it again. 

All in all though, I'm glad this place is in my neighborhood.  It's clean, cheap, quick and the pizza is FAR better than any of the chain places in the area.
