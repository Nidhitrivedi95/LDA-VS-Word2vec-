AKThbDjd3WRUBOYOLOjb8A The food is mediocre, and I have had nothing but terrible experiences with their service since they moved into their new location. The teenage girls who work there do not listen at all when taking orders over the phone. My order has been wrong literally every time. Food has also been forgotten entirely when I chose delivery. Find some competent employees before you have no customers left. I'm officially done with Monte Cello's.
