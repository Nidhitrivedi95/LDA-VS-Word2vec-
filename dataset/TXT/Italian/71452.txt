C7bK6Sd0LcvH7SOAjQu3LA The food was great! However, beware if using a Groupon. My boyfriend and I decided to order drinks just to be nice. We order $16 worth of wine and were then expected to pay $13 worth of HST which was calculated based on the entire price of our "free" meal. They also didn't serve us any free bread. The server was great though. Even though we were the only ones in the restaurant
