ghpFh6XpH1TYZhjAGdx-xw I work nearby and this is a favorite place to get lunch! The people who work there are always friendly. The food is always amazing. I love their pizza! They are, of course wood fired, as the name suggests, so the crust is delicious. I've done pesto and red sauce as a base and then I load my pie up with all of my favorite toppings. Chicken, meatball, fresh mozzarella, artichokes, Sun dried tomatoes, peppers, kalamata olives, fresh garlic.... I could go on and on. Their salads are also wonderful! There is a choice of romaine, spring mix, iceberg and other lettuce which is nice, add your favorite toppings and they will toss the dressing on it for you if you want. The chipotle ranch is my favorite. I love the salads as much as the pizza! This place is great, only thing is that it gets VERY busy during lunch time. I always show up around 11 to avoid a long line. Problem solved!
