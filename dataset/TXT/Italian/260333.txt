French fries are real fresh cut and rival what you get at the Kennywood Potato Patch. My husband had the beans and greens and it was the best version of this classic that we have had in a long time.  Even their tiramasu had a delicious  twist with a raspberry garnish. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The decor and atmosphere are lovely.  Bathrooms are super clean. We intend to make this our new favorite.place.
