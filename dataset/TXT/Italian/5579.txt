_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw You know, I have to admit, I am not sure I am trusting Yelp anymore. It seems to me that there are some people posting here as a marketing ploy to falsely boost reviews. After reading the reviews here and seeing the spot on 3TV news, we were excited to give it a try. The service was exceptional, wine list was good, but the food..... OK at best. Not good. Not great. Just OK. We had the meatball appetizer that was the best part of the meal. Very tasty. Then a Pomo pizza. We liked the crust.... we were expecting a near Bianco quality pizza. Unfortunately not the case. Then we had the pasta dish with bolognese and peas. Again, it was ok, not good, not great.

We decided it would be good for future wine and appetizers.
