This is a hidden gem. Its usually packed and with good reason - the food is great and so is the service!
Lasagna is amazing and the garlic bread is top notch. Their red sauce is so good you could drink it!
Service is always quick and courteous. 
A little pricey (16$ for lasagna) but its worth it - fresh ingredients and comes out piping hot and scrumptious.
Family friendly.
