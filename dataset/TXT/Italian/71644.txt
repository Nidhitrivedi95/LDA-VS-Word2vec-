cA9LmSotIsN3C8zCI94--A I went here as part of a big group for a birthday party. The pizza was solid and the portions were generous. Service was spotty during the meal, but they didn't rush us out, either. I would definitely recommend this place for large groups. The location wasn't ideal via the TTC, but it didn't seem as busy as other places so we were able to hang out for a while after finishing our mains.
