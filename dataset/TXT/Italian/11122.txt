0PMKMyfX1j7Nc4esk1RaMg Humble Pie has a fantastic lunch special where you can get any salad and any pizza for under $10. The salads are great and there are a ton of different pizza options, including some fancy vegetarian ones. I had the apple arugula salad, which was amazing. It is such a refreshing salad, and the dressing was amazing. I also had the arugula pizza, which I picked because of the house-made mozzarella, and it was okay. The cheese was sort of grainy as opposed to being luscious and thick, and I didn't love the taste of the crust (tasted a little like Chinese food, which was unexpected), but overall it was satisfying. 

I would definitely come back here for a salad.
