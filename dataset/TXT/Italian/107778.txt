fYqr99HXATERIGXQmjSgmw Went there last week on a Groupon.
I'll keep it simple.
Go there.
Eat.
Enjoy.
Since Yelp is telling me that my review is on the short side, l will bore you all with some useless details:
-I had the crab cakes.  While not as good as Andora's, they're still pretty good.
-my wife had the lasagna.  She said it was excellent.
-my compliments to the server,too.
Go there.
Eat.
Enjoy.
