AAc1Ob8MPxNUycjZ0kEd1Q Had dinner with friends at Yolanda's for the first time this weekend. This place is a big improvement over the previous restaurant that was located here. Had the braised short rib with polenta and an outstanding seafood soup for a starter. Excellent wine menu to go along with the food.
