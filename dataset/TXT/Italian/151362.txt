kO-2Bv52yUG3YVP0bIL5qA My husband and I were very satisfied with our experience at this restaurant!  From the minute we were greeted at the door to the moment we left!

We were promptly greeted at the door!  The staff is very polite! Service was at a great pace!  Not rushing us and not pushing us out the door!

The food was amazing!  I had the primavera pizza which was very good!!!  They bring you a little homemade spicy oil on the table to accompany the pizza if you want to add a little!  I dared and was not disappointed!  Added a little zing to the pizza!  Loved it!  
My husband started out out with the polpetta parmigiana as an appetizer (that I gladly shared).
(2 meatballs in tomato sauce with basil and shaved parmigiana cheese)  These were so amazing!  
His main course was linguine fruit de mer.  Lots of sea food in his plate and the pasta was cooked to perfection.  And what to say of the taste?  Yum yum!  All in all, this was our first experience, but not not our last!
I definitely recommend this restaurant!
