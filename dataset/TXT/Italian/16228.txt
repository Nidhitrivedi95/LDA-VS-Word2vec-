1WBVqmo7tgF0z0eGf4fPhQ This was my first visit to PastaIdea. Visiting Las Vegas from Los Angeles and craving Italian food, I did an online search and found PastaIdea among the search results. The name almost prevented me from going there because it seems like a strange, and not particularly inviting, name for a restaurant but the food had good online reviews so I decided to try it. The restaurant is very small, has little eye appeal and even less atmosphere. Doesn't really look or feel like an Italian restaurant but looks more like a space that would be used for a coffee bar or frozen yogurt shop. The food was very good - well prepared and flavorful. But the woman that served us, although quite pleasant and helpful, was behind the counter preparing a take-out order for someone and kept putting her fingers in her mouth to moisten them to open the plastic bags to put the to-go containers in. Should a food server be putting their fingers in their mouth and then touching plates to serve to customers? It's disgusting and probably a health code violation besides. Based on the overall experience, I will probably not return in the future.
