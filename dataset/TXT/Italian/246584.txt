V1JEkeAem05hps5ZCmMIgw Good bloody's but the food quality is very low and pricey for what you get. I ordered grilled shrimp salad and the shrimp were bits and pieces of shrimp and not a lot of them. The Mother Nature sandwich was delivered incorrect and was missing the main ingredient - the portobello mushroom. Disappointing experience.
