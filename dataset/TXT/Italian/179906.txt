nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Soooooo pleasantly suprised by this place. Went to the famous Cake Boss bakery since there are only 2 stores world wide! After standing in line at the bakery we found ourselves starving and impatient so we decided to just go into this sister restaurant right across the hall. Went in with no expectations and having read nothing about the place and was totally blown away! 

I had the chicken ceasar salad cause after spending 3 days in vegas all I wanted were vegetables and water. The romaine was crisp, the dressing was yummy, and the crutons were the star of the dish... parmesan polenta crutons!? That's a thing? You're damn right that's a thing and it's amazing! Would give it a full 5 but they were a bit skimpy on the chicken. 4.5/5

The man ordered the Philly Cheese Sandwich which was also delicious. Crisp and soft bread, ooy-gooy cheese, juicey thin slices of perfectly seasoned meat. It's not a traditional Philly in any sense but it's truely one of the best I've ever had. 5/5

Might I add they offer the dessert we were standing in line for at the bakery. Kind of wish we had just dined here and ordered a pastry for dessert!

Would definitely dine here again give it a shot for sure!
