iLLzOJLU4tPAN9UUHlyZiQ The 4 of us went for my brother's birthday, I was the only one that tried Restaurant Week while the others ordered off the menu...

PROS
The decor was simple and chic without trying to be overly trendy, music was just loud enough to have good energy
Service was great, she was attentive and had great recommendations
Octopus - same as Virtu just at way better prices, chickpeas and the sauce are a great touch for texture and flavor
My fiancee and brother shared the Prime Rib for 2, it was so much protein that came with a tasty aioli and salad
Loved the salted caramel profiteroles, generous with 3 of those bites

CONS
My pasta which was more like a lasagna was good it just wasn't great

Will have to try HH next time
