74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw Very disappointing. Caesar salad had two potato crisps instead of croutons and they tasted like two Ruffles potato chips. They also were generous and included one pepperoni in my salad.  Literrally one slice of pepperoni.  Veal scallopini was over cooked, dry, bland, difficult to cut and rubbery. Marsala sauce and mushroom and asparagus were good but pretty hard to screw up mushrooms and asparagus in wine sauce.  Waiter was very gracious and brought me a Chilean sea bass crusted with potato and olive oil. It made the exterior of fish taste very dry. Once I was able to break through that crust the fish om the inside was delicious. Flaky, tender and seasoned perfectly. The fingerling potatoes were ok.  Being a chocoholic i was hoping the Flourless chocolate cake Would redeem them. It did not.
