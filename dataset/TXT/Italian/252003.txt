VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Came here with a reservation for a Bachelorette party. Staff were all very nice and accommodating, with overall good service. We sat outside which was nice and we actually were able to watch the Treasure Island show while eating dinner.

As for the food, I didn't think it was all that good. Most of us ordered the meatball, which was just one large meatball cut into 4 sections (we shared, too). The spaghetti was fine, but I would say is overpriced for what it is. 

If you're looking for amazing food I don't think Lavo cuts it.
