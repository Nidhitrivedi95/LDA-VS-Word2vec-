qMOyKuyZpFH-Lmszd3Mn-A I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  It was getting sort of late for dinner and we were looking for a place close by and since we were already at Ballys, we decided to give this place a shot.
I had read a few bad reviews for it on Yelp, but decided to try it anyway.
It turned out to be pretty good.  It is not the greatest food ever, but it was good enough.  
I tried the 3 course meal for $19.99.
Started with a Minestrone soup.  It was more like a navy bean soup, but it was very good.
Second course was lasagna.  Not the best I've had, but far from the worst.  I enjoyed it and the portion was enough to get full and just enough to keep from getting stuffed.
Third course was the Tiramisu.  Warning!!!: As others have mentioned, it is not your typical Tiramisu.  It is served in a cup and it is like a mousse.  It was pretty good.  I didn't care for it too much.  Waiter didn't even give us the option for gelatto, just brought the Tiramisu.
Overall, the service was very good also.  The hostess was very nice and seated us right away.  Our drink orders were taken immediately and water was brought to us without asking.  Meal came out hot, in a timely manner. Dark atmosphere, but very fitting.
The price was just right.
I'll go back whenever I need a quick, cheap Italian fix.
