But the food at La Tavola, from the salad dressing, to the garlic bread, to the tiramisu is lovely. The 1st time we didn't have a reservation, but we had genuine smiles and 3 bottles of wine, the hostess found us a table and we had a great time, she was also our server. The 2nd time, reservations were made and we were even seated early (8:00) our server was non-existent. We had to get up and go get a pitcher of water for refills, and she overcharged us on the corkage fee. Supposed to be $5 for wine, she charged $7.50. The food was still amazing, so they get 4 stars - try the Chicken Jolina, named after the chef herself! They also had a number of chef's specials that sounded great - duck apple ravioli.. delicious.
