C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA My friends and I had a lovely lunch here last Saturday afternoon.  I ordered a Nanette with caramelized onions, goat-cheese and bacon.  It was delicious.  The portion size was great.  It came with a side salad.

Presentation could have been slightly better (I don't like my salad touching anything warm on my plate).  We had a nice spot on the outdoor patio.  Service was fairly quick and the staff were polite.  I was tempted to order drinks but was attending a wedding for later, so I will have to return for cocktails!

My only true complaint is that their patio had its fair share of WASPS.  And I hate those pesky buggers, so I was on edge while consuming my lunch.
