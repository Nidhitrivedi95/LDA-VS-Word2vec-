BQqwIYQuo2W94smjrBjy5g We saw that this restaurant had opened in our neighborhood, so we wanted to give it a try. My husband had the chicken marsala.  He has a thing about ordering this at almost every italian restaurant.  This is how he decides whether the food is good or not.  It was amazing!  I had the cheese tortellini - tons of chicken and gooey cheese!
We also had two appetizers and they were equally delicious. 
Service was outstanding - Chef Rudy came by several times to check on us.  Obviously takes pride in his work.  Staff was friendly and attentive!
 We will definitely be coming back!
