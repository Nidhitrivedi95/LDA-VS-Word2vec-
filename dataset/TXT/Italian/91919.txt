eGTAC8EzcHiYnnZ52tijiQ This restaurant is OH MY, HOLY FAR! But this place is OH SO WORTH THE DRIVE! 

Everything Stoney's that I put in my mouth (with the exception of dessert) was more than delicious. And here are the items I ate during my first and only visit (but soon to be alot more than the one time): 

- butternut squash and pear soup 
- spinach salad with poached pears, apricots, spiced pecans, cambozola, champagne vinaigrette and more yummy goodness
- pulled pork sandwich with garlic aioli 
- bilbao pizza (chorizo, mushrooms, bacon, garlic, cambozola) 
- ratatouille with goat cheese on naan 
- a mini banana cream pie 

As you can tell, my belly was content! 

Next time though, I'll pass on the banana cream pie. The banana flavouring tasted artificial, but to Stoney's defense - I don't think they bake their own desserts. Too bad, they don't bake their own desserts. If they did than this place would be heaven!

I can't wait to try this place for Sunday brunch... and all the other meals and snack times that exist!
