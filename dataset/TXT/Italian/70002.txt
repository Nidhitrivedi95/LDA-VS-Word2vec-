By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g If I could give this place twenty stars, I would. My boyfriend and I came here Thursday night to celebrate his birthday and it was amazing! Scott Conant is my favorite male judge on food network so I was so excited when I saw it was his restaurant. We got calamari, caprese, pasta with shrimp & lobster, and the salted caramel dessert. Our waitress, I wish I remembered her name, was so attentive, everyone was! They are on top of things and it was so relieving. The manager was nice enough to come wish my boyfriend a happy birthday, I believe highly in making your customers feel welcomed.

I can't wait to come eat here again in October when we're in Vegas. I recommend it highly! You won't be disappointed!
