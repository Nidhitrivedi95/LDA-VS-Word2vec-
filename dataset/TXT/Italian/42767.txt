7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw Came in for a quick bite before the music at Kierland. If we didn't chose to eat outside the not so busy place was on a 45 min wait?!?! Whatever outside wasn't that bad with misters. The Dr. Pepper I ordered my 4 year old came out a diet coke. Even he knew the difference and refused to drink it so I asked for a Chocolate Milk instead. Then we were charged for the Dr.Pepper we NEVER got and a kids drink was supposed to come with his meal! He got the Crispy Chicken which was a lot of food and good. Not your typical kids chicken fingers. Unfortunately my 4 year old doesn't like rosemary so he would barely eat it. The fries were large and saturated with grease. Our Pitcher of Sangria was so full of ice it would have been cheaper to order it by the glass! When we went to fill our cups back up the second time the ice was overflowing out of the small glass onto the table and the tiny amount of liquid was left at the bottom. No bread was brought to start we had to ask for it while we ate because the bread they supply to soak up the juice of the mussels was hard like a crouton. The Mussels were alright but tasted like bitter burnt garlic (in fact we found large amounts of burnt garlic in it). We ended up leaving after our appetizer since the service and food was so bad.
