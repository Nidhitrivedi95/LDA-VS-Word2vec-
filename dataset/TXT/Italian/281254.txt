YsQ4Abm2E7lozSvP3ZfVWw Beautiful space and really enjoyed our meal here. Staff was super friendly and the owner was out making sure everything was amazing -  which it was! Especially enjoyed the grilled haloumi with grilled veggies - they were so smoky and flavorful would definitely get this again. Their Caesar salad was super refreshing and tasty.  I ordered the special lamb shank that was so tender and melted in your mouth!  It was served over a creamy and flavorful mushroom risotto that was the perfect accompaniment to the lamb.  Great meal - would definitely come back!
