eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA Great spot in Tivoli village...especially for happy hour.  I had cheese ravioli and it was amazing - and very cheap!  They also serve mojitos, which are one of my favorite drinks.  The scenery is usually pretty good and Tivoli village is a great cozy atmosphere.  Easy parking underneath and easy access from Summerlin Parkway make this a winner...
