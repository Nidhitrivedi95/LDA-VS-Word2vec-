G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I was excited to try this restaurant because I love Giadas recipes. We arrived for lunch and were seated at the bar, which was fine as we had no reservation. Bartender was friendly and helpful. We ordered and he brought our drinks. After 50 minutes of waiting, and seeing other orders after ours we inquired the status. He said it was in the queue and they were really busy. After another fifteen minutes and two more inquiries we informed him we were leaving. He didn't charge for the drinks but it was pretty disappointing to have to start over finding another lunch spot!
