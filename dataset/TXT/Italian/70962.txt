C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA This is a really cute little restaurant that serves an Indian fusion style of food. For example I ordered a nanette (nanette #5 to be exact) and it's basically a pizza on naan. (Be aware the people working here may try to convince you it's an open-faced sandwich. It isn't.) And it was really quite good. The nanette came with artichokes, roasted red peppers, pesto, and I added Italian Sausage to it. It also was served with a small green salad on the side.

Our servers were lovely, bringing refills of coffee, hot water, and cool water as we needed them, but letting the three of us languish around the table with no rush. It's possible this is how everyone is in Toronto, but as an American where it sometimes seems as though servers might hate you based on the way they actively try to get you to leave I appreciated it.

There were three main menu sections and if I lived in the area I'd definitely be back to try another nanette, or a scroll, or possibly even a plain old sandwich or piece of quiche. As it stands I'm glad for the opportunity to try one of them.
