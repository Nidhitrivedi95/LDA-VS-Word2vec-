qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ Amazing!! We heard about this delicious pizza from a friend and decided to make the trek from San Tan Valley to Mesa. Totally worth the drive. The pizza was great, even my daughter thought so and she is not a pizza lover. 
The staff was great! As soon as I walked in I was greeted by Tony. He asked our names, mine and hubby's, then proceeded to advise the staff we came all the way from San Tan Valley to eat. They all welcomed us. 
The sweet girl brought us free garlic knots since it was our first visit there as well. 
Then as we were eating Tony came to the tables to ensure we were enjoying our pizza. He even addressed my husband by his first name again. A bit later he came to check on us and brought us a box for our leftover pizza. Thanked me by my first name for coming. 
We will for sure be making the drive to see them again for pizza!!
