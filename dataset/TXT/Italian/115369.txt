Grr2wJ3nYD_7qUyespDglA Pretty decent Italian food. What mostly drew us in were the softball sized arancini. While delicious and flavorful, I would like to try one of these made with the risotto rice rather than the plain white rice. The mozzarella poutine was delicious and pizza was flavorful and had plentiful toppings. Definitely happy I tried this and it was soooo filling!
