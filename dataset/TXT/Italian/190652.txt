pa2Y633N7lG7SHCIriE8GQ I know, I know...it's a chain, but we don't have them in Cali and it's so good!! I got the chopped salad and a side of meatballs, because I like my meats. Their to go system is probably one of the best I've encountered. My chopped salad came with the chicken and dressing on the side, so it wouldn't get soggy! They also have to-go olive oil packets with a side of the herbs to dip your bread in!! I mean, that is really next level service if you ask me!! The salad was delicious with crispy lettuce, spicy pepperoni and perfectly grilled chicken. The meatballs were tender and the sauce was good, but could have used just a tad more spice. But again, I can't say enough about their to-go game!!
