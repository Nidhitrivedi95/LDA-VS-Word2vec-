The pasta sauce tastes like it came from a can, the ceasar salad dressing tastes like Kraft's with extra garlic and the pizza is pretty much comparable to anything put forth by the big chains like Pizza Pizza. It's just unoriginal and totally uninspired.

The service is good, the waitstaff is attentive and it's usually pretty busy especially on the weekends. I'm just not a fan however and prefer a restaurant with a better standard when it comes to "Italian" food.
