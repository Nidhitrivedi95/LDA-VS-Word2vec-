n-BoGXG2NItNbr_PMtIRBg We were running some errands in the University area and decided to get dinner. Once again, we let the web guide us and this place seemed to be well-liked. 

We decided to sit outside, and that immediately caused a bit of an issue - the chairs are chained to the tables and it results in a somewhat awkward and uncomfortable seating position. Strange, and they never offered to unchain them for us.

Service was fast, polite and responsive. The menu seemed to be what one would expect from an Italian place. We started with the garlic knots - pizza dough with herbs and a marinara sauce. The knots themselves were tasty, but the marinara was a bit on the runny side. The bread that came with the meal was spectacular. We realize now that we should have ordered sandwiches. They're bound to be good on that bread.

We did not. We ordered chicken-stuffed shells and the fettuccine with ham, pancetta, mushrooms and peas. The shells came on a plate straight out of the pizza oven. My wife found the portion to be generous, but the dish was too salty. The fettuccine was perfectly al dente to me, but the sauce had broken, leaving oil/fat at the bottom of the bowl. Still tasty, but not ideal.

If we make it back, we'll be trying the sandwiches just to get more of that bread.
