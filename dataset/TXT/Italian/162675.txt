lsfFzCl7SXgoq8N5NjbvZA I was here with no reservation for lunch with a party of three and were promptly seated at 12, but the place filled up very quickly. It seems that the owner was helping serve that day.

We all had the veal and the soup of the day. The veal comes with a side of cooked veggies and some pasta (linguini that day) seasoned appropriately depending how you wanted your veal.

But, oh my god, the veal parm here is to die for.

What a solid meal for $15(?) CAD...
