kzbH1_l7VTSfFFcwTqY6vA The Greens and Beans are pretty good.  The have a hot sausage inside the dish that kicks it out of the park.  I love the crab cake salad.  It is a large crab cake that has no breading inside, you are getting all crab meat.  It is breath of fresh air!

The restaurant is intimate and relaxing.  The tables are close, but everyone minds their own business.  They offer corking fees if you want to bring your favorite wine, or a first date.

If you ask them for a recipe, they give it to you.  I asked them for their greens and beans recipe.  They gave it to me!!  I think they felt bad for me because I live out of state.
