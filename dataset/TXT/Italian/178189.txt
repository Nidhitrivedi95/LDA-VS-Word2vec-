nOykFBuMLOuw3ZB2WTk50g Terrible service, made us wait for 30 minutes before seating us at tables without cutlery or plates. The food was served before cutlery and we weren't given any until asked. All you can eat bread and salad was never restocked even after asking twice. Food was below par, greasy and un appetizing. No one bothered to come around with the cheque for the longest time possible. Don't bother coming here unless you are really hungry and there's no food for miles. Would have given negative stars if possible.
