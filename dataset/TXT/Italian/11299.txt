0pWGYVBxkufNn8MDCcA7cA Came here yesterday with family. We accidentally missed our reservation time but the host was great and the place was empty at the time so we lucked out. The ambiance is nice, we were seated at a large table in the back.

To start off we got a pitcher of the Bianco sangria which was delicious!

I got the chicken caesar salad. Yes I was THAT person who got salad as an entrée. BUT it was good. The chicken was grilled, fresh and the lettuce was nicely dressed. 

We also got the atomica pizza, salmon, and butternut squash ravioli. The atomica was a delicious thin crust pizza with tons of toppings. The person who got this definitely liked it. The salmon had a crispy crust and was nicely seasoned. It came with risotto which was a bit too creamy. But still delicious. And the butternut squash ravioli was sweet with a creamy sauce. The people who shared this dish enjoyed it as well. 

Overall, it was a great meal!
