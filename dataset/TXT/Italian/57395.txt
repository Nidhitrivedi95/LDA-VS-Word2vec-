anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg Last Thursday night we went to Piero's upon the suggestion of a coworker, who loves this place above all. I did not know what to expect and was surprised when my husband instantly recognized it as the restaurant from his favorite movie CASINO. I thought that the decor was very reminiscent of old Las Vegas and the waiting staff did take great care of us. I ordered a special - almond encrusted sea bass with mashed potatoes and green beans, and my husband has the seafood linguini. I thought that the food was very good. The fish was moist, the pasta al dente, and everything was well seasoned.  Yes, I would go there again and yes, I would recommend Piero's to a friend. My suggestion to you is: dress up and enjoy a night out in old Las Vegas.
