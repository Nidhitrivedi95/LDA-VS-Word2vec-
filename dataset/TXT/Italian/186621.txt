Orgm9nmcClxnAUva4nOKyA Not our first choice for valentine's dinner but they had room and away we went! Service throughout was excellent.  Lovey had the fixed price menu ($45) and I went for just a main.  She started with the crostini with beets and mushrooms, followed by beef wellington.  Both were excellent with the main being done a perfect medium-rare. My main was the chicken stir fry - a large portion! dish that came out hot and perfectly done. Loveys desert was the pannacotta - she did all but lick the plate!

Got to admit it was hard to find any reason not to like this restaurant!  Great service,  great food and the ambiance was nice! Absolutely would recommend this restaurant!
