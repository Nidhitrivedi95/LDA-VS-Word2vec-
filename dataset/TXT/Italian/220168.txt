SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Two stars means "I've experienced better". And in this case, I have experienced FAR better than this place. Came with a group of about 15. Did not get bread until the food was served. The server came only to take the orders. No explanation or recommendation of ANY kind. The non-Happy-Hour prices are far above than regular prices at other steakhouses. That might be somewhat palatable if there were comparable stellar service to go with. The whole dining experience is not just about the food. It takes into account the experience from the moment you step inside to the moment you step out of the restaurant. This place sorely lacked in making this a positively-memorable experience. It did succeed in leaving us with a bad taste in the mouth (metaphorically speaking). Perhaps they are not too enthusiastic about having large groups come and dine. We knew ahead of time that they would not make separate checks. But trying to figure out everyone's share was like deciphering a code. The bills lists the regular price, the Happy hour price and a total of what we "saved" because of Happy hour.   The 20% automatic gratuity was a real killer. The service did not deserve any kind of gratuity. Upon discussing with one of the employees, his comment was "this is company policy, we just work here". REALLY!!! Perhaps someone should explain to him what "service" in customer service means!! He stated the gratuity policy is in the menu. I guess it must be in some fine print because it did not catch my eye when I was looking over the menu for ordering. 

BOTTOM LINE: T-Bone at Redrock, Fleming's, Del Friscos, Echo and Rig, Alder and Birch have far better service and food for less than H&R's regular prices. I am not planning on coming there any time soon!
