nY2oBwH3s5sKox1mERIoVQ Epicure was stop three on the French Fry crawl, riding high off the success of Hero Burger. We entered & were told to head upstairs. The view of the staircase made my mind utter "uh oh" as it looked like the creepy old stairs in a haunted house; but when we got to the 2nd level, I was surprised. Upstairs was really nice. It gave that air of a club in a 40s movie, lead actor & his buddy sitting at some table shrouded in smoke with maybe Ella singing with her band. They played some great jazz (Dave O. was so excited to hear Coltrane & rightfully so!) & we all eased our coats off and got down to business.

I truly enjoyed our server. She seemed slightly stumped when Sarah asked her about beers on tap vs beers on the menu but she recovered nicely, I thought. She also asked if we wanted mayo with your fries which most places I'm left asking for.

The fries were delicious. They didn't taste like McD's (obvious 3 stars there!). They were perfectly cooked and I LOVED the extra touch of spoons in both the ketchup & mayo cup for us to spoon on our plates. The pile of fries went down pretty quickly. Mel D. was great enough to bring us some fries from Oh Boy to compare, and the Epicure Cafe fries were definitely better than Oh Boy. Also, maybe the waitress didn't see, but she was nice enough not to say anything or give the covert snotty attitude at seeing us bring in & consume outside food.

Epicure serves up a great locale to chat with friends, get good service and enjoy some really good food. I'll definitely be back again.
