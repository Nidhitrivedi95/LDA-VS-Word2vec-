i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw My wife LOVES this Deli, especially the Italian subs (I think it is the prosciutto, salami and Asiago that is her favorite).  Whether she is having a bad day or wants to celebrate - this Deli is good for both.  The price and the service are both great and will keep you coming back for more!!
