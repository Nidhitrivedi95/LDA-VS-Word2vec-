aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA Extremely disappointed!  Worst experience at an Oregano's. So mad I was the one who recommended going there for lunch with my husband. He gets his food, which was wrong & that was it. Mine never showed up. When the server assisting our main server brought again the wrong item for my husband, she asked if there was anything else we needed. Ah, yay, my food. Clueless, she goes to check. Comes back a few minutes later & starts cleaning the table next to us. Hello, did you find my salad??  She says yes, your server is getting it. Out he comes & starts assisting another table. He finally comes over & admits it was never submitted. He then places my salad order again & attempts to correct my husbands order. 20 minutes later the salad arrives with the correct side order for my husband. He's been done eating for 15 minutes, so what was the point? I get my salad to go because we were short on time. 

I ordered a $6.00 glass of wine which took forever to get, but at least I got it. Sure enough, we are charged for everything. Shame on you Oregano's. At least comp the wine, if not the salad I never got to enjoy for lunch. I'll be hard pressed to ever recommend going back. So disappointing. Being in the service industry, this could have been handled so much better than it was.
