OpCWTpPscK2WCAO_XlztUg Great place for lunch... I recommend staying away from the pasta but , get veal or chicken sandwiches or plates instead... 

-veal without bun, ( or chicken) add eggplant and do not dip the eggplant in sauce. Ask for hot sauce ( which is the juice from the hot peppers) , and as well, sweet peppers and as many hot peppers as you like...

For dessert.... Eclair!!! Best ever (I don't generally like eclairs but this place makes the good)
