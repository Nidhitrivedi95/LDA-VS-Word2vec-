fdX_eu-dCaKsDaK_itNIzQ Quick and friendly service, tasty food, and an adorable ambiance makes for a great experience at Tutto each and every time. 

I always order the Tutto Pasta - bowtie pasta sauteed with onions, mushrooms, chicken, with a light tomato cream sauce. Trust me, it is insanely good. There is just no way you could ever be disappointed with this dish. Plus it usually (sometimes) lasts for 2 meals which is always a plus. 

Not a huge fan of their bread they serve before the meal but i still can't help but grab a piece. I mean it's just sitting right in front of me...
