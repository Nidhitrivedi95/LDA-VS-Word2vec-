NBMCSTtayMJJisWSZ6WuwA My first 4 stars review! I think Toronto (and all other cities) need more of a 4 star places. Not disappointing but nothing to die for. Just good food. 

I'm a fan of the location of the Obika mozarrella bar, especially in winter. During Christmas time it feels like you're on some big square, with decorations, fountains and the rest.

On to the food - mozzarella is real good genuine stuff and all that. Add the real San Danielle prosciutto on top of that, and for 20$ you have a meal that can possibly compare to the one you would have in Rome (although I haven't gone yet to Obika in Rome to compare.) Ravioli is surprisingly tasty (reminds me of Italy as well, ravioli as a very boring food takes the new meaning there), and a special lasagna of the day with ragu and fresh mozzarella on top. I'll take it any day.

Service is satisfying, nothing super-fast but not disappointing.
