yPgUkQxj8CYPKF89HV65kg Lombardino's is a terrific restaurant and their attention to detail really shows. I had the Insalata Caprese (with fresh, local tomatoes and delicious prosciutto). The ham on the salad wasn't exactly authentic, but it still tasted great. 

For my main course, I had the Tuscan fired fillet - also great and served with local vegetables. I suppose the price ($38) was a bit steep for such a small portion. 

For dessert, I had the tiramisu, also really fresh and delicious. Unfortunately, Lombardino's espresso machine was broken, so I couldn't enjoy local Collectivo coffee with my dessert.

They have a reasonable wine list and the service is very good (keep in mind they're only open for dinner).
