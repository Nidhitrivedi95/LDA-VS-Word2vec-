3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg food was awesone, service good, ambiance elegant.  But as a 5 star restaurant they failed miserably to my first time there.  One thing alone made me feel inadequate and taken advantage of by the corporate evils.  It may seem innocent or even incidental, both here is how I sew it....  6 of us spent $700 total. just after and even during the meal serving,  i made aware to the waitress that we dis not receive a side item. She asked me if she could bring it or take off of bill. I said take off of bill. When thr bill came an hour later,  we paid.  Then i noticed that the $9 side item was still on bill and we paid for it. Again I told waitress about this. She came back and put $9 on the table where 6 people just got finished paying $700.  who gives a crap about $9 cash between 6 people??  sheeesh after the heads up I gave the waitress, I would expect a different customer service tactic. What do u think?
