gTPKyLrVlPVTs9XojH1SlA My girlfriend and I went to this restaurant recently on a Friday night, we hadn't booked so the waiter promised us a table soon if we had a drink by the bar, he gave us some cheap watery olives and our drinks and within 10 minutes we were given a table. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, although had Spanish music playing throughout the evening so not what I would call authentic Italian. The food was of good quality. The waiter serving us avoided eye contact, appeared to want to be elsewhere whilst taking our order, staff not particularly attentive. Overall a good evening was had but this could have been better if the waiters had actually looked at us whilst serving!
