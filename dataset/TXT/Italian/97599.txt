Didn't really eat any of it because I'm not a fan of fried squid.  The server noticed we weren't touching it, and the manager came out to make sure everything was okay.  I explained the mistake and how it wasn't anything wrong with the food, and he comped it anyway.  That alone is enough to get us to go back.
