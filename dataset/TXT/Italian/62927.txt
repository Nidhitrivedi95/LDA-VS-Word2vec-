ANTIPASTI - We started out with CAPRACCIO, which was a good share plate, was delicious infused with a lemony flavour.  If you like raw meat, this is the dish for you, they did it very well.

INSALATE - we balanced it with a very light, and refreshing CAVOLO NERO - kale and nuts, it was very well done, this is a great side dish to break up any richness of other dishes.  We had this with the pasta and it worked out really nicely.

MAINS - we did a  PIZZE, the SALCICCE.  This was a bit spicy, tomato-y and sausage-y.  It had a bit of tang and was was a good size, like a small pizza - good to share or eat on your own.

PASTA - our lovely server recommended a great pasta dish: PAPPARDELLE AI FUNGHI - they used shaved portobello mushrooms mixed into some FRESH homemade pasta, this was the best dish out of all the dishes of the night and I highly recommend.

BEST OF ALL - $1 for 1 Ounce of VINO bianco or rossi.  WHATTTTT, you can drink a glass of homemade wine for 6 dollars, for a nice restaurant - that is amazing.  And it was delicious too, it wasn't like normal homemade wines, which are ghetto, sharp and intangible.

The ambiance is good.  If you want to go, you must go early or during the week.  I've attempted to go on a Sat night for dinner - I went at 9 and the wait was 1.45 hours!  Fun people, great looking crowd, definately fun on a night out on the town.
