Ya9FMj-MWMkeMcog06N5bQ A salad, by definition being a simple combination of predetermined items one has on-hand, is usually difficult to mess up.  Leave it to Bar Louie to accomplish such an unlikely feat.

I ordered the Blackberry, Orange, & Brie salad: mixed greens, brie, oranges, blackberries, pecans, bacon, basil, and bacon vinaigrette.  The menu gives the option to add salmon and I took them up on this offer.  For those keeping track, that's nine items.  My salad arrived without one-third of them.  No salmon.  I asked and the server returned, salmon in hand.  Also, no bacon.  I asked, and was presented with a cup of cold, whole slices of bacon.  I've never met a piece of bacon I didn't like.  So, I spread the bacon lovelies out and grabbed my knife to cut them.  But this bacon, I discovered, was caked with cold congealed bacon grease - gross.  I sent the salad back.  I just couldn't bring myself to chomp on chilled bacon fat. For the first time in the history of this diehard devotee of the pork candy, I found a bad piece of bacon. Or at least the kind of chef who can manage to destroy two seemingly foolproof food items: bacon and salad.

To add insult to injury the service time was abysmal. I came from work with a group of about ten.  We called the day before to make a reservation for noon after being assured the restaurant would be able to serve us in an hour.  We arrived just before noon and ordered by 12:10.  Our food arrived in five stages, one brought by an apologetic manager, and the last not arriving until after 1.
