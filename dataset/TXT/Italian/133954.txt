IQ3esF7MvIOCbeVetW51Ng Just had dinner at HK for the first time in a while. My mistake. Better than ever! Can I rate it 7/5?! The four of us started with a wild mushroom "Sproutzza" as an appetizer. Delicious. We didn't want the Borgonzola cheese on it, and so asked our server to let the kitchen decide what to replace it with ... did I say delicious already? Definitely go for a Sproutzza -- either shared or as a meal. A truly unique offering. For our mains, after much deliberation (it all looks so good!) we settled on one Bolognese, two grass-fed HK burgers (one with fries; one with a squash soup special), and one duck special. Everything was delicious. I've said that already, I know. We had a great time sharing bites and tastes. The Bolognese was perfect and fulfilling on a cold December evening. The HK burger... well I doubt you'll find a tastier one anywhere in the city. Definitely won't find better fries anywhere. Haven't had better anywhere. Period. Good thing my daughter was feeling generous with her fries! The duck special was beautifully prepared, and came with gorgeously grilled vegetables... I pinched a Brussel Sprout... and then several more from my partner. She was happy to swap for some Bolognese, so all was good. Okay. Enough about the food. Can't say enough about the servers either. Great touch. Really know how to make your experience enjoyable. Thank you HK for making a great meal a great experience. I won't make the same mistake again; will be back long before "a while" has passed!
