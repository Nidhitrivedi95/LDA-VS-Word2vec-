SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Made reservations online for 7pm dinner and immediately received a confirmation from Michelle Meyer.  Shortly we moved up our reservation to 7:30pm and Michelle responded with "sure".

We arrived at 7:05pm but circled the parking lot twice and thought maybe we should eat elsewhere.  However, after 15 minutes of circling Chinatown, we decided to try Herbs and Rye once more.  Found a parking spot - at this point it was 7:25pm.

Walked in with a sleuth of people waiting looking very anxious.  Approached Brittney at the podium and was immediately attacked in a loud tone that we were late and can't hold tables more than 30 minutes.  I explained to her that our reservation changed to 7:30pm.  Showed her the email and Brittney's response was "well no one told me!"  My husband and I were shocked to have been spoken to in that matter in front of a line of customers.  The waiting area is very small and narrow that the waiting customers can't help but hear the conversation. Brittney says we'll need to wait 30 minutes since she was never informed.  Not even a apology.

We walked out as  I refuse to be ridiculed and belittled by a 21 year old who has no clue when it comes to service.  Treating customers as if we should be honored that she's holding the golden key into dining with Herbs & Rye.

We drove from the Southwest side because of the raving reviews and recommendations of this restaurant.  No thank you.   Not wasting our hard money for tactless experience.  We opted for dinner on the Strip.  Pricier - but a better and classier dining experience. 

It's unfortunate that Britney is Herb & Rye's front face and first point of contact.  Suggestion: send her to customer service and etiquette training.
