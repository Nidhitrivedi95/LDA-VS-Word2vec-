5sTFevXhGx01eLT4wF7Urg The Four of us were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere when we arrived at Tanzy. A lot of places have crowds but no energy. This place has a buzz!          
 The appetizer of fried Brussel sprouts and calamari were both fantastic! Anyone who can make br. Sprouts taste like anything except br sprouts is a genius.  The calamari isn't your typical batter fried dish either. Sauteed  with some veggies  only raised our expectations for dinner.

My fish dish served on polenta was really good. The fillet equally good. We all agreed though that the braised beef dish was just ok. The beef itself was good but the  gnocci and spinach that accompanied the beef was bland, that's it. 

The signature drinks were not memorable

We will definitely return.
