9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg I came here once on a Wednesday night to celebrate a special occasion. I had the best service I could possibly ask for, kudos to Greg for the personable service. We also received a complimentary serving of bruschetta since we said it was our first time. 

The food itself was alright, the giant meatball was excellent! The pasta on the other hand, not exactly my favourite. I got the bolognese and my friends ordered the baked carbonara. The carbonara was delicious! Very tasty and strong, perfect for a cold winter night. The bolognese on the other hand, was not to my liking. It was not al dente like I expected (though I guess that is a preference) and it stuck together like a ball. Nevertheless, decent food for fair prices. 

Would come back.
