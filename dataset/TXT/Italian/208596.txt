qRdrn0rDaL9b1z5jjoMkmg I'm baffled by the poor reviews here. I really loved this place! Came on a Monday night and sat outside on the terrasse. 

The "Antipasto Olivia" was excellent - a perfect variety of olives, nuts, veggies, cheese etc. 

I had the Linguini Gigi, and my husband had the steak tartare. We both loved our meals!  The pasta was perfectly al dente and very tasty, but... a bit salty.  

The wine list is good (I enjoyed the Bourgogne), but the beer options are totally lacking.  What a crap list of tap options. Such a shame. 

The food was really great, and the wait staff couldn't have been friendlier!  Everyone we dealt with was super nice and chatty, bilingual, and just overall number 1. 

Give it a try. Srsly.
