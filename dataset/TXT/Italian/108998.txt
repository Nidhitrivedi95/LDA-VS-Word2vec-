G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q We had breakfast at Giada's and it was underwhelming. Our eggs were mediocre at best - they were dry, and not very tasty. The frittata that I ordered didn't even come with a slice of toast. It was pitiful. And my aunt had scrambled eggs which were unseasoned and bland. The lemon smashed potatoes didn't taste like lemon at all... they tasted like dried out potatoes that had been left out all day. yuck. don't go here. save your money.
