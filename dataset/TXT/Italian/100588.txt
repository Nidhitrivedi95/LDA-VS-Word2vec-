fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w Good food overall. I had the rigatoni bolognese which was tasty but just a tad bit saltier than I would've liked. It was the perfect serving amount and I didn't need to tote around leftovers on the strip which was a plus. Waitstaff was pleasant and attentive. The total for four of us was around $130.00 not including the tip and only one of us had a alcohol beverage. Next time I go I will get the beef stroganoff, I hear it's divine.
