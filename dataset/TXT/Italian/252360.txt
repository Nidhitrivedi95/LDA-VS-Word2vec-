VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Tried their brunch for the first time and it was amazing! We had the chicken and waffles, eggs benedict, and chocolate chip pancakes.  Everything we had was amazing, but the chocolate chip pancakes were the best!!!!  The service was amazing as well.  Our server was so attentive and gave good suggestions while we contemplated on what to order.  He was so nice and friendly.
