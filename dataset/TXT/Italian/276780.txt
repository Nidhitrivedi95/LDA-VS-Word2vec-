It's beautiful, very old-world, like out of an old ethnic Chicago neighborhood - you expect Lucca Brazzi to be hanging at the bar - lots of old photographs, great lighting, and best of all, great Sicilian food!

We had a table for 6 in the bar; 5 of us ordered pasta dishes  and one girl ordered the chicken caprese - everyone loved their food!   Our waiter could have 'jollier' and smile a little more, but he's heavily accented French and working in an Italian restaurant, so maybe he feels a little out of his element.    Whatever, it did not deter our dining experience.  

Having taken a multitude of cooking classes and some in Bologna, Italy, my only complaint is that the 'bolognese' sauce on my spaghetti was a 'meat sauce' (ragu) and not a true bolognese, which gets it's complex flavor from sauteed carrots, celery and onions, in addition to  2 or 3 reductions of tomatoes, broth, milk, etc.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not a bolognese sauce.   It did require some hot pepper flakes and lots of the wonderful reggiano parmesano cheese they leave at the table, a generous gesture.
