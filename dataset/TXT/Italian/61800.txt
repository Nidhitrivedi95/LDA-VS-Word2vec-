azE1DNVQFBU8boVbaJhj7w Sorry to say, restaurant is riding on its former reputation. For starters, it could use a good deep cleaning. Visible dust accumulation, and really "old" odor. A real turn off. Staff for most pArt were very pleasant and pasta was excellent like always. Service at tables excellent. The bartender doesn't belong in the business. Rude to patron and to his own colleagues. He explained that the special menu at the bar was an entirely separate business fr the restaurant and we could not order fr regular menu. A turn off.
