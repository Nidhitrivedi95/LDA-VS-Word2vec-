fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w We originally went to Yard House but there was an hour + wait. This was the closest thing with a decent Yelp rating. The service was awesome, tap water was good, food was prepared quickly and the quality of food was amazing. I highly suggest the meatball sliders. It comes with a cup of marinara and a side of fries. They were awesome! The price is slightly inflated (like everything on the strip) the meatball sliders were $15 which isn't bad. My girlfriend got the bacon cheeseburger and said it was cooked really well.
