cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA After our last experience we were given a gift card to return. We came back hopping things would be much better. But I'm Sad to say it was not much better. Our Waitress was not very good very slow and was in a bad mood. I did ask her if she have a rough or crazy night. (Trying to break the ice and try to put her in a better mood) She said " Yes this place is really messed up the over hired and our now cutting back everyone's hours so now I have to find another job because they don't know how to hire." Even after that once again we had to ask other staff for refills on our drinks There was a table set up behind the Hostess both and we could see here sitting there a lot and not attending to the customers. My wife's salad  was very good but our Deep dish Pizza was not very good. The crust was very well done and was very dry. We only ate 1 slice each. When we were done I had to ask someone to get our waitress because we needed our check and a box for the salad. Another staff brings over the boxes and our check. I told her about the pizza issue and she said "yeha it is a little dark I'm sorry they been like that all night. That's why I don't get the deep dish pizza the hand stretched its a lot better." We were really disappointed we love pizza and were hoping things would have been much better this time. We may come back to try the sandwiches and the other pizza but not really sure. The other staff that helped us were very good.
