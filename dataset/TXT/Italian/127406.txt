HUWLnKD5LSZY134amUO2Rg Some friends from New York invited us out for dinner here. We were greeted by the owner Jimmy who later joined us at the table where he invited us to share some fresh mozzarella. 

We ordered a large The Works pizza. A white pizza which was amazing. A cheese calzone that could have been desert and a couple of Caesar salads with fresh anchovies.

The food was awesome and not greasy. In my opinion most pizzarias use skim cheese and when you use cheese that is the real deal, there should be some runoff.

Will be going back very soon.
