cMrCi3nAcBi3aUKDRAySiw I have been twice and made the mistake of ordering pizza each time because the rest of the short menu of homestyle options seems fairly uninspired despite the lure of ethically- and locally-sourced meats and veggies. ("Catch of the day" on this recent Thursday was pasta with marinara sauce and shrimp.) I should've saved my money and just got a slice from a certain ubiquitous pizza chain up the street. Big Mamma's Boy's crust is thick but not chewy enough, the tomato sauce is bland, and the toppings are meagre -- what little sausage I had tasted neither "hot" nor "Italian".

They specialize in gluten-free options here, which ought to have been exciting for my wife, who has celiac disease, but she too was disappointed. The first visit she had the ribs and they were just ho-hum. The most recent visit she ordered the burger which was scandalously tiny for the price and was served on some sad-looking sliced bread that was obviously from a packaged loaf. It came with a side of potato chips -- I guess fries are too complicated for this kitchen -- but she couldn't eat them because they were sour cream and onion flavour even though we told the waitress no dairy.

They have an overpriced wine list to match their overpriced food. There's also a poor selection of beer including one gluten-free option, La Messagère, priced as if it really were from France like it says on the menu. It's from Quebec though, and while I'd normally overlook such a silly mistake, it reflects the generally low attention to detail.

I can't imagine coming back here.
