qFqueIKCVF5PlXmjl1YY9Q I live in Colorado and somehow had heard about this place, so of course I HAD to try it while I was in town visiting.  I was not disappointed, this place is awesome!  The gelato is delicious, but also, the place is cute, the presentation of the gelato is gorgeous and the employees were nice, helpful and provided great, friendly service.  If you will be anywhere close to this place, you need to stop here!
