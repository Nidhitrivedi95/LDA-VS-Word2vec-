PY4u7UPF0VMcf0gYLlDRpQ I was actually quite disappointed the last time I stew here! I normally have wonderful service, but not this time. I brought a group of 8 people and the service was very slow. In fact, I had to stop someone and ask them to wait on us. I usually sit at the bar, but this time with such a large party we sat at a table. I was embarrassed because I raved about this place so much to these people and it didn't live up to the hype.
