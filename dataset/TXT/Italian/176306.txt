NhMEvtG8TA6AnCLFC63v_A I was not impressed with Annies. I will return just for the Aranchini balls. They were very good and should of just ordered more as my main dish
-Had the Chicken Picatta. the chicken was dry even though it was served in a wine sauce. It came with pasta with marinara sauce. It was served on the same plate and did not mix well with the chicken picatta. Either way the sauce was not very good.
