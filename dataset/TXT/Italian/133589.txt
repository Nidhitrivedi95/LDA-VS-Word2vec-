iNhP0ejUf2jVzaR5YCOoEQ We recently visited Remezzo's for my father's birthday, making a reservation for 7pm. We arrived 5 minutes early, and were told to take a seat and wait. The restaurant was fairly busy, and we were glad we were prudent enough to make a reservation. After about 20 minutes or so, we asked the host what the situation was, and he told us that they were preparing a table. At 7:45, with still no table ready, we decided to take our business elsewhere.

It is understandable that a restaurant may need some time to prepare a table, especially during a dinner rush. But if you accept our reservation, I think it is fair to expect seating within a reasonable time.

That was not the first time we've visited Remezzos, but it will almost certainly be the last.
