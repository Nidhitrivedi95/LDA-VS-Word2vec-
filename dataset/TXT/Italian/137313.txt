J4tO07oCDhwP3rdcgjjdxg Nice neutral decor.  We were there on a Tuesday night, so it was fairly quiet.  The food came out hot and tasted good.  Portions were not large, but that was a nice change.  Had to ask for bread instead of it being brought automatically.  Service was excellent and very friendly.  Will visit again.
