xzQn9smeOhgqCH-S-K-lgg Macaroni Grill in Strongsville is usually hit or miss. This visit was definitely a miss! I ordered the calamari appetizer and Alfredo pasta to go. The ordering process was very easy and the lady that took my order was very pleasant. When I got home I realized the pasta was clumped together and crunchy. I wish I would have checked the food before I pulled off. The calamari was decent but not evenly cooked. I won't visit Macaroni Grill for awhile. Waste of money.
