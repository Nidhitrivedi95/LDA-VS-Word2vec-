2gzB4EE7B_QEFWZtJTG4dA First visit was with family and friends for brunch Sunday 11/6/16.  Modern and upscale decor but still very casual and comfortable. Nice collection of wines and beers and great house takes on cocktails.  Chicken fried chicken,waffles,gravlax and steak and eggs were all big hits.  The monkey bread kept the grandsons and Uncle Eli quiet and happy.  Very friendly and attentive waitstaff.  Open window walls on a beautiful day made it seem like we were outside but comfortably in the shade. Looking forward to dinner on our next visit.
