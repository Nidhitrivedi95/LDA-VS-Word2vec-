r1RZJ5JQeEfCBc_MbHJ8AA The food was okay but the selection of pizzas on the menu do not have much variation from each other. If you want to build your own pizza it is very costly so you are stuck with their mediocre options or building a pizza for 3-5$ extra each topping you choose. I ordered a vegetarian pizza and under my pizza, stuck on my plate, was a piece of ham. When I told the waiter, he asked me what I wanted him to do about it. Overall was not impressed with the service or selection, the food is okay, the ingredients are fresh, the menu is very simple, the crust is very limp. I would not go out of my way to return.
