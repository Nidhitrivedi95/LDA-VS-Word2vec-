GIX0QykZTJylgLmynHOU6w I've been trying to get to Bottega Bistro for a few months and finally made it there this past Saturday.  I was really surprized that it wasn't more crowded, because the rest of downtown Willoughby was packed.

I love this place! Nice atmoshere.. Tribe game on the TV.  Life is good!  Great beer, great pizzas, and the bartenders, John and Mike, were really great at helping us choose the best beer!  Turns out our fav was called Flying dog raging bitch IPA.  Delicious beer and an excellent name.

I got the pizza with chicken, artichoke hearts, goat cheese, and spinach.  My friend got the marguerita pizza.  The marguerita pizza was a little skimpy on the fresh basil, and they happily sprinkled more on the pizza when we asked.  Pizzas have a thin crust and were nice and crisp.

We both ordered side salads which were really big.

John said that they are open on Sunday, which is a good thing, since most of the restaurants in Willoughby are closed on Sunday.  He called it  Sunday Fun Day, and I'm sure I'll go back to join in the fun!
