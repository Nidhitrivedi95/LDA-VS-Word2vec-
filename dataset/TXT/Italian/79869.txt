d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew Bought a Groupon for this place. Walked in, we got a look from the waitress was all. Read sign, found out it's a seat yourself atmosphere. Never had broasted chicken before. It was good, but salty. The potato wedges were thick and extra crispy. Pizza and bread was good too. The place was clean. Not busy at all for lunch time on a Sunday. They gave our little kids adult size drinks for $3 each instead of the kids cup at $.75. No personality from the waitress at all which is the only staff member we saw the whole time. May go back.
