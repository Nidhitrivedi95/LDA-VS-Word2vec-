yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w I love the concept of having the menu on the wall in several places to make it easy to see what you want and remember what you ordered. I also enjoyed the convenience of the "pre-fixe" menu, in that you get the wine, bread, soup/salad and entree included with every dinner. The only downfall to this is if you aren't hungry enough for all of the food that's coming your way. It would be nice to be able to order just an entree or soup/salad, but I the current system works as well. 

  The bread was AMAZING!!! The eggplant parm was AMAZING, even though it didn't have spaghetti included, but I wasn't hungry enough for that anyway. 

  Stay away from the white wine if you like things that taste good. It's all about that red wine. Unless, of course, the red wine carafe is empty, in which case drink up that free booze!

  Overall, a great experience. Loved the accordion player. And cheap booze at the bar! $6 whiskey and coke!!!
