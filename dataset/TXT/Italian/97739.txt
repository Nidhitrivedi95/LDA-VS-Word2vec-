EUQoB_ph7_xIyj7JZGI3bg Finally!!  Finally!! I am able to get some good Italian food in Arizona.  I am a bit spoiled since I lived in upstate NY for a month so I was ready for the real deal.  Of course I found about this place because of DDD.

Now it is a very intimate little restaurant with no fluff but with excellence service.  Why would not be ok with that if the food is good.  It is not very big on the inside or out but it will be worth any wait that you encounter.  The owner made a point of coming by every table and talking with his customers.  We learned that he played the cello in an orchestra over in Italy and he brought back the amazing recipes he cooks today.  He is an absolute delight to speak with so if you can, make sure you learn about him.  

I like to branch out and try other things but that darn bolognese is so good.  It has like six or seven different meats in it.  Really?  I was in heaven.  We also tried the brushcetta, tiramisu, and cannoli. I know that lots of people rave about the osso bucco and that is next on my list.  Darn I think everything is good. 

I even saw people getting takeout and the only reason I don't is because I live in the east valley.   I love this place and go back on a regular basis.  My sister thought I went back without her today and was ready to fight me.  Ha ha!!  Support local businesses people and you will get an amazing, unique experience in return.
