pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I was worried that with all the hype, this place wouldn't live up to my expectations. I've been here a couple times now and am not disappointed with it at all. Best pizza I've had in Phoenix BY FAR. Service was great, crust was perfect, toppings were fresh and creative. Definitely worth going back.
