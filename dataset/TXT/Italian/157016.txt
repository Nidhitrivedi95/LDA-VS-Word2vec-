lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ Mediocre food with a side of shadiness.

I went here only because I had family in town and they wanted to have dinner here. 

The food was OK, very overpriced but half decent. I am not a huge fan of the whole "family style" dishes where they are meant for sharing. My finance is a vegetarian, i am a meat eater... see the problem?

So we end up paying nearly 70 dollars when all is said and done. Not outrageous but for that price I would have picked an authentic Italian restaurant. 

So a number of days later my finance is checking his CC statement and somehow our 70 meal turned into a 140 dollar charge! We drove over to the restaurant and spoke directly to the manager. He was able to confirm the server had "somehow" given herself a 70 dollar tip. The manager said he would take care of this and call us when he did a little investigating.  

After a few days the manager said somehow the server had "accidentally" switched the tip and the total amount up. I have worked in food service before and I don't even know how that is possible. The manager said they would reverse the charge but corporate needed to do this and could take up to 2 weeks. Two weeks is an awfully long time to wait for a mistake, their mistake, to be corrected. 

Eventually the charge was corrected but the company never reached out to apologize or try to make it right. That right there sealed the fact that I would never return to this location or any of their others. 

If for some reason you decide to eat here keep your receipt just in case the server makes a "mistake".
