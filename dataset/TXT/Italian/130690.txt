IcOIw8pmzaIzYMzA07IsWg I've been here before and again it was using a living social voucher.  The experience them was slightly better as I think it was quieter compared to the most recent visit.
I think I remember now having the same dishes on both visits -  The pizza was ok - Milano Salami and gorzonzola cheese.  sometimes i feel it just nice a touch more for the bottom of the base as you sit it on a plate and it becomes slightly soggy and hard to cut - on that note a PIZZA KNIFE should be delivered!  Any how the arranchi meatballs were ok - I've had better last time and many other times, especially since I go to Rome many once or twice a year to get fed up on authentic cuisine. The service was good, and the wait was never long between meals.  mum enjoyed here Bruscetta and risotto, so that's something.
