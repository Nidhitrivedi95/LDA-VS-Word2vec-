_7tBGb6yVoiSiHq9NfQk8A Oh boy, I'm just going to jump right into it...

PROS
-great space
-love the furnishing and décor 
-bright and colourful 
-each table was nicely lit
-server was absolutely lovely - very polite

CONS
-service was dreadful and unbelievably slow
-waited 15-20 mins for the menu and water
-waited another 10-15 minutes for our order
-waited an additional 45-50 mins to get our food
-only 1 server on the floor
-"Hell's Kitchen Chicken" was good, definitely spicy but delicious - veggies on the other hand needed a lot of seasoning

Nope, nope, nope! Not coming back here I'll stick to the Heartland location, thank you very much.
