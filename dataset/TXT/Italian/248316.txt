This place is packed with people coming after work to hangout with colleagues and yes I was of the same crowd. We came here for a co-workers farewell and its a great place to gather. The food however was very average, nothing awesome and the cocktails were so bad. I had a Malibu Stacy and it was baaaad. Next came the Long Island Ice tea and this was ok.  For food we had just ordered a bunch of appetizers so my review is based solely on that, we had the chips with dips (two salsa's and some guac), bruschetta (good), onion rings (ok.. it's onion rings, what do you expect?), antipasto plate(yum!) and fried calamari. 

Overall this place was just like many other bars I have been too, if you wanna just hangout without spending too much money then its a good place. Stick to beer though, this place isn't for cocktails.
