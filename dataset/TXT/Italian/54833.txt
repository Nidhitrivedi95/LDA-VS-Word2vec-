aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ NOCA (North On CAmelback) is truly perfection in a restaurant.  Everyone that anyone could possibly want in a restaurant is received.

I have only been to the restaurant twice, but both times were thoroughly enjoyed.  Every single aspect of a restaurant is taken care of and the attention to detail is amazing.  From the second you step foot in the door the experience overwhelms every sense.  The restaurant design is clean, cool, yet classy and conservative.  The music fills your ears, but doesn't overwhelm a conversation.  Most importantly, the staff is truly there to cater to your every need.  They are truly a professional wait staff, and not simply working in the restaurant industry for a few bucks.  Then you get to your actual meal and words simply cant describe the ecstasy and delight that goes through your body as you are enjoying it.  Paired perfectly with a selection of wine or a cocktail by your professional waiter. 

Make sure you try the appetizer bacon and eggs.  It is to die for.  The chef's personal rendition of a old breakfast standby for a dinner meal.  In fact, everything that I have enjoyed on the menu is perfectly done.  Let them do their thing, and simply sit back and enjoy the perfection and your company.

One of my biggest pet peeves about fine dining is I never feel that I leave completely satisfied by the meal that I just had.  If I am going to pay the money for a $30for a plate or more, it better be perfect.  No ifs, ands, or buts.  Its gotta be the best.  NOCA not only satisfies, but it goes beyond.  Truly one of Phoenix's culinary masterpieces.
