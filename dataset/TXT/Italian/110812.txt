G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q First time at the Giada. We came for lunch on my birthday. We started with couple cocktails, barbarella and the white sangria.  The Barbarella was fantastic and I'm not much of a ginger fan. The white sangria was just okay. I probably would skip that next time.  We ordered the tasting menu from the appetizer which came with an array assortment of salami, cheese, lemon honey, olive, bread and vegetables.  I would highly recommend. It was $24 and big enough platter to be shared by four people we took half of our left overs home. For our entrees we had the salumi pizza and the muffuletta sandwich. And finished our meal with the Zeppoles italian donut for dessert.  Everything we ordered had wonderful presentation and was delicious. Service was outstanding also.  Overall, We enjoyed our experience very much, not to mention the beautiful view you get with your meal. Will definitely be back to bring family and friends.
