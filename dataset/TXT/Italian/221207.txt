SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg Phenomenal. Staff was great and allowed my girlfriend and I to move to a window when someone left so we could be closer to the fountain. Meal was amazing. Had five different entrees to share, two or three drinks and it came out around 150 dollars. Sounds bad but we were really full and felt like it wasn't a waste of money at all. The food was beautiful to look and totally satisfying. Go there for date night!
