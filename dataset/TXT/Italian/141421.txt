jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg I'd like to thank them for being able to fit a party of 25 people on Christmas day after another restaurant canceled on us without any notice. I love that everything is family style. It makes it really easy for a big family like that to order and be able to try a little bit of everything. The service was really good, the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because it was really cold in the restaurant, which may or may not have been the reason for the food coming out slightly cold and then also our order of gnocchi wasn't cooked all the way and was more of a dough ball, but it still tasted good :)
