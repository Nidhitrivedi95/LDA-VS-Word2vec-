D2nfOrnJ2OBlX_428sKyMg Noodles are good, but the soda machine is my favorite part. 

For my first time here I decided to try a bunch of things, I specifically went with a bunch of people so we could share. I ended up sampling the mac and cheese, penne rosa, tomato basil bisque, steak stroganoff, and the Japanese pan noodles. Everything was good, maybe a slight cut above the average noodle joint, though macaroni and cheese was easily my favorite. Sadly, the pan noodles were a bit too charred, though they substituted them for another dish without any hassle. The soup was pretty good, and it costing only a buck extra with a meal was pretty nice. It's a busy place and the interior is a bit too cafeteria-like for me (though the tables themselves are nice). 

The real highlight for me was the soda machine, almost worth the trip in itself. It's a new touch screen set up which has all manner of coke products and allows each one to be customized with different flavors (strawberry sprite, orange coke, etc). The only downside is only one person can use it at a time. It certainly brought out the kid in me.

I had high hopes from what people had said about this place, but, while good, the food just wasn't anything exceptional.
