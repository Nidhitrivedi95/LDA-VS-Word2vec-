klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw We were staying at the hotel, and needed a quick breakfast. Food tasted good going down, but caused itself to come out very quickly afterwards. For both of us. And we ordered different dishes. I'd give one star, but as I say, tasted good. 

They make tableside Bloody Mary's which is impressive to watch, but honestly, had better. Even their basic version is spicy, so don't even attempt the Cajun Mary if you are at all sensitive to heat.

With so many great restaurant's in Vegas, don't bother, unless you need a quick meal and are right there. And if so, hope your are wearing Depends.
