cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q My mother swears by this place, and I love to take her there.  Unforunately, Olive Garden is another chain restaurant that tries its best to be theme-ingly delicious.  I hate themed restaurants for that very reason. Frozen pastas, jarred sauces and mediocre food on a pretty plate is just that.  call me picky, but I prefer to avoid this place as often as possible.  Given that this place has its moments, but unless they start doing things fresh, I won't change my star rating.
