That was after they figured out the wine we ordered was out (20 min) and went on to notice they had no clean wine glasses. After watching other tables get served and receive bread - managed to beg for some.  Had to prompt the waiter to allow us to order appetizers which he managed to accurately record. Ordered dinner only to find out the special offered was gone. That took 10 minutes. 

The food was ok, pizza very good. 

Based on the service - will never go back. Too bad -  we were excited for a real Italian restaurant near our home.
