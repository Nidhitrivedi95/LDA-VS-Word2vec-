SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ I've had dinner at Trevi almost every time I visit Las Vegas. Situated in the Forum Shops adjacent to Caesar's Palace, this restaurant is consistently good. Their menu choices are varied, and there's something for everyone. Each visit, I've tried something different, and whether it was pasta or salad or just appetizers, everything has been well prepared, tastefully presented, and delicious. I agree with the other reviewers regarding the great service - the wait staff seem to really like their jobs.  I love that you feel like you're actually sitting outside in Italy, almost forgetting that the garish neon, traffic and noise is as close as The Strip. They have a full bar and the drinks are always good. Their wine selection could be a little broader, but there are good choices. I'll continue to frequent Trevi.
