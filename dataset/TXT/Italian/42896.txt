7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw North is one of our favorite restaurants.  Try the house white with a chefs board, yummy. Our favorites are the spaghetti with meatballs,  spinach tortillini, or the braised short ribs. The pizzas are great too. If you don't like places that get really busy and can be pretty noisy then you won't like North no matter how good the food is. Be sure to make a reservation if you are going on a weekend night.
