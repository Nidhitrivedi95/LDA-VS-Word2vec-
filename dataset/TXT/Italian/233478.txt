TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q Overall we had an ok experience.  We went on a Friday night so there was about a 20 minute wait, which wasn't too bad.  There wasn't very much seating and the waiting area got a little crowded.  The Margherita Pizza was very good.  The crust was buttery and delicious.  Even though the food was good, our service experience was not so great.  My boyfriend got one of the specialty pizzas and asked for it to come with onions instead of mushrooms.  Little did we know that this was considered "building your own pizza" and as a result we were charged more.  When the bill came and we asked about it, the server's response was it's written on the menu.  This would have been a great thing to mention while we were ordering especially since we told her it was our first visit.  We also ordered a kid's meal and were charged an extra fifty cents for apple juice instead of soda, which again, was not disclosed.  The manager did agree to remove the fifty cent charge but at that point, our experience was ruined.  The pizza was good but we probably won't dine in again.
