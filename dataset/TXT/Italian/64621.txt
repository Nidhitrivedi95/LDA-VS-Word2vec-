bgCHcGeOBNQxDT95XvzNFQ Have eaten here numerous times and usually everything is spot on perfect. Not this time. It wasn't horrible but seems things are missing that are important for people like myself and family to continue to come back. First thing was the wine I wanted, out. Now I would understand if it was a Rothschild but it wasn't. So who dropped the ball on ordering? Common items should always be available. Lobster bisque was superb. Everything else, Meh... No palate cleanser either. Disappointing. If I wanted meh, which I don't, then I would go to Olive Garden which I won't. My suggestion is to step it up because I'm sure I'm not the only person this has happen to.
