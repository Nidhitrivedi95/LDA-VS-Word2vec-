UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Stay away from this place. The food was horrible. I complained to the executive chef who was working last weekend. He didn't even have the courtesy to come and see me when asked. Found a band aid in my food. The management criticizes employee's right in front of you. I would hate to be an employee there. A manager Tony belittled a female employee almost to the point she was crying. How extremely unprofessional. Eat at Claim Jumper next door!!!! I would gave NO STARS but I had to give 1.
