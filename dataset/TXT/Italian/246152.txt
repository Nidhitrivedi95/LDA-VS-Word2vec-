uynbRIP4g85lp87xBJUaTg Went for Winterlicious and was the most hospitable service ever! The restaurant hosts were very accommodating for our large group. They above and beyond to prepare a spicy appetizer, in addition to their set dinner menu. The food was good, but the service was most memorable:) The hosts were very patient and gracious with the entire service, even though it was very busy. I would definitely come back to try the brunch menu :) Thank you Church bistro for a fantastic Winterlicious experience:)
