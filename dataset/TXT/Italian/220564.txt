sByhyN_S2FgNnPl5pqY0Ow I would rate it 3 stars, but the service was horrible. My buddy and I went for pick-up and he had an Entertainment Book coupon which was a "Buy one get one free." The guy working the counter wouldn't honor the coupon. He kept saying that they were running a special that was a better deal than the coupon. A line starting forming and we just paid the full price to avoid the hassle. Granted, if you are expecting to pay full price, it may be worth it. If you have a coupon, don't even think about it.
