nybEvSB5y3deFPOP7rE46A Great atmosphere and very well set-up. This will definitely be a well visited restaurant. There is patio seating with a fire place which will be a great place to hang out and have some drinks in Spring, Summer, and Fall. Winter....not so much. The food was very good and there is a wide variety of options on the menu. The pizza was better than expected and they make a mozzarella cheese in-house. It was very good. I was not impressed with the tiramisu. It was not what traditional tiramisu is, but more of a tiramisu-like dessert. The drinks menu maintained a diverse selection of draft and bottled beers, along with cocktails and many varieties of wine. The staff was friendly and attentive. This is now  restaurant add into the restaurant rotation. Check it out.
