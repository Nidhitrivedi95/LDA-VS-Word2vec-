BQqwIYQuo2W94smjrBjy5g I hate to bash a small business, but our dinner was thoroughly disappointing.  First off, the beer that I was served had gone bad and I had to replace it with a mainstream "water beer" to ensure it wasn't old.   Our bruschetta had so much fresh minced garlic that it rendered it nearly inedible.  I managed to choke down one piece.  The lobster bisque, which is devoid of actual lobster, tasted downright fishy.  Not briny, mind you, fishy.  We both tried two bites to confirm my initial impression, and sat it to the side uneaten.  Lastly, the pear ravioli arrived.  While I'll admit the sauce was pretty good, the shrimp that were part of the dish were beyond disappointing.  They are most definitely of the frozen variety, from a bag.  At $28 (including the $5 share charge), I don't feel that the dish provides enough quality ingredients to justify the price.  

We truly wanted to enjoy our meal, and only chose this place so that we could support local small businesses.  I'm giving an extra star for the friendly service.  However, based on this experience we definitely won't be back
