laAnd3e8T_8WG-weL2zikA This place looks like someone's living room, dinner room & kitchen... Had about 15 table set-up & one waitress taking orders, serving and cleaning up, plus Ida (owner) in the kitchen cooking.

I got the day's special, Peppers & Olives on spagetti w/dinner salad. The portion was way too big and too salty. All their pasta dishes were in red sause and didn't seem homemade. Dinner salad had a bunch of lettuce, ONE wedge of tomato, and ONE slice of cucumber... Dinner rolls were cold and some seems still frozen. At the end of the meal, we had to walk up to the register/kitchen area and TELL them what we ordered... cash only too.

Ida was nice and friendly, and went around to each table to chat with the customers. My bf's grandpa is a patron of the restaurant, so she stood around and chit chat with him and gave us free biscotis. :)

Overall the experience was ok... I would recommend they expand their menu, restaurant space and technology to upgrade the restaurant.
