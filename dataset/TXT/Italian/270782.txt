XPDzKfrq5uzz4o82eCZI7w from 2011 -- Rancho Pinot never fails to deliver. The ambiance is classy, yet comfy. The service -- knowledgeable but friendly. and the food? well, it speaks for itself. whether starting with goat cheese stuffed squash blossoms topped with cherry tomatoes and arugula, or eating the lamb with lemon and beans, the food is fresh, inventive and wholly satisfying.
this past weekend we sat at the bar and have skilled mixologist Travis make us a prickly pear manhattan. stellar! after the above-mentioned squash blossoms, we both had the nightly special -- a frisee and spinach salad, tossed in a sherry vinaigrette, with arizona lobster mushrooms, duck confit, crispy matchstick potatoes and a fried egg from Chef Chrysa Robertson's own chickens. topped off the meal with a new dessert -- a roasted banana/rum milkshake accompanied by two homemade peanut butter/chocolate chip cookies. heavenly!
rancho is a well-established restaurant in phoenix, with a mostly well-established crowd. however, younger foodies from all over the valley shouldn't keep from flocking here for the fresh, seasonal, expertly crafted food. wine list is great, cocktails are inventive and service is exactly what you would expect for an establishment of this quality.
