JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A Great place for late night eats especially. 

Cool feel to it and good music. 

All day breakfast is a favourite as is the 7 West club sandwich. 

Service was a bit slow last night but tends to be good enough.

Most dishes are $12-$15. Guess it's a bit more pricey than other late night food spots, but it's still not crazy and the food is good
