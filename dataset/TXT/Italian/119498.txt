H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g BEAUTIFUL ambiance, but I think it is over rated. Too expensive for a pizza and the tomato sauce tasted...well different. And not different as in authentic bececause I have had pizza all over Europe. I had to eat off my friend's plate who had no sauce on the pizza. My other friend ordered a pasta that looked like a kid's meal. Our server forgot to ring in our two appetizers so we got our dinner first, but the manager gave it to us for free so that was the only appealing thing. The fried mozarella is actually fried bread with a tiny piece of mozarella in the middle so I would skip on those.
