iFGC7CIcVKWdIKjIO7w6Tw Another great hole in the wall. Great small venue for shows and really good ramen. I haven't tried any else but the soups here, but they are delivious. Spicy Shoyu Pork is my goto. Rich, spicy broth, al dente noodles, and succulent shredded pork.
They have lots of space and a great outback patio. 4 bigscreens inside showing sports and random whatever. And they usually have calendar of decent events happening here.
They lose stars because of sometimes slow service. And also because I brought a date here on a Sunday and they were only serving sandwiches after talking the ramen up. So I guess call ahead and ask what food they have on Sundays?
Otherwise,  its a great, fun place where I can get my ramen fix.
