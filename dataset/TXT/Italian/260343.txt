wp5FAtCGMyU2RnQ-7kxKHQ Love Roman Bistro! Hubby and I went for dinner last night. Reservations were at 6:15 but we arrived before 6 pm and were promptly seated. We took advantage of the half-off deal on some appetizers (offered before 6 pm) and ordered the bada bing shrimp. They were very tasty in a tangy sauce, plump and plentiful! I ordered the beet salad with lemon vinaigrette dressing. Delish! Warm bread with dipping oil accompanied the meal. Hubby ordered the short ribs and I ordered the lobster ravioli. Awhile later, the manager announced they were out of short ribs. Not wanting a further dinner delay, my husband ordered the ravioli as well. We loved the dish, always a favorite! We ordered the lemon cake for dessert. It was very flavorful, served with warm chocolate sauce and a dollop of whipped cream aside. Service was excellent, but was disappointed with the timeliness to mention the unavailability of short ribs. This popular gem is our frequent go-to place and they also are very accommodating to large groups as we have reserved for parties of 12-15 on several occasions. Highly recommend!
