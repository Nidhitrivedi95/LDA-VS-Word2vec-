zY6f_cFY8HTI3hLlJj3SOg had the best pizza last night. I got two of the biggest slices of cheese pizza. Bigger than my face! Thin crust good sauce and great gooey cheese.  Seriously, the size of the slice freaked me out. One was more than enough. Service was quick and everything tasted fresh. I will definitely hit this place up more often.
