pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I've asked a few friends what to do while in Phoenix and a few of them mentioned Pizzeria Bianco.  Without knowing anything, I started reading these crazy yelp reviews about waiting in line for 4-5 hours.  I thought to myself, "Are these people crazy?!?!  It's just a damn pizza!"

Then I start reading... the #1 pizza in the country... Oprah ranks it her #2... and then I realized that I have nothing better to do while in Phoenix so what the heck.  A friend tells me it's not that bad on weekdays so I head on out to wait in line at 4:30pm on a Tuesday, 30 minutes before the place even opens.  It's 109 degrees out and there are already a bunch of people waiting in line!  After checking in, I easily have more than enough time to head back to the hotel to pickup the wife.  Two hours later, my life is changed.

I cannot give another pizza joint 5 stars ever again.  Pizzeria Bianco doesn't have the pizza's that I'm used to, it's just on another level.  If you're expecting a really good Round Table slice, it's absolutely nothing like that.  The toppings were just so fresh and flavorful with just the perfect amount of saltiness from the olives.  We had the Sonny Boy and the Wiseguy, both very different pizzas but equally amazing in their own right.

It's very possible that I gave this pizzeria 5 stars because I was just starved for 2 hours before eating and probably anything would have tasted good, but I think I really tried to be extra critical because of all of the hype.

Conclusion.  Best pizza I've ever had, but I still think people are insane to wait over 2 hours for this place (let alone ANY place).  Go on a weekday!
