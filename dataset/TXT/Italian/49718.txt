9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Best italian food in Phoenix, great atmosphere.  Lived in Italy for a year, and this is the equal to the best I had there. Fantastic. The antipasti plate is the best i've ever seen, the pizza is wonderful, and the crepes are to die for.  Cute, comfortable setting. But get there early - I'm not the only person who rates it best in Phoenix!
