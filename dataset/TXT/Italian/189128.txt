OYaL_-uxBCgrE94uNQ4VCA A little pricey but excellent service, portions, and flavors. Very open and spacious restaurant. Got Two 14" pizzas, chicken fingers (6), garlic knots (9) large size, linguini with clam sauce, 5 sodas, tiramisu, and the kitchen sink for under $100....will definitely be returning
