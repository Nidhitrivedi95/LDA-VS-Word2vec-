g-nzfTvso3-4c4gkhkmGbQ Frankie Tomatto's is an Italian buffet in Markham near Woodbine/Steeles.  It's beautifully decorated, and people come here from all nationalities.

I have been here many times years ago mostly for lunch with co-workers, I was here again for dinner today and I think it's better now than before.   I see they have renovated.   They have a new pastry counter which is cute, and the ice cream parlour section is now hiding next to it.

They celebrate birthdays and have live music.  This place is quite big, I find myself getting lost sometimes especially with the crowds!

The food is nice, they don't have much gluten-free options though, I only saw a few pastries which were gluten free.

It's crowded and a bit noisy here so if you don't like crowds or noise this is not the place for you.

They have early bird special, 5-5:30pm Mon-Thurs for $13.99, but you have to finish eating within that 30 minutes.  Parking is plentiful, staff is friendly.  Great for parties, kids love this place!
