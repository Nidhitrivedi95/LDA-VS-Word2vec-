1WBVqmo7tgF0z0eGf4fPhQ It's imPASTA-ble to describe how much I love this place but I'll give it a try! 

Whenever I'm in the area or whenever I'm craving pasta (which is pretty much all the time) I love to go to Pasta Idea, especially for their lunch special. It's $9.95 for a create your own pasta (only the ones with a * next to it are eligible) plus a drink and garlic bread with a side of tomatoes and chopped basil. Keep in mind that if you aren't dining here for lunch, the pastas can be a bit pricey BUT the portions are so huge so you can definitely share with another person! They also have delivery through Eat24 and BiteSquad if you just want to eat in but still get your pasta fix! 

For lunch I recommend their pink vodka sauce with spaghetti noodles or their caprese with their cheese ravioli! We usually get those two and always end up super full at the end of our meal. 

The space is pretty small so not ideal for huge groups but I'm sure they can be accommodating since I saw a huge group of 10 today when I picked up my order. Their customer service has always been great (I really miss those two sisters that worked here, haven't seen them anymore though :/) but today it was even more awesome since the guy was able to expedite my order because he knew I was in a rush despite how busy they were! 

Love how their pasta and sauces are handmade and always fresh with authentic Italian chefs behind the kitchen! It's definitely a nice difference from the typical "Olive Garden" or other chain restaurants. I also love supporting local businesses so this is the ideal go to pasta spot for me!
