tvhcshPITUGa_ffUlU-BHA My friends and I had dinner here before a Panthers game one a recent evening.  My friend actually got there early and the place was closed for a private event.  The staff was very accommodating to her though and made sure she was taken care of until the restaurant opened back up at 6pm.  The place was very empty at the beginning of the meal so our server was pretty attentive.  Once they got a bit busier, she was off helping other tables and being the bartender.  But service was good overall.

For food, I had the grilled shrimp salad.  It was delicious.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly.  Good dressing on the salad.  Not too heavy.  One friend had the French Dip and the other had the Salmon salad. Both liked their meals.  

I had a gift card for the place so that is why we went there but the food was good so I will probably be back.
