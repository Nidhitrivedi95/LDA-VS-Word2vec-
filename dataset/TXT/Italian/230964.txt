Tf13Wexrt6WmNw-CDW5Gyg I was excited to try the Meatball Spot but came away pretty disappointed.  The prices seem decent until you see how small the portions are.  The "full" size salads are a joke and the sides are ridiculously small.  The garlic fries cost $6 and aren't even enough for one person.  I had the classic meatballs with spicy meat sauce and they were good, but they don't come with enough sauce.  And the bread that comes with them is small, hard, and not very good.  A cool concept that fails in the execution.
