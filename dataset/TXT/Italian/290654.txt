ZVtjS8Hvq2a6SxHxlehPGg We tried this last week on the recommendation of a friend and so glad we did.  From the second we walked in and the owner Greg greeted us as if we were old friends to when we left it was nothing short of wonderful.  The waiter was knowledgeable about all the dishes and specials and recommended some very good wines.  Our party ordered clams, mussels, caprese salad, halibut and eggplant parm and everyone enjoyed the authentic flavor and I personally liked the marina.  I know Lori K. Reviewed the bread was hard which to me means she's never heard of sourdough so I wouldn't value her cuisine opinions at all and I can't believe all her negative comments and wonder if she went to the same restaurant as our experience was awesome.  A gentleman we were with couldn't believe it wasn't shipped in from San francisco it was so good and fresh.  Nice relaxing live music and this is now our must go to restaurant in Phoenix.  We went back again that same week... Highly recommend.  It reminds me of a back home neighborhood restaurant with its intimate and unique ambience.  Thank you Greg and we will be back soon.
