Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A This was such a great experience!!!  It was exactly what we were looking for!!  Sunday brunch was perfect and the service superb with Lucia!  This will be one of our regular spots for sure!!!  What a great find.. a gem spot!  

I was trying to send a second review because this place is so good but it wouldn't allow me so I'm going to continue.. I have to say meeting the GM Jessalyn was also a wonderful experience!  Her kindness and sincerity is what we would hope from someone in her position.  She made us feel right at home and wanting to come back again and again... which is exactly what we are going to do!!!  5 star food, atmosphere and staff!!!
