VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w LAVO party brunch was one of the main reasons my fiancé picked Vegas for her bachelorette party. I was upset to hear that not only was their reservation for two tables knocked down to one, without any heads up, but the staff was extremely rude in the process. Instead of accommodating their group, who had planned this for months, they instead tried to throw "free food" at them to make up for the lack of seating. Their party had six mothers who did not plan on standing for 4 hours time. The "promoters" simply sold their 2nd reserved table to the highest bidder, then tried to extort more money to "keep" it. The rest of Vegas was great, but pass on this Party Brunch spot as it gives Vegas a bad name.
