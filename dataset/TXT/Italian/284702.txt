zcfmbmOEX83YL04f9_Y0BA I tried really hard to like this place especially since upon walking in to the restaurant for a take out order I was met by what had seemed to be friends of the business who had given rave reviews. My first try was with the meatballs and pasta. Good meatballs but I ran out of sauce half way through my meal..Strike 1. Then a last week I tried a bacon cheeseburger, with fries and a side of mozzarella sticks. Ughhh where do I begin. First off, the burger was made from a patty, second the mozzarella sticks had no crunch and were dry and seemed like they just threw them in the microwave...Strike 2 Needless to say, I have since thrown away their menu.
