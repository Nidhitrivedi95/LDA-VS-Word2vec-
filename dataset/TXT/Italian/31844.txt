5pPZ333KNTONrDR6QH2q6g We really wanted to like this place. The only good thing about it was our server was fast, but that was mostly due to the fact that we were the only ones in there at 5:30 Saturday night. 

As we looked over the menu, seeing the high price points we thought we'd be getting some good homemade Italian.  We were wrong. The bread and salad aren't anything special. They were fine. We got some mozzarella sticks to start, it was clear that they were frozen. $7 for 6 frozen cheese sticks?! No thanks. But the real disappointment came when dinner showed up. My wife had the baked ziti. Once you get passed the fact that it's boxed pasta with a ridiculous amount of cheese on top, you find it also has the most flavorless sauce either of us has ever tasted. Not nearly worth the $14.  I had the chicken parm sub. It was doused with way too much of the flavorless sauce and way too much cheese as well. It made the bottom of the bun so soggy it was difficult to pick up. And on top of all that, the chicken was nothing more than a frozen chicken tender! 

It's a shame because we really did want this place to be good, we need more around here, but I work way too hard to spend my money on low quality pasta at a high price.
