3yMmo1sERpks50quoaA8PQ We recently caught wind of Uncle Sal's, so decided to check it out a little over a week ago.  It was packed when we arrived, so we found a nice table at the bar.  The bartenders were friendly, professional and so efficient.  The atmosphere was lively and filled with locals.  We shared an order of the tasty meatballs and a caesar salad to start.  I enjoyed the penne a la vodka and my husband enjoyed the lasagna. Delicious, simple food that doesn't try to hard - a nice change of pace!
