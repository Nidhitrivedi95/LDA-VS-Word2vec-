tUeYSmiIQn0WG9LN-qRLKg I ended up all alone on NYE 2014, and wandered a mile back to my hotel room. It was around 1am and was hungry, so I called the front desk checking on my food options. They transferred me directly to R&B, and ordered a pie for $12.  The pizza arrived within 30 minutes, and it was pretty dang good. The delivery guy was friendly as well. Can't beat the convenience and quality, thanks!
