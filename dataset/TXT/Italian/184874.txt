OilKQPdBj3rD7eZDF5OENQ Normally when I go for pizza I don't usually go to Pizza Express, however on a Wednesday (mainly due to Orange Wednesday offers) I do like to pay it a visit. However, I just don't go to any Pizza Express! Oh no, I go to the one in Stockbridge! 

The reason is not just due to the good service but due to its building and setting! Spread over two floors there are plenty of seats indoors, however on a hot Summer's day there is also a terrace where one can eat pizza and drink a nice glass of white wine! And this seating area has views over the river of Leith. Doesn't sound very glamour's, but at times it can be quite nice! 

One of the better places to go for a bite to eat in the area, you will be eating in, not your average Pizza Express but Stockbridge's pizza Express!
