EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw What an eclectic menu! I felt like a judge on one of those high-end cooking shows. From the bone marrow and uni risotto appetizers through the fantastic pasta course to the lamb belly main course it was delightful. I recommend the tasting option where you c pick any 3 or 4 items off the menu. The waitress was very knowledgeable and good at explaining the different dishes and offered good suggestions.
