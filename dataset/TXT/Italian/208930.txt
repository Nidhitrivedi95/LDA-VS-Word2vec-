qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg I love this place. The ambiance is so nice. The food quality is good and they offer great tasting gyros. My husband introduced me to this place. My favorite is the pomegranate chicken with the salad. My husband loves the cheesecake. I love it as well. However, I didn't like the baklava crust. It taste funky.
