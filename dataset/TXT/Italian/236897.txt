tXJkGjBkGOZHWAcCmlzS6w I went to Valerio's new location when I was in town visiting family.  Food was delicious!  We had both the calamari and muscles for an appetizer and for an entree I selected the shrimp ravioli.  Food was very fresh, wine was delicous and the room was dimly lit, making for a good dining experience.  

The only negative was the restaurant itself.  I think there is some room for improvement with the decor.  Although I liked the dim lights, the decor is very minimalist and could be spiced up a bit.
