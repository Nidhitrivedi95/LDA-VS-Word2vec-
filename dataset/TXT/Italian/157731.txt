Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA There are definitely better Italian restaurants on the strip with cheaper prices. Also, service on a good day is just OK. So that should tell you something. I would advise that  you to try somewhere else. Don't waste your time. Especially since I can't remember how the food tasted. Yeah, this is one of those places.
