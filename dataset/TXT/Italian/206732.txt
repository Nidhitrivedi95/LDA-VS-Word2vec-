qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA So our new  beach cruiser biker gang stopped by after a nice 10 mile cruise on a gorgeous day.  We were lookin for some cool drinks and light snacks to refuel before the ride back.

We were promptly seated on the patio, so we could keep an eye on our sweet rides.  None of us thought to bring a lock... :(  rookies!!

We were quickly given some menus and waters.  And then... we waited.  I'd say about 3-4 minutes before someone came by to take our drink orders.  We should have just ordered food right away.  It took another couple minutes for some iced teas.  And another couple minutes to come back for the food orders.

We thought maybe we were just being grumpy hungry riders.  Then we looked around.  It seemed like the service was pretty slow throughout patio area.  There were quite a few filled tables, with what looked like 2 people handling them all.  But the 3 behind the bar looked like they had it good, just standing there chatting it up.  How about jumping over the bar and help out with the customers? 

Some had the half paninis and half salad combos.  Others had the full paninis with the side salad.  For me, the full panini and basic side salad was the better value.

I think we will make the trek again, and give it another shot.  The food was good.  Though, the bruchetta looked awesome!  So we will have to try it!  We just hope the service steps it up a bit.
