oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw We had the rehearsal dinner for our wedding here for almost 40 people in the private room. I thought the food was really good. I actually asked someone at the table if I could have their pasta because I ate all mine and loved it. The appetizers were very tasty. The service was good. A nice balance between attentive and letting us enjoy our private room. The email communication to set up the private room was great. We overall had a very solid experience at Lupo and I would definitely eat there again on another trip to Vegas.
