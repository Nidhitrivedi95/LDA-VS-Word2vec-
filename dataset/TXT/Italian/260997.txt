WPV0ucYjnb2HOrNxSopv6A This is my second favorite pizza & cannoli place in Charlotte, and it's a very tight race between 1st & 2nd. I'm a bit of a pizza snob having grown up on delicious pizza on Long Island. Amalfi's is my fav so I was disappointed when we moved to the south end of town and didn't know of any good pizza joints. Enter Hawthorne's on 7th. This is my go-to place for pizza and cannoli when I'm not in the University area.
