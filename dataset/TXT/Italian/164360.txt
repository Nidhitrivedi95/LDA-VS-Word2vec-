LXheNwqZPoXuXNNeP1sNew We enjoy frequenting Humble Pie in Peoria.  The service is great and Haley has become our favorite server.  She is entertaining and attentive.  As one of your most consistent customers, we are disappointed by the changes in your menu.  You no longer serve that delicious turkey steak chili, and now have shifted away to a different version of doughnut holes.  We have lost two favorite items on the menu and request you reconsider bringing them back.
