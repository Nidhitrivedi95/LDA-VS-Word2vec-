80qlT-7liqYBXUQCeRLmUg I went with a groupon.... WARNING :  They have a "special" menu for $30 a person.  That we could NOT HAVE with our groupon, even though I paid $59!!  Don't buy the groupon! 

The bruschetta was the SMALLEST I've ever seen.  Two TINY pieces, with 3 pieces of tomato.  The warm mushroom salad was quite good. 

The chicken marsala (they wouldn't even spring for VEAL)it was ok.  Sauce salty, as were the Chopped zucchini and peppers.  Didn't taste any marsala..... 

Dessert: lemon sorbet is very good, nice and tart!   Tiramisu was spectacular, except for the strawberry sauce drizzle, which has NO place NEAR tiramisu! 

The waiter was efficient and considerate.

Don't buy the groupon!
