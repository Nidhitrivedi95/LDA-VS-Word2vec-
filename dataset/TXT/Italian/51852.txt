9joPX1laPl3p6l_VfCQJFw I am a huge fan of Italian food - real Italian food like you find in little villages while traveling through the Italian countryside, not the typical American-chain restaurant style "Italian".  

So, when I first heard of il Nido, I was super-excited to try it.  Maybe I was there on an "off day" for them, but I found the food to be a-ok, but not outstanding. We were there for lunch and the restaurant was not very busy.  

I do think it is a cute little place, and I will go back and give them another try... hopefully next time I'll be blown away.
