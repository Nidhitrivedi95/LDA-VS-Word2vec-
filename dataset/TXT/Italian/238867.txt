There is a good selections of Noodles and Pasta... and there are also soups and salads! Everything are prepared when ordered with fresh ingredients at a decent price.

Prices are reasonable from around $7 with most of them under $10 for pasta/noodle. Choices of Italian, American and Asian style, definitely something for everyone.

For lunch the Choose 2 meal Combinations at $7.25 cannot be beat!! A choice of Half Salad (I am forced to eat my green) and either a Half Noodle Bowl or Soups.

Pear & Balsamic Spinach Salad can be a meal of its own!! Loaded with Blue Cheese crumbs and tons and tons of walnuts!! Southwest Chipotle Linguine has a slight kick of spiciness with fresh pasta cooked al dente, and even has a bread stick on the side...

Nothing But Noodles has a self serve concept, you placed and paid for your order and the food will be delivered to your table.

Now I find another good place for lunch ...!!

BTW, stay away on Monday night if you don't have kids... because it is Kids Eat Free Night and that includes all the sugary soft drinks and cotton candies!!... Need I say more?
