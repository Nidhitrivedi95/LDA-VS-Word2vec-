-xbQQR_ydEJGqYzHSF4DnQ I have to preface this review with this... Hate Pizza!! Don't purposely buy it for myself.... Last time? About fifteen years ago....

Yesterday, I felt obligated to "buy" Pizza for the Daugher-In-Law's Dad and myself for the World Series final game....

My youngest son and his new bride seems to frequent this place quite a bit.... the descriptive fold-out menu that contained five coupons only had two remianing....

   Option 1:
   18" Thin Crust with 2 Toppings; with 2 2-liter bottles of Soda
   
   Option 2:
   2 14" Thin Crust Pizzas... Toppings extra.

The Dad chose whatever with Pepperoni Sausage & Mushroom. I picked Option 1.

Dad's review... Slightly better than average, good flavor (*** 1/2)

My review... (**)
The Thin-Crust came pre-cut in an unusual method... a Checker-board pattern with each piece about 3-inches square... not a Pie Slice. Pepperoni slices were baked on top of the Pizza with only 1 to 2 small pieces of Pepperoni per "slice"... as described above. Mushrooms were not obvious... they were hidden under the layer of Cheese...

IMO... not very much Meat per square inch.

I just don't like Pizza... never will!
