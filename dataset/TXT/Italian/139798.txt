The service here was excellent.  It's a full team effort for every table.  Every server, runner, chef came to our table at least once, during our meal.

We were looking forward to a lobster dish (poached lobster, lobster risotto), but none were available.  We went with the chef's tasting menu and wine pairings:

Corn Bavarois (2010 Fielding Estate Pinot Gris)
Roasted Sea Scallop with Pork Belly (2010 Fielding Reisling)
Corn & Forntina Agnolotti (2009 Hidden Beach Chardonnay)
Squab (2007 Pearl Morissette Pinot Noir)
Blueberry Lemon Curd (Maker's Mark Bourbon Sour)

The Corn Bavarois was a great start: light, creamy, and a little sweatness balanced with radish and a touch of chili.  The scallops, combined with pork belly were outstanding balanced with the sweatness of apricots and starchiness of the polenta.

The agnolotti was a nice pasta, but it was a little overkill with the corn.  The truffles didn't compliment the sweatness of the corn, as I had hoped.  (Also, we noticed a variation in the how well each bite of agnolotti was cooked.)

The squab, although cooked wonderfully, seemed to lack the creativity that was given to each of the other courses.

Finally, dessert was a nice finish.  Creative, different.  A surprisingly wonderful, yet simple, journey for the palate.  Very nice way to finish the evening.
