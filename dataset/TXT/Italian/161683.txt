LMdUoR00jPxQDWLYRq93FA First thing I want to get out of the way is how few good restaurants there are in the Phoenix area. When I first moved out here from the Bay Area, the first thing I noticed was how un-diverse (this is most likely not a word) the Valley is; from the people, to the stores, to restaurants, to the actual foods. 

Quiessence was one of my first interactions in Phoenix with good food, great service, and a great environment. 

The first thing you will notice is the little driveway leading up to the restaurant. The deeper you get, the less of the city you feel. When you finally pull up to the entrance you will be fully engulfed with a small town/ranch feel. The inside is beautifully lit with candles and is lined with wonderful wood. The outside is great as well, as it is surrounded by white and pink flowers, with no signs of a city at all. 

The food was excellent. We went with a 6 course sampler. The server told us that the menu is changed everyday as to change with farmer's specials and the chef's obsessions for that day. Another great thing is that the restaurant supports local farmers and goods. Also, while me and the folks don't drink wine nor ordered any, the wine person (not the actual term I'm sure) is quite knowledgeable from what we heard. He was able to explain fully, why each glass was the right choice for that particular course.

This is a rushed review because I hate typing, but so far, this has been the food highlight of my Valley experience.
