The staff member that greeted us was welcoming from the start, and had a great sense of humour which fit nicely for a place as laid back as this. We asked for recommendations and were pretty picky in setting our criteria for the beer we wanted to drink. Regardless, each of us loved the recommendation she selected, and ultimately had a wonderful time here. The atmosphere is far from any hustle-and-bustle, the music choice was both familiar and nostalgic, and the interior was just good ol' pub style without any modern snobbery. This place checked all the boxes for us.
