LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw So I just visited oreganos a couple of days ago. I always get the Pablo Picasso salad, amazing. Unfortunately, I was disappointed this time. I ordered coleslaw and they changed the recipe. The old kind was made with wasabi mayo and green olives, and I loved it! Now, it's just blah. The cole slaw won't keep me from going back, but just miss the old stuff. Could I get the recipe?! Thanks! :-)
