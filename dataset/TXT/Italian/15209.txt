1PJpo48hSChCbriXEHGSjw I have a lot of experience in fine dining, and although the food was spectacular, the service was not.  My husband and I were on the younger side of the clientele that evening, and I guess that meant to them that somehow we deserved lesser service.  We weren't even told the specials, and were served lesser glasses of wine with a lot of sediment.  We left after the main, deciding not to get dessert.  Very disappointing.  Fine dining for me is about the excellent service as well as the food, and they just didn't do it.  We left feeling rather insulted.
