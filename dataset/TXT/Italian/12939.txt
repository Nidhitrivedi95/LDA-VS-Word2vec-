GARBAGE!
Employees were friendly and we were starving after having checked in to Wynn. Walked in and the place looked like a fancy sportsbar. 
Started off w/ Calamari. It tasted a little like calamari, but the texture was different.....the spicy sauce was good....that's about it. 
I ordered a Blackberry Blis, which was good and gave me a little buz, and my girl ordered a Bellini. That was ehh, and the glass it came in was so dirty that you can feel the dirt on the outside of the glass. 
For our meals, we picked the Fetuccini Alfredo, Spaghetti and Meatballs, and Caesar Salad. 
This is the first Italian "restaurant" that didn't serve bread.....so once our meals came out, I asked for bread and parmesan cheese......a few minutes later......had to ask for it again....
here's how the rest of the meal went:
Fetuccini was bad...chicken is the quality you'll get at a really cheap buffet or in the pre-made microwave and serve chicken pieces from the store. Spaghetti and meatballs was chef-boy-r-d. I didn't say it tasted like it....it WAS that. Straight out of the can probably.....except it cost $24!!!! the bread was cold.....not room temp., but fridge cold. 
This place is overpriced and I suggest you either go somewhere else to eat, or if you have no choice, go to the bar and drink yourself unconscious so u don't make it here. 
To top it off....these retards don't check ID when someone bills a meal to their room, so 2 days after we ate there for the first/last time ever......we were billed for another meal.
