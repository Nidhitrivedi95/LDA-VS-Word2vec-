PcfFrGL6NgS0gqneNE8R0A We always do pizza on one of the weekend nights and have tried several different locations around Lake Wylie - We still rate this portofino's as the best as compared to Ayrsley especially - the Gastonia staff appear Italian and obviously cook like Italians - would love to eat in sometime.  They prepare pizza with the right amount of sauce, cheese and are generous on toppings.  Their crust is also done the best. This is compared to Lake Wylie Pizza, Luigi's Pizza, Papa John's, etc...
