XD0LjNuPPwJPsTAHecUh7A One of my worst food experiences in Toronto. 1- There are way too many tables for the space 
2-the place is really really dim (it was hard reading the menu
3- The food portions are really small, I have had tapas that are larger 
4- My pasta took over 45 min to get to the table and it was undercooked 
5-  The sea food pasta had almost no sea food in it (1 shrimp, 2 tiny pieces for scallops, and 5 rings of calamari and 6 mussels)
6- The sea food was overcooked and chewy (with the exception to the one shrimp that was actually the only good thing in my place )
7-The place is overpriced
