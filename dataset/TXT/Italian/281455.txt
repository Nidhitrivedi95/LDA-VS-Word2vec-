YSUcHqlKMPHHJ_cTrqtNrA My BF took me here for my Birthday dinner and I loved it. There are 2 seating areas for dinner. One is the more typical restaurant area and the other is a dim light more romantic area with a large bar. We sat in the romantic side of course. Our server was absolutely amazing. very tentative but not in your face. The food was really good and authentic tasting plus the atmosphere was awesome. Even though it was a quite night in there you didn't see the servers effing around and doing nothing, which was good. It made me feel like they were aware of us and respectful. I felt really comfortable and was happy that he took me here.

I would recommend this place for a nice evening dinner. Definitely want to go back again.
