qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg It has taken me awhile to review this place. I didn't want to give it a review while peeved. But this place has peeved me each time, yet, I still return because the pita and lemon cilantro hummus is my addiction and it offers such a great lunch menu. It definitely beats having to drive a way for Mediterranean food and I always double thumbs up for that! 

We used to eat here when they were back at the centennial shopping center area, and at the time I was not as impressed. However, I can honestly say they have greatly improved. Their pomegranate chicken is always tender and juicy. Although, I don't specifically order that for myself...I always can't help but to take a bite off my kids plate. 

Their veggies are always so fresh and crisp so I appreciate that especially because I'll order a wrap or gyro. Their gyros are usually stuffed as I find myself struggling to monster bite into it. Lol. Their Platos potatoes seem to be just the frozen store.bought fries...but that's okay because they season it well and the dip that comes with it is rather simple.but good! 

My only gripe that leaves me.annoyed is for the most part...service is very slow especially during lunch time. My husband works nearby so we like having lunch dates here and I have to go there first then do the text of I just ordered come.on up. We have gone for dinner and I was pretty irked at how.slow and seemingly neglectful the waitress was. She apologized because she had a lot of tables, but I mean...we were there before it got chaotic. From the look on everyone else's faces, I'm sure they were thinking the same thing. It's cool...I get it.

Other than that...yeah, good place to get your Mediterranean fix without doing the journey somewhere else! Definitely recommend! Kid and stroller friendly!

Enjoy!
