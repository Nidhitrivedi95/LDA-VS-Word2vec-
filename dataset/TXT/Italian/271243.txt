XqSN1PtZkJ6QorOUa9AAdA I'm a huge fan of this place. The service is fantastic and the food is great. I really like the duck plate and veal pasta plate. The restaurant gives you a free ticket to the gondola ride at the hotel, which makes the perfect date night. It is very expensive by my standards and I only come here once in a blue moon, but it's totally worth it.
