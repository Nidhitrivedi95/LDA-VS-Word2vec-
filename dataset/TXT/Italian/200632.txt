Service: This was my first experience at Spacco, which happened to be on a Friday night. 
Our server had a bit of attitude. It felt like he was doing us a favour by doing his job. He came to take our drink order and completely disregarded me(he took 3 out of 4 orders). I went to get his attention by "grabbing" his arm, in which he informed me politely but FIRMLY (and a bit rudely) that I shouldn't be grabbing his arm. 
I wouldn't recommend this place for a date. I feel like your date would end up pissed off or annoyed with the servers attitude.

Food: I ordered the Don Cleo sandwich with a garden salad. They only had a balsamic vingarette, which I thought was surprising because every restaurant I've gone to has at least ranch or even caser. The dressing was extremely vinegary and I couldn't enjoy the salad. The sandwich was pretty bland, but the large chicken portion was surprising. 

Atmosphere: We sat outside on the patio which was fairly busy. It would have been nice to hear the music from the inside on the patio. After dinner we went and took a look around the place and it was pretty busy. Not too many people on the dance floor and a handful of people playing billiards. 

Suggestions: If you do want to come to Spaccos I suggest sitting outside on the patio, but I wouldn't bring a date here. It has a casual dress code which is nice. Would I come here again? Probably not.
