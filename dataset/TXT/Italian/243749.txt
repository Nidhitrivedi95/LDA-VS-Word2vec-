usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA It's a contest between Piccolo Forno and Il Pizziolo for who can deliver the best Italian Wine Bar style pizza. Not necessarily a meal like we might expect, this is snacking pizza. 

As a city, we've come to tolerate Mineo's as a standard, even though that pie would have done best being served in 1985 at Pizza Hut. Piccolo Forno doesn't approach pizza with the same regard as a heavy, greasy comfort food, and the overall build is far lighter and more dignified - like it should be.

If Il Pizziolo's is a little wetter, Piccolo Forno's a little crunchier. Satisfying in a pinch, the pizza here shows signs of a temperamental oven and was presented with an unevenness in the cooking. I want a char on the bottom; not a spotty blackness. Sauce and cheese to cover the margherita were good but not particularly notable.

I won't call it bad, but I can't say I'm altogether impressed. I would certainly eat it again, but for the price, in Pittsburgh, I expect something a little more to weigh me down.
