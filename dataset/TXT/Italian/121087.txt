HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A Cool place, you can sit at the counter & be part of the kitchen. Tried the pork loin & it was very good. Wine was good. Ended the meal with tiramisu (this is my fav dessert) it only gets 2 stars. It needed more cheese & coffee flavor.  It was homemade but they used a cake instead of lady fingers. Would not recommend it :(
