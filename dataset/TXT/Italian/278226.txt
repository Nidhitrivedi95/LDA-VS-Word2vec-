yLrCSSrSnpxB-0ZEPt19jA I LOVE this place. I love all of the by-the-slice pizzas I've had. My favorite is currently the mac'n'cheese. I think it's better than Ian's and have argued for many hours over it with friends. My old favorite was the BBQ chicken. I think I got a free slice of cheese from the Moocho app that wasn't very good, but with a selection like Pizza Di Roma's why would you get cheese?

My absolute favorite thing here is the calamari. They easily have the best calamari I've ever had. I hate the tentacle parts and they're always more than happy to not give them to me whenever I ask. Which is very appreciated as I just find them weird (I know it's silly).

I've gotten delivery a few times and it's always warm when I get it. It can take a bit longer than other delivery  places I've noticed, but it's not enough of a difference for me to care.

They've only gotten a few of my orders wrong and considering how this is one of my top three most frequented places, that's not bad. They're always nice when they have to fix a problem.

I don't like sitting in the restaurant. It has a lot more to do with the people who go there and the fact that I only eat there late night. I just don't like listening to drunk frat guys talk about the women they're screwing. I imagine during the day it's fine. The place is nice looking and clean. Plus the murals are really pretty.
