0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw We've been here twice, once for coffee/breakfast at their place in the back and the next for dinner to sample the burgers I had read about.  I love the ambiance here and the casual dining on picnic tables outside on their lovely grounds, and the food is a notch above decent, and fresh, for sure.  We will most likely be back, just because it's a cool little spot with good food.
