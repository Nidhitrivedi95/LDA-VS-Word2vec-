G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I was hoping to really love this restaurant since I love watching Giada's cooking show. I made reservations for the Saturday after Thanksgiving 2 months prior for 5 people. They asked if it was a special occasion and stated it was my nieces bday. 
First things first the self parking is limited it is shared with the adjacent hotel n a timeshare. So you have no option but to valet. This was at 5pm. We then get to the restaurant and we still had to wait for 15 min for our table and when the hostess sat us we stood their like idiots bc they were still prepping the table. Epic fail!! 
When we finally sat our waitress was unprepared.. Trying to give us a menu that was empty so she had to go get another one.. 5min later she comes back takes drink order. She looked disheveled n had no personality. 
Food was mediocre for it being a fancy restaurant. I ordered the crab n scallop risotto which had bits of crab shells in it. I told the waitress and her response: oh that happens sometimes n walked away. The scallops were very salty as well. The appetizers were good we had the octopus, calamari n shrimp and some cheese thing which I can't remember the name of. There was nothing special on the dessert menu which I was so surprised about bc Giada makes awesome desserts on her show. 
So the occasion was my nieces bday that was acknowledged by 3 people at this restaurant and did nothing special not even a piece of chocolate?? Why acknowledge the occasion if they plan not to do anything I thought that was really weird.
The one memorable thing was the photo booth in the front entrance. 
In conclusion: reservation service fail, food mediocre and service fail;(
