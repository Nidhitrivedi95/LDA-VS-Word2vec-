oi5BvNYKud9bGC74XcnwEA We went here about a month or 2 ago. The service was ok, little sluggish. But the thing that earned this only 2 stars was the so called pulled pork sandwich i ordered. I should have known not to order this particular item at kelseys, however they claimed it was pretty good so I went for it. 
And then I tasted Dijon mustard and cheese. couldnt taste any pulled pork though.The pork was dry and unseasoned. no bbq sauce unlike every other pulled pork sandwich i have had.
If they can spoil a dish as simple as this , i dont expect they can do much better with anything else on the menu. 

Not going back unless its someones birthday and they have this as their favorite restaurant for some reason.
