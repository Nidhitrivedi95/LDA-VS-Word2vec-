It was nothing short of amazinnng!  I will warn you, the portions are large for a tasting menu and you will get full! Ladies don't make the mistake of wearing a tight dress like I did! I was iffy about the tasting menu because I normally wouldn't choose to order most of what was on it and my boyfriend isn't a huge seafood person but we were feeling adventurous and wow were we surprised. The items I remembered the most were the raw yellowtail, fennel dusted black cod, spaghetti, and the desserts! Who knew simple spaghetti could be soo good! They were also sooo nice to give us three extra items on top of the tasting menu! Oh and also, their bread basket is the best I've had. Stromboli bread. Oh my goodness, I have dreams about this bread haha. The  ambience is very romantic and dimmly lit yet didn't feel stuffy or stiff like some higher end restaurants. I wish I took pictures but since our table was in the middle of two others tables I didn't want to disturb anyone with the flash of my camera. Oh and the view is really pretty! I hope to be back soon!!!
