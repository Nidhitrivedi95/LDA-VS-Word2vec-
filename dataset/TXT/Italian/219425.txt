SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg In wanting to get off the Vegas Strip, I sent out a call for recommendations and received a great one for Herbs and Rye, located in a somewhat seedy part of Vegas on W.Sahara. Don't let the outside location deter you. The inside of Herbs and Rye had a great, dark vibe and was definitely not a Vegas Strip kinda place. I am quite certain its a local hang out. In fact, if I lived in Vegas- I would be a regular for sure. They specialize in craft cocktails, a favorite of mine and the reason why my buddy and I went. I had a Buck's Fizz (on the menu) which was a great refresher followed up by a Pimm's Cup (not on the menu) which was done well, although with Ginger Ale instead of Ginger Beer. My buddy had a Moscow Mule which was great and quite large drink which kept him occupied during our whole stay. The menu is divided into cocktail "eras" such as "pre-prohibition", etc. I thought that was a cool touch. A pleasant surprise was the food. Being a cocktail place they don't do drink happy hours, which I admire- however they do food happy hours...with several dishes offered at a discount. To take advantage I had the mussels in a spicy tomato sauce and my buddy had the fillet and mashed potatoes. Both were excellent and a great deal. So, in addition to recommending this place for a great pre-strip hopping cocktail, I would definitely get there for some grub prior to going back to the stock tourists hang outs.
