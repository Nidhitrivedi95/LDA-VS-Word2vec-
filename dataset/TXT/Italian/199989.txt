PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA One of the best meals that I have had in a while!
I met my friend Marty here for dinner this week. He raved about the food, and I was hoping to find a new and scrumptious restaurant to explore. We got there just in time for happy hour, so I was able to snag a house martini for $5. Fantastic way to start! We  started with bruschette...4 chunky slices of rustic italian bread with a drizzle of balsamic, small chunks of tomato and what I am guessing was fresh parsley. The bread was fresh and was the perfect consistency. I dislike when the bread is too thick and way too crispy and the toppings are just sitting on top and fall off everywhere. This was by far the best bruschette that I have ever had. The balsamic complimented the light toast and the freshness of the toppings was just to die for. We then ordered the Pizza della Terra...wild mushrooms, braised leeks, taleggio cheese and truffle oil. What a creation! The smooth truffle oil with the earthiness of the mushrooms was an incredible compliment to one another. The cheese was not one that I was familiar with, but was creamy and distinct. The leeks were caramelized and added depth to the overall experience. I can see why this pizza was featured as one of Phoenix's best (and is also why I ordered it). Chef Peter stopped by our table and was gracious and friendly. Attentive and personable wait staff as well. I will be returning and giving rave reviews by mouth whenever I can!
