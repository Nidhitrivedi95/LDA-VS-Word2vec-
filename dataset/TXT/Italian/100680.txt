fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w Our first stop after arriving from the airport and were not disappointed.  Who would think chicken strips would be so lovely?  They give you a selection of dipping sauces, my favorite was the chili infused dip.  The service was amongst the best in Las Vegas. The hiring manager should get a raise.  Everyone here had such a great attitude and work ethic, it kept us coming back for a drink or food each night. Thank you!
