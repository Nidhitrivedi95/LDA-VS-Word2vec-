The service was excellent,. Jean-Phillipe was very polite, attentive, and he made us feel immediately at home from the second he stepped to our table. We explained that we couldn't read the menu, which was entirely in french, so he did us the favor of describing some of the appetizers for us. He'd periodically check in on us throughout the evening, usually to gauge our reactions to the food, which were a mix of ravings and silence, due to being completely at a loss for words.

The food was incredible. Not even joking, it was the best meal I can remember having... ever. We started with the brussel sprouts which blew my mind. I'd never had them quite like this. I believe they fried them in beef fat, and dressed them with a cider/honey/hotsauce concoction that was absolutely perfect. Oh and the mussels. Not too briny, fresh and delicious.
Horse filet. I never ever thought in a million years I'd eat horse, but I did, and it was amazing. Very similar to beef, but slightly more tender, and just as, if not more delicious.
The lobster pasta plate was huge and the pasta perfectly cooked. Creamy sauce with so much lobster. The two of us barely dented it, and I'm looking forward to the leftovers.
We finished the meal off with the sticky toffee pudding. I'm a big dessert eater, and my date isn't, but she raced me to the last bite.

All in all, it was a wonderful experience and after I got up from the table, I wanted to walk into the kitchen and open mouth kiss the chef so he could taste everything I just did.

Thank you Jean-Phillipe and everyone at the Liverpool House, next time I'm in town, I'll be sure to come by.
