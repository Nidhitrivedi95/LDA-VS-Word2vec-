FEnAZBsWW9o1yhDRygQ_Sg Very nice experience. The ambiance of the restaurant is a nice touch of Italy, along with the friendliness of the staff. The stuffed tortellini in cream sauce with truffle oil was to die for. So rich and full of flavour. Surprisingly this was only a special of the, but it would definitely be able to survive on the main menu.  Will definitely come back.
