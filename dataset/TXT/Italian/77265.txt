Our waiter took quite a while to finally acknowledge our presence. We ordered the bruschetta, a deep dish pizza, iced tea (no lemon), & water (no lemon). The waiter repeated all of this back to us. He brought back our drinks WITH lemons and no ice. Then proceeded to argue with us as to how we ordered our drinks. Then he compounded the problem by going to the corner station, removing the lemons, adding ice, and serving them to us again. I realize some of you are thinking this guy is nitpicking, but imagine he effect if someone was allergic.

We decided to add the garlic/parmesan fries. Our appetizers came out quickly and if the I was judging strictly on the fries, I would have been rating them at 5 stars. The Bruschetta was good, but the bread it was on could not in any way be called garlic toast. The very fresh diced tomatoes and fresh mozzarella were excellent, but the not quite toast became very soggy.

We ordered the pesto chicken, mushrooms, & black olives on our deep dish. The pizza arrived in about 30 minutes which we thought was pretty good. The good part: crust had a nice texture/taste, and they did not scrimp on the cheese which was top-notch. The bad: the sauce was very generic and bland. What we got of the 'toppings' was great, but was extremely skimpy.

There was lots of extra tomatoes on the bruschetta which we added to the fries and the pizza. It complimented both very well. 

The atmosphere could only be catagorized as a cacophony. Something resembling sound dampening would have been a nice addition.

We did have a ton of leftover pizza, but I am not really looking forward that much to the leftovers.

Overall, my rating would have been closer to 2.5 stars. It really didn't rate $50 with tip.
