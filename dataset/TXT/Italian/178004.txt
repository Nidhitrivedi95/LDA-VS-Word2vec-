The composition of the plate was really pretty and the flavor combination (it was a crispy turkey breast with risotto and a horseradish cranberry relish) was very good-- it was like fancy thanksgiving! 

Service was good. I sat at the bar and the bartender was nice and food came fast. Only complaint is the risotto was a bit salty, but if you eat all the bits at once, it wasn't a major issue and I ate it all up :)

Restaurant itself is really nice and cozy. Not too much room to sit in the bar stools along the longest edge of the bar because the walking space is small between that and the tables. Liked the atmosphere though.
