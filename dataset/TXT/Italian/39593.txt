7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ This place is overrated. Way overrated. I thought it was just okay, which for a place that charges up the you know what, it's not acceptable.

Our waiter knew the word no way too much. Almost any deviation from the menu we asked about, the answer was no.

The pastas were tiny. The sides were tiny. The amount of meat on the steaks was subpar. And, they tasted decent, but not great.

I had to use the bathroom at some point and it showed me how big this place is. And, any place that is this big, should not have one bathroom all the way in the back. I had to walk a quarter mile to get to it. Nuts.

Don't go here. There are 4 other steak houses in the Palazzo alone. I would go to Cut if you want a spot in the Palazzo, or just a good spot in general.
