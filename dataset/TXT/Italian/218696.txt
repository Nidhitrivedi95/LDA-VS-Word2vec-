s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q Very nice and clean place! Everyone from the person who took our name to the servers were very sweet and attentive.  Food was delicious, the wait wasn't bad at all.  This place is busy but that does not keep them from giving you great service.  I would definitely come back and do recommend it to anyone who want great service.
