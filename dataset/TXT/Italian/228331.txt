SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog RigaTony's is one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area. My family has been eating here for nearly 20 years. My little sister actually once barfed up pool water and Oreos in the lobby of the old location after a long day of swimming at Grandma's house... ahhh, memories. (They were extremely nice about it.)

Anyways. I COULD order just their delicious salad and bread here and be totally satisfied, but I never do. I always have a terrible time deciding between Penne Rosa (probably my favorite), Baked Rigatony, Capellini Checca, Chicken Picatta, Stuffed Shells, and a ton of other things. I love them all. We've also ordered their large to-go pans for parties at home several times, and those have always been fantastic as well. There's a reason this restaurant is always packed, and I always look forward to taking out-of-town guests to our favorite restaurant!
