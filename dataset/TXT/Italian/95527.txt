epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ We dined al fresco on a warm October evening and had such a lovely date night. It was a busy Saturday night, but we were still seated within about 40 minutes. Host was very nice.

We shared two appetizers- the fresh Buffalo mozzarella plate and the Antipasti. They were very well put together with quality foods. My fiancée was a little confused- 'This cheese isn't spicy at all!'  I had to explain Buffalo did not refer to wing sauce. Guess I have a little refining to do with that one!  ;-)

We shared an entrée- Scampi Pappardelle. The scampi (3 with an order) were huge! They were grilled and had excellent flavor. The pasta was perfect and I loved the freshness of the sauce. The menu said 'spicy', but I didn't taste any kind of heat. Could have used a few pepper flakes in the sauce.

We both really loved our drinks too. He had the Dark and Stormy (also very confused about the giant piece of ginger in the drink. I had to explain to him what it was) and I settled right in with a glass of Valpolicella. The bread was also delicious.

We will certainly be back!
