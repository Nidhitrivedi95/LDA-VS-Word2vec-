jz4jg_OTw32IMr_sXFwj9Q We sat near the bar area where the TV's are. It was clean and quiet. The guys at the bar were talking about football, it actually kept us entertained during lunch. Lol.

We ordered a large meatball and a large chicken & broccoli. The chicken broccoli was DELICIOUS. Best pizza I've had in a while. Meatball was nothing to write home about, but good anyway.

Nice kids meal options for our son, too.

Waiter was friendly and kept our drinks full. Couldn't ask for more at lunch time.

Prices are little high bu worth it.
