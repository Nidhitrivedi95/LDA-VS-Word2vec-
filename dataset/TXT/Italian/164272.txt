LXheNwqZPoXuXNNeP1sNew My girlfriend and I thought we'd try this place out because we purchased a Groupon. 

Once we arrived we were greeted and let us choose any table because they weren't very busy; given it was a Wednesday night. Once seated at a high top table and given menus we seemed to be ignored. 

About what felt like ten minutes passed and a lady named Kendra stopped by and asked if we've been helped. We told he we haven't and she asked if we'd like something to drink. My girlfriend and I wanted to try two draft beers. She rudely asked for our ID's and got us our tasters. While she was gone we tried the beers and looked at our Groupon on my girlfriend's cell phone and noticed it was only good at the Kierland location (no biggy). 

I had to try to make eye contact with the waitress so we could order our drinks. There were probably three other couples eating and one larger table of six (I don't believe a little better service would have been difficult). The draft beer selection was also quite poor although their extensive wine selection makes up for it...IF you're a wine drinker. 

We finally got our pizza order in as we were half way through our tasty beers and couldn't wait to dive in... we were starving at this point. 

Our pizza arrived and it looked delicious although it seemed like it should be served in a larger plate (slumping off of the sides). We ordered two waters and began eating. The pizza was delicious and the only complaint was that the pizza was a little too thin. But we really enjoyed it. 

Our waters never arrived so I flagged down another waitress and asked her for two waters. They came instantly. 

I know it sounds like I'm nitpicking this place to death but I'm not. I believe we just had a waitress that might have been new or something. We will be back and I hope we have a much better experience.
