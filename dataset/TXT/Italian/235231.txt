TVKenh65WwJX3zEr36zKCA If you've been to the Oyster Bar at Palace Station, this is the answer to the hour plus line at Palace Station. The one in the Sunset Station Casino in Henderson is 98% as good but a much shorter line, if any. Unlike the Palace Station version that has just 21 seats at a bar, this version has several tables as well and the line is survivable. Had the Signature Pan Roast and it was the outstanding equivalent to the Combo Pan Roast at the Palace Station restaurant. I'll make the drive out to Henderson in a minute to go to this place.
