KY8J9dIOKD2vL0jdzUiuhg I love this place. I have gone here multiple times and I honestly look forward to coming back again.  I am Colombian, so once I saw that this place opened up and that they served Venezuelan food I HAD to go, and honestly, I was not disappointed at all as it was very,very similar to my mom's Colombian home cooking.

I have tried their suffed arepas which are like corn patties (think grits) stuffed with delicious chicken and avocado. I have also tried their cochino frito, which fried pork. It was perfectly cooked and just so flavorful. 

For brunch they have a variety of items to try. Eight in all and  you get to pick five of them. I had the pericos which is eggs with tomatoes and onions (done just right, not overdone or underdone), fried arepas, little cheese sticks wrapped in what seemed pastry, shredded chicken, and bacon. Although it sounds like a whole lot, the portions were just perfect. Also for brunch if you bring your own Champagne, they will provide the OJ for a small fee so you can have mimosas!!!

Also in the evenings they provide a complimentary sangria with your dinner!! Not too shabby for a place that is BYOB!!

Overall this place is awesome and I honestly can't wait to go back!!!
