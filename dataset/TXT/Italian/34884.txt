6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA A solid Japanese Italian fusion restaurant. Tried their:
1. bruschettas (anchovy oil with mozzarella, octopus and avocado with wasabi mayo, & tuna and spicy cod roe. One of each for small order and two of each for large.). My favorite was the octopus and avocado, followed by the tuna. Didn't really taste the anchovy on the last one. They're all very buttery and just crispy goodness all around.

2. squid ink spaghetti - try this! Yes, the color might turn you off and probably not a dish of choice for a first date haha but this is one of those simple dishes that has extra dimension of flavor. The squid ink gives that umami-y, oceany note to the al dente spaghetti. Trattoria Nakamura-ya did a really good version.

 3. linguini with scallop, shrimp, and salted cod rod. Creamy, rich flavor melted perfectly with the linguini. The fresh seafood balanced the dish.

Service was on point. The only downside is they're located in the same plaza as Raku, Kabuto, Hwaro, etc., so parking is not easy to find during popular dining hours. Can't wait to come back and try more dishes from this gem of a restaurant!
