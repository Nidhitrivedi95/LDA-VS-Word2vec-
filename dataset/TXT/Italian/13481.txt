18NP-qL3VIJEBJGpns7aTw Embarrassingly I have been here probably close to 100 times. At least 20 of the 30 lbs I need to lose is from Barro's. My wife and staff tell me I need to stay away.  I can't. The all meat pizza and huge dining area are as irresistible as a cute puppy with a red Christmas bow around it. 

The price is great. Too good- which is probably why they just raised it a bit. Still a smokin' deal! 

Police officers often congregate to eat here. Seriously. All of them. Like at least 50 at a time. I've never felt more safe and satisfied in my life. If you are a wanted criminal, come buy them a round of pizza, confess your crimes and I'll bet they let you off easy.
