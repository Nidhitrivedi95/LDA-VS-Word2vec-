Portions are a bit small, but if you're going with appetizers and dessert the amount of food will leave you full and happy without being too stuffed to leave your chair. The waitress made a great wine selection to go with our food. The restaurant isn't very big, the decor is modern. A good place to go on a date if you're willing to spend the $.
