3-6biVwm7VwPZ-k67jml-Q Probably the worst eggplant parmesan sandwich is the history of this item. The one star extra is for decent bread, but the filling was inedible. They decide to strip the eggplant down to the skins and then put all the skins in the sandwich. Next, they take all the seedings and eggplant meat and also throw that into this sandwich disaster. Top it off with mozzarella cheese and charge you $9 for the privledge of eating a horrible concoction. Nothing is fried, nothing is mentioned how they would be spitting on the fine history of the egplant parm sandwich in their version. Wilted lettuce as your side dish and there you go - enjoy your lousy lunch. Ripoff city. Should have walked out when they said that they don't have a chicken parmesan sandwich...hello it's an Italian joint. Whatever part of Italy this place represents, avoid it on vacation.
