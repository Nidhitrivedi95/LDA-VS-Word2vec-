gtfLQysuCBEAQk3wwWxwTg Sunday afternoon linner and a pizza craving. Neither of us were particularly hungry, so we decided to just get one Margherita pizza, an arugula salad, and the peperonata appetizer, which came in just over $40. The salad was slightly under-dressed for my taste, and the peppers could have been warmed up, but both were very tasty. They were also a little on the small side for the price. 

The pizza, though, as simple as it was, was delicious. The crust had just the right amount of crunch, the cheese was perfectly gooey, and the tomato sauce tasted very fresh. The chili oil is SUPER spicy (YUM!), so use sparingly! I only used it on one slice so that I could taste the individual flavours of the true ingredients on the others. At the end of the meal, they offered us an ice cream on the house - a very nice gesture - and SO creamy and flavorful, even for simple vanilla with a strawberry on top. 

Someone recently mentioned in another review that they do not accept credit cards, but this was not the case for us: the waitress told us they take everything but AMEX.
