dWliPaP9k43hSKGSujNFXg We stumbled into the place after going to another business in the plaza.  At first glimpse we thought it was a chain but entering the place I saw the review in the local paper that I had read.  The raves in the review were correct. The bar is a long granite or marble setting with comfortable chairs.  Although stuck in a boring plaza the atmosphere is hushed, dim lights, Italian setting but not cheesy Italian.  The artwork partly consists of photos of the Carnegie Bridge, an icon of Cleveland architecture.  We stayed for happy hour, a rare treat for a Saturday.  Great selection of food and wine, pleasant and attentive bar help, thank you Randi!  I really liked the place and will be back.  Highly recommended.
