Formally, "The Fontana Bar and Lounge" SBE Entertainment and MGM International decided to redesign and rebrand the Fontana Bar to add some nightlife to the Bellagio, I believe it kills the sophisticated and classy theme that makes the Bellagio famous for. Hyde Bellagio is in the same league as the Bond Bar and Chandelier Bar at the Cosmopolitan which is only a 10 - 15 minute walk. In my opinion, those bars have much to offer compared to Hyde. The few things I liked about the this bar / lounge was the close view of the Bellagio Fountains, drinks, and friendly staff. 

It's nice to come by, relax, mingle with tourists, and watch the Bellagio Fountains. The fountains were so close to the lounge, that you can almost feel the mist from the water  jets. I'm not much into the clubbing scene as I was a few years ago but the lounge is a great place to just relax from the casino or whatever. 

TIP: Bellagio guests get in free, just show your room key and you're good to go. Unless they have a special event going on, just have to pay whatever fee they have.
