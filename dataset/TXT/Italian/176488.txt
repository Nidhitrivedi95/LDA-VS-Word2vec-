nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ My husband and I dined here on Saturday night. We were visiting from out of town and staying at a nearby resort. We wanted Italian, but wanted to get out of the hotel. This place was close and had some good reviews. We are so glad that we decided to eat here!!

Our server was fantastic. The receipt said "Dominico" but I forgot to look at his name tag. Anyway, he was an older gentleman with an accent. He made great recommendations and steered us exactly where we wanted to go. We ended up ordering the Italian Kale salad to start and let me tell you....it was amazing! Then we got the Lobster Ravioli for our main course and it was fantastic as well. We were both very impressed. There was also live music and it was perfect.

We only make it to Vegas about 2 times/year and I can't wait to come back to enjoy another meal here. Next time we will make sure to save room for a cannoli!
