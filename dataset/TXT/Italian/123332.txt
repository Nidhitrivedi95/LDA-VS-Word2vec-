hlrZHM4D48XiQtXh6cRg_w I am giving this place only 3 stars, not because of the food but because of the manager that was on duty tonight. 

First off, the food was great and the server that we had was really nice. I have no complain about the food at all as we all enjoyed it. This place is also good for gatherings as the ambiance was amazing, it was not very loud and music selection was good.

However, we were disappointed with how the manager handled our situation. We understand that we had reservation and some of us were late but she did not give us our seat since our group was not complete yet. She could have sent us to the dining as we waited for our entire group to arrive as 90% of us were already there. We were not informed about their policy that if your group is not complete, your entire group will not be seated and you would be asked that your reservation will be given to other group. The place was not 100% full that night and if they have that policy, which is by the way not common and not the best service to guests, they should inform us when we book our reservation.

Overall, like I said, food was great but the manager that night could have served us better.
