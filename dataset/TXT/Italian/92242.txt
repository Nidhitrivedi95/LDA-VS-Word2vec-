EgwGTDZ705TwudPJwAY0yQ This gem has been at this location in Ahwatukee for 11 years (next to Va  Bene). I can't believe I only just now found it! Being Italian, I'm pretty picky about my Italian food and this place is so good and is reasonably priced! At the outset though, I had my doubts because their bread is a really poor excuse for Italian bread. It's soft and not anything like the crusty Italian bread I'm used to. Normally this does not bode well for the quality of the food. However...

Lasagna and eggplant parm were very good (don't think I'll ever find any as good as mama's or my own). Salad with house Italian dressing was quite good (no wilted lettuce as another reviewer experienced). Trio pizza (ricotta, tomato, basil) and clam pizza were excellent! Never had clam pizza before. It was garlicky and wonderful. They also made me a red clam sauce version. It was good too, but not as garlicky as the white. Also had pasta with broccoli and sausage... Excellent. Only thing is that the clam pizza and pasta were a bit oily for my liking. Next time I'll ask them to cut back on the oil.

They make their own Sangria and oh my! Love it!! Nice and fruity, not too sweet and not too dry. Finally, I had the cannoli--hands down the best cannoli I've had in a LONG time.  

The other thing I love about this place is that it's family-owned and you can tell they love what they do. All were so warm and friendly. I went for my birthday dinner with my husband and they really made it special. But get this... they didn't even know it was my birthday! I had finished my sangria and thinking about how I'd love another when the waiter came over and asked if I wanted what was left in the carafe, which turned out to be a full glass. Then when he brought the check he served us a cannoli on the house! When I thanked my hubby for telling them it was my bday, he said he hadn't! 

Definitely returning often... Especially for the special pricing on their pasta dishes on Mondays and Tuesdays!
