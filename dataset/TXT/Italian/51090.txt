Met up with a group of 10 other friends for a dinner and got to sit in a corner of the restaurant that was relatively quiet for all of us to have a conversation.  The waiter was very attentive and took the time to explain things on the menu, as well as answer any questions we had about the portions.  I got the baked carbonara and a tiramisu for dessert - both were very good!  The tiramisu was a bit heavier (dense) than I expected, so I was stuffed by the end of the dinner. :p

Overall, great ambience and food.  Would definitely come again!
