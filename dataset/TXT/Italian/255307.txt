VYLQ3bMCqmHiNO2FS8aAsg Didn't feel like pizza, but a co-worker talked me into coming here. Made it here around lunch time, and it seemed super busy so I assumed it must be good and  worth the trip. The Venezia's Supreme and 6 spicy wings (that made me tear like a little girl) w/drink combo is a very good deal for around $6.. very authentic NY style pizza. Good dough and ingredients. Thank you for the big slices of pizza, I'm tired of going to places and over-paying for dinkey little slices.

Thumbs up!!
