0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw I've been here a few times and I have to say its okay. There no way I'm going to drive out to santan for a pizza thats good but not great. I can get the pulled pork sandwich at joe's bbq closer which is the same. The burgers might be fresh but always needed something else to bring it up to par.


The worse thing is breakfast. We went at about 6:30 in the morning and got the green chilie pork and scrambled eggs. As much as people blow things up these eggs were cold and overcooked. Plain and simple.

I'd like to see this place do well, they just need to tighten up a little and they'll be fine.
