L9qDnDHSnINNjePwrJz-uQ We have loved this restaurant for many years now!  Their pizza has a unique and amazing flavor, the crust is super delicious and the sauce is great too!  It's our "go-to" pizza place and when we are in the mood to eat in and have Italian it's also a fav!  If we are ordering out for a big group, we also like to do a little combo of pizza, pasta and salad!  You can't go wrong here.  This location struggles to stay busy but I think it's just a "hidden gem" so hopefully more people will discover it soon!
