3k9treY8PmsZ42bKmuICgA Spoon and Fork gets a solid "meh". The food was okay. Nothing was bad. But nothing was great either. This location was previously Matsu, which was a much superior restaurant. 
The appetizers were probably the best part of the meal. The calamari and tempura basket were both good. 
When it comes to sushi, my biggest pet-peeve is cold rice. Maki should taste fresh, not refrigerated. This maki was definitely cold and mediocre.
I also don't understand how an "All You Can Taste" place doesn't have bottomless soft drinks. Dessert is extra too. 
I doubt I'll be back.
