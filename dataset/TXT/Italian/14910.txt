1muT5zEqoC4qp9ms08qJtQ We've seen this place and always wanted to try it out. We learned that it's not the best date night place for a young couple. 

Pizza was really good! Got a deep dish sausage pizza. Could have had more cheese, and the crust is so large you would think they could offer garlic butter to dip it in, but no.

Service was good but our server was a bit odd. He introduced himself as Ricky Bobby and then we overheard him telling other servers "Shake and bake." (From Talladega Nights if anyone isn't familiar.) He was a bit intense with eye contact and I wasn't 100% comfortable.

Environment wasn't the best. Our table was right in line with their drink counter and close to the kitchen, so there were plenty of staff walking by constantly. A full-on view of a black kitchen non-slip mat and the water station isn't exactly the ambiance I look for in a restaurant.
At some point they turned the TVs on really loudly, and all I could hear was commercials blasted into my ears because the baseball game hadn't even come on yet. Also plenty of kids and the occasional crying baby.
