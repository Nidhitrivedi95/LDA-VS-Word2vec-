Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A Pros:
Some more interesting choices compared to many of the other buffets(such as Mediterranean offerings, Lumpia, etc....).
The bread pudding is SO good. OMG.
Price ain't bad if you got a slot club card.

Cons:
Service can be rude
Overpriced at face.
VERY hit and miss.
Very small.

The only reason why I ever really come here is because I seem to always be in The Palms for one reason or another. While it's definitely MUCH MUCH better than it's original incarnation the ~Fantasy Market(seriously, WTF type of name for a restaurant is that???), it's still sorely lacking. Seeing that the unofficial theme for the Palms is the 7 Deadly Sins, I personally think that they decided to focus on Gluttony the least since the fat belly that results from gluttinous acts doesn't fit in with their main focuses of Vanity and Lust.
