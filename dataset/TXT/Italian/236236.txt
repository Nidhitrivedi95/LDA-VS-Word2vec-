Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA Tried Federal Pizza for the first time tonight. Atmosphere is nice, though the restaurant is so dark, its very hard to read the menu. Service was good and food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. While my wife enjoyed it, I found it to be way too salty. The pepperoni and the pizza sauce were both too salty for my taste. My wife enjoyed one of their signature 'wine coolers' and the prices on everything was just okay. Overall, they have the location, the atmosphere and the employees - now all they need to do is put the same amount of effort in the food. 

Incidentally, when the waiter asked if we wanted Parmesan cheese with the pizza, we expected him to come back with a shaker. Instead he has a cheese grater and cheese and starts grating it over the whole pizza. (My wife wanted parmeson, not me). So that was an unexpected and unnecessary surprise. Best to leave the Parmesan with the customer in case they want more later and can put on as much as they want. This makes more sense with a pasta dish...
