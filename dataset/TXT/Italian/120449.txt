h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ Came here with my girlfriend on a Friday around 8pm and used a Groupon (pre- fixe for two for $48 which consisted of 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 2 glasses of wine). We are locals (though that probably doesn't matter for purposes of this review).

The ambiance is very chill and romantic, it is the perfect place for a date. When we got here there was live music. Apparently they have live music every other Friday.

My girlfriend and I found the food to be fantastic. 

For my appetizer I had the cheese and cracker platter. It was delicious. My girlfriend had fried zuccini which was very good.

For entrees I had the lasagna while my girlfriend had the ravioli. Both were delicious.

Our service was great. We were helped immediately, and our server was very attentive throughout.  My girlfriend and I are both young and know very little about wine. Our server advised us on the best kind of wine was based on our personal preferences. The owner even came to our table and asked us how our food was.

We will definitely come back here!
