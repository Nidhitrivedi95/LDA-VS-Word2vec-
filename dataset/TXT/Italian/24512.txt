4EfiNcKSsafogIhAjwv0gg I'm Italian and lived in NY (NYC not Buffalo or something) for 25 years.  After moving out here recently, I was disgusted with all of the pizza that people have recommended to me.  Sunset is exceptional, especially for Vegas standards.  They have a $9.99 pickup special for a large cheese pizza and I urge everyone to try it.  Dough, sauce, and mozzarella live up to New York standards and blow everything that exists out here out of the water.  If you like Domino's, you probably won't appreciate this place.
