However, we were disappointed with the food. I ordered the steak and eggs which was supposed to be a  5 oz NY strip but I'm not sure that was the actual cut of meat. I asked for the temperature of medium and got a well done piece. A sin against beef. Also at the table was pancakes. Although the portion size was enough for 3, the cakes were heavy, cold, flavorless and without the honey the menu claimed they had. The cakes did not come with sides. The preference would be a smaller portion of cakes served with at least one side. The maple syrup was cold. We asked to have it heated but their heating lamp must not be functioning properly because after 2 attempts the syrup was still very cold. 

Last, the online menu is not aligned with the actual menu. We came for the Belgian waffle as seen online, but found they were not on the menu upon arrival. 

Overall, a disappointing experience but the place has potential. They've got work to do.
