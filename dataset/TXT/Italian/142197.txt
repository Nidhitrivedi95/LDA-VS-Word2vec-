jOseCpGmgbQWEfX2Wn_TGQ This restaurant had good Yelp reviews so my husband and I decided to try it. It's in a somewhat random location and it doesn't look like much on the outside. The inside is very dated but at the same time kind of fun. The all-male waitstaff is very attentive and very nice, The food was exceptional. I don't think I've ever had cannelloni as good as I had here. My husband's escargot and veal parm were excellent. The escargot was NOT "chewy" like pencil erasers as some restaurants serve. The creme brûlée was so-so but interesting because there were raspberries on the bottom and a couple of strawberries on the top. I thought the cream was a little too runny, but some people like it that way. I would go back to try the lasagna.
