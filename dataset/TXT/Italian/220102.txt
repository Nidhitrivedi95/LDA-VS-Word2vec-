SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg great prohibition-y vibe with an extensive menu of cocktails, but the actual cocktails don't live up to the rep this place puts forward. 

Service was super lackluster.  Came at about 6:30 on a weekday and waited probably an hour to get our food. When I asked the waiter if our food was coming soon, he had the gall to ask, "Do you have to be somewhere? Is there a certain time you need to leave by" 

So..... if I said 8, would you wait til a half hr before to get me my food? What kills me, was that it wasn't even busy... other reviews might talk about the waiters running around with their heads cut off, but it was not even busy. 

3 stars for the amazing deal on steaks (got a kansas flat iron for 14$... really not bad) 

but there are virtually not HH drink deals (all 13$), and the other food was very average and expensive. 

I.e., 

flatbread - bruschetta style -- very mediocre $15 
Mac and Cheese, --only plus was the truffle flavor, but otherwise nothign special 
Prosciutto penna pasta -- a whopping 22$ and it did not knock my socks off. 


We asked the bartender (i think the owner) to make 3 different cocktails and he could not get it right... for a place that touts such an expansive list, you'd think he could make 1 well balanced cocktail, but he didn't really know what he was doing.  To his credit, was a nice guy, so 3 stars for that and the food)
