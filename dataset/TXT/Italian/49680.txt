They were hands down the best food I had at that event.  I took their information and planned to go there for a full meal and never did.  
I am so disappointed in myself that it took so long to get here.  I took my boss here for lunch on a beautiful Phoenix day.  It would have been great to eat outside, but we opted for inside instead.  It's an old downtown house converted, like so many awesome places downtown, into a restaurant.  It's cozy and unpretentious.  A+ for atmosphere.
Just an fyi, during lunch, pizza is not served.  That just means I have to come back for dinner.  (Hopefully it won't take me another 5 years to do that).  At lunch, their delicious sandwiches and salads are available.  If you're not with your boss, you can also get a glass of pinot noir or chardonnay for $3.  I got a delicious lemonade and found a breakfast sandwich on the menu:  eggs, spinach, and ricotta on wood fired bread.  So good.  I got the fruit salad as my side which was yogurt, granola, and fruit.  My lunch ended up being two items I make myself for breakfast all the time, but elevated to gourmet deliciousness.  I can only strive to make my breakfast or lunch this great.  My boss got the pastrami sandwich and fruit salad and thanked me for bringing me here.
Looking at the reviews, I need to come back for dinner, brunch, and dessert.  I can't wait and definitely won't.
