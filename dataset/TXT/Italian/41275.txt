7NucoWCjPzZyRPjsVR28xQ The absolute worst pizza in Las Vegas.  We paid over $30 for 4 slices of BURNT BLAND "pizza."  The staff was careless and cussing at each other and clearly didn't care one bit about the quality of their product.  Seriously, the bottom of our slices was jet black and tasted like charcoal.  This was the worst part of our vacation.  Made a Yelp account just to review this horrible establishment.
