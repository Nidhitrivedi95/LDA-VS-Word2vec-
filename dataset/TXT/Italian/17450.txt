2bK1ng2mnRdtTh_BDNGmIg I've heard good things about North End pizza but I was disappointed. We ordered a medium supreme pizza and mozzarella sticks. The medium pizza was small and greasy. It was chewy and it seemed like it had been sitting for a while and then reheated. The mozzarella sticks cost $7 and they were the exact same brand as the ones served at the Walmart deli. That really made me mad. If a business is going to buy subpar products at least sell them at cost. Don't waste your money!
