oHvWn9Xmg7mfzzj9ROS-8A Some of the best food comes out of the smallest kitchens.  This is one of those places.  Family owned and operated, the food it AMAZING.  Felt like I was back in Southern Italy.  

Don't let the location scare you.  What they lack in curb appeal, they more than make up for in the food.  I can't wait to go back!!
