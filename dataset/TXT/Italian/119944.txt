H13m2H3HlSsiId_UcJfmQw I was excited for another Greek restaurant to open up in that location, since Mr Greek was a big fail and went downhill very quickly over the years. I ordered the chicken Greek. The chicken came raw three times. Yes. I sent it back thee times. The cook couldn't seem to cook it thoroughly. Never ended up eating the chicken. The salad was disgusting. The dressing was not your traditional Greek dressing. It was sweet like something you would pour on a dessert. The waiter was unable to comp the chicken. Even though it never came back to me eatable. Definitely do not waste your time or hard earned money.
