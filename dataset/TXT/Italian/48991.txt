9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Been here a few times in the last couple years. Always solid and never had a problem. Very cute date spot, actually the bf took me here on our first date, big points! I recommend the capricciosa(sp?) pizza and a nutella crepe with strawberries.

Parking is off the street and there will probably a wait, but it will be worth it
