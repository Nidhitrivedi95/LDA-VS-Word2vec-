SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ I stopped by here wandering through the forum shops and I'm glad I did.  I was by myself and starving and the smell of carbs!, garlic and Italian amazingness was irresistible.  I was seated immediately in the "outside" area (it's all technically indoors because you're inside the forum shops, it's just louder if you sit on the patio than inside the restaurant). 

My server was friendly and suggested I get the Capri Coral Crush...which I would suggest to you! It was AMAZING! Sounds much more melony than it is, it actually has a really great Mango taste served garnished with a mint sprig. Yum. 

They brought out warm bread and a little plate of olive oil which was nice since I was starving (see CARB! craving above). The bread was okay, it probably would not have been had it been cold, but warm it was fine and not too dry. 

I ordered the linguine with clams - white sauce.  Always a favorite of mine and it did not disappoint.  LOTS of clams.  It was not my favorite ever, but it was really good and was served fairly quickly considering what a crowd they had in the restaurant.

I would absolutely go back here, particularly for their happy hour Sunday-Friday with half off cocktails! I need another one of those Capri Coral Crush's!
