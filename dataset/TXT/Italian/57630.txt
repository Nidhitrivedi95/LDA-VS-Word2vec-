aNYunG3j5zNJ4F0dQcZMyQ Dined at Tomaso's with a group of 12 last Friday evening while enjoying the Labor Day weekend at the Bilmore. We chose Tomaso's due the the Yelp reviews and proximity to the hotel.

Although our waiter was not Italian (I believe he was South American), he was pretty good.  I think he tried to give our large group time to chat so it was nice not to be rushed (which seemed very European).

The meals served were beautiful, but I don't think any of us thought the food was that amazing (we also ate at the Capital Grille and Frank & Albert's-see those reviews-and really enjoyed the food).

I thought the restaurant had priced its menu well for the ambiance and plates served.  I would not be opposed to returning, but there are other better options in the area.
