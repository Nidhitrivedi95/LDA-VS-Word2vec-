t5Ip9ggWaam6qAUH0WPKVg Wow what a total disappointment here! I had a 1/2 hour wait at oreganos so I said I try Nypd next door! I tried their meat lovers pizza in 18 inch for 21.99 on menu.  It had mainly crust and could have been a 14 inch pie with the small amount of meat on it! A total ripoff no meat on meat lovers pie!  2 inches on each side had no meat. And for the same money I can get a 6 pound monster loaded at oreganos with enough meat to make 2 nypd meat lovers 18 inch pies at the same price point!
The reason oreganos is always a wait is the food is great quality and huge in size every time! Fantastic customer service all things nypd neighbor is not.
Nypd needs a lot of help here! I would not waste my hard earned money
