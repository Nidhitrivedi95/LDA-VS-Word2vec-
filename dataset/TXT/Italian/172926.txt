N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg I finally got to try this place and I'm glad I did. We waited for about an hour, but they let you order before you get your table so it's ready faster. We had a large group and ordered the Lou, the malnati Chicago classic, and a pepperoni. We also ordered the spinach salad and a house salad with the creamy lemon garlic dressing. The spinach salad was pretty good but tenge house salad with that dressing was so good! It was creamy and flavorful and a nice change from ranch. I would order the house with the lemon dressing again for sure. The pizza came out fairly quickly and I was really impressed. The Lou was my favorite with all of the vegetables, but the malnati was also really good. The sausage was flavorful and fresh and the sauce was nice and chunky and not too acidic. Everything tasted really fresh. The crust was awesome too. The pepperoni pizza was good, but not as great as the other two. The pizza was thick and hearty like deep dish, but it wasn't greasy or heavy like some deep dish pizzas can be. The prices were also reasonable. It was about $24 for a large pizza which would easily feed four people.
