nI-ZmgPjAtiNTTU-_gnoYQ Absolutely one of the best dinners ever.  Food was prepared perfect. Appetizers were Calimary with marinara sauce and a Caprese Salad, stunning.  I ordered the Shrimp Linguini Marinara with crisp golden French Fries and the wife had USDA NY Steak with Vegetables.  Steak was a beautiful medium rare; vegetables were crisp clean and sautéed perfectly. On to dessert... Tiramisu, Ricotta Cheese Cake, Lemon Sorbet and Gelato... wonderful and an absolute symphony of flavor. You know all the ingrediants, foods and sauces were prepared fresh and with passion.

 I would like to compliment the Chef, kitchen staff, servers and Management for outstanding food and service. I will be back with family for sure.
