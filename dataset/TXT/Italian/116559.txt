GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA Love Batali's food.  Been eating the stuff since we were kiddies.

Well, not really.  But we've eaten at most of his restaurants in NY and were excited to discover his new establishment in Vegas.  Anticipation was cranked up another notch when we learned that B&B was modeled after Babbo, Mario Batali's NY temple of pasta worship.

If wifey and I could impart a single nugget of wisdom to others in this world, it would simply be this:  

"When dining at a Batali restaurant, don't fuck around with anything other than pasta."

Sure, you're gonna want to try that roast beast, or the foo-foo salad.
Screw it.
Order the goddamn pasta, 
strap yourself in, 
and prepare for your life to change.

The pasta tasting menu really should be the only damn thing on their menu.  People should be shot for trying to order anything else.

5 courses of pasta perfection, in a whirlwind of flavors and textures.  From the pungent gorgonzola nudi, to the creamy and decadent goose liver ravioli, it's an experience like no other.

4-stars because the pasta tasting menu at B&B is $30 more than than the same menu in NYC for no good reason at all.

Didn't think I'd catch that, eh Batali!!??!
If your food weren't so damn good, I'd have to bitch-slap that Italian face of yours for price gouging me like that, pisano!
