pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Have heard about Pizzeria Bianco for years. The hype started getting ridiculous so I tried to go one night and they had a 3 hour wait, even though they closed in about 30minutes. Heard they took reservations for parties of 6 or more, so we got a group together and called. Took 2 months to get a reservation- so annoying!!

Their staff isn't overly helpful, and it took forever for our server to finally get to our table. Once he did, he was knowledgeable and friendly and service was fast after that. 

We all ordered salads, mine was a house salad that was really good. Portion was just right, not too big or small. However, it was so good that once I was done I wanted more. I shared a margherita pizza with added mushrooms that was pretty good, but my friend let me try her Wise Guy pizza and that was amazing. 

Not sure I have the patience to wait as long as some people did, and maybe if I had I would not have enjoyed it so much. But saving time with a reservation was worth it, and I'll go back if I have some time to kill or want to pay a little more for pizza.
