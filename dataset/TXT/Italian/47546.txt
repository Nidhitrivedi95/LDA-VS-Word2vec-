8yiLVWzJyyTEhYE0fVNvlA In short, YUM. Went here while in Vegas recently with Lauren B. It came at the high recommendation of someone else and their kudos were well deserved! 

Arrive hungry as this place brings you lots of food even before you order. The service was amazing with a full team paying attention to our table including the captain (which became confusing at tip time as there was a separate line for tip and captain tip, which we weren't quite sure how to handle)!

Upon seating, a large 20+ pound carcass of Parmesan cheese was brought to the table and we were each given a heaping scrape from it. Then, we received a small plate of meat, bread options (go for the buttery looking one - you won't regret it at least in the moment!) and crispy zucchini. We ordered the special Burratta as well, which they split into two plates for us. The Burratta was amazing as were the other items we had to start. I opted for the special Pappardelle alla Bolognese as I rarely turn down a homemade Pappardelle or Bolognese sauce. It was amazing. Seriously great taste and a heaping portion. We enjoyed some wine with our meal as well - a nice Italian Chianti. We were both so full we couldn't even consider dessert, but they will bring you some grappa to the table as a post-dinner treat. 

Make a reservation - definitely a popular place and worth planning ahead to go there. Just be sure you are ready to mangia!
