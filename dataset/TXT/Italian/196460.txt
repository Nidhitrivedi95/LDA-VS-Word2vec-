pOEL97ld-FJMKO8Ki8JmYg I went there for my first time with a big group of friends as a Christmas gathering dinner. I ordered the fried oyster mushrooms to share with two other friends and the liver as main course. Both were awesome. The liver was more than I expected. There were two pieces of it with my favourite asparagus as decor and bacon and mashed potatoes. There were also lots of veggies on the side with a very small tasty plum (atleast that's what I think it was). The liver melted so quickly once I put it in my mouth. It was a loaded entree and I was so full from it. The price of it was great too, very reasonable. My friend tried the salmon which she gave me a piece to try. It was very delicious and you can tell it's fresh seafood. Most of the guys in my group ordered the steak and they've said good things about it too. 

As for the service, it was awesome as well. Some of my friends were terribly late but the servers kept ensuring that we have enough water and as more of my friends came before we ordered they served us delicious dinner rolls. After ordering our food, a few guys left the table to buy something at a store before it closed nearby. Meanwhile their dishes were ready but they weren't back yet. The servers urged us to call them back quickly because reheating or leaving their food warmed in the kitchen will ruin the true tastes.
