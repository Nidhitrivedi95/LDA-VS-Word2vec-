vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw We never ate at this restaurant but I always pass by it so we decided to try it and was great food and service. Our waiters name was Josh fabulous waiter. It gets pretty busy and but it's worth the wait. It's hard to find good restaurants and good service all in the same sentence. I guess it depends on the restaurant.  

I had the baked ziti so if you can't eat much I suggest sharing with a friend or I guess it depends how hungry you are. Oh yeah the deserts are also fabulous we ordered the cookie ice cream half chocolate chip and the half peanut butter with vanilla ice cream omg that's so good. Share with friends for sure !!! Excellent food for sure. We went to the one in Glendale.
