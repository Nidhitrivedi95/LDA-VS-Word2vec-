DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw Exceptional service. 5 stars all the way, waiters knew the menu and were very friendly. I highly recommend the rabbit, and lobster ravioli. The fact we had an option to order small portions (Tapas) and were able to try more then one meal (four each to be exact) was phenomenal. When visiting Vegas please stop by and try it out. Being italian and raised around good food, here and in Italy, I am very particular with my Italian food and for myself to recommend an Italian restaurant is extremely rare. A+
