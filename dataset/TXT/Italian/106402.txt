Leaving the shadows of my last job, I embark on a voyage searching for delicious flavors.  Empty stomach, with Kunoichi on my left I joined the stream of the culinary conscious at the doors of CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe!

Immediate greetings, short wait, professional server introduced himself as Joshua.  We had drinks, bread (free!), apps and dinner but passed on dessert with lingering looks back as if to validate the mutual decision

I had studied the menu before but that had been weeks prior.  Ended up ordering the most popular items on the menu.  

Korean Beef : Seoul-ful

Culinary Thought: Flattened, juicy, smoky and perfect temperature. 

Ninja Eating Plan: Over noodles, with chili paste. It was consumed quicker than a Japanese shrike dives for meals in July..

Pad Thai : Rad

Culinary Thought: It was almost to beautiful to start eating.  

Ninja Eating Plan: She said it was the best Pad Thai she had ever consumed.  She also noticed a difference in CBN Cafe's Pad Thai noodle compared to all others she has tried.  Kunoichi tend to notice every "little bit."


Calpico Beer: Summer Drink of 2013?

Culinary Thought: Refreshing and different.

Ninja Eating Plan: Helped to calm down the tongue on several occasions of too much chili paste (hands were shaky after a successful morning mission)



Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: When breaking your solemn vegetarian vow it is good to exercise within a week of consuming any meat product.  This Ninja has enjoyed the experience and plans on returning before the first clouds of Winter stretch out over the valley horizon.
