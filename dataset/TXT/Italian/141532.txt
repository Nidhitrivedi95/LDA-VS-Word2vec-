jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg Recently move real close to this place and was excited to try it. Really like it on first impression. It is a neat looking place with a good feel to it. 

We were seated and waited an extremely long time to even see our server. Although we were ready to order our server took only our drink order and ran away to put in our drink order. Our drink order was simply a bottle of wine. We didn't see her again to place our order for another 5 minutes. 

So we order the lasagna with garlic bread and soup. The soup arrives just barely warm with the complementary bread which wasn't even warm. 

Finished the soup and started waiting for the meal. Oh did I mention the wine still had not arrived. I guess the bar was backed up oh wait it was a bottle of wine. 

I try not to completely judge a place based on one server. So the food arrived and it was bland. 

Food wasn't great and bad service but that could be a one time thing but on the way out in the foyer there were two employees across from each other having a discussion. We passed between them and out the doors. They simply continued their discussion without so much as acknowledging the departing customers. 

So it wasn't and individual server having a bad night. This is obviously poor management.
