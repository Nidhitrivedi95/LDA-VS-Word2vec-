pOEL97ld-FJMKO8Ki8JmYg Ended up here for brunch when we realized Origins North was closed.  The brunch options sounded so good it was hard to choose.  There were 4 of us and we each tried something different.  We ordered the $5 mimosas and they were good.  Servers were very attentive.  While we were waiting for our food a server accidentally dropped all the mimosas he was carrying for a nearby table.  One person at our table was splashed with the mimosas.  It wasn't s big deal but they apologized profusely, brought napkins, and offered to move us.  We opted to stay as it really wasn't a big deal.  Our mimosas were comped which was a nice thing to do but we were not expecting that.  Our meals came quite quick my and were delicious!  We all enjoyed what we ordered.  I ordered the breakfast burrito and if I had one complaint it would have been to have it a bit more spicy or provide hot sauce / salsa to taste.   We planned to order coffee as well and maybe dessert however our server had one more surprise for us.  He brought over a sampler plate with 4 really amazing desserts and comped the dessert and coffee as well.  Completely didn't expect that but it was a really nice thing to do and honestly the desserts were phenomenal!  Would go back for coffee and dessert alone!
