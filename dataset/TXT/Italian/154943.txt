The waiter did point out a couple of specials that included "buy one - take one". Great value for the money (basically between me and my wife and the promotion we got four meals for the price of two).  

I would say 4 stars only for the fact that I reserve 5 stars for specialty placed that are not chain related.  As for service - 5 stars as always.  

Can't wait to take home the lemon cream cake and have it with my coffee in the morning (just another recommendation from the waiter)!

Our server was Cooper - he was beyond great!  Great evening, great food and great value!
