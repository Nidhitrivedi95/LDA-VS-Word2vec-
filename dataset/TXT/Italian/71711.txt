CAALCmefoLQtDvLEER4_6Q We loved this place! Was our 1st visit and already talking about going back. We had a reservation for six for 7:00 got there early at 6:30. We were led to our table and then greeted by the owner,Bobby. We saw him most of the night walking around making sure things were going smoothly. It was a busy night. We ordered two meatball apps and the antipasto plate the guys raved about the meatballs and the fire roasted peppers. Then we had our salads a Caprese, Caesar and 3 palms all tasted very fresh. I would recommend the 3 palms. Then we had 3 pizzas a fungi, puttanesca and a meat very tasty. Nice wine selection. Service was excellent I think we had three different people brining our food and checking on us. We also loved the rustic decor.
