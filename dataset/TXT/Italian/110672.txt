G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q My friends and I came here for Brunch.  The restaurant is just beautiful.  However, it stops there.  

1. Food: We ordered a variety of dishes.  The biggest disappointment was the pasta! A kid could make it better, to be honest.  It was beyond bland, lacked any flavor and not even served hot.  Olive Garden serves better pasta and you can buy a grocery store pasta sauce that is much, much more flavorful.  This came as a shock as this is the Giada's restaurant! 

2. Service: Incredibly slow.  We waited over ONE HOUR for our entrees to be served! No waiter came to give us any updates. Once they did arrive, a few dishes were not even warm.  We ordered 2 cocktails which took so long to serve that we finished eating our meal in that time. After no word from them about our drinks, we inquired about them only for the to remember. We proceeded to tell them to just cancel it because we were already ready to pay our bill and leave.  After he acknowledged that, a few min later, someone came running with our drinks...probably so they could still charge us for them.  But we again told them no, we already cancelled them because we are done eating now.

Overall, very disappointing experience.  If you want good Italian food, do not come here.  However, if you want average/below average but to be in a place with beautiful ambiance and views, then come and enjoy your time here.
