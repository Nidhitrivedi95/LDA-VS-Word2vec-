XPgurhZwZgNAwHcrpoe3Zg I've been coming to Niccoli's for years, beginning when I worked in the same parking lot and found this gem. The owners are great people and a lot of love goes into their food. I love their sandwiches on fresh bread, great cheese and meats. I crave the meatball sub weekly. Try the coconut macaroons, they're worth every bit!
