W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg We went here because it was the only place without a wait, but then we kind of figured out why. Overall, no one in our party was impressed. I feel a little bad leaving a bad review because the owner/manager seemed really nice. They forgot to give us bread to start, not that we really cared all that much, but when they did it was cold. One person in the party enjoyed the wedding soup but that was about it. I got the Chicken Parmesan and it just wasn't that great. Also, the pasta that came with it didn't have all that much sauce. They gave us a free fruit and whipped cream desert at the end (we assume for the bread incident, even though we didn't complain or anything). The desert might have been the best part, I really enjoyed the whipped cream. This was only my second trip to little Italy in recent years and I definitely try somewhere else next time 

P.S. In case they read these reviews, you really should consider updating some of your decor. Everything seemed old and worn out. Also, I didn't really understand the, what appears to be, African tribal masks behind the bar.
