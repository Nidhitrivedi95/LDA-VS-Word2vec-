L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw I did not had super high expectations for this restaurant as I knew it was licensed to a big corporation. 

The decor is nice and clean but not quite imaginative. Some wood, white tiles, metal and exposed light bulbs. Rather safe and common. 

Service was very good. Our waitress was smiling, happy to answer our questions and listen to our feedback. 

As for the food, we shared the Italian Nachos to start. 3/5. The raviolis were over fried and we could barely taste the cheese inside as it was too dry and had too little. 

We then shared the Patate Pizza. Mascarpone sauce, pancetta bacon, rosemary and sliced potatoes (3/5). The idea is great but it is lacking in execution. They did not chopped the rosemary leaves and wherever it was on the pizza it was overtaking the taste. It was not mixing well with the other ingredients. As for the pancetta, 4 slices is no enough! Especially when the pizza is $19. The dough was good but borderline overcooked. 

Last we shared the Gennaro's Tagliatelle Bolognese. The sauce was good and tasty if a tad too liquid for my taste. I was surprised to find that some of the pasta were sticking together. (3/5). 

Overall it is a decent option that should please most basic desire of all the family. However, if you wish to have something a bit more interesting I would recommend Scaddabush.
