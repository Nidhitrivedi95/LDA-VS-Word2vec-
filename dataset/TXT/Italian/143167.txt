JsRt9LPgv-7guVcY4u6OQA I have to start with the staff. Seriously the sweetest staff at any restaurant & very attentive. I hit the shrimp fettuccine alfredo & my husband got the special of the night Zuppa di Pesce that they added lobster tail. Some of the best alfredo I have ever ate. My husband kept bragging about everything & love the white wine sauce that he chose. Pretty safe to say that we'll be going back to this place in the future!!!!
