PXN0l42g6IWp18NGJ7yn5w Came here for lunch today and sat on the front patio. It's been a while since I've been here.

$11 for rosemary chicken pesto panini with caesar salad
$3.99 for a martini

The food was decent. The service was decent. The location was decent.
My only complain is the noise today. The area next door was doing construction during the daytime (they really shouldnt) and the airshow going on, plus the fire trucks. 

Not somewhere i'd suggest for great food. But decent for a patio outing if you're just lounging around on a Sunday afternoon.
