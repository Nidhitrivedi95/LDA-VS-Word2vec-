eQo4kIwIWJbAnfXYl3k5BA I'm really floored by all of the amazing reviews of this place. I've been twice and both times were disappointing. One time I got the pizza there, it was very heavy, greasy and doughy in the middle. It was disgusting but I was starving so I choked my way through a couple of slices and later got very ill!

The next time I went was not by choice, I was meeting a large group there for lunch. The waiter obviously knew he would get automatic gratuity due to the size of our party and gave us dinner menus instead of lunch menus to beef up the bill total. He was also very sneaky about additional charges ("would you like fries, chips or salad with that?" -- failing to mention the fries and salad were additional charges). I requested a lunch menu and ordered the chicken parm sandwich, it was ok -- but nothing special.

I will say they have very large portions but otherwise it's not very noteworthy.
