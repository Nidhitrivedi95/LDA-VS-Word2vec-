qZZ8VU1Bk-xCruEAZNwm6A Honestly I love their pizza.  Its best hot from the oven (what isnt?) so dine in sometime!  The ratio of sauce to the crust is perfect.  Not too thick either, which basically tastes like tomato paste to me, but a nice medium "body".  The pizza is pretty spot on for your neighborhood pizza style.  It is not gourmet wood fired, but sometimes that is exactly what you want.

Wings are consistently good too.  I hate jumbo wings.  They always seem under cooked, and taste much different.  You lose out on the perfect blend of sauce to crispy skin to meat.  So their wings are perfect to me.  My only gripe is that the sauce separates, so you get some extremely buttery bites without much hot sauce flavor. 

Great full menu of pastas as well.  Was not wowed by the eggplant parm, but ravioli and meatballs are all great at this Mom n Pop shop.
