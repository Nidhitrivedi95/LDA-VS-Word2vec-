q4mx-ff4_LvU3NnMvNIrZA Five of us went to Sammie's, and everyone came away impressed. Three of us had the Sammie's Burger, and they were awesome! The other two had sausage sandwiches and they said they were excellent as well. Several of us had the onion rings, and they were big, hot and absolutely tasty. We also enjoyed a couple of appetizers, the pretzel sticks with cheese and fried cheese sticks...very nice indeed. It didn't hurt that we were there during Happy Hour too, got 2 bucks off on the draft beers. The downside....no room for dessert! I'll be back!
