4KZRFxciaKfTD7qbS55b7g Fabio on Fire was our late night treat for our wedding, and everyone LOVED his pizza. Not only was the pizza amazing, but Fabio and his staff were so sweet. Fabio actually gave me and my mom hand written cards to congratulate us, which I thought was such a nice gesture. I feel bad because our guests ate all 40 pizzas we had ordered in less than an hour, and I was kind of rude to Fabio when they said "no more" (because I hadn't gotten any yet). We finally decided to just pay for more pizzas...and they were more than happy to make them. Giving me more pizza is the easiest way to make me happy ;-) 

Anyway, just wanted to say thanks so much for making my wedding night so special, Fabio!!! Everyone loved you and your pizza! :-)
