wCRc6E9XcyPnN1WwJhaGtA I guess I'm spoiled with the likes of Mia Bella and Il Bacio in Little Italy, but Joey's is average to sub-par Italian food.  I gave them another shot tonight to improve upon that opinion, and they did nothing to do so.  Starting with the salad, the house dressing doesn't taste homemade (mine is better!).  The red sauce, the measure of any Italian restaurant, is pretty bland.  I'd actually give the manicotti a B+.  I've never had a good desert at Joey's and tonight was no exception.  The apple cobbler was doughy and flavorless.  We paid way too much for a below average meal.  I have to admit, my lunch at Olive Garden last week was better....sorry Joey's.
