y8zlR75tcmvkg49dqdLGDg My husband & I tried Sauce Pizza & Wine for the first time on a recent Friday night after recently moving to the area, and what a great place it turned out to be!! The nice young woman who took our order at the counter was incredibly patient & helpful as she explained the menu options, and we couldn't have been happier with our Margherita pizza (drizzled with balsamic - yum!) and the quinoa salad my husband talked me into was seriously the best salad I've ever eaten. The traditional pizza crust was just right - not too thick & not too thin, and you can tell they use nothing but quality ingredients. Trust me, we're going to be regulars at this place!
