xly3K2HgsjvZs5Mu9kSFxg I went to J Bella's for dinner and perhaps the best part about the experience was the service. The food was very good also! Our waiter was very attentive by constantly filling our glasses when necessary, bringing the courses in an orderly fashion and checking in on our table. Before dinner came, they brought warm bread and garlic butter. I ordered the strawberry chicken salad and It was delicious. The portions were huge and there was a really good amount of salad toppings such as strawberries, pecans, and goat cheese. They had a very large wine selection that I would really like to come back and try.
