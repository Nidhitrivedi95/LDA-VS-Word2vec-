dwozIcXMNA5iRya8tbTwoQ The other reviewers are on crack. I live about two blocks away from this place and believe me when I say that it is the closest thing to NY "greasy" pizza that you will ever get. Yes, I grew up in NY so I speak from experience. This pizza is fantastic. If you don't like NY style pizza then you are some weird ass California hippie!
