wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw I am giving them a 4 Star as no one is perfect. I read some of the previous reviews both positive and negative. I decided to give them a 3 visit review and see what's going on.

First off, the weekend evenings are packed and be prepared for a wait, but for me it was worth it.

I started with an assortment of the BRUSCHETTA'S.

Brie & Apples with Fig Spread
Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone
Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese
Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese

The selections were excellent but I settled on these 4 and I was not disappointed. The Fig spread was a wonderful surprise that offers a versatility beyond its pairing with Brie and Apples, which was spectacular.

The Tomato Jam and Sheeps Milk Cheese? Wonderful pretty much sums it up.

Visit 2 was lunch. I ordered the Autostrada Panini sandwich, the Italian meats were all top shelf quality, but it was the house pepper relish that brought it all together. They should bottle and sell that relish.

Visit 3 was Brunch. I brought a friend and went a little overboard on ordering. We started with the Butcher Block which is a wonderful assortment of Italian meats, cheeses, olives,breads, hummus's,and nuts. There were only two of us, but it could easily be the perfect warm up appetizer for 4.

Next up was the Farm Scramble, the Ciabatta French Toast and berries with a side of their Applewood Smoked Bacon.

I could go on and on describing how good it all was, but I would run out of room. Fabulous!!!!

Regarding the service, everybody was nice, seemed to back each other up for water glasses, bussing empty dishes, etc. No complaints here.
