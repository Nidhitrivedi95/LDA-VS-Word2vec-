HhPVzZYQI-akaXRK_A4dKQ I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon. The new decor is really nice and fresh but it ends there. The food was not very good. No presentation and no taste. The only thing I liked was the wedding soup. I visited with 5 other people and they all said the food was not very good. Good things were the decor, no wait, fast service but that's it. I think they need an overhaul on the menu and some more spices to help the bland food.
