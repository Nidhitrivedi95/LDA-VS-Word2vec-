xoisXoqK68W2euSKbj5ybw Pizza is excellent.  Philly cheese steak is excellent.  Garlic knots are addictive.  Staff is incredibly friendly and makes you feel like you're dropping in for a family dinner.  We've taken visitors to Charlotte here for a quick slice, and inevitably they ask to go back on return trips to Charlotte.  Love this place!
