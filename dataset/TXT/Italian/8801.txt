0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ Service takes FOREVER. The girl took like 10 minutes creating our pizzas and we were the only ones in line when we were ordering. When I was sitting, I didn't see the line move for a good 20 minutes because of how slow she works. 

A dollar a topping is ridiculous.

Pizza was so burned at the bottom that I actually had ashes on my plate, teeth and under my nails. The top was so soggy that when I held it, everything fell right off it. 

Stick with Pieology.... Fast service, cheaper prices, better quality, always cooked to perfection, and not a slimy burnt mess like Novecento. 

Never again.
