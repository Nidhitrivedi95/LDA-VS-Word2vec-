fuBpjG-lsD94_BdpjHxbuQ Cozy little spot on queen west with amazing thin crust pizzas, prefectly done pasta, and delicious wine. The tomatoe sauce used on the pizza really stood out it was so yummy we ate every bit of it! Came here on a Saturday night before heading out to a party on King west, its a nice alternative to enjoy some great food and wine instead of the crowded and overly priced king west. They take reservation too so even more off a reason to come back.
