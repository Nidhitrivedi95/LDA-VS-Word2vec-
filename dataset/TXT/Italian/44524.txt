8Cny1-SYxd8vtgmBFFSJYA Just the food is probably 3.5* but with Ennio making all the difference, I give an overall 4*.

Enormous portions ~ do not over order!

So many times you go to a restaurant but complain that the portions are too small; well you're going to complain again but for portions being too big!

If you are not a big eater, I suggest you skip the entree and just go for he main dish. I was already full after my entree of vol au vent. 

Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday so got to taste the dishes ordered by everyone. Some dishes were secondly better than others. 

The entree of eggplant parmigiana was excellent! My vol au vent was just ok...you can skip it.

The rabbit was good, the chicken was juicy and the veal was also very tasty. My fettuccine a la Ennio wasn't to my liking. It was way too creamy and full of butter. I took 2 bites and had it to go. When reheated the next day, you can see all the butter at the bottom of the plate. Not a dish to order if you are in diet.

Overall decent restaurant.
