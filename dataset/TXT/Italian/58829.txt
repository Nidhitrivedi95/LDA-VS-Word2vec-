aqrTv6QiU0J9Sxm_T--c5g Our dinner tonight was spectacular !!! Our waiter was so friendly and polite and made us feel very welcome .
The chef was very accommodating with gluten allergies. I highly recommend the gluten free eggplant parmigiana !! It was the best I have ever had !!
My husband enjoyed his veal dinner as well. The calamari he had as an appetizer was excellent!!
