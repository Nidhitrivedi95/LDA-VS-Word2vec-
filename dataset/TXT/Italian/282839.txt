Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ I wanted to try Little Tony's based on Yelp reviews and one in the local paper.  I wasn't so sure I was going to be a fan because, unlike other Yelpers, we weren't as blown away by Tony's flagship restaurant, Pizza Rock, on Fremont.  But we were pleasantly surprised.

Loved the fact that they were open late, and also that there was a Happy Hour in progress, so we saved a few bucks on our drinks and food. 

I had the St. Anthony 9" pizza, a white pie with mozzarella and sweet sausage, red peppers, ricotta, and basil.  It had quite a kick to it, and I loved it.  The wonderful surprise was that it was CRISP, which was my complaint with the soggy Cal Italia pizza I'd had downtown.  Our terrific and friendly server, Alexis, explained why Little Tony's does a crispier job with the 9" pizzas.  It was filling, too, so I managed to eat only half. It made a great breakfast the next morning!

Hubby, remembering how much he enjoyed the meatballs at Pizza Rock, ordered a four-bagger - for $4 HH price! - and a side of veggies to put them on top of.  And since he'll be fending for himself while I hit the road, he ordered another portion to stick in the freezer.  Alas, it was the end of the culinary road, and only three remained in the kitchen, so they were gifted to us.

I tried to take pictures of my beautiful pizza, the big bowl of veggies, and the warm and inviting atmosphere, but as it happens way too often, Yelp was "a bit funky right now," and I couldn't post or even save them to my phone.  

But there'll be a next time, and I hope to be able to capture them then.
