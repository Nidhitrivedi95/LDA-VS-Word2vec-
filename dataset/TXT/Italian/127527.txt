HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA Food was okay, portions were lacking.  If I am going to be charged $12 for a sausage and very little meat, there better be meat.  $1 sausage and 4oz meat does not add up.  I paid extra for cheese and peppers..one pepper, one.. really, bro your picture shows tons of peppers and cheese everywhere.  I can eat an 8 oz Outback special for $20 or a small sub with fries and drink for $15.  FYI instead of having the girl cleaning and mopping half the restraunt to close that side at 6pm, have her outside spinning a sign to get business.
