-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q After living near Naples, Italy and knowing the taste of traditional Italian food, I was pleasantly surprised to finally find a restaurant that knows how to cook.  Our party of 4 started with the Family Insalata...then onto the Italian Stallion pizza....pizza perfection Chicken Marsala...Rigatoni Bollenese and Rigatoni Al Forno.....after sharing all this traditional, home cooked food from Heaven, we were all too full for dessert.  Though, the thought of a cannoli or cheesecake was tempting...next time for sure.  4 thumbs up here...
