esnvHQxunLTAckQpntqbCg Hands down the best meal we had on vacation. My Oso buco was fantastic and the gnocchi were the fluffiest I've ever had.  The staff was so so so nice it was like having dinner at a friends home. They gave me an aperitif and after my daughter raved about the gnocchi, the chef came out and wrote down the recipe for her and explained step by step how to make it. It's that kind of nice touch that made it one of my most memorable meals ever. We'll take pictures and post them when we get home and make gnocchi.
