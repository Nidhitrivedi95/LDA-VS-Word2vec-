VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w A big group of friends went recently because this was her favorite restaurant of all time.

The food was good but it wasn't anything to write home about. The pasta was really al dente which I liked but I wasn't blown away by the sauce or the meatball. Again, it was all pretty good but it wasn't really worth the high price.

The oreo dessert we got at the end was probably my favorite of all the items we got.

3.5 stars overall but decided to go with a 3 because of the unwarranted high price.
