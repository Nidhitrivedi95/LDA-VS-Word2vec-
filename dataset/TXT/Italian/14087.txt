1Bc4KYox4Fux-aLV4OfFnA I went in and ordered a black olive and sauteed banana pepper pizza. The pizza was huge for a medium and had a ton of toppings on it. The banana peppers were spicier than I expected but pizza tasted great. However, the crust wasn't as tasty as I was hoping it would be.

The employees at the restaurant were all friendly and helpful, since it was my first time there. The place was busy, but even so the service was quick and professional.
