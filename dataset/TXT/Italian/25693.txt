4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg I reluctantly returned to Allegro a few days after a bad experience (See my review on 12-30-14). I returned because it was about 3am and there was nothing else open in the Wynn where we were staying. There were four of us.  We ordered a couple of pizzas and drinks. The service on this visit was excellent. The pizzas were average. I am not complaining about the prices because they are on par with what you would expect at the Wynn  but they are pretty high. I would go back for late night pizza if staying in the Wynn but wouldn't make a special trip.
