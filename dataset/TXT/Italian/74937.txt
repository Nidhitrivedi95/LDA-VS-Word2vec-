Cr5CLpmVrmzFyz_RfQ6rmA Scaddabush opened in Richmond Hill a few weeks ago, so naturally me and the fiancé decided to give it a shot. 

Let me first start by saying, I hate parking in this lot. It's always overcrowded and there are way too many restaurants for the lot, but anyway...

The restaurant itself is very nice, low lit, rustic feel. There are several tvs around that show different sports channels and cooking shows (something for everyone). 

We ordered the bomba buratta as an appetizer. It's a cream stuffed fresh mozzarella with a garnish of chilli and roasted tomatoes and sausage (though the menu says double smoked bacon, I swear it was sausage). It was incredible. Scaddabush is known for their mozzarella, they make it fresh in house daily. It was so good. Definitely worth getting. So creamy, and light and delicious. 

We then ordered a large pesto pollo pasta (fettuccine with pesto, roasted tomatoes, chicken and spinach) and a butcher pizza (bacon, sausage, pepperoni, garlic). It was a lot of food, but so delicious. The bill was just under 60$, and we left stuffed and satisfied. 

Definitely worth coming to, their mozzarella, pasta and meatballs are all made fresh daily in house - I would highly recommend trying them. Glad they have a location up town!
