_AVXgkX4DiNQAQj_3tNhFQ Had lunch here a few weeks ago.  Reservations were made at 11:45 a.m. to avoid the lunch time crowd, which was perfect.  Service was good, even though it was busy.

I had the margherita pizza, which was a very good size - I would say larger than a usual personal pizza.  The crust was thin and crunchy.  Good ratio of cheese to tomato sauce and a good sprinking of fresh basil.  It was nice and light.  

Price to be expected for downtown Toronto, but nothing outrageous for lunch.  I would go back and order something different, as I saw lots of plates being delivered to other tables with wonderful looking pastas.

It s a bustling place at lunch, filled with the business crowd.  Overall a good experience and I would recommend this spot.
