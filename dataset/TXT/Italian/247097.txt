V6MWAv-xv4dgSUrDU1qxaA Had lunch here once at Nothing But Noodles before, pretty satisfied. Huge portions, decent Marinara, and leftovers for lunch the next day.

That was visit #1. Come visit #2.

I ordered:

    Fettuccine Alfredo w/ Roasted Vegetables. (Note the pic above is the basil pesto dish, but the grease/cheese ratio was pretty similar)

Problem: There was an exORBITANT amount of Parmasean, combined with the watery-collating nature of their supposedly "freshly made cream sauce". After a few swirls, the unevenly cut roasted veg started forming big, hardened chunks. I tried my best to separate and salvage the veg and pasta I could, but it really became a big, salty, creamy mess. Like untangling hair from a dirty pipe. Absolutely disgusting. I might as well have handed over my ten bucks.

Two hours later, I felt my stomach churn. I felt used and abused. Never again.
