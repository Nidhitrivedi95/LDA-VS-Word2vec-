5mb-6Guz9xqNXMigh8noMQ Eh. I am visiting my brother here in NC. We came to this place. It was super hectic and we had no idea how to start our order. We figured it out when we saw everyone standing in line and then rushing to claim a seats. We waited. Got our pizza. Lol this is a Brooklyn pizza?! Haha yeah right. This pizza was raw. The low quality sauce and cheese they use left the crust of the pizza oily and slimy. We asked the waitress to look at the pizza - she said that's how it comes out. Lol. Horrible. We asked for the pizza to be put back in the oven. Eh 5 mins later - same - now more burned pizza with a still raw crust came out. Instead of being a problem we ate this crappy "Brooklyn" pizza. Thanks for nothing.
