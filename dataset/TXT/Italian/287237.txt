ZKklfxHUlL8_xReUyZfSUQ We were tight on time since we wanted to catch a movie afterwards back in the heart of Toronto so when we placed our orders with the server, I specified that we had to be out of there by 8:45 p.m. (we walked in at 7:20 p.m. and placed our orders by 7:30 p.m.). The server acknowledged my request (it was also noted on the last page of the menu to inform the staff of any time restraints so it was a good idea that I did).

Unfortunately, by 8 p.m., our food still hadn't arrived yet. (It just so happened that we had all ordered from the pasta section of the menu -- so I couldn't understand why pasta dishes were taking so long to be ready.) We had been waiting for half an hour by that point. At 8:03 p.m., the server came around to tell us that our food would be arriving in about 3 or 4 minutes. That was fine. Unfortunately again, the truth was that it took a lot longer, almost seven times the number of what he told us, because it wasn't until 8:20 p.m. that our food finally arrived. I kept track of this because we were tight on time and had specifically told the server that we had to be out by 8:45 p.m. In the end, we ended up waiting for an entire hour for our food to arrive from start to finish.... The time that we had to wait for our food to arrive was even longer than the time we actually sat there eating...

Anyway, I had ordered a Homemade Goat Cheese & Portobello Filled Agnolotti with a black truffle cream sauce.  When it arrived, I was shocked to see that it was such a small portion on my plate.  There were only four agnolotti on my plate...  Compared to the portion sizes that our friends received for their pasta dishes, this agnolotti dish was extremely small.  I do recognize that it contained black truffle and goat cheese though -- pricier ingredients, but I still felt that the portion should have been more substantial.
