bXbCGFk3ZjLcTdQQB-xPyQ This was our second time visiting Luciano's.  Both times there were about eight of us dining for a birthday celebration.  We went for brunch on Sunday. The warm bread with the sun-dried tomato and olive oil spread was delicious.  We must have gone through four or five loaves.  Most of us enjoyed the food. Lunch portions are enough to fill you up.  I had the omelet special with roasted potatoes and fresh fruit.  The omelet was stuffed with onions, peppers, mushrooms, ham and cheese.  It was delicious.  The birthday girl received a free strawberry cheesecake which was delish. Service was excellent.  They tacked on a 20% gratuity which we thought was a bit much.  But, one of us crossed that out and added her own tip amount.  I keep forgetting to do that.  But, will remember next time.  Atmosphere is lovely with tablecloths (even for lunch) and chandeliers.  Very nice.
