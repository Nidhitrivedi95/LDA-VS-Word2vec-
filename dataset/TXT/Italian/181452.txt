O5_CKNQOmtRHY_CjOB6XYA Service was absolutely amazing but the food was mediocre at best. It's not super expensive but it's also not cheap. I ordered the seafood pasta and ate half of it because it was over cooked. They asked what I thought. I told them. They tried to offer me dessert which was great but at the end of the day, I was here for the main course and it simply wasn't good. I don't know how this place got 4 stars.
