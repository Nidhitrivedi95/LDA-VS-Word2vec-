UzjCvrNuK4crxi0IS9Jp5A My family and I have an amazing time each visit the food is great and reasonably priced the drinks are great never watered down the resturaunt is clean and the owner is on site and makes a point to speak to all the customers and to ensure they are enjoying their visit we are also there for the events they hold for local Arizona music artists to preform on Saturday evenings
