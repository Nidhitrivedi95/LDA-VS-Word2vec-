azE1DNVQFBU8boVbaJhj7w The atmosphere and service from this restaurant were a welcome change from much of what we received the rest of our stay in Pittsburgh. The staff seemed genuinely friendly and attentive. 

The food was good- not outstanding but definitely one of the best meals I had in the city. I ordered salmon, which was cooked perfectly. My friends had the pasta tasting, which for it's price seemed very reasonable. Pasta dishes never impress me the way other dishes do, but teh three offered this night were on the lighter side and a nice variety.

Oh why lie, they each had three servings and I was eating off their plates. That food was gooood!
