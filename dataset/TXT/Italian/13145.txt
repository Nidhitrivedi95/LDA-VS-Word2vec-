14O6gNqpd3bcnIAHPFT58g Went with family last night...loved it! Our server, Julie, was excellent- extremely friendly and attentive to our table. The stuffed mushroom and shrimp scampi appetizers were delicious...excellent for dipping the really good garlic bread in the sauces. :) My daughter said that the fettuccine alfredo (not on the menu, but offered) was the best she's ever tasted. The butternut squash ravioli was very rich (almost too rich) but quite tasty. The guys both got the crab and shrimp stuffed ravioli with walnut cream sauce (not on the regular menu)- both loved it!  It's a really great place for a special date or a quaint dinner with friends.
