IXUwuNjy707wJNW2U4sRVg We came for a going away party and had a large area reserved for us. The staff was so accommodating and took good care of us the whole evening. I loved the ambiance and it felt like I was in Italy surrounded by a plethora of shelved wines. 

We started off with a delicious cheese and meat platter paired with red and white wine. Then we ordered a caprese salad with fresh tomatoes, basil, mozzarella. For the entree, I got the fettuccine bolognese which was awesome and my husband got the gamberi (shrimp)with gluten-free corn penne. Wow for gluten-free, that pasta was seriously really delicious and cooked perfectly al-dente. We finished the dinner with a tasty homemade cannoli! The ingredients were all really fresh and clean which is probably why I didn't fall into a sedated food coma after the meal. 

If you're trying to find an authentic Italian restaurant especially in the East Mesa area, look no further! Alessia's is legit!
