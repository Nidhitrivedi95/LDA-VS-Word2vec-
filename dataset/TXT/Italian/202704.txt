q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Coming to Vegas I was told I must try this place, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is fun and it was a must experience. 

After coming here I won't be coming back. The evening started out on a positive. Liked the idea and the decorations and atmosphere, but the food was sub par for the price. It said steakhouse so I ventured for the $40 steak. My friend had to change her order due to them being out of food and she was also not impressed with the selection. 

We did make reservations and asked about the special to make sure it was still going on when we called. We were assured it was. However, after we ate the waitress brings the bill and after inspection find out the special was not honored.  She then told us that the special was for locals only and we were clearly not locals. 

They did finally honor the discount, but not without complaint.  The waitress told me that "next time I just need to be aware". Maybe I should've read more reviews or maybe they should mention that when calling to make reservations.  Either way there will be no next time for this patron.
