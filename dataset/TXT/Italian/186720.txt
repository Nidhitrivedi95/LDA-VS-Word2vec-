Orgm9nmcClxnAUva4nOKyA I went here for lunch with my co-workers.  I ordered the lasagna.  It was pretty good, but I found it too salty.  The bread that they give you in the beginning is very good.  For dessert, we got a slice of tiramisu to share because we were celebrating a birthday.  It was quite good.  Nothing too special.

The service was friendly and fairly quick.  Can't complain much there.

Overall, for the price it was decent, but I found the food salty.

Would I go back?  It wouldn't really be my choice, but I wouldn't be against it either.
