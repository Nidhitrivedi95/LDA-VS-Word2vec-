FhVYpbvE8IQeUHAcwPPIXg It's always been a great time going to Gabriella's. All their food is delicious from the appetizers to the entree's. Their food is homemade everyday from fresh ingredients. We go with friends as it is so nice to have a family restaurant that doesn't feel like Vegas. It's a great place to sit, eat and drink with friends. They even have live entertainers on some nights, a piano player and a Frank Sinatra impersonator make for a nice atmosphere. The patio is great bonus when the weather is nice....

We've always had such great food there that we had a Xmas party in their private room. They helped lay out some nice family style dishes and everyone went home stuffed!! It is a nice intimate room just off the main dining room so you can still hear the music in the background and doesn't feel like your off in a dungeon. It is easy for the servers to get in from the back so the service was great. Thanks Elias!!  

They have a great happy hour with something like 24 beers on tap and food specials. . It's not a video poker bar so everyone sits around and chats, something that is such a nice change from most Vegas bars. Like I said, it's great to finally have a nice friendly neighborhood restaurant with such good food and service.


Keep up the great work Gabriella's !!
