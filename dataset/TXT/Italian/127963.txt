hXeasEtce5edeiRaGx5kmw It started wrong. We reserved a table of 8 for 20h45. I arrived 5 minutes earlier, but the table wasn't ready, when I asked them at what time will I get my table they said that I will have to wait for at least 15 minimum, because they had a waiting list. That's the perfect example of bad management. However, I noted a good point, the young hostess was nice, and she offered us bruschettas while waiting.
Another thing I didn't like, was when I went to the bathroom I noticed that the hand soap was mixed with water.
On the other hand, the waiter was polite and messy, we had to repeat several times our orders, which he even messed up, same for the bills.
Food was less than average, tomato mussels were salty, portobello portions were too small.
Finally the peanut butter chocolate cake was good.
