2YnUIGGmhoJX4Cd61nQLkg I've been to the on-campus Za's countless times over my years in Champaign and have always enjoyed it. Food portions appear to be fair for the price, there are decent vegetarian options, they fill out orders quickly, and the selection is a good balance of flexibility and ease. The stand-alone Za's was of similar quality.
