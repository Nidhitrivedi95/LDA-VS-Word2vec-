IvovJ3sfYrjHKH_hS5XrNA They had my niece's birthday party here and sometimes I take my niece and nephew here when I'm in town visiting. They have a ton of tables, perfect for parties. They have a ton of tvs. They have a cool area with a ton of games. It's not huge like a Chuck E. Cheese but it's entertainment enough for children. They have a small prize counter to cash in your tickets. The food is mediocre but better than Chuck E. Cheese!
