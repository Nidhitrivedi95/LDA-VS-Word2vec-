GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA My group of 3 shared 2 pasta dishes (boar ragu with gnocchi and the bolognese), brussel sprouts and the charcuterie type appetizer and everything was amazing. They cure their own meats and the quality shows. These are not giant portions but the food is rich and flavorful. We all left very satisfied.
