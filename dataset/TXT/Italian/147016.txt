k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw Excellent food. Best Italian in Vegas. Highly recommend for breakfast and dinner. The price is so good you would think the food would be cheap but you would be mistaken. AM service was outstanding but the night crew could use some work. May have been an off night. Still worth the 5 stars.
