CR2DMfg3uP02PKT_fuygIw I was really hoping we'd found another great pizza place nearby.  Unfortunately this is not the place.  
We ordered the Romano pizza, it's described "With fresh garlic, grated romano cheese and oregano"  Sounds great right?  Well what we received is a cold pizza with a "cheese" crust.  The cheese was the parmesan that comes in a shaker off the shelf.  It was inedible.  We ordered meatball topping.  The meatball had zero taste.  I'm not sure what the meatballs were.  The sauce has zero flavor.  It was very dry, we tried putting olive oil on it, didn't help.  Usually I can stomach any pizza, but we wasted our money on that one, we both ate half a slice, threw the rest away.  
We also ordered the pizza fries.  Again, the sauce must be the cheapest they can get, it has no flavor, ketchup would be better.  Again inedible.  
We tried the zeppolis, and thank god I ordered 12 because that was our dinner.  Luckily they couldn't mess up fried dough with sugar.
As you can see from my other reviews I tell it like it is.  Trust me when I say, order from anywhere else.  Papa Johns, Dominos, even bake a DiGiornos.
