aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw I'm not going to be nice. The only reason for the 3 stars is service, gnocchi, me dad loved his meal... maybe I should give 4 stars but I just can't. This place is very pretentious. I would never venture in here without my dad, or somebody equally knowledgeable/ slash wealthy. I don't want to go back, but I would not turn down if someone else was paying. We had a wonderful table looking over the rest of the diners and then of course the beautiful windows, but that is despite the point. Drinks.. once again my signature roy rogers, my dad stella. I do not remember if the served bread, nevertheless lets get on to the meal. Gnocchi. oh man their gnocchi is the only reason I would spend money here again. Wow.. everyone must try their fabulous gnocchi. I do not remember what my dad got, but he was pleased. Next I had the lobster. How can you go wrong with lobster... you can. First it was like $60 per ounce or whatever is is they weigh lobster with. I say this is fine and order. You have to order at least 4 of those $60 per... that is $200 my plate alone. ya. if I would of known this ahead of time I would of chose much much differently. I received the ridiculous amount of lobster. had a bite and ugh. NO no no no. I ate it cause I felt bad. I ate $200 lobster because I felt bad. What! that is so wrong. My dad can afford it but I'm a college student. I spend $200 on groceries like a month. Ya needless to say I should of had something else. I'm just so glad I didnt get sick. Our meal was ridiculously overpriced, but my company was good and he loved his meal. For that alone 3 stars.
