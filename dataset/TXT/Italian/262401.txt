wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg I came here for the first time today with a friend and I was pleasantly surprised. Located near the Biltmore I was expecting something more stuffy, but I arrived I was greeted by a lovely open aired building with a very nature friendly design. I chose to dine outside on the patio and was greeted very quickly by our waitress who was very friendly and helpful. 

I ordered the Strozzapreti and my friend ordered the seasonal vegetable salad with an appetizer of steamed mussels. When the mussels came out I was very satisfied with the amount they gave us, however when the main courses arrived I was a bit surprised. The food was beautiful and well presented however I felt like I was eating a side pasta for $17. Despite the size of the food it was very flavorful and very fresh. y friend was a little put off the size as well, but enjoyed her food as well. 

I feel that it was a nice experience and that the atmosphere was nice. However I thought it was a bit over priced for the amount you got. Despite this it is still worth a try and I suggest you come on a week day during lunch when it is not so busy.
