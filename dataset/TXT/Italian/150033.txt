KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ Sooo glad i ate here and not at the buffet next door. Got the antipasto platter($35) and since there was only 2 of us they kindly cut the portions in half($19), also had the shrimp and lobster diavolo and the ravioli purses. The diavolo was okay, but the purses were SO good. They are  definitely the dessert version of a ravioli.
