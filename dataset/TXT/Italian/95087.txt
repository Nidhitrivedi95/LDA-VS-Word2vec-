eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg After passing The Grotto many times and always noting how good the food looked, I finally got to try it. Had a margherita pizza as an appetizer, it was okay. Nothing more. Will skip that next time. But being from NYC it's also hard for me to be impressed by any other pizza! My boyfriend ordered penne diavolo, had a great flavor. I had shrimp primavera it was great. Dessert was the best! Chocolate mousse cheesecake, it was the first time I ever considered ordering a second dessert! Will definitely return. Service was great, Cody was on the ball. Noise level was pretty high.
