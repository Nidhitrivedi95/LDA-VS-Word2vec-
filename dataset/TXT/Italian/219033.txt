I don't remember the name of all the dishes, but here is the gist of what I ordered: clam pasta (my main dish), boar pasta, lemon honey ricotta appetizer, zucchini appetizer, brussel sprouts side, mushroom pizza, and grilled fish. 

The clam pasta had a nice hint of spiciness from the chili flakes; however, it was on the oily side.
