CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA 4.5 stars.  They make a really good thin crust  NY style pizza.  We also like the wings ALOT!    We do delivery 9 times out of 10 and they are fast and the pizza and wings hold up well.  I don't care for the BBQ wings but my kids love them.  We all like the honey hot wings. 

They hands down have the best lunch special in town. We were here the other day and got 3 slices plus a drink and 2 waters for $10 plus change.  I had a slice of the special pizza with sausage, pepperoni and jalapeños. I'm usually not a fan of sausage but this stuff was really tasty.  The slices are huge too.  I left full but if your a huge eater you might want 2 slices.  They are local too so I like to support local businesses.
