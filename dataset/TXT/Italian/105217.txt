FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q The expectations were low, but review is about to be even lower. 
Usually I'm very gentle with places, and will give them the benefit of the doubt, but this I won't be able to.

My entire experience was just a "bleh". 
Service was below average. 
Place is super basic in a bad way.
Food was just not good. 

It almost felt like the place doesn't fit in a city like Vegas that has SO many different options and possibilities.
This place mostly exist in little small towns close-to-nowhere when that spot is the only option the locals have.

Bottom unfortunately line it was not a good experience. 
Trust me. I know food.
