mUUTJY9_BqmAYxypHiqWrw Another one of those Italian Cafes & Bakery that COVERS all their windows up.  Don't they ever think it makes them more suspicious?  Don't they think they will deter walk-in customers?  Good thing I'm a regular to most sketchy spots, I'm from Scarborough and this place is here.

Inside was Breads to the left, Individual & Whole Cakes on the right, Pastries & Cooks to the right, and roughly 5 varieties of Basic Gelato flavours to the right.  No decor to speak of and plenty of ITALIAN women busy doing their thing and having good fun conversations on their own.

Sicilia($3.25) Cake is available in individual format or Whole format.  This Pistachio Bavarois, Orange Pastry Cream with Almond Meringue and Almond Genoise has the consistency of a PISTACHIO Creme Brulee and was not too sweet.  Cappuccino($2.50) went well with the dessert.
