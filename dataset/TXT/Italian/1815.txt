-j0CbYvlwuJ3Tfx__X38gA After having lived down the street from here for quite awhile, but I finally was able to check it out to celebrate our wedding anniversary. 
We were met by a welcoming host who took our coats and showed us to our seats.
Our waiter arrived to our table and was warm and personable. He brought us our delicious cocktails and explained the dinner menu really well, and answered questions without any judgement or arrogance.
I ordered the alfredo dish and my husband got the veal marsala--both amazing.
All dinners come with bread, soup/salad, and a small pasta dish (meat entrees only).

For the quality and amount of food, it was actually a rather fair price. You could for real go to Olive Garden and spend about the same. I'll definitely be back!!

Protip:  ORDER A MEATBALL!
