gZBhQmqZy9aIq3HID8Vjkw this place was below expectation. we ate across at wolfgang puck's the day before, the food was delicious. my friends had amazing pastas and we decided to try mario batali's restaurant the next day. the pasta was disappointing. it was under cooked, I think the waiter said I have to ask for al dente, I wonder if I heard him right. anyways, it was just not as good as the freshly made pasta at wolfgang puck's. we ordered two pasta and they were both under-cooked. my other friends ordered dessert and coffee, nothing spectacular about it, which is disappointed when the restaurant is named after an iron chef.
