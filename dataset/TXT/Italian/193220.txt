pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Had dinner with friends here last night and everything far exceeded my expectations. We had the steak bruschetta and spinach farro salad for app's and both were so delicious. We all loved our main courses, two of us had very picky specifications and they got both of our changed dishes perfect. Such an enjoyable meal. Then we shared their homemade cheesecake for dessert and it was to-die-for. Our server was good too, don't remember his name. Next time I am in town I will definitely be back!
