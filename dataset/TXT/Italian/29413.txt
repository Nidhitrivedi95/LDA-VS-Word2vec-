5CqM8dr3d3LI_B-1_-5U7A We've been to a few other spots owned by the same group across the area, so we planned to visit Cibreo shortly after they opened in the old Bricco space. Our group of four was not disappointed. 

The decor has been updated from the prior space...I was particularly taken by the above-bar decor - curved wood reminiscent of stacked wine barrels, topped by wine barrels spelling out "CIBREO". 

We arrived early to meet our group, so we sat at the bar for a drink. The bar staff was friendly, professional, and attentive, and while we didn't order anything super complicated, they did serve my "filthy" martini just perfectly. Occasionally they taste like rocket fuel from not being shaken well enough, but this one was great.

We moved to our table - we came in after the pre-show rush, so it was quiet (we more or less had the place to ourselves).

I really cannot think of anything we DID NOT like. Panzanella salad, antipasto tray, bolognese, pork shank/osso bucco - everything was spot on. Service was excellent as well. Worth the try if you're headed out downtown. I give a 5-star, because I felt everything was well-planned and very well-executed.
