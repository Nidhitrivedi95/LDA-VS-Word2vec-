xrA53WYhRCml2bMfpQ_Hig Excellent service! Fun and LA Cali vibe. Amazing food! A little restaurant with garage like windows that open up in the summer. The decor is so cute, very clean, and staff are all great. We ordered fish, pizza, drinks, veggies, and dessert. We cannot pinpoint what was the best because all were equally delicious. Highly recommend trying something for each category.
