duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ I do not like buffets. To me, I get the feeling of cheap, mass produced, and bland food.

That being said, I loved the Veranda brunch buffet. :)

I went with family not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised. There is a wide assortment of pastries at your disposal: danishes, coffee cakes, muffins, and all sorts of sweet treats. The fresh made donuts are top notch, and I definitely have to exercise restraint to avoid becoming Homer Simpson.

The breakfast items are great too. Scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, crispy hash browns, banana pancakes, and cinnamon French toast are all good. The meat selection and quality is excellent. Multiple types of sausages and bacon are great, and their bacon cheddar waffle with fried chicken is amazingly good.

I like to finish the meal with their bread pudding, which is delicious. Plus they have fresh juices that are really tasty. Today they had a watermelon lime juice that was perfect. Overall, this is the only brunch I have had in my life that I thoroughly enjoyed everything I tried.
