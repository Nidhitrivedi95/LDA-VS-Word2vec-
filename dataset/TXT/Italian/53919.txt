A7waf6G3cvnLfAqKeLL8DA Took my father out for lunch today and risked a new place--had heard good things about Buca. 

We mixed some starter salad plates for lunch and it was just right. The heirloom tomato salad was a great choice. Beautiful, ripe, sweet tomatoes and the dressing was very delicate. The lamb skewers were cooked just right. Nice flavor. Bread knots and stuffed olives to round it out. Stuffed olives were just, mmmm, perhaps the breading was a little dense or overly crisp? 

Chianti by the glass was very good. Beautiful and smooth. Nothing sharp in the taste.

Space is great. Dark and comfortable. Admittedly, I felt a bit underdressed in jeans and a T (hey, it was Friday) but our server didn't flinch. 

The crowd looked a little funereal with all the black, but altogether it was very lovely.

Would feel very confident bringing a client there.
