LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Do not purchase e-cards from their website.  I purchased one as a gift for someone and it was relatively easy to do.   However, I found out the next day my friend had not received it.  After much haggling and shuffling me from corporate to local to the gift card company itself, I was told their system was down.  They offered me my money back or the gift card when up and running.  I did get the e-card finally that next day.  Bad business to take someone's money and not provide the commodity.   Believe me I wrote a letter to corporate and this is what I got: Your card has been viewed by Brad.  Wow!
