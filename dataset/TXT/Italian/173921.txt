nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g Incredible ambiance that was a combination of old-world and chic... The food was phenomenal, with service the rivaled such. A colleague and I ordered the calamari fritti (wow!) and split two pizzas (a white with rapini and spicy sausage, as well as a tomato with prosciutto and arugula).

A great selection of wine and an overwhelming complement of scents from their homemade goods left me regretting I had no room to stay any longer. Will absolutely return again.
