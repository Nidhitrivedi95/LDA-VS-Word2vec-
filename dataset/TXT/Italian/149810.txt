KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ Italian Food was just ok. Wine was expensive, I recognize several offers that I buy myself and at the restaurant they where prices at least four to five  times more than what I buy them for at my local wine store. We had cocktails with tequila in them and they were $16 apiece they were pretty good. The food was good but not anything special. Same things and taste you can get at a Italian franchise. After our first drink, the waiter told
Is he had not put in outlet
Order yet he was waiting so we could relax awhile and enjoy our first drink, that is ok however I feel he should have asked US if we wanted him to wait to put our order on and not decided that on his own although we probably
Would have chosen to have him do that, we have have been asked. Next time we may be in a hurry. Prices are a little high for what you get. Restaurant is kept kinda on the dark
Side for ambiance .. I liked it although some may not, you may need a flashlight to see the menu.
