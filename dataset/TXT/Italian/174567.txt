NDjxiIYJWEfnM3DfggZo5g Well went in yesterday to see your new sized slices I heard from friends in area. Man was I disappointed. I have been a customer for 20 years and always raved to friends about your big slices. Now this new small size for same big price is not worth it. Looks like I will be going elsewhere. If you ever go back to big slice let me know as many friends and I are now not going to visit you anymore. 

The fact is now you need a minimum of 2 slices to get full. So 11+ dollars... I could go get a full pizza for that at even Pizza Hut as they have daily deals. 

Even the panzerotti I received about a month back was smaller than usual. I even paid double cheese and got very little cheese.

My old friends of pomodoro I wish I could say better after 20 years, but I guess this is where we part ways.
