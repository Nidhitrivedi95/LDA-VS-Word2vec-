The food was excellent. I am a 3rd coast seafood snob but had been assured by my relatives (who grew up in Louisiana and know) that the seafood was of great quality. And they were right, the shrimp and scallop cappellini was delicious. I also enjoyed my boston bibb salad, the gorgonzola kept it from being too sweet. Judging from the clean plates from the rest of my group, I'd say that everyone enjoyed their meals.

Various wines and beers were enjoyed by our group. I ordered the cucumber martini with vodka and it was OK. Definitely need some other non-sweet cocktails on their menu. 

Then, of course, we had to have desserts. We had both the special candy cane brulee and rasberry brulee. They bring out a big tray with all the desserts of the day when you ask, so be prepared to be tempted. They all looked delish.
