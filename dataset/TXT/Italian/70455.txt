BzXtEUHu86ju9ttE-X3saw What a great way to mix Greek and Italian food! Every time I've ordered from here not only do I receive amazing service from the owner and staff, the food is equally as awesome. The menu is huge and you will find something you like. 

I'm not a regular gyro person so I always get the chicken one. So good! Very flavorful and the homemade sauce is awesome. The Villa
also turned me on to grape leaves. These are a must if you stop by! Not many places actually stuff them with meat (unless you visit a very authentic Greek restaurant) so grab them here while you can. I'm now obsessed! For dessert, try their homemade rice pudding. It's done just right... not too sweet or filling so you don't feel like you've gained a million pounds after eating. 

Prices are all very reasonable. This is a Beaver County gem!
