VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Food: I actually went to eat here once with my girlfriends for a comped dinner 5+ girls. Not sure if they do this anymore but It consisted of a 5 course meal with drinks in between to add to the dishes. Didn't taste just Italian but Mediterranean to me. It was delicious and after dinner and the drinks from dinner I was already buzzed. 

Club: Small and very crowded unless you have a table, because its so small the range of people who come here are mostly music lovers who come to enjoy the headliners that are booked on days like Tuesdays. The design of this place kind of sucks once you walk in you have to walk up stairs. Girl's like me in 4 inch heels ya... it sucks.

Music: definitely my taste in music, Trance. Even though this place is small they throw one hell of a party. The lights, go go dancers, confetti, and the foam glow lights they give out definitely add to the craziness of this place. 

Bar: There's 1 and 1/2 of a bar in this place, yes very small. The main bar is always packed but there's a male bartender there that's super nice and I tip him well because he makes my drinks strong just the way I like it.
