egLgkvwupLaUXhwnWnvp7A I am from Long Island,NY. We went here several times. The Sicilian was raw in the middle, a regular pizza was lukewarm when we would purposely counter order for take out. The final straw was when we ordered a sausage pie, sausage parm hero, and a spinach & cheese calzone. The sausage was crumbled! No pizzeria in NY or NJ would serve crumbled sausage parm hero or put it on pizza. It is sliced sausage for the pizza and actual sausage for the sandwich. When we asked why the hero was sausage crumbles and not regular we were told customers here don't like regular sausage!!! That's why it's all crumbled! SMH. The spinach calzone had broccoli in it also. Go to Rosario's closest you will get in Concord to decent NY pizza. If in Mooresville Tony's is the best
