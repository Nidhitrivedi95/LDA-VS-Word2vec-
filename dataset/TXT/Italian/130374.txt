Iam7tYWhssw_rscSBkeRIQ Best Pizza in the 'Burgh thus far.  Do not let the place scare you, as some of the best food I have had has come out of old, out of date looking places in questionable neighborhoods.  Fiori's has awesome crust, sauce and amazing thick pepperoni.  Even though they are cash only, they are worth thew trip to the ATM and it is apparent that a lot of other people agree with me as on a week night, all of the tables were taken and there was a long and consistently moving line of people coming in for their take out orders.  I will definitely be back to Fiori's and I appreciate the recommendation from the friend who first turned me on to this yummy hidden little gem.
