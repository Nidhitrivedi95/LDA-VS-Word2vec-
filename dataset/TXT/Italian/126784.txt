hTsZSiftorNUFb1VaHCHHg After the Strong Beer Festival I stopped in here with some friends.  We were seated quickly at a table for six people and had prompt, friendly service.

We all shared the poutine, short rib bruschetta and chicken artichoke bruschetta.  All of our food tasted delicious and the happy hour prices were great.
