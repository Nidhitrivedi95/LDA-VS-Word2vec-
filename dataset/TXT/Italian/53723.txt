a6SqJZTFMpSOR6Qb0STyFA My chicken parmesan was forgettable -- not horrible but not even close to the best I've ever had. Olive Garden's is definitely better, and way better priced. My husband got linguini alfredo with meatballs, and that was very good, but on par with other less expensive chain restaurants.

I got cannoli for dessert and it was really small for the price, plus the middle of the shell was hollow. I would never buy it again.

The pricing was high for the ambiance and for what you got; thankfully, we had a Groupon for 50% off. If we didn't have that, I would have felt ripped off. 

As for ambiance, the tables were very close together and it almost reminded me of cafeteria style seating. It would not have been good for an intimate date.

The service was very good, and the host was funny and friendly. Overall the only way I would go back is with another Groupon--otherwise it's not worth it.
