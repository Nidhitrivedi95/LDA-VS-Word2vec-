k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ Good food, slow service. Menu was excellent with lots of variety. Décor was nice. We went Friday night and only had about a 15 minute wait to be seated. Started with  the meat and cheese plate. It was nothing special and I wouldn't order it again. Ordered 3 pizzas to split. All of them were good. Fresh toppings, good dough, good cheese. 

Once seated drinks took ~10 minutes to get, then another 10 minutes to order then about 30-40 minutes to get the food, then we were done and sat there for another 20 or so until wait came. Ordered desert and it was ok at best. It was the chocolate pudding one. It had good flavor the texture was off. 

Overall I would go back, but the amount of time it took was a bit crazy. Everyone in our party commented how they could make a lot more money if they learned how to turn tables quicker.
