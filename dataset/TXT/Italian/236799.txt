txAKid34IUd9spo6MLF_Sw We started with the bruschetta with feta. It was an average size portion and was very tasty. I ordered the chicken parm with extra spice and it was excellent. The server even brought a dish of oil peppers and spices to the table so I could add more if wanted. My date had the linguini and meatballs. She said it was well done and tasted good. The restaurant was very empty for a Friday night at 630 as we were the only ones there. The server was very good and very polite. I would recommend checking this place out on Main Street Unionville. There is free parking behind the restaurant and easy access to the door and patio at the back of the restaurant.
