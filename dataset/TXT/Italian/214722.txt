rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg It's kind of an expensive event to go to, considering the entrance fee and the food prices. It was for my husband and I, about $50 total, and this was five years ago, held at an empty lot near Rampart and that shopping center off Charleston. Parking was a problem. The atmosphere was nice- there were performers. 

The food was excellent (sausage and peppers sandwich) but I just think that the vendors charged a lot. It was restaurant prices. We didn't go back. 

On a side note, this festival was started many years ago. My husband was a child when he was featured in an article about the event. My mother-in-law had this framed article hanging on the wall.
