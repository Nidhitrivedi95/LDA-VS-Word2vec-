_BnBjRMt5Ba-TAv07r3fyw I made a reservation for New Years Eve specifically because the restaurant said you could order of the regular menu as well as the special new years menu. Having a food allergy this works for me because there are certain things I can't eat. When we sat I asked for the regular menu and they said "Sorry its only the special menu this evening".

It was really all down hill from there. My girlfriend and I dined alone, and picked a later time to go to dinner. We were sat in between two large groups, both having small children. We were lost in between and sometimes would go twenty minutes before even seeing our server. It got to the point where I had to flag them down and ask for the check. I know places are busy on NYE but still not ok.

On a positive note the food was good, but I was disappointing with the bait and switch menu, and the lack of service.
