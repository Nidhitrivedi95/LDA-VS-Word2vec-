LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA I have been to Maggiano's two times. They have some tables that are right next to a window that has a really great view of the strip which I liked. Most people want to sit there so there is a wait time that can be pretty long. I ordered the chicken parm. And it was really good. They also give you a lot of food which a lot of restaurants don't do anymore. Its a very nice restaurant and will deff. be going back.
