v3AS5LGeV2Si4nOHZ7lgxQ This review is for delivery service.

Called around dinner time, but did not have to wait to place my order.  The man on the phone was SUPER friendly and it made me happy.  We had gotten one of those "Nickel Dollars" coupons in the mail worth $10 so that is why we chose this place, along with Yelp reviews.  We ordered 2 pizzas....... Fetalicious and Sacre Bleu with walnuts.  Happy Guy quoted us 45-60 minutes.  It was only about 40 minutes!  After the coupon and a GENEROUS TIP TO THE DELIVERY DRIVER (DON'T FORGET TO TIP YOUR DELIVERY DRIVERS) we still spent less than 20 bucks.  Oh the pizzas were size small.
Anyways the pizzas were delicious!!!!!  I'm getting hungry just thinking about them.  This place is a Yes, at least for delivery service.  

PS.  Glass Nickel send me more coupons!!!
