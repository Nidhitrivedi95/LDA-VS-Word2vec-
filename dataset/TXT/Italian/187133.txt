oryS4vX0xkKC4tOekgowDQ Great place, friendly people, very cool old house turned into a restaurant. The server was not all there, he must have been new. I asked him three times for lemon for water, took him twice to bring a Corona, and he not once checked up on us after our main courses were served to see how the food was. That leads to this, because I was waiting ever so patiently for him to come back and ask - my pasta was very dry, not much sauce on it. I wanted to see if I could have another side of sauce but it seriously took him so long to come back I ended up just eating it. It was a good dish, I'm trying to check the menu right now but it's not showing up. It was veruceli (sp?) pasta, the spiciest on the menu, which I would give it a 6/10 for spicyness. Good place though with decent prices!
