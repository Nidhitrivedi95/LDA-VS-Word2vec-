OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ After winning a $20 gift card here via a raffle at Jaime W's Sweet Tomatoes UYE, I used the card for dinner for my son and I.  I called in an order for two regular meatball parmigiana sandwiches and an order of garlic knots and was told the order would be ready in 20 minutes, and it was.  Just driving the four miles from the shop back to my house, I could smell the sandwiches and knew that we were in for a treat.  Once I got home, my son and I were both kind of amazed at the size of our sandwiches--if these are regular size, the large size must be ginormous!  Made with Italian bread, the sandwich's meatballs were huge and covered with sauce and cheese; we dug in and, let me tell you, it was a nice, delicious mess.  There's no dainty way to eat one of these sandwiches, but why should you?  The $3.99 order of garlic knots yielded 6 knots with a side of marinara and between those and the sandwich, I could only eat half of the sandwich. Even the teen couldn't finish his; that's saying something about the size of the sub.  Not bad because now we both can experience the other halves for lunch tomorrow.
  
2 regular meatball subs + 1 order of garlic knots = $20.72, including tax.  I'm a fan, for sure.

By the way, I walked around a little before I left the deli and they have some tempting desserts on display--I'll definitely return to try the famed white pizza and some sugar.
