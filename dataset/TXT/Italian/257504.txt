w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A OK, so you NY'ers will know what I mean when I say that Metro's cheese pizza is the kind that you'd be happy to walk into any New York pizza place and order a slice of.  And anywhere in Brooklyn, it would be cheap and satisfying.  It's satisfying for sure but, the quality doesn't match the price.  I feel like I'm getting jipped - getting my "pretty good" NY style pizza but for a far too expensive price.  I liked the restaurant, the service was OK, and the rest of the food was good.  But just too expensive, so I'm taking off a couple of stars.  If you're looking for something different and a pretty satisfying pie that reheats well, give this a shot for sure.
