hSU3MbB9Yu8MlybxfmABeg I'm not the sort to go out of my way to write a negative review. A restaurant can have a bad day, and sometimes things just happen. I get that.

That said, I came in here on a 90+ degree day for lunch. The place was a sauna, maybe hotter inside than outside. I don't know how a restaurant like this - a small space where the kitchen heat easily transfers to the dining room - doesn't install an A/C. The ceiling fans did nothing to offset the heat, and so I was left sweating buckets. The best part? Every now and again my table would get a nice whiff of skunk odor. Nothing like ungodly heat and skunk to put you in the mood for some Italian.

The food itself? Meh. The bread was tasty, the meatballs okay, but the pasta and sauce? I'd have been better off making my own at home. It would have tasted better, I wouldn't have to suffer an inferno to eat it, and it wouldn't have cost $70 for three before tip.

I should note none of my issues are with the service itself. Our waiter was great, the hostess attentive. But everything else made me wish I had waited until 5pm for Etna to open. On a street with so many Italian restaurants, I can't think why you would ever go here.
