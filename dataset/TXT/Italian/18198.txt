2LOTz08OPRyA0ibJImJRbQ O.M.G. this place is the real deal! So chic and lovely. And the food, oh the food! I had the oxtail pasta. Wow, just wow. So supple and tender. My date had the veal and according to him it was delicious. We ended with the flan and tiramisu. DELISH!!! This place is not cheap but it is definitely worth it. Just. Go.
