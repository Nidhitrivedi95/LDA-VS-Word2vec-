oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw Reconfirmed why we love Lupo:
Food - it's really, really (and I mean really) good...try the seas bass, it's delicious.
Kids - my kids love this place, and any time you can find a place kids love to eat that doesn't have a drive-thru, everyone wins. Note: there is not a kids menu and there are linens, but my kids are huge fans of the mushroom pizza...and the best part is that despite sharing one they still can't finish it, which means more for me!
Linens aside, you can get out of here w/o breaking the bank as the pizzas are fairly priced and delicious (my wife had shrimp pizza, yum).  You can also splurge if warranted (I'm telling you again, try the seas bass!) and the zeppole for dessert are a great finish...but good luck trying to share with kids - they'll devour em in a second.
 
Side note: the white bean puree with bread sticks - we could eat that all day by itself.
