D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg Almost a 5 star, the food was very good had the shrimp franchaise i might go back just to have that and we got compliments from the chef he sent us 2 other appetizers which were good too The main dish i had was the filet with this balsamic finish it was sooo good also got the death by potatoes and they were very tasty too the reason why they only get 4 stars is because we had a 6:00 RSVP but we didn't get sat till 6:30 and there was no one there, we were the first people there, then after we ate and paid the bill with a nice tip they asked us to hurry along because there was a party awaiting but when we walked thru the bar there was no one waiting. over all the food was out of this world the service not the best I would still recommend it and would definitely go back
