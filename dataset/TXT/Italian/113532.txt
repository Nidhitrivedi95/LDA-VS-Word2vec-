ghpFh6XpH1TYZhjAGdx-xw First timer. Came in at 11:30. Line was to the door. First impression was clean. Atmosphere equals happy people. Ordered a pizza. I must say wow. For a thin crust pizza, this was outstanding.  I've been looking for a great pizza place. This one is up there. If there were one of these close to my house, I would eat here weekly. This is a must visit type of restaurant. Highly recommded. Nice job folks. Keep it up and build one in queen creek please.
