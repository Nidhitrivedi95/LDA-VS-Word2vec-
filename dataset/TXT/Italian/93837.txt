(Yet Another Strip Mall Gem)

3.65 stars.  Not quite a solid 4 but pretty darn close.

I like the deliberate decor.  Much more interesting than I expected in a strip mall.  Warm textures and soft lighting as well as exposed brick.

The service was predominantly very good.  There was a moment when one of my coworkers received his salad and was surprised that it had cheese.  He hadn't read the menu and it didn't occur to him that a house salad would come with blue cheese.  The waiter was a little put off that he didn't want the cheese on the salad but then returned it and brought out another salad minus cheese.

I had the penne ala vodka which came with asparagus, asiago, basil, prosciutto and a nice vodka sauce, portion size was good.

Based on my visit I would return to try other selections.
