txF4WKY3P2hF3i6VCRD8YA Ok, I couldn't stay away. Despite the terrible pasta (still terrible) and horrible delivery, I started ordering again. And what do you know! Delivery improved tremendously!

I moved, so I was now in their delivery radius as reported to GrubHub and could order directly from that website. (I still don't know what was going on that I could order on their restaurant website since I was within their service radius, but not grubhub before. Hrm.) I don't know if the website was the issue or they hired different delivery people or use GrubHub for delivery (I think through postmates or the like?) but however it works, it's much better now.

I have now had the pizza and I'm very pleased with it. SO GOOD. I usually order either a cheese pizza w bacon and red peppers or I'll get their Hawaiian pizza. THEY HAVE MANGO ON IT. This is big for me. Pineapple, mango, bacon, and ham (which I subbed out for salami.) The mango adds a lot to the flavor, but I wish the chunks were bigger. That's my only complaint about the pizza. The crust isn't as thin as I would usually prefer, but its still yummy.

The cigar rolls are still perfect (when they have them) and the pasta is still overloaded with way, way too much of whatever sauce it's made with so I'm definitely going to stop ordering that from here. Most recently I ordered the creamy calabrese and couldn't eat more than two bites. It was overloaded with alfredo sauce and topped with a thick layer of cheese. It seems Angelina's approach to pasta is just to overload it with fat, which they've proven can actually be overdone. I threw out the pasta.

But for pizza, burgers, apps? If this much improved delivery continues, I will continue to make this my pizza go-to.
