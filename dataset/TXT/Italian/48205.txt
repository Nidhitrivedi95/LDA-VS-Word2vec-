93FVxoipAIYG07gisMOQhw We were looking for good Italian food and decided to try this place based on the reviews. The place was surprisingly packed for a rainy evening so we decided to wait the 20 minutes for a table. We ordered drinks while we waited and were a little disappointed that an $8 glass of wine was not filled at least half way. We were walked to a table that the hostess warned us was wet and we had to ask for it to be dried. Once we were seated and ordered, our very small salads came quickly but we had no silverware or napkins. Eventually we were able to let our server know and she fixed the problem.

The live music was fun but, a bit loud. This is definitely a family friendly environment as children were running between the tables going outside to play and marching back in between the tables while we were attempting to eat. This seemed to be the norm with the staff and the patrons. I have never seen such a thing.

The food was alright, it really was in dire need of some serious seasoning. My spaghetti tasted like pasta with tomato sauce and the chicken parmesan tasted like it came from the freezer. His small portion of chicken marsala was thin over some broccoli. The cannoli  had a strange flavor and the nuts on it made our mouths dry, not good. 

Overall it was an alright experience, no where near all the great reviews it received. I don't know that we will be back.  Not a date night type of place.
