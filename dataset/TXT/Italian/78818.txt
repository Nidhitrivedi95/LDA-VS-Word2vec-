d-PQrWHCEbv_lH-UMD874Q After reading the amazing reviews, I was so excited to try the pizza at Bottega!  Wow what a let down. The crust is soggy and undercooked (all 6 pizzas ordered) and the woman next to us sent hers back twice before giving up and leaving without eating.  
The arancini was disappointing & dry and didn't come with any marinara.  The bacia was bland. 
Great bright decor for a lunch spot but the pizza is just so bad, who cares?!  And this is not just my personal opinion, the tables on both sides of me were also complaining of soggy pizzas!
