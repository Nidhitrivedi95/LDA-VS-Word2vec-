The atmosphere: fun, relaxed, pleasant. 
The food: Oh. My. Gosh. This stuff is good!!! 

Some of my favorites are: the anti-pasta salad. Junior size. It is a monster, you can share and still be full. Always fresh, full of roasted red peppers, meats, cheeses and flavor! 

A sausage pizza. Nothing fancy, but fabulous. My husband is not a fan of thin crust pizza. But this is one he will order over and over. 

Alfredo After Dark, with chicken. WOW! I will call this Macaroni and Cheese on steroids!!! This has so many flavors. A slight jalapeno flavor. A tad spicy, mostly flavor. The sauce, a great Alfredo. Creamy, smooth and full of flavors. The chicken is sliced thin and is moist. The pasta is cooked to a perfect texture. Order this with the intention of sharing, or having leftovers. Delicious! 

The toasted Italian Sausage sub. YUM! The bread makes this sandwich. Crispy on the outside, and super soft of the inside. The sausage is a bit spicy, but again, flavor! 

The bruschetta. Enough said. 
The pizza cookie, or Pizookie (piz-uk-ee). My favorite is the chocolate chip flavor. A must share! 

The service: I am convinced that everyone here loves their job. Always helpful and prompt. (on occasion the hostesses seem a tad out of touch with the customer). 

Make some time to go by and try them out. It will be worth your effort.
