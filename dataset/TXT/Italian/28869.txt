My first time going they asked us to move tables in order to fit in a larger crowd that showed up unexpectedly, and since I'm really easy going I didn't mind at all! But the waiters/staff kept apologizing for the "hassle" and at the end gave us a delicious free shot. What a way to a girl's heart :)

I have nothing bad to say!
