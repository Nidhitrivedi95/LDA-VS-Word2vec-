qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg I've never had a bad experience at any of the Market Grille Cafe locations.

The staff is always friendly and the food is always great.  I usually get a gyro plate, but the pomegranate chicken is delicious as well.

Also, save room for dessert, or order some to go, because the baklava cheesecake is AMAZING.
