LXheNwqZPoXuXNNeP1sNew After spending a half hour last Friday night trying to figure out where to go for dinner, we finally decided on Humble Pie. The kids had been here but I had not.  After a very nice meal, and sampling of a few different items, I thought it was a good place overall and I will go back:

I had the meatball sandwich.  The meatballs were huge and the bread was fresh and it was loaded with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.  The sauce was a bit bland, 

My son had the shrimp pizza which was amazing,  It was one of the best flavor combinations I have ever had and I want it next time I'm there.  I also tried the BBQ chicken pizza and the goat cheese and prosciutto pizza which were also pretty good.  We also had a fig bruschetta and a regular bruschetta which were outstanding.
 
Prices are average;  for 6 of us the entire tab was $116 and the server was phenomenal.  He was literally running his behind off, the place was packed but he was spot on, professional and pleasant.

The only thing I didn't care for:  it was very dark inside, I had to use the light from my phone to see the menu, and the music was turned up to a volume loud enough so that I could not hear the server.  As I mentioned above, I will go back.
