9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg I might be biased but judging the number of times I dined here, I guess I would have to give this place a review. I used to live the building above the restaurant so I became the first group who ever tried this place. I must say that I was immediately impressed by the fresh pasta and cheese made in store every day. You can verify who made your pasta today on the black board at the entrance. I like this place because it is affordable (around 20 bucks would give you a filling pasta dish) and super tasty. It is more like a chic downtown bar/restaurant that happens to serve you amazing comfort food. I recommend the futtuccine Capri and Pesto pollo; these two are my go-to pasta options. The first one for seafood lover and the second one is chicken. 

Also, do order a large portion, because if you cannot finish, you want to take it home! 

Btw, also lots of wine options and a great place to chill. No reservation needed, big enough for big crowd!
