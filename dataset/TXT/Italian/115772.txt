GtHu9uGXpn7Jg_Z7vFKZKw I'm a red sauce italian food fatty so I was taken aback when I saw a place with a primary serving focus of MEATBALLS!!   How amazing is that!

One of their methods of serving balls are cup combos - choose either 2, 3 or 4 balls in a cup with sauce and a breadstick.  They have FOUR kinds of meatballs and a bunch sauces to choose from.  I got original balls and turkey balls and had chose the spicy meat sauce.  It was amazing.  Both kinds of balls were tender, flavorful and had great texture.  The spicy meat sauce lived up to its description.  The spice level was probably one step past italian going toward mexican.  The breadstick was quality too.  

Meatballs can also be served as sliders or a full sub.  They also feature flatbread pizza and a couple other sandwich options but......the focus is balls.  

Recommended for a snack.
