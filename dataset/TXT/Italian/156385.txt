L6ZPG8lO1tMGmHimSjuEMg I truly had an awesome birthday dinner here. Jonas was our waiter and he really took care of us. The chef prepared a special dessert for me to celebrate my birthday. I truly felt special. I had the Yaki Soba and it was very tasteful for a vegetarian dish. I will definitely be coming back!!!
