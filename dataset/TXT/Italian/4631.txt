_mg5bYknpZgaWSfjQVmrJQ Our server was wonderful.  The hostess folks were very confused about handling three couples and were not taking names. Can't imagine what it is like when it is crowded. The pizza was good and since they dropped some on the way to the table they made us a personal pizza to go to make up for it. Unfortunately when we went to eat the leftovers the next day we discovered they put the wrong toppings on it!  
The stuffed mushrooms were not very good. Fortunately we only ordered the half order special. Salad was tasty but the serving bowl was taken away by the busboy before we finished it. 
Not likely we will go back again unless someone we know is partial to them.
