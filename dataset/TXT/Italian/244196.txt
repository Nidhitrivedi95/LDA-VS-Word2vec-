USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg I went to this restaurant last Sunday night to celebrate for my girlfriend birthday. We have reservations at 8.30pm and we got there around 8pm. Once we came inside the hostess welcome us warmly, she lead us to the bar because we came early. When the table is ready she seated us and hand the menu while she introduce the restaurant. It's really great. After that, the waiter coming and introduce himself, and asking us for the drink. We had taittinger brut champagne. And after that he let us know their special appetizer. And he really knows all the menus we asked. He's great! All the food that we order are amazing! I was order lamb and my girlfriend had lobster. We had amazing dinner! It's truly recommended.
