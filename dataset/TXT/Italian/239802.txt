u9R0_pvEkl7QGPJYH3j1sg It is so hard to find semi authentic Italian food in Arizona and this for sure hit the mark . Fresh ingredients, great combinations of flavors , had all my favorite dishes , what more can you want? Try the bruschetta it amazing . Wine was low end but who cares the food made up for it. The staff was really friendly and made you feel at home
