UfSwz2LHiVu0K6CJJ6-2gg I have been a regular for over 3 years, eating lunch at least twice a week.  Fresh lentil soup, pasta e faggioli, homemade lasagna with a creamy bechamel, and chicken picatta, all have been delicious examples of lunches which reminded me of what my mom used to make. I LOVED this place and considered myself so fortunate to have such a gem close to work.  All this changed recently as they sold to new owners/partners and changed the menu to include middle eastern dishes like schwarma and falafel.  It wouldn't have bothered me so much, but the quality has declined dramatically and the prices have gone up.. Gone is my delicious spaghetti bolognese for $7.99, replaced with weird spices and overcooked chicken for $13.99. What is supposed to be hummus is some type of drywall putty. I mourn my old Cafe Volare as they now call it Mia Bella. I am so sad. I will never set foot in this place again and predict that it will shut down within 6 months. It breaks my heart. The new owners should give a course on "how to take a fabulous business and run it into the ground".
