wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw Came here for a Sunday brunch with my wife and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The service was spot on! It was a pretty chilly morning and our server basically dropped everything to make sure we were comfortable at our outside table by placing a heater next to us. Now that's what I call customer service!

I ordered the country toast and my wife ordered the salmon. While the portions may appear to be not that large for a brunch meal, they were definitely filling enough. I also highly recommend the mimosas, which are better than many I've tried elsewhere.

Finally, the music choice: superb! Did not expect to hear 90s gangsta rap with my brunch but absolutely loved it! ;D

Needless to say this won't be the last time we visit Postino!
