hz8mFMIQxQNLKE5rYmg6zQ I moved to north hills in October. When I moved here we tried Papa johns but they had horrible service and messed up the order. So we tried pellagrinos! Since then I haven't tried anywhere else! It is delicious food, not just the pizza but pastas and apps as well! They also have great service and very quick. I won't order pizza from anywhere else!
