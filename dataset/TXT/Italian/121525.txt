HC7XYU669ZXbE1cChU5U0Q On our trip to visit relatives in Willoughby, my mother in-law took us here to celebrate son's birthday.  

The restaurant interior is nice and has a warm atmosphere.  The owner Lisa came in and visited each table, which was very nice.  

The bread and dip they brought out before our order was SO delicious, I'd go back for that alone!  We had a hard time not eating all the bread and dip as not to ruin our appetites for dinner.  They sell the salsa bread dip at the front as well.

I had the Crabby Paddy salad which had two crab-cakes about 3" round.  It was pretty good and filled me perfectly.  

Since it was my son's birthday, they brought us each a little slice of vanilla cake and my son's had a candle in it, the wait-staff sang him happy birthday and some patrons also sang along.  It was all very nicely done and I'd go again.
