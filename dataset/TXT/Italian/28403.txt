53BSdnhzcCBfBH_6TgX63Q I love a good NY type pizza.. & I may just be a pizza snob., so upon moving to PHX , my friend ordered this in a pinch for caloric intake bc it was near our hotel..I've loved Rosatis ever since... I'd love for them to add some more variety to the salad selections.. But hey.. I'll take the awesome pizza & make my own salad...
