Zps5RW0brl-s43OvlCgZAQ I was surprised that the restaurant  was kosher when I tried to order  a sausage pizza. The restaurant was busy for early Sunday.  The pizza we ordered  was nice and fresh a little too much cheese. We liked the gnocchi but the sauce was a little too salty. The garlic  bread was crusty with a lot garlic. Service was fast. The interior was simple
