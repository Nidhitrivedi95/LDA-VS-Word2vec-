wSpUTl9Bho2WRo9C5p_-Pg What I like: The food of course, location, speed, and service.  
What I don't like: The small, SMALL portion sizes and the cost associated with those portion sizes.  

We visit this place for lunch often, and we all agree that we really like everything about this place except for the portions and cost associated.  We'd visit far more and take our out of town coworkers here if this was fixed.  Well it was a little while ago when they introduced a lunch combo.  As Amy L. pointed out you could get any two of the three following items: soup, salad, or pasta and a drink.  We all tried this, loved it, were full, and finally felt it was at the right price.  

Today we went back and unfortunately we saw they had removed the signs.  I asked the girl at the register and they said they're trying a new combo out which we all pretended didn't exist on the menu.  This is severely limited to a ceasar or garden salad and a sandwich or soup.  Seriously, we're at a place called "Sauce," yet on the lunch combos you can't order pasta?!  We all ordered a stand alone pasta dish and drink.  We left again unfulfilled, frustrated they fixed and then screwed up their problem, and +$11 in the hole.  

I'd easily rate this place 4 stars if they went back the first lunch combo.  If you're a person who eats small portions, you won't mind this place and I'd highly recommend going.  Hopefully someone at corporate will realize their mistake.
