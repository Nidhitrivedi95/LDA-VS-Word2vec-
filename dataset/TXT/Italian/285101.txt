zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g The Di Fara Special is the absolute BEST pizza I have ever put past my lips!!!  Breaking down every part to this pizza, each on their own is amazing, the crust, the sauce the cheese, the pepperoni...ALL AMAZING!  Worth every bit of the price, which if you ask me is not all that bad, the pizza is huge! A must!!!!
