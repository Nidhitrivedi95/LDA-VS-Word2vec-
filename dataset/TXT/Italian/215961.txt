RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ My wife and family planned a surprise dinner for my birthday. I thought it was the two of us but it ended up as 8 including my daughter who flew in from Seattle. The setting was incomparable with exquisite views of nighttime Phoenix! The setting, service and the food were superb. The staff was knowledgeable and attentive, the presentation and taste were world class. What a great find! I'll be back!!!
