XJ2dT7pwmutxM4ceQnTVUg The service was terrible! When I asked for ranch dressing for my calzone as I waited for the calzone to arrive. The waitress grabbed the ranch from my coworkers appetizer and gave it to me.  I guess he didn't want it according to the waitress, cause he was not asked. Then my calzone that I ordered came and it was the wrong calzone. I didn't have time during my lunch break to wait while they cooked another.   When she picked up my other coworkers empty plate of buffalo wings she asked if I wanted the rest of his ranch dressing (streaks of buffalo sauce in it) .  Then at bill time I have her a $20 for a $13.21 lunch and waited for my change. She gave me back only $6- no change, so I included the missing change in the tip amount I left to make a %15 tip even though service was terrible. And got cursed at while leaving.  The food is good but they need to make a serious change in wait staff. If I remembered her name I would have added it to this review.
