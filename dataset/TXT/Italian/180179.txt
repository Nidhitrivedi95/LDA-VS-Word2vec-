Mostly just skip the spaghetti and meatballs, the meatballs were quite the let down :( the calamari is great and the shrimp scampi noodles were on point but the rest of our food (spaghetti and garlic bread appetizer) was just okay. Ambience is cute and servers were nice and on top of drink refills and checking on our table.
