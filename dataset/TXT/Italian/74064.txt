CPgyfcsyPegLha1ajaSRoA This is my favorite Italian restaurant! They have HUGE portions and very excellent prices. I don't get to go very often, but every time I;m in the mood for some good Italian this is the place I go. They also make excellent hoagies. I'm a big fans of the turkey! Their dipping sauce for the bread is amazing! I'm pretty sure they sell it by the bottle as well. If you are looking for some good Italian food in the South Hills look no further than Pasta Too! Their tiramasu is awesome! It's also huge which is a good thing because I'd never share otherwise.
