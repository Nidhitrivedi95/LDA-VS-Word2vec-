3prYLfbO9h30ozqdUCZ_6A Oh my goodness; I wanted to like this place, other ppl say it's good but... no. Just no. The interior is a maze winding through a plethora of faux- stucco rooms with tons and tons (and tons) of kitschy random junk on the walls and nooks and shelves in a poor attempt to make it look 'authentic' or 'immigrant' Italian. It just seemed creepy/dirty/tacky. Sitting at a table looking into a nook, one could see dust and dead bugs. Waitstaff coughing... and food was definitely not great. Bread was like loaf bread and the olive oil/vinegar mixture tasted sour. Food is served family style - several ppl to a dish. We got stuffed shells which the menu boasted of sausage, etc.  It was puréed - like this unidentifiable baby poop goop. I was only able to eat the pasta shell; my stomach was literally turning - it was all just very gross and seemed super unsanitary. 

We did try the brussel sprout/prosciutto side and that was the one redeeming thing of the entire visit, but not enough to save the experience. 

Just ick. Felt dirty and old - including restroom. We don't be back; should have went to Olive Garden; not a fan of chains but it would have been better than Buca.
