SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Came here over the weekend to celebrate my sister-in-law's 30th birthday.  We loved the decor and the atmosphere!  Probably the longest time I've spent at the forum shoppes without shopping.

We ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana as part of our meal.  (We did family style here.)  It was soft, but not mushy - perfectly cooked IMO.

We also ordered the Deep Dish Pizza.  I loved how they used actual chunks of mozzarella instead of shredded.  It tasted really good.  I think the crust could have been more crispy and it got soggy really fast, but overall a good pick.

Our 3rd dish was the Pork risotto.  The pork was tender, but it was still a little chewy.  The risotto itself had tons of garlic, not a huge fan of the dish.

Our last dish was the shrimp ravioli, that day's special.   It came with a lemon-y type of cream sauce.  It was an okay dish.  I'm a fan of marinara over creamy sauces.

Since we were celebrating a birthday, they brought out a complimentary dessert.  It was huge!  I think it was the Banana Veneziana.  We were so full from dinner, but we couldn't stop eating the dessert because it was THAT good.

Great, trendy place to eat.  You might have to scream a little bit to carry a conversation because it was so loud sitting on their "patio", but great nonetheless.
