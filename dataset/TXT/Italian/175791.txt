NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ Only came here for pastries at first... but today I had the pizza. Seriously some of Best New York style I've had aside from Enzo's in GV and secret pizza at Cosmo. Totally my new pizza place. Also. They have awesome traditional pastries on Easter and Christmas. Wheat Pie. Yum! :)
