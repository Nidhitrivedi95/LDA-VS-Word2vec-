7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Warning: If you want to be able to eat here and live with yourself, you'll have to dumb yourself down a bit and pretend you don't understand the word "lardo" when you read it on the menu. Are you ready? Good.

That said . . . Helloooooo, beef carpaccio with "warm lardo crostini." LOVED that this was one of the pre-theater menu antipasti offerings. So delicious. 

I have to admit, I was less slightly less charmed by my main course -- the pappardelle with porcini, served with a fresh grating of parmesano-reggiano (chef's suggestion) -- than I was with the first. It's hard to follow a tender meat-and-lardo pairing with truffles and pasta, no matter how perfectly al dente that pasta may be. 

It is even more difficult -- if not impossible -- to then be delighted by a simple gelato/sorbet. The texture doesn't follow, the flavor doesn't quite match; nothing is really right about the arrangement.

So I left with mixed feelings about Carnevino. On the one hand, my departing taste was that of bland, "espresso"-flavored gelato (flavor not really recommended). On the other hand, it's nearly a week later, and I still drool every time I think about the carpaccio or the delightful tuscan fries my husband had with his filet. Perhaps skipping the dessert would just be your best option.
