Pg12K0aiPMz2FpmkzxQnaA I guess, being the first to review, what I write will influence anyone looking this place up! If you're reading this then Karamia is a place to try and will not regret. As for how much you like the food, you be the judge!

The location is new, clean, bright and pretty. It was not crowded nor noisy. They have booths and plenty more space than their old location.

The waiter was very friendly and smiley, however, they lost half a star in this category. She didn't check up frequently enough to refill our waters or ask if we needed anything. We found ourselves looking for her on a few occasions (when my friend couldn't take the spice from her plate and needed water!!). I can't complain too much here because it wasn't THAT bad.

Their service was very quick. We had our plates in about 15 minutes, but like I said it wasn't busy. Our plates were hot and delicious.

I had the peppercorn chicken plate and upgraded to the saffron poutine. I was hesitant but my friends told me to try it and I'm glad I did. It was different...creamy and savory and the flavor was not overbearing in any way. The chicken was very tender and flavourful and the salad and dressing were good. My friend had a saffron sauce pasta plate with steak and she said it was kind of dry but otherwise delicious. 

Bottom line if you're looking for a good new halal 'italian' place to try out, definitely come here, eat and be merry :)
