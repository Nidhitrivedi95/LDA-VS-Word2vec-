Q4RSmF0s-AkaegrLFCLEbg I had dinner here while on a weekend trip to Toronto. My Mom had heard it was good so we tried it out. Our meal was great. As an appetizer we had the shrimp alla diavola - and with the warm bread it was great. For entrees, I had goat cheese & crab ravioli and my Mom had butternut squash ravioli. Both dinners were delicious. The portions were plentiful - we didn't have room for dinner.  

The thing that I loved about Toronto was that the restaurants go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Donatello was no exception. Our host was enthusiastic and attentive and we didn't have to wait long for our dishes.

The restaurant is pricey (our bill came to $106 with alcohol) but its well worth it. I'm a New Yorker so its not out of the ordinary.
