PxTKXsdYqoFHWAG2amz0XQ Came here on a Saturday night around 6:00 PM. The service was attentive and excellent. The pizza was great - a very thin crust that I just couldn't stop eating. And I usually really restrict my carbs! We also had a quinoa salad with added chicken, which was also excellent. ANd the chef made a small bowl of linguini for my 1-year old granddaughter to nibble on.

We ate at the outdoor tables while she made a huge mess, and the staff was really sweet about it. As my first visit to Phoenix, this made a good impression on me.

Enjoy!
