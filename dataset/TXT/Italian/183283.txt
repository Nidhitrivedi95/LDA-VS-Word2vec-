ocZv9DHZaf9tkJyzxL5tbg Ate here this evening with my son and father.  They both had gnocchi and said it was very good with a wonderful tomato sauce.  I had rigatoni with hot sausage.  Sauce was very good,could have drained pasta first, but delicious nonetheless.  Sausage was good.   For an app we had stuffed hot peppers that were to die for.   Only gripe is pop in cans that each of us paid for 2cans each.  Finally a real Italian restaurant in a predominantly Italian neighborhood.
