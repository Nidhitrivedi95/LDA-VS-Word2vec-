64o_nYvzIKwHFOSYSEm-qw My favorite pizza in Las Vegas! Best all you can eat deal in town! My clients love it too. Bought $100 worth of food today and it saved me over $1500 in overtime labor charges.

I'm definitely a repeat customer, and I highly recommend this place to Las Vegas tourists as well as locals!
