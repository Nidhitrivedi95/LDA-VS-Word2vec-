Seriously the best pizza I've had in Vegas!  Niko and his brother accommodated us with such authentic charm and passion! 

The flavors ooze out of every cheese filled pore of the crust.  Freshest ingredients, the heart of the artist comes out in it's ambrosial deliciousness! 

Everyone should enjoy a slice of Niko's!
