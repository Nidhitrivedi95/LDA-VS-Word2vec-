Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw I love Cuginos. Discovered it on accident while a friend was eating at Chipotle and wanted a slice of pizza. I bought two slices intending to bring a piece to my fiancé when he got out of class at UNLV... oops. I ended up eating both, because they were SO good!

Fast forward a few years and we pick up pizza there whenever we are nearby. We live across the city and we don't get to eat there very often, but every once in a while I'll mention Cugino's to a friend and I have yet to talk to someone about it who doesn't know the place and love it!

The pizza is great, the garlic knots and deep fried gnocchi are also good. I haven't tried anything else on the menu because I literally cannot get out of there without a slice of pizza.
