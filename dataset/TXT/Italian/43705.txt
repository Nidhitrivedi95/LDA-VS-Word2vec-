821Xtr_wwXqDc_ljjy5p6w Came here tonight as a birthday dinner and the party was 8 adults. 

First we ordered the bread sticks. They came and were drenched in oil. (I guess that's a common theme with pizza hut.) While we started that we ordered 3 pizzas and some wings.

First came a meat pizza, then about 5 minutes later the veggie pizza came, then 15 minutes later the wings came and finally 5 minutes later the cheese pizza came. This was one of the more disappointing parts of the dinner as some of us were left to wait while other people in our party ate. 

In terms of the quality the pizzas were all covered in a layer of oil but the flavours were great. The wings were buffalo mild sauce and were delicious. The sauce was nice and sticky and had enough spice. The wings were fried to perfection. No complaints with the wings.

Would I come back again. Probably not unless I'm trying to skyrocket my cholesterol levels. I think I'll stick with pizza pizza instead.
