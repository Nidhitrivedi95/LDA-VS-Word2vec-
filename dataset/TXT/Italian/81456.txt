dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw We ate here on Wednesday, April 26. Our original reservation was for eight people but we changed it to seven when we checked in. We had two different servers ask us if we were still waiting on the eighth person which I think contributed to our slow service. I've eaten here a few times before but this time was totally different. It took over thirty minutes to get our drinks. Two of of our party ordered a pasta with meat sauce and got pasta with no meat - so it had to be sent back to be refired.  My chicken dish was delicious but certainly not worth the over one hour wait. I also wasn't thrilled to see a dead cockroach next to the wall behind our table but I guess a dead one is better than a live one. Service was really poor - not sure I would go back.
