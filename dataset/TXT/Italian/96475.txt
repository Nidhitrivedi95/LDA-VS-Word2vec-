eRNDudpCqrDuRaz4-reNOQ My dad was in town and we decided at 5 to go out for dinner. WE figures since it was so early it wouldn't be hard to find a place, boy were we wrong everything was booked. My husband got a hold o Papillo (called) and they were wonderful enough to squeeze us in! 
We don't eat Italian a lot, as it doesn't always do some well with my stomach, but we really loved the food we got at this place! I had a delicious fresh pasta dish with seafood and marinara sauce. It said on the menu " chill and marinara sauce" and when I asked how spicy it was they said 'because its all freshly prepared' they can just make it without the chills for me!  Fresh and great service!  The waiters were very friendly.  Cute and homely atmosphere, felt like I was in an Italian Families home for dinner, and it tasted like it too. We had a bottle of the red house wine which was nice , mellow  and super fruity! ( I don't like strong tannin wines). Really great resultant! Will be back forsure! 

Also I loved that it was a restaurant that we could have conversation in and laugh without feeling like everyone else was quite or listening! 

They have a bunch special of 2 course for £9! will be back for that!
