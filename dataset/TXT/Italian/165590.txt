For some reason there were almost no people eating when we were there around 1 pm on a Thursday but the food was great. I had the pear Gorgonzola salad with grilled chicken which was perfectly fresh and tasty. My hubby had the pene cardinal with Italian sausage...also delish.  We finished it off with a very fresh cannoli . They had to have made is fresh right then and there. We will definitely go back. We were sorry that more people seemed to be going to bland chain restaurants instead of choosing this one.
