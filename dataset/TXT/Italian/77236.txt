cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA I'll give it a little while before trying the restaurant, but will be ordering take out again soon

Ordered a half Special half Chicago classic which they said would take 45 mins, and an email confirmation stated the time for pick up which was accurate.  

2nd time ordering take out ...got a cheese, and a veggie deep dish.  

Once again: Cant complain, pizza was great.
