kQ9gVGp5R_jZwLi0-q8PZQ I tried Hey Meatball for the first time for lunch yesterday. Overall I was very impressed. My fiancé and I decided to get two meatball sandwiches and split them. We tried the Rodfather (pork meatballs) and the vegan meatballs because we both usually really appreciate a good veggie meatball. These veggie meatballs were lentil and sweet potato based (there were some other stuff too that I can't remember).

Both sandwiches were fairly large in size and came with a side tossed salad. The pork meatballs were delicious, the sandwich was fantastic. The vegan meatball sandwich was also quite tasty but they definitely weren't the best veggie meatballs I've had. I guess I prefer eggplant veggie meatballs but that may be a personal preference. I probably wouldn't get these again but that's more a testament to how good the regular meatballs were. 

The extras: The salad was also good. It had a lot of pickled veggies on it which I found a bit overpowering but my fiancé really loved it. 

By far my favourite thing was their hot sauce. Two different types both really good!

I really enjoyed Hey Meatball. It's a bit too heavy to eat on a regular basis but it was super tasty and ill eat there again when I feel like a bit of a hefty Italian indulgence.
