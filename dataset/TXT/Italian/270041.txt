XlvpNPAZnzm-DJmKYmK2nQ Boy has the quality ever gone downhill since its opening a year ago. It is now just an ordinary thickish crust pizza without much flavour. Entering through the heavy, unwelcoming doors, you find a cavernous place with not too many customers. This could be a thriving spot with a bit more attention to quality.
