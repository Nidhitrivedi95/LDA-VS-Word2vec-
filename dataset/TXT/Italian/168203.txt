MJHSWSh9Ixusz8t_VdL3qA Not too bad of a place.  I had the Chicken Parm, and it was pretty good.  It's a nice little family joint, kinda small, so you might have to wait for a table at dinner.  We went for lunch, and the lunch prices were pretty decent.  I would maybe think twice about going for dinner, because the dinner menu is a bit more expensive than other Italian places.  They do give you a nice salad though with your meal, which is an extra charge at some places though.
