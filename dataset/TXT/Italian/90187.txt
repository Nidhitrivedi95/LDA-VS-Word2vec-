E9b73ETPw0VYUJ2_YSJJdQ Pizza Rustica used to be really good.  Quality pizzas for a decent price (not cheap but not ridiculous).  

Recently I've had two meals and both have been terrible.  

First of all the base on my gluten free pizza was like cardboard (they used to do a really nice crunchy one).  
Secondly the toppings were quite lacking - I mean, the goats cheese was literally on one tiny piece of pizza.  

To add insult to injury, the driver delivered the wrong pizza. When I called up to let them know I got a very tepid response.  Fortunately the driver corrected his error quite quickly, otherwise I either faced another lengthy wait for a replacement or I keep the one I received in error which was $4 cheaper than the one I ordered.  (no refund of difference was offered, not that $4 is going to break the bank, but it's the principle). 

I wonder if Rustica has a new owner as previous experiences were superb - both delivery and in restaurant.  

Unfortunately i won't be returning
