M1hEQVMiND1rbiT8mo2j0g Loved this restaurant.  Great food and service at great prices.  I went last week and had tortoloni with shrimp recommended by Ricki my server it was outstanding.  It is rare to find a strip restaurant with good value and servers who actually give service I was sorry I had not heard about this place sooner.  The only downfalls are they should have misters and music outside as it was a little warm and I wish they had a lighter fare menu for lunch the food is a little heavy, some summer sandwiches and salads would be a great addition.  Aside from that the food and service were very good I will definetly be back and tell all my friends.
