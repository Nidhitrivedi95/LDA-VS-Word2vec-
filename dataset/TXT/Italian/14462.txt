1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag Had a pleasent experience here for dinner on a bustling Saturday night. We ordered the lobster ravioli, spaghetti, & steak. Everything was PERFECT. The wine list was good however you could only buy sangria buy the glass (waaahh) so we got a bottle of wine instead. Service could improve a LOT, but then again maybe we shouldn't have sat outside. But hey! The view was nice & we even caught the Treasure Island show during dinner.
