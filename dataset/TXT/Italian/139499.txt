jG1jcAeDw0pZTHCNC5kw_w Who makes the best pizza in Arizona? Grazie does! Grazie's pizza tastes heavenly. Grazie used to be a super busy restaurant, nowadays it is less packed but I have remained a loyal customer. Somedays the service and food is different than on other days but I don't care because the pizza is always delicious!!!! Nowhere else can you find anything like it. 

Side note: I have been coming here for 10 years now and tonight (10/5/2014) the Panna Cotta was the best it has ever been! Whoever made it tonight, please keep them around!!
