XeUm1QS078kgjwONhul0ng We eat here once a month or more. It's a hidden gem. Maybe it's the parking, but this place should be jammed given the value. I go for the Caesar every time, because I've not found better in Phoenix. Valentinos in Santa Monica would not be a stretch comparison. My luv adores the lasagna which is a sometimes special. The pie says Brooklyn, especially the Quattro formmagi. His specials, especially seafood, and Roast pork offerings are sublime values. Get there and save Pino, who is a great host, who remembers his patrons, from the pile of anonymous pizza purveyors
