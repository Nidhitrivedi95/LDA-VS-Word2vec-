An Italian & Japanese fusion resteraunt was quite an interesting twist! We came here for dinner & wanted to try the famous dish. It is a small little store that could possibly seat like 40 people MAXMAX... when we walked in we we're the Only people other than the workers. Would have to say it was SUPER dark in there.. it seemed like no difference of lighting from outside to inside ahahhha 

One thing that was really apparent was the foul smell that would not go away which we assumed is the bad piping system for the sewer or something but it was only in this place which seemed to be coming directly from the bathroom & it filled the whole place possibly because there was no one there either to distract the smell?.... it definitely affected the taste of the food...

SPAGHETTI UNI TOMATO CREAM SAUCE $26.95 - I would have to say it was a large amount! It was DERICIOUS!!  although because of the smell of the place it was a bit hard to taste the uni... but the moment we walked out of the place it was like a kick in the face of uni cloud! We packed some Togo & ate it at home & you can taste the uni like AMAZINGLY perfect =] 

KUROBUTA SAUSAGE RATAOUILLE SAUCE $5.95 - I had one piece.... the hubby devoured this thing in seconds =[ I hate being a slow eater....

Definitely have to come back & try other dishes!!
