stNlfaeBITkyGmHn8oRwvg Ordered barbecue wings with mild sauce on the side and they literally delivered my wings with absolutely no sauce on them and nothing on the side. Then when I called to let them know they made a mistake and I needed them to bring me sauce, dude gave me crazy attitude, like it was my fault lol. And the pizza sucks too. The dough tastes like it's not cooked all the way,  the pizza sauce was Bland... Probably the worst pizza I've ever had. I think QT's Pizza (gas station) is better than this crap. Do yourself a favor and skip this place and get some REAL pizza.
