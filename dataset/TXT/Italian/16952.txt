22so15K1aqikL9FHt37CSQ Having been a regular customer my delivery was messed up. Manager refused to rectify the order and blamed his inability on the other customers he had to attend to. Ridiculously poor management and terrible customer service. It's surprising that such a big chain isn't capable of teaching their employees on how to run a store during busy hours or maybe it's just the specific Tempe branch that can't function with high volume orders.
