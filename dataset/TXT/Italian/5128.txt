_Nitc4wBfIs4lZ45Oc5JOA It was a very good experience. We were driving past and saw it and thought to try it. It's like the chipotle set up as you order your food and move through, but two meals, order breadsticks and drinks, $32.  Maybe a tad much, but this was definitely a nicer experience than "fast food" places for lack of a better term. Food was very good. Staff were super super friendly as we asked lots of questions. I will say with kids it seemed really fun for them. Families having spaghetti, etc, there just seemed to like how it keeps things moving without the wait time of a restaurant with younger patrons. That was very cute. We were there end of November I believe. I meant to write the review then.
