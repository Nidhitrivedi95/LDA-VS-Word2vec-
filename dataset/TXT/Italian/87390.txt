duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ Food was really good. Food portions were small like you'd expect at a 5 star restaurant.  Service was good. So why only two stars?  Because they had the audacity to charge me $5 FOR A CLUB SODA! $5? We spent $275 and you couldn't fair for a  glass of carbonated water? Great way to nickel and dime people. We won't be back! There are too many other options that serve great food and don't charge you for carbonated water.
