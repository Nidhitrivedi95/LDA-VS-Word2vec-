G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q We went to Giada for my husband's birthday. Our hostess was very friendly and we were seated right away, I had made reservations for 8 pm. The restaurant is lovely with a great view where you can see the Bellagio fountains. Our server Rocco was amazing, very attentive and passionate about the items on the menu. He brought us a complimentary Prosecco which was a nice touch. We started with Tricolore salad, it was fantastic and quite a large size. Then we had the Lobster Arancini and the Fritto Misto. Both were very nice, the marinara that is served with the Arancini makes the dish it is light with a spicy taste at the end. The Fritto Misto has a very nice light crunchy batter, not greasy just right. My husband and I shared the Spaghetti and the Scallop Risotto. The Spaghetti was delicious and my favorite of the two. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the fresh pasta was great. The sauce is a creamy lemon sauce that is not over powered by lemon. I highly recommend this dish. The risotto was also great, scallops were cooked perfectly, and the risotto was nice and creamy. Only thing that I can kind of complain about is that they knew it was my husband's birthday and they did not bring him a little dessert but it's ok haha.
