The West Side has a NEW "GEM" in Town!

Mike is a well known Chef in this area and is well known for his Greek and Italian Cuisine. 

This restaurant prepares well made food. Sauces and many meats prepared in house. The front of the menu says they are a Bakery too so possibly some of the breads might be prepared in house too.

I've been to his last restaurant many times and this new restaurant offers a bigger more varied  menu, wait staff, roomy comfortable booths.

I came in for lunch and ordered the Salmon Souvlaki Pita. The pita came with my choice of Greek Fries or Greek Salad so I went with Salad. Out comes a big fresh salad and soon after my pita arrives. The pita bread seemed like it was made to order as it was so fresh and hot and the filling was tasty. My husband had the house made sausage with peppers and onions. The sandwich was baked with bubbly mozzarella cheese. 

We were checked on several times by our server and by Mike.

We will stop in for dinner next time as I remember the Myconos Chicken was pretty darn tasty.

Portions are large and pricing is reasonable.

They serve breakfast (8am), lunch and dinner 7 days a week.

Give Mike's a try when your in the area!


Very Slight update.
Very surprised that many yelper's are making an issue about the atmosphere. People are making it sound terrible and that really isn't the truth. Just look at the pictures and see for yourself. Mike's is not high end and has a slight retro feel and is a whole lot better than many little dirty ethnic dumps you see on dirty dining.  Now THAT IS THE TRUTH!
