9ETbjlbD52Q6PKXjIcTqUA such a distance from Phoenix/Scottsdale, it was good to find a place that had a great selection of delicious French entrees.

did a nice job for a special birthday dinner, including a custom cake for dessert.

wait staff was very attentive and understanding of our somewhat energetic kids.

but note that is the "fine dining side". the "casual dining" side is more or less a nice version of a sports bar. keep in mind when making reservations.
