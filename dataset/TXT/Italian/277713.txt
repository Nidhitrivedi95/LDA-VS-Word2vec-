YjJnGaqvCpxspBLxXrOA9w Had dinner this past Saturday with 2 other couples. The food was good but cold. The service was abominable. The restaurant was full, yet we saw only 2 servers. Had to ask for water twice before we got it and bread twice as well. Most of us got pasta dishes and we were never offered grated Parmesan. It took way too long to be served both salads and entrees and when the entrees finally arrived they were cold.  Very disappointing.
