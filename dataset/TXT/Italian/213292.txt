r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA DeFalco's is now one of my favorites! My friend and I stumbled upon it through yelp and I am so glad we did!  The staff was friendly, as well as the other customers, when they found out it was our first time. We got a little too excited and ordered the margherita pizza, chicken parm sandwich, and Te antipasto salad. It was all so good!  We didn't finish it all, but then all the desserts looked so good, so we got some biscotti, canolis, and an eclair. 

Since then, I've been back to try the white pizza. It was good, but I still end up back with the margherita. 

My only gripe is how tight the seating is. If it's busy, it's hard to find a seat, but you just gotta be ready to swoop in and grab a table if someone leaves!
