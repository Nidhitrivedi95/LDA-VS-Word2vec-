-8Oaw94x2pYJCVP8ZtuTTw been there so many times. love the food but there is one waitress that is very slow and you kind of feel like your being ignored. her name begins with a V. I have had here twice. the 1st time I put up with it thinking it was a bad day.. but again today, her servive was poor.....
