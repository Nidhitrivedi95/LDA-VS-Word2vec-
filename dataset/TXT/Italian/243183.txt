UpmAfOoh6WTF9g6AH-6ofA Went here for Summerlicious with some friends on a Saturday evening.

I was happy to see that we were started off with some of the namesake bruschetta. I found the bread tasted a bit stale for my liking, but overall fairly tasty.

My appetizer was a salad with peaches, bocconcini, almost, and a balsamic mustard vinaigrette. The peaches were substituted without notice for figs, which were delicious.

My main course was the ciangale spaghetti with wild boar meatballs and truffle cheese. The meatballs were juicy and flavorful although the sauce was a little disappointing.

The panna cotta for desert was quite delicious, although it left a rather unappetizing taste in my mouth moments later. The tiramisu one of my dining companions order was apparently quite delicious.

Overall, the food was quite good, although given the price of the dishes, I would think twice about returning.
