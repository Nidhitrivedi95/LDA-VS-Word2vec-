5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA I've been here for Father's Day, a first date, and most recently, my mother's birthday. They have a great food & drink menu.
On my mother's birthday, we sat outside and were fascinated with the beautiful weather. Our server was very patient with us when we told him that we needed more time to decide on what we should order. We will definitely be back another time!
