6I27BTuHI5PMvOBG4WS8NQ Both times I've been here it was for a birthday dinner so the table was about a dozen people deep, which makes the evening a lot more fun. And the restaurant is so spacious (with very high ceilings) that they can comfortably accommodate large parties.

Anyway, the best thing about this place is the food. It's downright incredible. The last time I went they had an antipasti special where you get two verdure, two meats and two cheeses for 15 bucks! Definitely an awesome deal to split with a friend. First time I came here I ordered the ravioli and it was fantastic. This time around I ordered the tagliatelle (almond pesto) and it was delicious. My friend let me taste some of her lamb, which melted in my mouth.

Atmosphere is nice. Both times I've been there it was at night in the winter so I can only imagine who chaotic this place is on a summer afternoon. Staff was great (girl even took my coat at the door) but with it being a large group they might have been laying the service on extra thick. Great place for a romantic date!
