B7G_2Hx8Rx8l6oQ6K3n5Uw They have gluten free items labeled on the menu, but even though they have a ton of veggie options, the vegetarian/vegan options are not labeled so we had to ask about everything and held up the line. If they had things labeled as vegan, they'd get 5 stars because the food and service was good and they were very accommodating regarding our "allergies."

Order: Roasted winter vegetable salad, dressing on the side. No other changes. Quinoa, beet, & arugula salad with no goat cheese, and balsamic on the side. Build your own pizza, hand stretched crust, red sauce, olives, asparagus, and spinach. All vegan.

Tip: order extra red sauce if you get a pizza with no cheese.

The Roasted Winter Vegetable salad is almost exactly like True Food's autumn/winter salad - yum!
