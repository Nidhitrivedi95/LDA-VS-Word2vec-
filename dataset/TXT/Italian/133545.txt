im8sxT2V-drSvxP17qdb2A I've been to Sicilian several times before but I stopped going ever since my last bad experience with them. After more than 5 months of depriving myself from Sicilian, I decided to give them another shot since I've always remembered them having the most delicious waffles. The only problem I had with them before was that their service really sucked ass (always slow and the staff never seemed happy serving paying customers!) 
This time around, their service noticeably improved as they were more attentive and orders moved more smoothly. Feeling more at ease because of this, it allowed me to enjoy my Strawberry Waffle in peace. The Fantasia (homemade vanilla ice cream with fresh strawberries drizzled in strawberry sauce with a little whip cream) is by far my favourite dessert to get. They make the creamiest and most delicious ice cream served on top of your choice of a hot fresh Belgium waffle or in a soft crepe (yuuumm!). Their serving portions are huge with fair pricing so you might find it convienient sharing your dessert between 2 people. They also have a nice side walk patio which is great for the summer!
