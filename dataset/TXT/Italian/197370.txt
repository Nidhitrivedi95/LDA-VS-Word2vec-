ppwYJPfE0tpSJA9X8l54cQ I had barely moved to Arizona last month and was craving pizza and wings and this place is near my home so I stopped by. 

When I got home I deeply regretted that idea. 

First of the guy who I first spoke to was rude from the start but whatever I was ordering to go so I don't really care. 

I ordered the large pizza with extra cheese and pepperoni and sausage, cheese sticks, jalapeno poppers, and wings. 

Everthing was burnt. The wings, sticks, and poppers were all black. 

The pizza had little to no cheese and I had paid for extra cheese.

Last but not least, it was flavorless. 
I felt bad for my family because they were not enjoying it either. 
Anywho, you live and you learn.
