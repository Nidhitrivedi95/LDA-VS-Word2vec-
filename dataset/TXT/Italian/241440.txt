UHPjDgiEHnTe7-MP-b2kyQ My first try to Veneto, and I'm in love with it :) Nice atmosphere, delicious food, and very nice staff. So here's a bit recap:

Antipasto: Carpaccio Affumicato (Thinly sliced cured smoked beef with shaved parmesan cheese, arugula and drizzled with balsamic, topped with a ginger-cucumber pesto) -- liked everything of this dish but not so much of the ginger pesto, the ginger taste was a bit too strong to me...

Entree: Orecchiette Salsiccia e Broccolini (Pugliese pasta sautéed with sausages and rapini, in extra virgin olive oil, garlic and red pepperoncino, slightly spicy) -- This dish was presented nicely, colorful and very flavorful!
Gnocchi di Patate alla Bolognese  (Homemade potato dumpling served with homemade meat sauce) -- Loved the tasty meat sauce, and the potato dumpling was definitely one of a kind.

Dessert: Chocolate Souffle with Vanilla Ice Cream -- rich chocolate cake paired with the delish vanilla ice cream, yummmmm, what a sweet ending.
