The will actually try to sell you another gift certificate that is worth less for the same price instead of honoring the original one.

I am not sure how the food is since I never got the chance to try it... but if the way they treat potential customers (by tricking them into buying worthless certificates) is indicative of the food I guess I am not missing much.  Thumbs down 100%.
