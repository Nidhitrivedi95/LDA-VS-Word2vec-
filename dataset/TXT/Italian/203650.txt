Q6DIU2OnvBUo7KJ3rdjM-w We just moved to the area and decided to give this place a try. Not only was I hung up on 4 times, the girl, Madison was very rude when telling me. "I still can't even hear you!" She then hung up. I called back from three phones and was hung up on every time after asking to speak with a manager. It seems YOU may have been the ones with "phone issues" due to the fact we have successfully completed one phone call to Zella's Pizza and our delivery is currently underway.  They even hooked us up with extra discounts. Zella's pizza is the way to go! Zero stars for Barros.  The girls at Barros should take notes on good customer service from the wonderful staff at Zella's Pizza!
