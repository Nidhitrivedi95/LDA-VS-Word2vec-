klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw Review for the Society Cafe as a wedding reception dinner sort of thing:

Not sure how easy it was to plan this, but my friends Alexis and Chad just got married in Vegas at the Wynn and had their wedding reception at Society Cafe. 

The menu was a mixture of pre-set and choice. Appetizers were served family style (pigs in a blanket served with ketchup, pretzel breadsticks served with a stoneground mustard butter, buffalo "lollipop" wings with ranch). First course was a choice tomato bisque (served with a drizzle of basil oil in the initials of the couple and a crispy fried basil) or caesar salad. Second course we had a choice salmon with quinoa cake and citrus vinaigrette, roasted chicken, or trenne with truffle cream sauce and peas. Dessert was wedding cake.

The service was efficient and professional and unobtrusive. The food was delicious (might be worth a mention that when serving 40+ ppl vs the standard 150-200+ at a wedding, quality of food is inversely proportional to the number of guests).
