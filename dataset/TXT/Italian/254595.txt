VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ I would really give this place 4 1/2 Star! Our dining experience was YUM, YUM, and YUM! The atmosphere of the place is nice and clean. Just a little over done with decor on the walls, but I guess something to look at. The service was very friendly from the time you walk in to the time you leave. We asked our server for suggestions  since there were so many menu choices. The food was delish! I tasted what everyone had and boy...Yummy! From soup (onion soup & gazpacho), appetizer (farmed beers and goat cheese), entree (lamb chops, Brazilian chicken, c? salad), and dessert (forest fruit tart). Even the cappuccino! You can't go wrong. 

Reason I took off a 1/2 star was my friend ask for a cocktail, but they only serve beer and wine. Also, when our entrees came out, only the hot entrees came out together and I had to wait another five to ten minutes for my salad entree to come out later. Which I guess they wanted to make sure it's fresh?

Overall, the dining experience is definitely worth returning and trying everything else on the menu. Did I also mention, it's reasonably PRICED!  This location is known to be jinxed.  I hope it stays! We need a place like this in Henderson.
