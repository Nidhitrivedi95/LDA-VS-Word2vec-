DhRJJ5aUUuBp3XR1JbLeuw The pizza was ok. Not horrible, not great. You order at the counter and seat yourself. They have a nice patio here and the waitstaff is attentive in refilling your drinks. 

I didn't like the little cup they served my white wine in. I like to hold a wine glass from the stem so I don't warm the wine with my hand. And if you order a red your serving hits just below the rim of the glass so you can't swirl your wine. Weird. 

There wasn't anything that really stood out from this experience. We probably won't be back.
