The staff is always so nice and the manager is also so helpful and extremely attentive to anything we may need. I always come with my 8 month old and he is always checkin on us and brining us a high chair when we need it. Not only that the food is AMAZING. I always get the champagne salad but my fiancé gets the lasagne which I steal bites and it is delicious!
