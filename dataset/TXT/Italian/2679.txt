-RIWE3MU3GCHM5KIW7PLww My boyfriend and I were excited to eat at this restaurant after reading the reviews. We ordered our food he got a Caesar salad which had cashews??? no big deal. We got the bread which was pretty good and then a cockroach crawled put of the bread on our table. We cancelled our order and got out of there. Won't be back.
