TMkTYhDMgDCuFwdDYIIoJA Ate here last night and had the worst service ever! The server, very short blonde hair was clueless and lacked people skills. She approached our table and didn't even say 'hello'. Waited for our check for 15 minutes while our dishes were all still on our table. I asked another server for the check and a to go box and she immediately brought one over and was very nice. Our server saw this and dropped our check off without a check presenter and without saying  a word...Big mistake! Gave the server that brought me a to go box a 10.00 tip and our catatonic server got 1.57.
