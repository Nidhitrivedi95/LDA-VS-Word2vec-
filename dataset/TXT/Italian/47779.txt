8yoe08nCUpjDQ56Y9qVPKg Great Italian Beef sandwich in the middle of the Vegas desert...don't get the hot dog..it's fine, but not the Italian Beef.  This place has the complete experience...a grumpy cashier who manages his screen-window like a guillotine...pulling it up just long enough to take your cash and drop your food on the counter.  He once settled an argument my brother and I were having about "what's in your pickle relish" with a one word answer..."pickles"....and if you've ever been there, you'll be familiar with this little welcome: "NEXT!!"
