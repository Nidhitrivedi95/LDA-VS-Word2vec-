DvxGK4R1_0LR9837DCOZXg We recently moved to the area and have been trying our local Pizza places. Luna is the first one we tried, and we have ordered several times since from them.  Today I tried a competitor and was disappointed, so I thought I would throw Luna some Yelp love.  This is good classic pizza.  The crust is chewy, the sauce is flavorful.  The wings are flavorful.  I have sometimes had really good wings from them, sometimes so-so (perhaps they sat a little?).  I'm not a big bread with pizza person (because pizza is carby enough), but I did order the garlic knots one day when I had a crowd eating, and they were quite tasty.  Luna's is affordable, and their delivery is prompt and friendly.  Luna's, I wish I ordered from you tonight.  There is nothing mind-blowing about this pizza, but it is good simple pizza.  Hits the spot.
