OilKQPdBj3rD7eZDF5OENQ Although I don't usually go for chain resteraunts, this one breaks the mould. The main thing that makes it so individual is the setting- it's in an old bank with a tower overlooking the water of leith with a great outdoors area. The food is wonderful and well priced and the music relaxing. The only real problem with this place is the service- it took over an hour for our starters to come last time we came.
