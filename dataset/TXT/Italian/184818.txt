OIdOJaNS8M624F58XGV3PQ Best pizza in town! 

I associate pizza with snacking at school events, or lazy party food. I don't dislike pizza but would never order it at a restaurant. We went here for a friend's birthday, and pizza being their specialty, I ordered one! 

The thin doughy crust paired with the right amount of sauce and succulent toppings made this pizza restaurant my favorite in town. The pizza here is exactly like the ones I ate in Italy. 

After eating the pizza here, I gave other Italian restaurants a shot at their specialty pizzas and none of them were even close to it.
