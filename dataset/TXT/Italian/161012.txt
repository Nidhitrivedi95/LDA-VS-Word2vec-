lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ Despite the recent 5 star reviews, I really think the 3.5 star rating on Yelp is an accurate representation of the food and service you'll get here.

The pizza was incredibly salty, which made me want to drink more water. But the waiter never came! She seemed really busy because the restaurant was closing in 30 minutes, which resulted in us waiting a long time to put in our orders. My water never got refilled either. 

The food is a 2/5 and so is the service.
