3yMmo1sERpks50quoaA8PQ Uncle Sal's is delicious and has a nice atmosphere.  The host and bus staff are wonderful.  Scott was the rudest waiter I have ever had.  We came in for a birthday dinner and we are a polite bunch; we say thank you and try to be pleasant.  Scott never said you are welcome--he was snotty and spent most of the dinner chatting up the host who was clearly his boss.  This guy was awful.  When I started to be rude back to him, suddenly it was like he remembered what his job was and he started be obsequious.  It really ruined the dinner.  I hope that management reads this and addresses the issue.  If we return we will make sure Scott isn't our waiter.
