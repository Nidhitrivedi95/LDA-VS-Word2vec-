wV6Nle04jS8I40tUHPUiiQ We have been to Humble Pie several times and have always had a really nice experience. Their selection of pies is great and we love their specials for lunch! Out of the 5 times or so that we've been there we've only experienced "meh" service once. The other times service was fine. We will continue to frequent Humble Pie on Happy Valley.
