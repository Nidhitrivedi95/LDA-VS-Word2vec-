IS5tQNVzyVYbI2zl8yEaKA A friend of mine made reservations to the resto as we were looking for some Italian. Came in through the back door and at first was not impressed. This Casa opened up to a nice little restaurant, full house (expected for a Saturday), clean restrooms and great vibe. Our waiter was very bilingual, friendly and did well for our party of 8. I had some of the best gnocchi that I have ever tasted and the rest of my meal was great. I am sure to return.
