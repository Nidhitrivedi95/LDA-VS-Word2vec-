pjpUOlJLlkIxBZ5BquA2PA I took six of my friends to Pomo yesterday. I told them about the powder sugary dough and the complimentary lemoncello. We ordered pizzas and paninis. Food was good but we weren't offered the usual fried dough and limoncello. Service was slow. I love Pomo but they need to be consistent with their service. I will probably be back next week. Hope the service is better.
