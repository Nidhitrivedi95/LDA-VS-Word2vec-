pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg The place serves great tasting pasta- Southern Italian style. Our large clan met up here for Thanksgiving dinner. 

Let me start with the pasta first. The shrimp scampi with spaghatenni/angel hair pasta noodles is terrific. The perfect garlicky dish with fluffy great tasting pasta and jumbo fresh shrimp. For sides, we had deliciously prepared mashed potatoes, steamed carrots, brussel sprouts, and green string  beans. Ok, the specially prepared turkey was juicy and moist. 

The bar service, table service, and the basket of breads receive positive marks from me. This place is memorably very good.
