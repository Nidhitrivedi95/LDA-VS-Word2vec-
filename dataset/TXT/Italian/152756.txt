KuxDPl6UYNLxFChPm0_MNw Our hotel recommended this place.  Great food with stellar service.  I took a chance and ordered one of their virgin drinks.  It was called the "RedMed Sour".  It was a magical blend of help oil, orange juice, lemon juice, agave, and a FRESH-CRACKED EGG!!  This blend was terrific.  It sounds a bit crazy but it tasted great and not at all earthy.  Unique drink everyone should try!
