NoF90rswXBHESSyDaWeKKA What a great spot! Don't be fooled by a the nondescript exterior, this place is a gem. Extensive draft beer menu. Start with an order of Pepperoni Pagnotta (honestly you could make a meal of these!!) I suggest the Margarita pizza. They will add pepperoni if you want meat. Finish with the Flourless Chocolate Cake! You will need to share that with a friend. Great food and exceptional service!
