Shared the trio of dips with yummy toast, the delicious asparagus bruschetta, and the calamari (which I skipped thanks).
I had a nice big strawberry/avocado/goat cheese salad and a gigantic, totally delicious mushroom and arugula pizza.  I totally only managed two slices after eating everything else but it was SO good (if a bit light on the mushrooms and heavy on the arugula).
Also snagged a bite of the meatball sandwich which was really good.  I hear the short rib sandwich was only okay and the ahi tuna disappeared off the plate so fast it was scary.
I would definitely eat here again and try out a pasta.
