wp5FAtCGMyU2RnQ-7kxKHQ Food is pretty good, or at least the last time we actually ate there it was. Service has varied from o.k. to poor in the 3 or 4 times we actually ate there.  We had 7:15 reservations Friday night and at 8:00 we still weren't seated.  I won't return for the following reasons:  1. The front of the house is inept, to say the least.  Our first visit was right after they opened, and I excused the incompetence as part of the learning curve.  They haven't improved with time.  2. The noise level in the bar area makes it pointless to try to carry on a conversation. Outside is best, and the dining room in the rear has been acceptable in the past.  Bottom line - meals aren't cheap here and for your money, you can do better at a lot of other places.
