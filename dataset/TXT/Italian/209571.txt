qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA We had a really great experience here. 

I ordered the beef carpaccio and a side green salad (still a tad hung over from the night before and my stomach was not in the mood for anything too buttery or greasy). It was filling (but not over the top) and just a wonderful meal altogether. In addition, the views overlooking the Venetian Canal and the Grand Canal Shoppes was priceless - we spent most of the meal people-watching rather than talking, hehe.

Really a romantic and ideal setting, but not uppity nor obnoxious. Would totally recommend this to anyone in Vegas.
