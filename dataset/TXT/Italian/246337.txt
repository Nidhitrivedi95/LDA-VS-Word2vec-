UzjCvrNuK4crxi0IS9Jp5A Terrible pizza terrible customer service, i just moved to the neighborhood Jul 27th and while moving my stuff one night got hungry and ordered from them. When the food finally got to me as i open the box to see that my pepperoni pizza is a pineapple and my 2-liter of coke that was bagged was a sprite. I called immediately back and was promised a free pizza by a man who said he spoke to a manager. Today i tried to call in receive said free pizza apparently nobody has heard of the situation i spoke to one manager who then called another manager and they wouldnt do anything in return.
