7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw Went here for dinner and was very happy!  Fair prices for good food.  Had the scallops with risotto and it was great.  Scallops were perfectly cooked and not over seasoned.  Risotto was just a shad over cooked for me but the flavor was great.  
Nice attentive service to top it off.  
+ half price bottles of wine on Sunday :)
