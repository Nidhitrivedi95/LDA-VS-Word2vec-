yLrCSSrSnpxB-0ZEPt19jA Pretty big individual slices of thin crust pizza that work well for a quick meal on State Street.

This place would be a solid 3.5 star spot if that was an option. There is usually not a long line, which makes it a good spot if you need food right away. I feel fairly neutral about the place and most of the slices. I tried the BBQ chicken pizza once and found the chicken to be dry. One slice I do really like is the spinach and feta cheese pizza.
