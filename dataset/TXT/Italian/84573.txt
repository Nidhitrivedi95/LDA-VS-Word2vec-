DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA I only swung by here after I got some "recommendations" from the locals after my trip to the Sonoran Preserve (really nice hiking area). I only came here for a light meal, but it ended to be not the best experience. First, I'm surprise with the mix of strong and negative reviews; maybe the restaurant just had a re-regrand opening, but I'm not the judge. So, here are my thoughts:

I had a light drink with their glazed seared salmon salad and some garlic-y flatbread appetizers. I like the fact that they were trying to go organic and include fresh options. However, I wish the salmon was not overcooked, and the honey citrus glaze had a funky after-taste I'm not sure what is up with that.

Their desserts did look appetizing, but I did not have room for that. 

Conclusions: I'm not a big fan of their food, there was an uncomfortable confrontation at the front house, very odd and unsettling environment yet I do like the décor and a "try" for fresh ingredients towards their Italian-style dishes, but I was expecting more of a baking restaurant than anything. It's an alright place; I think.
