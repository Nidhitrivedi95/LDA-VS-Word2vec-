qeJnMI5RmyJ2TZvkqvjn6Q Got seated at 7:17pm and it's 8:07pm as I write this review and we have yet to even receive our appetizers. We haven't heard a peep from our servers as to what is going on. The tables around us who were seated before us have also not received their food. I understand it's a busy night but waiting nearly an hour and still haven't received our appetizers is a little ridiculous. 

Will see if the food is worth the wait...
