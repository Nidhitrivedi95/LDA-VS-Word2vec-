G9UlT-mBMdUwoUGCW405ow I finally discovered where they hide all the good restaurants in Cleveland. Tremont! I was raised in the east-side suburbs, but live in Chicago now. When I come home to see family, it's always hard for us to find a non-chain restaurant with something interesting on the menu. Well, not anymore! My dad had read about Shaq's famous tweet mentioning Lago's lasagna and decided that we should try the restaurant. We really really enjoyed Lago. 

We made early reservations and headed downtown. The restaurant is intimate, cozy and very appealing. We all ordered drinks (whoa, strong!) while we looked over the menu. We decided to order a small antipasta plate to share between all three of us. It was just the right size and everything was fresh and delicious. We also all ordered the poached pear salad which was really good. 

For my meal, I ordered the acorn squash risotto with cranberries and gorgonzola cheese. This was sweet, but I like that sort of thing. It was very warming on a cold winter night. My stepmom had the pan seared scallops on a bed of orange, fennel arugula salad. This was fantastic! I'm looking forward to ordering that on my next visit. My dad had the veal tortelloni with peas and prosciutto in a parmesan cream sauce. He said it was good, but compared it to a similar dish he liked better in Chicago. 

As we were reminiscing about our favorite flavors of gelato on our 2010 trip to Italy, I decided to try Lago's gelato for dessert. I ordered the banana praline gelato. This was unbelievably similar to the banana gelato (my favorite) in Rome. I was very happy with my choice! 

The service was decent; at times a little slow. Not slow enough to hinder us from returning though. We truly enjoyed our meal at Lago, and it was a nice way to end our holiday vacation together. Looking forward to dining at Lago again!
