wxzG81ZyWpBje_mU4aFLaw I ordered using GrubHub because I'm laid up with the Flu and was tired of the hotel food. I had the Minestrone soup and Fig and Prosciutto White Pizza. Both were very good despite them being cold. I've never used GrubHub before and might again in a pinch but I will definitely eat at Humble Pit again.
