I was given a waiting ring but about 5 min later saw an open but dirty table in the bar area.  I asked for it and was told in a minute. 10 minutes went buy, a smaller table was cleaned and was immediately taken.  The one i was waiting for was skipped.  So i asked again, sure let me get someone. Once again another was cleaned but not the one we were waiting for.  By then two of the front ladies are looking at me and commenting among themselves.  Not good!  Im deaf but im not blind.  Very disrespectful to do this to anyone. Finnaly i saw another person and asked if it could be cleaned.  Total waiting time 25 min. If my waiting ring would have not been taken away from me i would have been seated in 10.  My complait is against the two young girls.  Rude to talk about customers.  Yes i was hungry but i wasnt rude.  Erin took care of us once seated.  She gave us wesome service.
