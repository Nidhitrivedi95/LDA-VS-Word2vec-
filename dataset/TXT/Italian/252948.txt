VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Came here and got a table for a friend's b-day via a promotor's recommendation.  Tried to come again the next night and snooty doorman said our ratio wasn't good enough to let us in (2 guys, 1 girl) and had the audacity to offer us a table (for a mere $400) downstairs in the lounge instead!  Regardless of his opinion of our group (or lack of) ratio, midget promotor with napolean complex didn't have to act like the typical snooty vegas jackass about everything.

Still gets 2 stars because table service was beyond excellent.  Staff was extremely helpful and willing.  You do get what you pay for.

Oh yea, place was a little small too.  Not very grand at all.
