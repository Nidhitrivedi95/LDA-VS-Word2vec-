ldGnkfXjRNAxRP9cizgr0Q After being on the road for a few hours, I was looking forward to trying this place. Unfortunately, my family and I arrived and the cafe had a sign on the door that said "be back in 7 minutes." Lights were on, door was locked. I didn't mind waiting, but after 15 minutes of waiting on the street, we decided to go somewhere else. I even called the cafe a few times hoping someone may just be in the back. I just recommend that the next time it is around 5 pm on a Tuesday, with a Beyoncé concert happening in a couple hours, that their be someone in the store. Maybe next time.
