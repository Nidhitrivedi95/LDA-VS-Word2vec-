KtUuxN2gZXeC7WpJ_w9hNg This is a lovely restaurant that no matter when you go it's always busy. The staff are very friendly and efficient and the food is fantastic, especially the pizza and fish dishes, although beware of the mussels they can be a tad on the salty side.


 It's the perfect place to go with your partner, friend or the whole family for a nice lunch or dinner. However the staff are always welcoming, even if you just want to pop in for a coffee and some cake.


 Price wise the food is good value.
