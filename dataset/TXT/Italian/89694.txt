E0YuuRpK_4RpaUF7JK3mhg We called to make a reservation for two people and were told by Walter that they were "wide open,reservations were not necessary". When we arrived we said."table for two please" and Walter replied, "do you have reservations?" Ha-Ha-Ha!? I told him what he said to me on the phone and he said "oh, someone else already has a reservation". He then lead us to a tiny table with two of the most uncomfortable looking chairs I've ever seen (also, we were told by friend to sit in a booth, chairs were like torture) we both said, at the same time, "we'd prefer a booth please" and good old friendly Walter replied, "that's for the people with a reservation"!Needless to say, we left! Go to Tuscany Grill, directly down the street, it was "E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T!! I'm going to write a RAVE review when I'm finished here...just like I'm finished with Bratalian. Carla, get rid of your brother-in-law, family or not, he's pulling you down!
