I had heard rave reviews of Tanzy, but had my own personal bias w/the name. You see, I was raised on a farm in SW Washington and "tansy" was a menacing weed that was cursed under one's breath in the spring. I personally thought the weed was quite charming (beautiful, yellow flowers)...but my grandparents thought differently.

Tanzy didn't disappoint! It was late afternoon so the staff rolled back the walls and the lounge area was completely al fresco. Nice breeze on the tropical sofas while watching the tops of the palms sway in the wind. Felt like I was on a damn vacation.

I had a cucumber-lime martini (delish, but a tad on sweet side) and their calamari. OMG! Soooo good! My friend had their fries and they were quite impressive also - unique tasting and love that they were put in like a little, silver "fry basket". Nice touch!!

Service was impeccable and attentive. Tanzy, you won my heart and have changed up my personal bias - thank you!!
