ES8JP18I4sz72HEAWjk_KQ Six of us went for dinner and I didn't find any issues with service as others have found.  Our order was taken quickly and the food came quickly.

I tried the polenta antipasti and have a pizza main.  The polenta had a ton of flavour - I would not hesitate to order again.  The pizza was flat crust with artichoke and black olives.. delicious!

I found this place slightly more expensive than other Italian spots in the area but I would still definitely come back!
