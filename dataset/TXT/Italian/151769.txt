kpZ2vPjkHfee4pCLC05tfg Great Italian restaurant!   Serves rustic, comfort food.  Have been here several times and have tried different dishes and our favs are:

-Award winning pheasant risotto
-Hand-made pastas "strangle the priest"
-their own in house made cured meats.  So good!

Came here a few times with those deal find/teambuy/groupon type deals....but we were going here before they offered the deals...so if you find the promos, they are great value!
