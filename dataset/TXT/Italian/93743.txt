eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ Just AWFUL...  I was in town for a Bridal Shower and the service was horrible!!  There was only 12 of us women and they couldn't get it together.  They forgot to bring out 2 salads and missed 3 entrees.  Our waiter Kevin was the worst and the manager Kelly was non-responsive.  DO NOT ever plan a party here.  I felt bad for the bride.  The day was supposed to be about her, but everyone was focused on the slow, lousy, rude service
