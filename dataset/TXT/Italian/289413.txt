ZtJ6sTq7-5rL9ORUtQJHAQ Just tried this place for the first time...loved it! Great service, relaxing atmosphere, nice decor, delicious bread basket (or two...since we kept eating and eating and eating), fantastic food. We ordered the Linguine with Clams and Penne ala Vodka (plus meatballs). The linguine was wonderful with the light white wine sauce, and the vodka sauce on the penne was some of the best I've ever had. The meatballs were also delicious. We 100% recommend Gaetano's, and we will for sure be back soon.
