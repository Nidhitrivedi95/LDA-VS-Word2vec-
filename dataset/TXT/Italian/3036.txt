-z9IQza32guuRyqF8jxMyQ Very down home - humble italian food. 

Visited this restaurant with my big italian family. They are picky eaters, particularly about dishes they can easily make at home, like penne with meat sauce and veal parm. 

However, this restaurant knocked it out of the park. 

RE: Food
-the calamari is amazing. Huge portion. The rings themselves are huge and the batter is not heavy. 
-The kids had penne all a vodka - a staple at home. They loved it. A classic recipe done right. Just wish I knew how big the portions were. 1 plate would have been enough for two children under 10 years old. We ended up taking home a plate, but it warmed well the next day. 
-lots of choice for pizza, I had the Americana with green peppers, mushrooms and pepperoni. So good! One of my guests had the bruschetta pizza  with melted bocconcino on the bottom. I would get that, looked light and fresh
-spaghetti all chitarra  - a huge hit with the two guests who ordered it at my table. The sauce is very similar to what we would make at home. The pasta was fresh and cooked to perfection. huge portion!

RE: Service
-attentive - no complaints 

RE: Ambiance 
-this is NOT a fine dining restaurant. It's more of a trattoria - a casual place where you can bring children
