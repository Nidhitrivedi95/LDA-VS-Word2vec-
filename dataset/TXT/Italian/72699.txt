CGCLYjfKSxVvHOvAe8L-IA we had this pizza delivered to our friends hotel room whilst visiting one evening. although the wait time was 45 minutes, we were drinking so it was no worries. after clarifying the location, the delivery went to the wrong hotel. well, no worries there because we all get lost at times. 

but the pizza, i thought, was subpar. a margarita pizza with no sauce. i thought all margarita pizza's came with red sauce. that's why we get those because in my previous pizza experience, they load them with red sauce. anyway, i was disappointed and with so many options that we do love, doubtful we'll hit up SONY again.
