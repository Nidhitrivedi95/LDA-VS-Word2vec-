7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw Went for a late night date. Arrived just as they were closing for the evening but we were greeted pleasantly and seated on the outside patio as requested. We took our time ordering without a pushy waiter waiting to close up and when we finally decided ordered two deserts; the Nutella  crepes and the pear fritters. Both were excellent. Great service, great atmosphere and wonderful warm desserts on a cool evening.
