r2BP0Irh63hqYUDSZd0ijQ Discovered this italian restaurant a few months ago and I think it's worth the trip to try out.  Their portions are generous and reasonably priced.  Their bread is delicious and their sauce is the perfect compliment with it.  Calamari is something I recommend and their service is good.  Pasta is cooked very well, though the dishes I've had so far has A LOT of butter/oil.  But maybe that's why it tastes good.  Haven't had any of their deserts but I'll be sure to try it one day.
