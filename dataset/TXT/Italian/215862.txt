RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ Where to start! This place is truly amazing all around! The view is to die for, the food is even better worth dying and coming back for. The lobster was so tender and flavorful along with the filet mignon. The service "Ian" was truly amazing, extremely knowledgable, personable, and well spoken. To top it off he introduced us to the chef who prepared and amazing dinner for our anniversary! Thank you! I can't wait to come back again.
