a0imQZn-utjU8kyIfEdwLg Wow!!! do not waste your time on this place! They advertise that they are the best pizza in Charlotte, yeah probably within a 1/4 mile of their location and that is something I would contest! The staff is rude and the food is horrible. Do yourself a huge favor and go ANYWHERE else for pizza in the Charlotte metro area. If I could vote less than one star I would, they do not realize that they are in the service industries because it seems they could careless about pleasing a customer! I have worked in the service industries all over the East coast and have never seen such disdain toward a customer.
