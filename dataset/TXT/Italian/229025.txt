sZMliOne4mADZ2-CqeanZg I went to Bar_One for Sunday brunch with a dear friend who I hadn't seen in a long while. I called the day before to reserve a table on the back patio (FYI they accept reservations for seatings before 11 a.m  only), and when I got there was seated with a smile. I quickly realized that eating on the patio on a day  like this would cause me to melt away, so I asked the server if there happened to be a table free inside (in the air conditioning!).  This was after we had ordered and already started sipping our delicious mimosa's!
Lucky for us, there was a table free and our server was nothing but helpful and friendly throughout the transition inside.
Now for the eats! 
Dee-liiissshhh-oouuuss!!!
I had the Ozo Buco (egg in the hole) with smoked Salmon and spicy hollandaise. The bread was thick, and soft, and the hollandise was draped inside meticulously as not to take over the dish. I also ordered a side of peameal ($2) to complete my tasting, and I was in heaven!!
My brunch companion ordered the Bar_One Brunch and was just as impressed. Eggs, potatos, pancakes.. The perfect portions to make a successful meal.

I will go so far to say that Bar_One has one of the best brunches in the city.  Plus, who can resist an atmosphere that is modern yet has a family feel?
Well done guys, I will most definitely be back!
