uwT7CppiYkek-Z-661sndQ This restaurant is consistently good. Not amazing, but good. I have eaten here a handful of times since it first opened and have not been disappointed. The gnocchi is decent and the pizzas are great. Prices are reasonable and staff are friendly. Every time I have been they seem to have been out of the meatballs. Wine list is limited for a "wine bar".
