PJgNZN4UYLxP47cy_1c-DQ I've recently tried out their meatball spaghetti one night and sausage spaghetti another and a slice of cheese pizza. I love spaghetti so it's hard to not enjoy it, but their sauce is pretty good. I did enjoy the sausage one more than meatball. Their service very friendly and you never wait forever for a meal. I do suggest for others to try out.
