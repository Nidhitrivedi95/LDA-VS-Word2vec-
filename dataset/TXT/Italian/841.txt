-8JaNeG3etLgOVyg2gOIiA skip this place. there are much better Italian restaurants in phoenix. 

pros:
(1) the food tasted OK (as good as Olive Garden)

cons:
(1) the decor was extremely outdated...it felt like a retirement home
(2) way too much "mozzarella" cheese on my entree 
(3) it felt like my food was not freshly prepared...perhaps it had been under a heat lamp for a while.
