cXgXRqB40CGHEMKQgxLDTg I love this place but that is probably because I select awesome combinations for my pizza... : P
Went here for lunch yesterday an as always it was really good.
I recently went to the one in Central Ave too, and it seems they have a nicer pace at that one, seemed more coordinated when they make your items... 
Oh well, maybe it was just a frantic day... lunch rush hour gets kind of tough... long lines and super busy, but they are very fast. And also, this place is kind of loud... super loud... but everybody is very friendly and I could go here for the teas alone. Delicious. Overall great experience and I will go again tomorrow if I can...
