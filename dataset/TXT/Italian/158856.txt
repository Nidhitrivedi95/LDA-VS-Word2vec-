LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Love Maggiano's for great pasta! 

Maggiano's is noted for their excellent sauces and pasta combinations. You usually get a quite large portion as well. I can usually barely stuff half the bowl down and have to take the rest to go.

I am a fan of the simple fettucine alfredo here. Their sauce is homemade and has that traditional cream taste that is perfect and blows chains like Olive Garden out of the water. Add chicken if you get the chance....the chicken is that soft, pulled chicken taste like it came off a rotisserrie chicken, instead of the gross, rubbery cubes or strips that you get at lesser chain restaurants. So yummy!

Dishes are plenty big to share. Appetizers as well. We order the Fried Mozzerella and it is definitely enough for four and impossible for two to eat alone. Very reasonably priced as well, right on par with Olive Garden, but much, much better quality.

If you do the large 'family style' dining or have a birthday they bring you these soft cookies with a lemon glaze that is perfect for nights when you are already stuffed full of heavy pasta. The perfect quick, sweet bite.

Only warning is this is not a location that is a quick stop. Save for rare occasions they are extremely busy 7 days a week. Even with a reservation you will likely end up waiting 10 minutes or so before being seated. Request to be seated away from a main aisle way or you risk getting jostled and bumped by passing rude dining parties. 

Have always had exceptional service by the servers. They are always personable, quick and welcoming. 

There is a kindly older gentleman who usually comes around with a guitar or accordion (?) and offers you a song with your meal. This is perfect for those celebrating a birthday or anniversary.
