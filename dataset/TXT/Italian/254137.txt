Vv7aXgWg2TEXfrfE_-FFrA I was looking for a good place to grab a sub around the neighborhood (just moved to Collinwood last March).  I ordered the deluxe buttered cheese steak.  It was great, nice to have a sesame (& wheat?) bun rather than plain jane white bread.  It was delicious, plenty of food, and from the looks of the menu, I could eat there a bunch and find several solid favorites.  Highly recommended.
