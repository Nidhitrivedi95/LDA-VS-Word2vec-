HfOQdfvijWVWMFgMIhVuBA The Tootie's beef sandwich is a perfect cylinder of tastes, requiring neither melted cheese nor ranch dressing, Frank's nor french fries. Pittsburgh, with your gleaming bridges and mobs of blue collar drunks, this should be your signature sandwich. Primanti's is fuckin' dumb.

Also I love the pickled veggies. I would eat those alone as a side salad.
