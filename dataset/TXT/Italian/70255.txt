bYPahCt2MBgEqSahPS8GJQ When ordering, I couldn't decide between penne vodka or Fettuccini Alfredo. The waiter said, "No problem! I can put in a half order of each!". Sounded great. Then I got the bill and realized he failed to mention it would be $7 extra for this.... Also I never once received a refill on my water which was my only beverage. Once we received our food, the waiter never came back until he brought the bill. The food was very good but service was not.
