bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw Let me start by expressing the build-up that was my expectation for this restaurant. I have been wanting to try Vivace since it opened its doors to the Charlotte public. 

I heard great review after great review so the bar had been set pretty high. I elected to go during restaurant week so I can dip my toes into a few different dishes and not feel like my wallet was getting ambushed. 

Overall thoughts? Awesomeness and I will absolutely be back. I had the risotto balls to start and they were heaven in my mouth. Perfectly cooked with a sauce to die for. Loved. I would have had them as my main meal as well if I could. 

Then I opted for the steak. Eh. Just alright but definitely not bad. The sauce that came with the dish was finger-licking good but the steak was just a little under-cooked for my liking. My friend got the chicken capellini pasta and I thank my lucky stars she let me try some because holy goodness it was awesome. Unreal actually.

Dessert was perhaps my biggest area for concern because I went for tiramisu. My most favorite dessert of all time and I will judge a restaurant on its food quality based on the tiramisu that they serve. Vivace did not disappoint and actually got an extra star for serving it with a caramel sauce and Espresso gelato. Absolute deliciousness. 

My overall thoughts? Get yourself to Vivace. STAT.
