Ocq3pio5JGNKEGqzjAhkbQ Took the family out last night, and decided to give Joey's a try. It just recently opened up near the movie theater. 

Wife, the two girls, and myself ordered:
Italian Beef sandwich
Chili Dog w/cheese
Chicken nuggets
Chicken Sandwich
and Fries

The food was just OK, nothing special! I actually liked one of the girls chicken nuggets. Had very good seasoning, liked the taste. Their Italian Beef sandwich was alright. Did not like the gravy, glad I had it on the side. But the peppers, and onions made the sandwich much more appetizing.  Wife's chili dog was alright, they do serve Vienna hot dogs, but I would rather go down the street to Freddie's and have one of their dogs. 
Now Joey's has a Chicago's theme, seems like there is a lot of places like that here in the valley. But their decor just didn't seem authentic, just seemed cheap. The restaurant was clean, workers which was over staffed were very nice and always checking to make sure things were OK. But the smell this place had just wasn't right! The girls complained about it as we walked in, wife also complained. My opinion was it smelled like they boil their hot dogs? But it could also be their gravy. 
Glad we came by and checked this place out. Not sure if we will come back? But who knows!
