The fresh bread was hot and crisp. The star of the show, however, were the double chocolate chip cookies. I shared one with my daughter, immediately regretted it after my first bite. Better than my cookies and it takes a lot for me to say that because my cookies could win contests. Will definitely get my own cookie (cookies?) next time.
