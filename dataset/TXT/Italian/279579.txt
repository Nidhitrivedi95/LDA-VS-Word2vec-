yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w You definitely don't go here for gourmet food.  However, the portions are pretty decent considering it includes salad, entree, cappuccino and ALL YOU CAN DRINK RED OR WHITE WINE.   I always get the spaghetti w/meat sauce since its almost as thick as bolognese.  

Been here twice and love it each time. Maybe b/c I'm in Vegas, having the time of my life and ridiculously drunk.
