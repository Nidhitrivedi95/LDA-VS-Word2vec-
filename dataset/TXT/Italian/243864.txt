usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA By far my most favorite Italian spot in the city! I find myself going here for every special occasion to get a margherita pizza. It's the closest one I've found after living in Italy! It's a BYOB so we always grab huge amounts of wine and stay for a while. I'd highly recommend checking this out with family or friends. Be sure to reserve if you have a party greater than 6. You'll have to wait most nights if you're a small party, but it's worth the wait!
