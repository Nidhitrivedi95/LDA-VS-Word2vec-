N_cCvYUP0dQeLKflgoUrXQ So I went to the Boka Pizza in Pheonix Az, I ordered a meatball sandwich. It was not busy when I ordered my food. 5 min after I ordered that is when it got busy. I waited over 30 min for my sandwich just to get everything burnt on this thing. Yeah I wasn't going to eat that. Good thing I got a refund. 

My friends got the personal pizzas and thoes were slightly burnt as well.

Going to Boka was a waste of my time. Go at your own risk.
