_qA2HPqgLiBc-M4wRyml0g Good pizza! Its wood fired and very thin. It is soggy toward the middle and more crispy toward the crust which normally I dont enjoy, however the ingredients were very fresh which made up for the sogginess. 

What I actually enjoyed most was the ambience of the restaurant and thought it was great whether you decided to take a date or go out for pizza with a couple close friends. The colors used for paint are warm and the brick wall gives an inviting cozy feeling. Combined with the open pizza oven that you can see the fire, you have a spot that can make for a nice evening with someone special. 

There is also a cute little bar and I did notice they have a happy hour, so that would be worth checking into. We had a few drinks and got a pizza and salad and our bill was a reasonable $40.00. 

I would recommend this cute little place to family and friends!
