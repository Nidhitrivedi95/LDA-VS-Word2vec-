KtSEqZbGV1WHgOgtSMEZFQ We went with friends and it was a disaster.   They double charged us for one meal  they gave our friend the wrong type of drink. The steak was blue when I got it instead of medium rare.  When we asked the waiter how long was the dry aged steak aged for and how big was the piece he couldn't tell us.    My wife's pasta had shrimp that was raw.   The steak was clearly not aged as it was tough and stringy.    When I got home I immediately had to run to the bathroom. Never again!
