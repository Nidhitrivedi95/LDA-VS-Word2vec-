nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Fantastic, a MUST eat!!! The Caesar salad with melt-in-your-mouth croutons, the grilled cheesy bread appetizer, and the lasagna were absolutely delicious! Wife had the salmon and was thoroughly pleased with her meal as well. This will be my go-to Vegas restaurant for future visits, absolutely loved it. And that doesn't even speak for the service staff, they were absolutely excellent at what they do. Thank you for topping off and already fantastic night with Rascal Flatts!
