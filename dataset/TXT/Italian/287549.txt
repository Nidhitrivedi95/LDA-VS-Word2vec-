zluk4cL7Ch-uRlRply42ZQ Wow I was so close to b the 1st reviewer. Hehe

Awesome food - the standard menu is pretty boring so listen carefully to the specials. That's what we ordered. Starter was mussel - outstanding. We tried beef liver, pork chop and salmon. All outstanding. Waitress is very patient, not very professional but I can overlook that. 

Great atmosphere and certainly worth the money. Try it if u r in the area!
