wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg I got to stop in here recently for lunch while visiting Phoenix, and I was definitely impressed. Thankfully, I was with a large group and I got to sample a chunk of the menu because everything was delicious!

I definitely suggest starting with the bruschetta. The ingredients were fresh, and the portions were large. I also had the arancini and the asparagus pizza. It's hard to go wrong with the arancini, balls of risotto in a nice red sauce, and the pizza had a good crust and ingredients with the egg on top also making it unique. Add in some red sangria with this and you have all the making for an amazing lunch.

In addition, we had a large group and the service was always prompt and friendly. I'm so happy I got to try this place!
