G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I can describe this place in one word: heartburn, (but in a good way). This place is an oxymoron of several things: casually chic, warm simplicity, homey high-end food. We started with the bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese, and although I've had many before, these dates were scrumptious. My dish was a lemon lobster ravioli which was fine; I was expecting more bold flavor. But surprisingly, the star of the evening was the orange mocha. The best dessert coffee I have ever had. It's made with their house made orange syrup. I can't believe the coffee is what impressed me most. So much so, that my husband and I are going back to Giada's today, just for the coffee before we leave town. 

Overall, a very enjoyable experience.
