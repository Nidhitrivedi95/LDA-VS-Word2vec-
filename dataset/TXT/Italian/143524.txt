Gotta try the bruschetta. we did the sampler and all were great. I would have rated the steak as the best though. just so much taste on that little piece of bread!

the rumors are true, they will make substitution to portions of the mail, though our waitress failed at the game... the game is one of surprise. It's one of my more favorite games in rating a resaurant to see how well the cook responds with the surprise. Not so good this time. 

But I'll give them another chance next time.
