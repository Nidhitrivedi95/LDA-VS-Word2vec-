E0YuuRpK_4RpaUF7JK3mhg Best Italian food ever!! My husband and I went there tonight for our wedding anniversary.. we have been there before bc we loved It so much. We laughed at this person "jaden" below who wrote a bad review bc we enjoyed the same dish she ordered and It was PHENOMENAL and Marcelle the manager and daughter of the owner who she said was rude was nothing but AMAZING and her service was perfect and impeccable. Shame on people who try to talk bad about restaurants to get free things out of people who work so hard and present nothing but amazing food..or maybe others pallets are more advanced than others <U+200D> she should probably actually read the menu as well bc LEMON BUTTER SAUCE means lemon butter sauce and It was DELICIOUS!! I come from Los Angeles and was brought up on fine dining and amazing Italian food as well, I would recommend this to anyone and everyone i know. We will be back to celebrate all of our special occasions here and i hope everyone of you take the time to check this place out and there amazing food. Bravo! We love you guys and thank you Marcelle!!!
