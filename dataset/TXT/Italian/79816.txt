D2smJ2r0RrVoe0aGlT-2wA Had the rare opportunity to abandon the kids for the evening and go and have a night out with the other half.  I tried to book, but was told that they only have so many tables to book each evening and these were gone, so only option was to go in and wait for a table.  We arrived at 730pm Friday 28th sept 2012, told it was a 1hour 45min wait.  We decided to wait, the atmosphere was brilliant, the interior beautiful, I loved the loos, brilliant loo handle, so much so, I had to take a photo ( I must be rather sad, over come with excitement for getting out for the evening).  I think I made my way through half the cocktail list at the bar in the wait for our table, we also ordered 2 appetisers, during our wait at the bar.  The cheesy nachos dish was beautiful and then we ordered bread and oils, this wasn't so good, the bread was dry and required more oil, would have been nice to have a separate dish of oil for dipping.  The bread comes in a fancy small dish, 3 of our breads fell out on the floor, the waitress picked them up and walked away, and to be honest we were that starving from our wait I would have ate them off the floor.  I do think that we should have been given more bread, as the dish the bread is delivered in is not suitable for when waiting in the bar area.  But that is me being very picky.  We did get our table bang on the full 1hr45min wait.  Food arrived promptly that we ordered, I had the pasta arribbatta dish, was very hot and spicy, just the way I love it, my partner had the lamb, he said it was good but he has had better lamb kebabs ( I think that meant it was ok, but not amazing).  I think I will need to go back very soon, this time not so drunk just to check out that it was that great.  Overall I had a brilliant time, met my expectations, I loved the food and the building.
