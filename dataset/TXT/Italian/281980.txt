yxQsedCcjJEfqhC7u8Rl0A In town for one night on business, and found this place through Yelp.  I picked it since it seemed to meet my requirements of being classy but not stuffy and had some good looking vegetarian dishes.

I was right!  Our waiter was great, and worked with us to order a delicious 1/2 bottle of wine.  It was great, and impressed my boss (who is not easily impressed, especially when it comes to wine).  She had the veal and seemed to like it.  I had a mushroom ravioli and it was great.  The bread for the table was focaccia, which is always such a decadent treat (I'm a carboholic!)  We were stuffed so no need for dessert, but I left totally satisfied.  

My only beef was finding the parking entrance was a pain (had to pass the restaurant and pull a u-turn) and all the traffic from the construction (I was told Toronto is being built from the ground up) means it took us ages to get in.  But they were nice about it when we walked in.
