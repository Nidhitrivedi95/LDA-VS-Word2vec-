DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA Would give 0 stars if I could.  Owners are extremely rude.  My burger was as wet as a soaked sponge tried to send it back and old man said I was wrong and when he got to the kitchen the crazy lady that calls herself a chef said I don't know what good food is.  Do not eat here, I have never seen such chaos in a restaraunt.  Server girl was nice but left a cash tip and watched old man put the tip in his pocket what kind of owner steals from their people. Wow unbelievable.  Please close your doors
