5gv6AqHXfi3gJV4fb432Vw Great spot to eat good pizza and gorge on wings. I had a cheesesteak and it was what a cheesesteak should be, Cheesy and meaty. Best part: it was all halal. Because I am bound by dietary restriction, I had to find a restaurant where I could eat food fast and halal. I was on a tour around the country and so I had never been to Vegas before. The guys who work in the back of the pizzeria were the owners, and were really cool. Good food, good service, and a place to sit and eat. What more could a brother ask for? Will definitely come back here when I'm back in Vegas.
