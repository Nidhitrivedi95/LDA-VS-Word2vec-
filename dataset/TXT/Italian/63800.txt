bBGTy0iw4vXxq28zpTjsnA We had met up with the family for dinner here and were very disappointed. Neither the food, nor the service was very good at all and the attempt by the waitress to recover at the end just before tipping time was quite transparent and really too late. 
We ordered a salad, one order of spaghetti with extra fresh basil on top, a Calabrese pizza and mussels with garlic bread. 
The spaghetti came with pesto on top which the waitress insisted was basil, the pizza was actually quite good, the salad was similar to one that could be taken off a salad bar. My mussels initially came without any bread and when I asked about it, the waitress said it was being grilled. About 10 minutes later after the mussels were cold, She brought me 2 slices of absolutely burnt bread stating it was grilled. After I complained, and seeing that I was waiting, I was given a slice of non toasted plain bread. The sauce for the mussels was decent. 
I have and will continue to be under the impression that if I'm eating out and paying good money to do so, a restaurant should deliver on quality of food and service. It should be better than what you can do at home (as an untrained cook!). This place far from delivers. We won't be back. 
Total after tax and tip $112 ish
If we just got the Calabrese pizza and left, I may have had a different impression. A pity that this place gets a one star from me - I really did like the pizza.
