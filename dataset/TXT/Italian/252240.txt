VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w This place has the best Chicken Parmesan I have ever had. And this is my favorite meal ever and I have tried this at hundreds of restaurants! Wow, this blew me away. It was served as a huge portion in a square shape. Very thin, and creative the way it was cooked and presented. I am planning a trip back to Las Vegas in the coming months just to have this again!
