d4pEtorPeMPPHviFjzjvxw I went with a party of 4. The restaurant had great atmosphere, however it was empty except one table of 10. Instead of seating us in a quiet corner we were seated right beside the party of 10. Not one to complain we let this go. The waiter then came to take our drink orders. When I asked what beers were on tap his manor changed from friendly to arrogant. Instead of suggest ing one of the bottled bears the waiter stood there smugly. I than had to prompt him for what beers they had bottled. While ordering  our meals the waiter corrected us constantly. My wife asked for capers on the side of her dish. The waiter then lectured her on how the chef wouldn't like it and you would never add cappers to such a dish. Although he may have been correct. This is no way to talk to customers. The condescending manor in which he continued to address the table soured our evening. The meals were well prepared but nothing notable. They appeared to have a decent menu with several dishes that looked interesting. However due to our experience we will not be back.
