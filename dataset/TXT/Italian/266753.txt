The place is small and only has bar stools but the staff are super helpful and friendly. 

I went here with my parents and each of us had the Travelzoo coupon ($10 for $20) which was a definite steal. I ordered the Lobster Poutine (large) which was a good lunch portion and not super salty like many other places. They used crispy wedge-like potato pieces, which I definitely prefer over thin fries and there were also a decent amount of lobster pieces. The cashier recommended we dip our potatoes in their secret "fancy sauce" which had a unique, yummy flavor. My mom got the Surf n' Turf Burger which was a mid-size portion - the lobster pieces definitely complemented the patty. My dad got the Lobster Grilled Cheese which was a good blend of cheese, lobster and other ingredients with tasty bread - it was also a little sweet. Both their meals came with coleslaw which they raved about. We also shared a side of seaweed salad which was a good mix of seaweed and other leafy greens, though a little salty.

Overall food was fresh and delicious! Definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the Financial District.
