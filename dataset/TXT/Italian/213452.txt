r6I3Y_wUn8ncKs44vlqu-g Two visits during my week in Montreal. First time, I came in alone and sat at the small bar. A simple concept here, only pasta and wine, and the pasta Puttanesca, once it arrived, was excellent. The house red wine - also very nice. But I had to wait 40 minutes to get service because the single waitress was being over stressed and the maitre 'd (possibly an owner) could easily have served me herself but declined to do so, perhaps because "that is not her job?" Finally a gentleman from the kitchen, who appeared to be another owner, took my order and rescued me. But forty minutes; an unfortunate experience. 

Gave it another try - second time that horrid woman was not there, only the adorable waitress, Britney. This time, excellent in all ways. I recommend this place - unless you see that rude woman (fancy eyeglass frames), leave immediately!
