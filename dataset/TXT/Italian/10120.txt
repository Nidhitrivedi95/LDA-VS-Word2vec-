0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg This is hands down one of my favorite places. I love everything about it! 

The ambiance is very close and cozy, perfect for date nights or business dinner!! The staff is very sweet and they are always checking on you whether it's their table or not. 

The menu is perfect, they have a little bit of everything. For starters they have this amazing yellowtail sashimi and it melts in your mouth(one of our favs). They also have this short rib ravioli/pillow and that you must must get. I have never tasted anything more delicious in my life (we get it everytime). For their entrees they have this chicken and it's so tender and the skin is perfectly crisp.

Everytime we try something new and we are never let down! This place knows what they're doing! Can't wait to come back again!
