Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA The food is fresh and tries to be relevant. Maybe it is, but I would say that the pizza toppings are sparse, from what I saw. Every male patron ordered his own, bcuz they are not meaty enough to share. There is big business in bread, these days, I guess. The meatball sandwich was very good (worth ordering) and on good bread, not a big bready airy doughy roll-- we added grilled onion ($1). Good call. The drinks are good, but very weak and too small. Not worth the $12+++ and my small drink was $15 w a float of Grand Marnier which could not be detected. Salad had great dressing and was acceptable in size. I give a full extra star to our waiter DANIEL who was very attentive, attractive and accommodating--- he took care of us at every turn. :)

Again, it's Vegas...you pay generously for everything....
