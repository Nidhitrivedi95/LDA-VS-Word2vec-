GMriYorKj1v-dhhJ1om-Sg Being vegan, I was thrilled when NYPD began offering the Veganizza, and vegan cheese for custom orders. It is nice to have the option of ordering a pizza for pick or delivery now. It is a bit pricey, and despite only being 3.5 miles away, there is a delivery charge of $3, which I think is excessive, given the cost of the pizza. I do like that they have a record of your last order for easy reordering, but given I get a custom sometimes, I would like to see a better record so that I don't have to go online to go through the options again. That being said, for anyone plant based or with a dairy issue who doesn't mind a higher price for pizza, I would recommend it. I have never eaten there, only utilized pick up or delivery. Drivers have always been courteous.
