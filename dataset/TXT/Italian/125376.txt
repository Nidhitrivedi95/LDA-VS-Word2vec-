Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A What a great restaurant.  To say the service was impeccable would be an understatement.  It was fairly open when we went and we decided to eat in the bar area.  Our server was fantastic.  He was definitely educated in the wine, drink and food, which is nice because he answered all of our questions.  The Agnello Ravioli was excellent with the Sonoma Lamb, which I order against my first thought of the highly recommended Voodoo Penne.  I would definitely go back.
