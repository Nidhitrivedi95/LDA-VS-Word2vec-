These are personal pies, indistinguishable from Café Porta Alba's (their Hilldale sister location is pricier) and comparable to Pizza Bruta (which is a bit drier, more floury). Some other review will say more about how they use some quick-fire 90-second oven whatever, but the result is a really balanced margherita. (Though sometimes the cheese areas are really small in a sea of red.) I'm also always so surprised to see the staff so perky and welcoming compared to other Madison-area restaurants. And I appreciate it! They appear to have a fair amount of lunch traffic and everyone sitting is always cheery. I don't get it. They must not work at the university. This is the (personal) pie to beat on the west side, at least until Sal's moves out here.
