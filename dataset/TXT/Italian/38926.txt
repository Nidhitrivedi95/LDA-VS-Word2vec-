7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA It was our first time here. I came with my family and we ordered wings and the spicy chipotle pizza. The wings were good, but the pizza was amazing!!!! We also ordered a brownie a la mode. It was okay. The brownie wasn't warm and it wasn't too much ice cream. If the brownie was better, I would have gave it 5 stars.
