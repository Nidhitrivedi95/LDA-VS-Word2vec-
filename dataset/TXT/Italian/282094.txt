The lights above the tables are super low and annoying since they came right at eye level. Place was loud so it's hard to talk to people at your table and see them with those damn lights. I was really really hoping this would be good Italian food but it just wasn't, especially for the price. One of us got the fettucini alfredo and it  was gooey with overcooked pasta. My tortellini pesto was so RIDICULOUS! It had so much damn sauce that I could barely see th pasta. It was literally swimming in it. I'm not hard to please but I couldn't even finish it. I'm not sure why they thought that was okay. When I told the server about it she just asked if I wanted it boxed up. I would have preferred a refund but she wasn't having it. Such a waste of money. You might get better Italian food from a frozen dinner.
