It is hard to respect a restaurant that serves cold butter in foil packets, not olive oil. Service was very slow, despite it being not that busy for a Saturday night. Had to wait a couple of times with empty waters, even had to flag a different waiter to top us off. The calamari was very good - tender, not greasy, and just a light dusting of breading. The meal took forever to arrive, despite being just a salad (DRENCHED in dressing) and an entree. The main entree was cold, as was the plate. Clearly the plate had been sitting in queue for some time (I had a hunch since the folks who came in after us, a party of four, were served first, and attentively at that). My mother voiced the complaint to the owner that the entree was cold but he barely seemed to acknowledge - he seems to be flighty and not that accomodating. Might want to up your customer service skills. Fountain Hills has far to go in terms of reputable, delicious dining establishments, but I had thought this "gem" would continue to be a favorite.
