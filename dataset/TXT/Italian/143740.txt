Still, in the name of trying new things, we tried a brunch with friends at Bella Notte a few Sundays ago.  They do make a decent bloody mary, which is a good start.  I ordered a couple slices of pizza with various toppings and my date ordered a calzone.  My pizza came out cold and her calzone was piping hot from the oven.  Like some other reviewers have noted, if you order things that take different cooking times, you can expect some things to be cold.  Their kitchen can't seem to get it together enough to present all the food at a reasonable temperature.  If I go back, I'll try order something that takes a long time to cook like a calzone.  Or I'll just go to Primanti's.
