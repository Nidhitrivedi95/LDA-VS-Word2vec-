WtkzllWKYCEmN85E7fMBUw Great wings & Pizza! I've been coming here for about a year now, and love the food. It is a small business, so of course their prices are a bit higher.. I often get 12 wings for 10-12 bucks here, and am never disappointed. My fiancée loves the pizza and since making this my regular spot for wings, we have moved about 10 miles away.. The distance isn't a factor when it comes to quality, we'll continue to come here, support the small business.
