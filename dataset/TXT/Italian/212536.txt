r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA Saw this place on diners, drive in's and dives. Guy made it look really good. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but twice now I have just been lukewarm on this place. Got a sausage sandwich, roll was hard and way too much red sauce. It was a mess and not the good kind. The pizza was average nothing I would crave.
