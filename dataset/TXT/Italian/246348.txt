uzpdcxvlKx5BuoWU3NRHbA This is the first ever review of my life. Guess what made me do it?
ordered chicken piccante with calamari. ABSOLUTE DISASTER
everything from ingredients to way they cooked them.

chicken was THIN, DRY, OVERCOOKED
they use tiny squid for calamari, it was also THIN and DRY. the calamari easily cracks into pieces (yes, the meat inside is so dry it cracks and breaks). it was kinda like fried beef jerky but more bland. I suspect they use fridge dried squids.
The sauce for piccante was bland, as if made out of some power mixed into water.
The garlic bread was unbelievably soggy. No doubt they were microwaved.

I really feel sorry for the restaurant to write this review but it was easily the worst italian food i had in my life and have to speak out against people who think food here is even remotely okay. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. maybe it's the atmosphere of the restaurant that deludes them into thinking food is good. I can't speak on that because I had mine delivered by Mr Delivery. But speaking strictly on the food itself, it is really really really really bad for it's price.
