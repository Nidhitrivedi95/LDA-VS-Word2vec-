BnuzcebyB1AfxH0kjNWqSg We frequent Carrabba's in Frazer, and enjoy the food.  Most of the time, the service is good.  Upon arriving tonight, we asked to sit in the bar but the hostess offered to seat us either at the bar itself or at a high table, citing something about a rotation.  Fortunately, the manager, Brett, interrupted stating "they can sit wherever they want", and we were seated in a booth in the bar, as we originally requested.

The food was good, as always, as was the service from Ashley, who was also the bartender.  Throughout the meal, Brett stopped by a few times to ensure everything was to our liking.  This extra attention certainly wasn't expected, but it was definitely appreciated.
