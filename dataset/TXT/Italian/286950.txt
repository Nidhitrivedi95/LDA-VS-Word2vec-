Zja7ykq3icDzkN20XX6j1w Being disappointed by one of their neighboring pizza places, I went in here not expecting much better, but I was wrong.  This was one of the best slices I've ever had.  I'm so glad this place is right around the corner from me.

(I still wish these places took credit cards, though.)
