Wow, I was wrong!!  Ambiance is everything you expect from a Strip resto -- seductive and stylish, modern but comfortable... the list goes on.  The wine was fantastic, as was everything I ordered (read: tuna 'susci;' their special pasta of the day made with squid ink -- app. portion, if you please; and the branzino... WOW!) Didn't think I had any room for dessert... but made room for heaven when it came to the table -- the zeppole was all that... and then some.  Service was sometimes slow, though the servers themselves were extremely knowledgeable about the menu and were quick to make suggestions once given info about preferences. Love this place and can't wait to go back!
