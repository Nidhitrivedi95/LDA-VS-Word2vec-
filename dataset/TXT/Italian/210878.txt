qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ Casanova Bros. is the best pizza in the East Valley, bar none.  In the 10 years I lived there, I never had a better dining experience.  The food was excellent, whether I ordered pizza, pasta, a calzone, it didn't matter - it was awesome every time.  And they truly do treat you like family.  Tony, Mike, and Louie set the tone and make Casanova Bros. a true East Valley treasure.  Give them a try and you'll be a regular here!
