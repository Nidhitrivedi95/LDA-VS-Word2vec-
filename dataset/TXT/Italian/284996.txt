zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g DeMarcos Pizza provided us with a lousy,cocky waiter from Rhode Island, who said his name was Luigi. Mr. arrogant never refilled our ice tea, never brought our request for bread, for our salad.  We had to ask the bus boy!  We sat in front of the kitchen. Albert the manager was there, he knows me, and barely spoke.  He did however sit at other guest's tables! The best part, my girlfriend used he debit card, and the waiter brought back his copy waiting for his tip to be added.  I left a lousy cash tip, which he did not deserve. He then told us to go to U-Swirl a few ft. away for desert, laughing at us.  I want Las Vegas to know this restaurant lacks manners and class.
