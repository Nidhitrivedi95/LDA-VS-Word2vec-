nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g The main problem with Terroni is that it is unbearably pretentious. It's one of those places where you are not to disrespect the menu with your request not to have mushrooms on your pizza, despite the fact I have hated mushrooms my entire life. The servers also act like they are somehow indulging you by doing you the honour of the delivering food right to your table. It's like they went and took the first 10 people they found on Ossington, put them in a restaurant and asked them to serve a bunch of investment bankers. There is also some guy "spinning" (I put spinning in quotation marks because he uses a Mac and iTunes, although it is a very complicated looking set up) during lunch. But hey, I'm sure that the bankers from RBC really appreciate his latest Jay-Z/Journey mash-ups while they talk business. 

There are some good things about Terroni though. The food is pretty decent, even if moderately overpriced, and the location is pretty cool. If you are looking for Italian downtown over lunch Mercatto on Bay is a much better bet. However, there is no DJ at Mercatto and your server might not have cool plastic framed glasses with no lenses, but if you are able to get past those flaws the food is really good..
