Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw Seriously mixed with this review.  First off, the food was fantastic.  But my goodness did we have to wait F-O-R-Ever to get it.  Not just us, but the four or so other tables around us.  We all must had waited around 30 minutes to get food after ordering.  The table next to us didn't even get a menu for ten minutes.  

I'm gluten free so my boyfriend and I stopped here because I was excited about their gluten free pasta options.  When I ordered it, the waiter warned me it would take at least 25 minutes to cook so I thanked him and got the chicken kabob instead.  Our food still took over 30 min!  Luckily we enjoyed each other's company and the food ended up being really good.

I saw the staff running around the whole time not being effective.  They couldn't prioritize.  One guy was tending tables and another just folding a huge stack of napkins.  Then the waiter came to us (party of two) with four salads.  I told him it's not ours and he insisted it was and put it in my face.  I said "No salads!" three times then something clicked in him that made him realize it was the wrong table... Why would we have two salads each??

Besides service this place is really good.  Just don't expect to be there for less than an hour even if only five tables are filled.
