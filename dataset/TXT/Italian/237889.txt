u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Having lived at the Central Postinos last year, which was my home away from home, I ventured East hoping for the same experience. Well, while it was okay, I will not say it met my expectations and I will tell you why. Big plus" Live music. Another big plus: Expanded beer selection including domestic beers in bottles. The food just was not up to par with Central. The Cranberry Walnut Chicken Salad, our old fave, lacked Gorgonzola and had WAY too much celery. too little chicken and too may herbs. The apples in it were the size of a gold ball (OK, I am exaggerating, but not much). It lacked finesse. I know the weekend chef may have been new, not skilled, whatever but come on, this is a nice place. We had a Panini which also lagged far behind the Central location. Lacked flavor and the pepper spread was not as spicy. The salad we ordered had almost no dressing on it, which I know is an easy fix, but COME ON this is not a young place...upscale crowd and décor. Great wait staff. They were not the problem. The beer was not the problem. But they should take their kitchen staff over to Postino Central for some training.
