-b-waFIsc6BJdXWOJMRKEQ We were here on NYE which might explain the slow service, but the food was also nothing to write home about. The best thing was the mocktail from the bar. 

I tried the rack of lamb that came with a small side of pasta. The pasta was totally over cooked. Nothing worse than overlooked pasta. It was so mushy and slightly cold. I was rather disappointed. I'm surprised by all the positive reviews on their food. Lamb was probably fine, but can't remember much about it.

It took over 3 hours to get our appetizer, entrees and desserts out. It was abysmal. Who wants to eat dessert at 11pm? I get they were swamped on NYE so i still left it at 3 stars, but really, this should not be acceptable at any restaurant.

anyway, i wouldn't try it again but it's edible.
