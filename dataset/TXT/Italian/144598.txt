k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ We love coming to this family owned restaurant and being served by its awesome family of local workers. The service is amazing (especially our excellent server today Morgan) and the creative rotating menu. The consistency and the quality food is unmatched for lunch. Literally, it is the best lunch in town. Please don't read this review and come for lunch because parking is limited and  we want to keep coming. Jk. But seriously.
