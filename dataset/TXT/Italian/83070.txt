dHgbL5EAEawIcqk6aXe2Ow I would give this place zero stars if I could. Calamari was greasy and totally overcooked. Thought I'd get the fettuccine Alfredo because you can't mess that up, right? WRONG! The sauce was watery and tasted like bleach. Service was not great. Watched a waitress have a conversation with someone while
pouring water out of a pitcher onto the floor. Would never go back again even if someone paid me. Wasted $60 on hot garbage
