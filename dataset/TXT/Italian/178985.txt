nsw3tlB-hwz4KbPYcuaSww So delicious!  The menu was so exciting that it took me awhile to choose a pizza - they all looked amazing.  I had a pear, Gorgonzola & arugula white pizza and it was great.  Fresh ingredients and am amazing brick-oven crispy crust.  Loved that the owner walked around and introduced himself :)
