VeRHiEbUe_vHprYn8mnezA Since my family of four returned from Florence over Christmas 2016, we had a craving for Bistecca alla fiorentina (Steak Florentine).   Franco comes closest to replicating the dish here in Phoenix metro area.

Pasta is also lovely.  Best way to enjoy the food here is to share.  Order a starter, a couple of pasta and a few meat dishes.  Enjoy with friends and family.

We have celebrated many birthdays and anniversary here.  Brought a few out of town friends as well.   After dinner, take a short walk to water front and enjoy the cooler evening.

Price is reasonable given food quality and services.   Wine price is also quite good.
