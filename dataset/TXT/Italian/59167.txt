ARWLV46iIa3Dvt1y8-SPpA Great food and service with a friendly attitude.  I have been eating here for many years.  The food is consistently good and prices reasonable.  Yes, they only accept cash.  Also, they don't serve alcohol, but you can bring your own.  Lunch, dinner or take-out:  you can't go wrong with Giuseppe's.
