I used to come all the time and now I'm completely writing it off after a 4th time of having horrible service and long wait times. Oh, and if you think ordering take out will help, don't bother. Ordered 4 house salads and ONE pizza to pick up, was quoted 10 mins for order to be ready and ended up going in and having to wait an extra 30 mins for order to be complete. Lost a long time customer since this location has been open. 

Also, if someone orders a bottle of white wine, it should always be put in a wine bottle bucket with ice for the table to keep cool.
