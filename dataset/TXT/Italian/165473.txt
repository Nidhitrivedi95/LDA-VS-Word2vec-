m6rffQy85HUq82DjLq-YJg We go here regularly. Raised in an Italian household, it's hard to find a good Italian restaurant that compares to that good old home cooking. Regarding the food, it is always delicious! No matter what you order it'll be great. However the three stars is due to inconsistent service. There is one guy there that is wonderful. (He's normally bartending). Every time we get him I know we're going to have a great time. However every other server that we've had is rude and acts like it's an inconvenience to service. Even one time I called in to get a quote on a catering order. We were looking to serve about 120 people. It took the GM three days to call me back and then acted like it was a giant pain to take a catering order? I placed the order with Grimaldi's instead. Unfortunately, their service is more often bad then it is good. I suggest getting take out from them.
