4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg The two issues here are food and service.  
Neither were especially outstanding, despite a hefty dinner bill. 

Admittedly , we were a little early for our reservation.  When they seated us at the bar, we assumed it was just until our table was ready.  However, it seemed they intended to serve us dinner there.  This would have been fine except there were some loud bachelorettes at the next table.  No problem,  when we inquired about this they seated us in the dining room.

The food and service were ok.  My issue is that for 50 plus dollars per person, we expected a little better.  You can get the same food/ service at a Macaroni Grille or an Olive Garden.  I understand this is the Vegas Strip, but still....  The Wynn is a higher end resort.  I would not go out of my way to dine here again.  

If you are in the mood for Italian food, definitely check out the Sinatra next door at the Encore.
