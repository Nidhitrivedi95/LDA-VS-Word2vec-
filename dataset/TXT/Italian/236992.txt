tYbK94fl50os3h_RjpY4gw Moved to the NW last year and I have become a big fan of Roccos. The pizza is great with a full amount of quality toppings on each slice. You can choose pizza by slice or small medium and large. Pizzas are massive so choose wisely unless you want to take some home for later.

The menu goes beyond pizza and I am looking forward to trying the wide selections of pastas, soups, and breads. Roccos also offers Italian Gellato is also available to complete the meal. Soda, milk or juice for the kids, and a decent selection of beer or wine for mom and dad. Roccos is much more than pizza.

The dining experience is enjoyable at Roccos as well. A recently expanded dining area with added tables, arcade and small play area for the kids and flat screen TVs add to the family atmosphere.

Customer service is small town like, something rare in this city. Employees have paid for arcade games for my kids, given us free garlic bread as we waited for the pizza, lets us taste the wine and other warm gestures. They make you want to be generous with your tip!

In conclusion, after reading this review, you are now informed enough to not choose Domino's!
