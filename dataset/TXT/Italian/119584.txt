H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g I wish I could give 2.5 stars.  

Jim G. and I frequented this place when it was Enoteca San Marco.  Even when we previously enjoyed this place, we recognized that this was a snacks, wine, dessert kind of place.  We were never blown away by the dinner plates.  Now, with the change, things seem to have gotten worse.

We started with a salad we had loved before, the Buratta Pesto Caprese.  The cheese is excellent, as are the pine nuts.  The pesto was lacking and the tomatoes were stewed instead of fresh! What?!?! Weird.

We also shared some Verdure: Olives (plentiful dish of olives), Lentils Alla Toscana (always solid), and Eggplant Caponata (decent).  Our server had to use a rolodex looking device to explain the Caponata to us. She better have been new; she was slow, inattentive, and not too bright.

We shared a pasta and a pizza.  Both bleh! We had the Rigatoni with Pork Belly and Swiss Chard, and cheese.  How is it possible that this dish has no flavor whatsoever?!?!  One of the most boring dishes ever. What a waste!  We also shared the Sausage and Peppers pizza.  Terrible.  It says Pizzeria in the name!  Sausage was bland, pizza was apparently salt free, and the sauce was flavorless.  Waste of time.

I did not expect fine dining here, but damn, this was disappointing.  Usually Batali places offer a minimum of quality.  Otto is sad. Too pricey for such mediocre food and service.
