X3-ZauIT8o2tcoBHjYUKFw I will preface this review by saying I come from a state known for really good "mom and pop shop" pizza.  I am picky. Keep that in mind.
My husband and I relocated to Pittsburgh recently, and are on the hunt for a pizza place. This is our second attempt.  It was not bad.
The crust was pleasantly sweet and only slightly too chewy. The toppings tasted fairly fresh. We found it to be pretty oily though. I shouldn't have to wipe my hands every time I pick up my slice.
The pizza was ready in a timely fashion. We opted to go pick it up rather than risk overly long delivery time.
