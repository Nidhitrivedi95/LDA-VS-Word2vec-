zgGoxOsThXKAcs2lAgC9yg My husband and went here tonight and I have to say, this was the most amazing dining experience I have had in a very long time! Our server Hailey (same name but not me hahaha!!) was absolutly wonderful! She was so genuine and sweet! She was having a rough night because of another table and she never let that get in the way of our service! My drink never went lower than half gone before she had another drink at our table. She is so amazing!  I also had the pleasure of meeting her manager, Mike. You can tell he really cares about his staff and has complete control over his resturant. I had to call him over to gush about Hailey and you could tell he was very proud. I will forever go to Buca! The food was amazing and the staff is outstanding!!!!!! If I could give a rating higher than 5 stars I would!!!
