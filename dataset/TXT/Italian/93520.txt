Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag I've been to a few of Wolfgang's restaurants on the Strip, and this is ranked somewhere in the middle. Nothing remarkably memorable, but nothing that left a bad taste in my mouth either. We shared the octopus appetizer, prosciutto pizza, and the veal ravioli. All three were solid dishes-- the octopus was grilled nicely and packed a good punch with acidity and flavor, the prosciutto pizza had a good chewy crust and flavor, and the veal was tender and the ravioli itself had a good bite. The veal was definitely the highlight. We also got a fruity rum cocktail that was pretty good too.

If you are around the Crystals, a good option. Otherwise I wouldn't make this a destination stop.
