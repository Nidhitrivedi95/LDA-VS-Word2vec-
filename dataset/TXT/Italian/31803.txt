5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ This place sucks.  Ordered the simplest thing, an 18 inch with mushroom and pepperoni.  When calling to place the order, they asked cash or credit, and we said cash. After over an hour, this smug delivery guy shows up and asks for 21.50.  All I had were two 20s - and he only had 6 dollars in change!  He didn't even apologize or try to fix the problem, just gave me a smug look and took 34 dollars for a 21 dollar order!  Real classy.

And the pizza was cold, greasy, and generally quite awful.  Super stingy with toppings.  

Avoid this place at all costs.  An absolute rip-off that makes a sucky pizza.
