viji5rHhNlsy9w-JmUhyaw Had a long wait time but they gave us a wine menu and told us it would be half off for the wait which was awesome . It was super busy but the waiter was very efficient with everything he had to get us and was always checking up on us to make sure we where happy . My food was delicious and came out fast have no complaints here
