wRVuPNdzTrlXC7m_CHac9g This is a pretty good restaurant and would recommend it if you want a decent meal before heading to the Playhouse. I came here with a couple of friends before watching a movie in the omnicentre just down the road. I ordered the Pizza Mamma Roma which came with asparagus, cheese and ham. I thought that the food tasted pretty bland, but the prices are reasonable and you do get good portions of food to ensure a full tummy.
There are a huge amount of dishes on offer at Mamma Roma, and me and my friends only ordered pizzas there, so perhaps their food has more flavour in some of the other dishes.
The decor is pretty nice, but is tainted by the fact that they seem to be playing up to the stereotypical Italian features and gives the place a cheesy feel to it.
