Huge portions
Big enough you can share 
I am a big guy who eats and I am not able to finish my pasta dish
Expensive to eat there but portions are huge

Left money once on the table cause I did not need change and left.
Sometimes waiting for a waitress to take of the bill can take awhile! 
You know to pay for my meal and left tip.
Was chased down in the parking lot for not paying!
Is there a rule that states I must pay at the counter? And check your table before jumping to conclusions.
It is a sit-down establishment so I don't see the need for the counter unless you need change but hey 
Small problem just a little annoyed is all
