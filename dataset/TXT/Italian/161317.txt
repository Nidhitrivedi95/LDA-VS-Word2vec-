Keep in mind this is a pizza joint. This isn't 5 star dining. They have a juke box, a bar, beer, and pizza.  FAN-TASTIC. It's in Mandalay Place next to the burger place.

I got the truffle white pizza [$18.95] and antipasto salad both were delicious. Friend got gnocchi and calamari both very good.  Thank God we made a reservation b/c b/w this and the burger joint next store there were 20 people or so hanging outside waiting to get in and seated.  We got there around 7:45 pm on a Tuesday night.  We walked right up, told the girl my name, and sat right down. Service was outstanding!  I can't say enough about how much they checked in on us to make sure we were doing ok. And like 6 difft people. One guy brought our apps, another guy brought our wine, another guy took our order, another person brought our food, all the while the waiter was making sure we were doing fine w/ every round of food.
