Y-hmtitiRfg7vmc3N-lTww Every single item we ordered was bursting with flavor. My family agreed this was the best meal we've eaten in a long time and the best Italian ever. 

To start, we were presented with a bowl of flatbread brushed with herbs and olive oil and garlic knots. We knew with the first bite that we were in for a quality meal.

To drink, I ordered the house Pino Grigio and my husband ordered a porter on tap. 

We ordered the calimari appetizer. Perfection. Fresh, not overly chewy, and bright with marinara and a squeeze of lemon.

My daughter ordered a bowl of kids pasta, penne and marinara. She enjoyed it thoroughly.

My husband had the seafood linguine and was ooo-ing and ahh-ing with every bite. 

My son and I shared the white pizza with creamy parmigiana, artichoke and spinach. It was magical, especially with lemon drizzled on top.

For dessert--we should have but we did--we ordered a slice of the chocolate cake. It was very rich and not overly sweet. It was a little dry to be honest, but that didn't stop us from eating it. In hindsight we should have tried the cheesecake.

The service was exceptional. Everyone was so friendly. We were even brought a bit a pizza dough to play with! My daughter thought it was a little silly but we got over it and played with it anyway. 

It's clear that this establishment has a lot of pride in ownership. From the decor, to the service to the food. This is a five star place!
