RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ Bravo! Clap clap clap. People usually choose between Mineo's and Aiello's in Pittsburgh, and I'm a Mineo's fan! Why? Simple: EXTRA CHEESE. The pizzas are essentially the same to my amateur palate, but Mineo's dumps EXTRA CHEESE onto your pie. The crust is also far superior to Aiello's. Mineo's crust is flavorful, chewy and not dry. The sauce is a little sweet (edge to Aiello's on this one) and I think they must get the cheese from the same seller, because both are deliciously salty, but Mineo's just puts on more. YUM. VOTE MINEO'S AS BEST ZA IN PITTSBURGH :)
