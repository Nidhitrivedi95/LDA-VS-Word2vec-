BcLFIr4wtd3GQ3fnz15yDQ Delicious meal with so many options that I want to go back and try!  I had the linguini and mussels and it was very tasty and satisfying. The atmosphere feels like you might have stepped in a true Italian bistro.  It's a very relaxing atmosphere and the staff are very attentive.  If I had to give a slight downside I would say the food is a la carte (dinners don't come with salad or bread) but honestly the quality is there.  I will be back!
