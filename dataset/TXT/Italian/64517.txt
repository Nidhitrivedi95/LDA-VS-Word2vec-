BgAV4IwXkd8gpuyUJX2wnQ This is truly authentic Italian food and reminds me of Little Italy in New York City. Our party had veal piccata, lasagna, lobster ravioli and the calamari.  All were delicious. Service was excellent and and the atmosphere was lovely. Great place for parties of six or less.Owners are very friendly and accommodating.
