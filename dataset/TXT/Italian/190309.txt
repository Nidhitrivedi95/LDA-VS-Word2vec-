P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw Some of the worst customer service I have experienced! Was told pizza would take 20 minutes waited 39 minutes! First time their first time ordering, person taking the order very impatient and had an attitude. Place is kinda dirty. Pizza was good but they're stingy with the ingredients mostly bread. Would not recommend or go back. There is better pizza places in Las Vegas. Owner need to redeem his name and work on customer service and be more generous with the ingredients
