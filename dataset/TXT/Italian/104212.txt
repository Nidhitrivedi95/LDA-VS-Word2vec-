FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA I've gone to this location a couple of times for brunch and the Monday & Tuesday night specials. I thought that the brunch menu was alright, nothing special. However, the $20 wine bottle & bruschetta plate deal is a definite must!! I'm personally no a big fan of bruschetta, but I enjoyed my night here just relaxing with some friends after a long day. There's seating indoors and outdoors. The vibes are chill. I can't believe I haven't gone back (will definitely be going sometime soon as writing this review made me realize how much I enjoyed myself there).

Parking can be hectic because this location is in a hotspot in Central Ave near a bunch of high profile restaurants.
