u_s0zWoTlX7PoYDjtKAK2w My boyfriend took me to Toci's while we were waiting for Sonic's happy hour. He raved about the lunch special. You get 2 slices of pizza and a drink for around $5. The slices are huuuuge! Great place if you're feeling hungry but not feeling like spending a lot. 

The default is cheese but bf got pepperoni on his (not sure if there was an upcharge). The slices were thin-crust, but still super filling. 

It certainly isn't gourmet or the most healthy choice. If you're the type to dab your pizza with a napkin, prepare to grab a few extra napkins. But if you're craving yummy, greasy Brooklyn-style pizza, this place will hit the spot.
