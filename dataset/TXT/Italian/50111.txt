Food wise pretty good.   We started with the fried calamari.  It was tasty except it comes with a homemade like sauce and not marinara.  Overall a bit spicy but not ghost chili hot.  Then got 2 pizzas, the prosciutto and then an artichoke with olive and ham.   Tasty, crust had some nice burned/charred flavor, pizza cooked well.  Enjoyed it overall and if in the area we'd return but wouldn't go out of our way.
