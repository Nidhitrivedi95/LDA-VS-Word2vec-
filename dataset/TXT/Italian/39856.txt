7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ AMAZING. Stopped in here after a show. The ambiance is beautiful and simple. Lighting is perfect. We had perfectly made martinis to begin. Charred octopus was cooked wonderfully with a nice limoncello char. The beef cheek ravioli is not on the menu but they sound like they have it often. It was so delicate and rich at the same time. The steaks look amazing, although we did not have one. Desserts were fantastic and the wine list is absolutely out of this world!!!
