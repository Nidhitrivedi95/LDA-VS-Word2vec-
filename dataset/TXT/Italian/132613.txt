IkLAUX7lZIWqE9_YC66SRw I love this place... Food is awesome... Been eating here on average about 3 or 4 days or nights a week since they opened.  What can I say, I'm from NYC and I found a great NY Pizza Restarunt in Scottsdale. I'm not even going to say NY Pizza Style Restarunt ... It straight up tastes like your eating Italian food in NY except without having to defrost your car for 15 minutes to get there. 

The staff is great, friendly and fun. Antonia at the bar is a friend of mine, She gets me my drinks... Well not for free, but she gets my drinks and is professionally fun. 

I'm not a wine drinker but "Wine Wednesday"  1/2 price bottles of wine draws a fun vibrant crowd and I always have a blast meeting the guests. 

My name is Rob ... You should come on out and maybe you will get to meet me. I will be the guy wearing a "Be Blessed" shirt ... but if I'm not here the fun staff will be ready to make your experience great.
