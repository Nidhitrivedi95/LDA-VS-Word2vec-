AuOkeVkc38UaZeq-u14dCg I was very happy to get away from the chains at the local mall and find this place.  It was recommended by a local and delivered all I hoped for: good quality food, nice sized portions, and fast service.  The chili was decent, salad was fresh (try the chunky blue cheese dressing) and salmon was very tasty.  I'll be back again.
