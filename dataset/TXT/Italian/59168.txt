ARWLV46iIa3Dvt1y8-SPpA We love Italian food, so we try lots of places. This is one of our new favorite places. We had antipasto salad, eggplant rollotini, chicken parmigiana and canolis. All of it was great. We picked up the food and didn't eat there. They were so nice! We wanted zucchini parmigiana,  but he told me that they were out of zucchini.  He said if I bought zucchini to them that they would make it. That was amazing!
Nice people.  Great food. The canolis were heavenly. Try this place. You won't be disappointed.
