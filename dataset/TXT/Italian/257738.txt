w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A Success has gone to its head. In the past the steep prices were worth it, the pizza was excellent. Now after much notoriety the crowds have caused this one time gem to become complacent with regards to its quality and service. The other night was the final chance for us and Metro Pizza. We placed a take out order for the "Metro" and arrived 40 minutes later (time as quoted) to pick it up. The pizza was burnt badly and they had tried to cut off the burnt sections, in fact many slices had no crust at all. When brought to his attention, the manager did offer to remake the pizza (we'd wait another 30-40 minutes for it),  and when pressed he offered a free 2 liter of soda. We left with our burnt pizza (no pizza is worth a total wait of 80 minutes) and something to wash it down with. Considering the Metro with one topping cost about $25 bucks with tax, this was the last straw.

With so many excellent pizza places in the valley that are vying for customers, I hope Metro decides to shape up and get back to the quality that made them a staple in Vegas.
