pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA Had the crab/shrimp panini w/the side salad...both were delicious but the panini was supreme. The bread tasted homemade and the portion of tasty seafood inside was fairly generous. Wasn't the biggest fan of the chocolate soup for dessert but it was interesting to taste! Fyi We sat outside and there were definitely some interesting characters walking by. One approached a table...
