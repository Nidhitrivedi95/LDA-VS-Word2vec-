MLQeuiL9rqOq_rDKGEcU0A Cute and cozy restaurant off the beaten path (Parliament Street just south of Wellesley).  Friendly and welcoming staff each time I have gone.  Servers are attentive, knowledgeable and sometimes chatty, but not overbearing.  I sometimes do feel like family when coming here since it's so comforting being there with home cooked traditional Italian comfort food and I'm not even Italian.

On a recent visit, we sat on the patio which was called the Extended F'Amelia and what a lovely area.  It felt like we were in someone's cozy and relaxed backyard. It truly felt very zen. Plus great spot for people watching in the neighbourhood, almost felt like we were the neighbourhood watchkeepers.

Decent wine selection with varied prices and we managed to order a bottle that suited our budget.  The menu selection was varied and there's something for everyone with reasonable prices.  Everything was fresh and flavourful, plus plenty of free bread that kept on coming.  We had the flatbread and the rosemary bread which were so good that we just ate them as is.

The pasta was not quite as delicious as previous visits since it was a bit on the dry side, but I still managed to finish the dish since it was still tasty.

If you want a restaurant that isn't in the busy neighbourhood and on the quiet side, then F'Amelia is for you.  It was definitely worth a trip to Cabbagetown for this hidden neighbourhood gem.
