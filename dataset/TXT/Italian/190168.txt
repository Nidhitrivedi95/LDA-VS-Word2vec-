P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw Best Pizza I've had in Vegas!! bar none, hands down. Wings were hot yet eatable, Been living in Vegas about a month and a half now and this place has it all from good music playing, very chill environment to eat some great food. I  would give it a 5 stars only if they added more beer on tap.
