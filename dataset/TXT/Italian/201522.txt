PZ-LZzSlhSe9utkQYU8pFg Sometimes when I go to an older place like this I have to decide if it is a run down dump or if it authentic and charming.  Carluccio's has the old school charm!

The place is by the now derelict Liberace Museum on east Tropicana.  I am guessing it has been here for 20-30 years which is a long time by Vegas standards, so it has some history.  The place has brick walls, old school burgandy colored booths, custom wood door, dark wood in the bar area and I loved the black and red tiles in the bathroom.  

It has a bar area, restaurant area and we sat in the atrium area at a table.  The hostess and waitress were very friendly.  

The menu was typical of a Italian joint.  The prices seemed reasonable.  I ordered the meatballs and sausage plate.  It was a large offering with a side of pasta.  Very tasty - the meat sauce was right on!  I tried a friends chicken parm - that was tasty.  Huge servings at reasonable prices!  

Carlucio's is so not corporate and that's why I really like it!
