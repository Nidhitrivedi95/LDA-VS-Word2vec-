They take it really literal at this club. No cover charge and was able to bypass the long ass line that extended to the cold outside. Free drinks. Grabbed about $35 flying dollar bills. Pooled with other friends, we had a net gain of around $50+. Hm, that sounds like a good deal. Needless to say, I was ELATED! Used it for taxis and tips. WIN. Get a promoter. Yes, even you groups of girls! Much faster and less frustrating to be walk in with a promoter than wait mindlessly in lines. 

There is a lounge/restuarant/chilling area with a bathroom on the bottom floor. You have to climb a couple of flights of stairs to get to the loud, and I mean LOUD (the volume had our ears RINGING- it really could have been turned down a LOT), dance floor. I lost my shoe like Cinderella during this plight four times. Then there is a pretty..bizarre row of sinks? Then comes the dance floor. 

There was a HUGE crowd because there was a convention earlier that day, slightly an older crowd I guess. The music was pretty good, but like I said, way too loud. Joined a table, so we had a bigger space to dance. The bouncers were a little mean and was very anal about having me put on shoes. Sigh. They were really particular about having a portion of the VIP section unoccupied for people to walk? Idks! Obviously they have never worn heels before. But other than that,  a very fun time. The "shots" that the staff were making were DELICIOUS and FRUITY! Not quite sure how much was alcohol, but it was the girly-est and most delicious shots ever. 

My highlight is still the flying dollar bills. Oh Vegas. You are so funny, sometimes.
