VxgjMl8tQrT4idJW_z8daA This was the first time we visited a Carrabbas after receiving a gift card. It was a Saturday night so fortunately they allowed us to call ahead and wrote down our name. From the moment we entered we were greeted and the staff were friendly even being completely packed. Once taken to our table the Mgr told us the history of the business and promised she'd do whatever she could to make us happy. We ordered drinks; I opted for the blackberry sangria & it was amazing. I'm not a big pasta fan so I ordered a house salad and side of asparagus; they were even nice enough to add some mozzarella cheese to the asparagus for me! The server was awesome! He was funny, attentive, and helped clean up my daughters mess after she spilled her soda. Another thing that is interesting is the kitchen is open so you can watch the food being made; no microwaves! The place has a great vibe and the only reason I gave it 4 stars are the price. The food items seemed a little steep for the quantity but @ least they give you bread and dip while you wait for your food. We'll definitely be back... but probably during happy hour.
