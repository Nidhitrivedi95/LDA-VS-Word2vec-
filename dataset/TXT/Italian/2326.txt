-PUPEpMsjBjk_rX5lFaWng This review does not address their pizza, which I haven't tried. Went there with a group of friends, ordered and shared lots of food. Bottom line: Great atmosphere, great wines, great appetizers, great desserts, so-so salads and friendly service (even though they forgot one of the sides we ordered), but the entrees ranged from fair to poor. The sauce on the lasagna and eggplant dishes tasted burnt, and the eggplant was sliced way too thick to be flavorful. Eggplant Parm or Rolatini is not for the lazy chef who doesn't have the time to do the painstaking preparation. The worst was the linguini in white clam sauce. It tasted like somebody dumped an entire container of peppercorns into what otherwise might have been a good entree. Consequently, the mild taste of the clams and pasta was completely destroyed by the flamethrower heat of pepper - NOT what linguini with clam sauce (red or white) is supposed to taste like. (What is this? Mexican-style Italian?!) Pesto's is fine as one of those trendy wine, appetizer and dessert bars, but for a real Italian meal, it leaves a LOT to be desired. They might also consider having waiters offer fresh grated cheese (Even the Olive Garden chain does that!)
