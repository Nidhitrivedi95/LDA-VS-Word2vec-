SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg I love lago! I have been here twice now. 
We waited a short amount of time for our reservation. Our table had a great view of the fountain which is a plus. My passion fruit mojito was delicious. This place is small plate restaurant which makes it very easy to share many plates. We ordered the ceasar 
salad,bruschetta,pasta,polenta,and 
meatballs. The only dish I wouldn't order again is the ceasar salad. 
The meatballs and polenta are always my favorite.  

I would come here before a night out but not for a romantic dinner the music is blaring which makes it difficult to converse. The music selection is Edm and house music which I enjoy but not so much for dinner. Our service was attentive at first but slowed down as we got to the end of our meal.
