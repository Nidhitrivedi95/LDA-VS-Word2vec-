jaicRYvLNQKT-iquYQ1wAA Living in Brampton there is some limited choices when it comes to Italian food options.  Don't get me wrong there is excellent Italian food here, but there is some that are just standard Italian fare...  This is one of these places...Canelli's is centrally located in Brampton (Queen St and Kennedy) in a strip mall.  

The restaurant has a patio, which is a rare sight to see on the busy retail industrial district of Queen St, it is also nice and spacious with lots of seating.  Large or small parties shouldn't be and issue here.  Open kitchen style with full view of the service area.  Service here is good...friendly staff and acceptable service.  I have been here twice as my wife's mother likes the Caprese salad.  Price are in line with most restaurants in the area and portion sizes are quite good.
  I have had the Risotto Verde (spinach, roasted red peppers, red onions) which was quite good and very filling and the Manicotti..lots of cheese and tomato sauce baked in a modest portion.  Lasagna, Pizza, salads...pretty much the standard fare.  If your palate is hankering for some Italian food with good portion sizes and resonable prices..Canelli's might be what your looking for.
