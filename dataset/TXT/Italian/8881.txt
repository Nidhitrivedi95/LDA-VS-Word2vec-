Located in the Northwest on Centennial Center Drive north of Ann Rd, so it was close to home.  You order at the counter with a menu or you can follow there steps on the menu board.  Pizzas and salads are made right in front of you  as you walk the line.  Margherita pizza as choice one or white pizza with no sauce just olive oil, plus toppings.  Additional topping's are just $1 more for each.

We went for the Margherita 10 inch with and Arugula salad. Dough ball shaped right on the pizza peel with plenty of flour for easy release.  Once pizza was prepped into the wood burning oven for a quick.  Microwave pizza is not even cooked this rapidly.  Crust came out perfect with a sight char from the hot oven.  
The sauce had a slight tang from the real tomato sauce.  The fresh basil and real chunks of mozzarella melted and blended nicely.  

The arugula salad was pretty tasty as well.  Topped with artichoke, marinated mushrooms, mediterranean olives, and shaved parmesan cheese.  Drizzled with a balsamic dressing this salad did not last long for the whole family.  

One unique feature was the silverware like forks and knifes on the table in a little jar.  The self serve plates on a separate table was another interesting touch.  Novecento also serves gelato for dessert.  If you check in on Yelp while at the location you can have a complimentary cannoli.  Yumm! I love being a member of the club for these awesome little perks.
