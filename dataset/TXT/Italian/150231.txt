KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ I first had RAOs at an Epicurean event and had to try it again.  I had the ravioli purses, which is what I tried at the Epicurean, and it was just as good as I remembered (I am still thinking at it!).  The meatballs were huge and delicious as well.  I would come back again and again for those two things!
