LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA I usually come to Maggiano's if I want decent Italian food. Not anything amazing like you would find in other cities. I have noticed that the only difference of lunch and dinner are the prices but the same portion? Very interesting. Usually the lunch portion would be way smaller but I really could not tell the difference. The party/family style is definitely NOT worth the price. I do admit that Maggiano's is probably not even comparable to Bucca but still they overprice their food too much when I could probably get the same thing at a small family owned business. It doesn't help that it's on the strip. The service is great! Make sure if you go on a holiday or a very busy weekend to make reservations! The portions are great but the quality...hmm....I'm the type that prefers quality over quantity.
