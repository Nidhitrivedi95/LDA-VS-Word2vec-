fFKkuE9hB7g98xATUfMkiw I've been coming here for years and that porchetta sandwich is to die for. For $10 you get a massive, freshly made to your specifications sandwich. Simply bursting full of flavor. 

The Thursday I was there at noon was madness! Long lineup but it was moving a great pace. 

They also had steaks, and other dishes as well. Great place, great food, tough at times for parking.

PRO TIP: get there before noon ;-)
