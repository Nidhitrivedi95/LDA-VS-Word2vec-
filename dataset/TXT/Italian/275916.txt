yBGqf8l9NOM3vZFnlxcgzQ Used to go here years ago for good Italian when I noticed the now defunct The Standard was going downhill. Seems Vivoli is also on the way out. 

Service was actually quite good. She checked in multiple times but was not intrusive. However, the same cannot be said for the food. We ordered an antipasto platter that had some meats (hot salami, prosciutto), few cheeses (Asiago, Parmesan, and Gouda), bruschetta, the pesto linguine, primavera, and penne a'lla vodka. 

The platter was disappointing, the bruschetta was atrocious - could hardly call it bruschetta. I've had better at Milestones. The pesto linguine was disgusting. Incredibly oily - it was as if you were slurping oil. Could taste nothing else. Primavera had carrots in it which is odd. Penne a'lla vodka was fine! 

Years ago, Vivoli was quite good and I am sad that has fallen off so hard. Little Italy itself is nothing like it used to be.
