DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA Went in with an open mind, Was very impressed with the food, had the sweet and spicy pasta rustica and My fiance had the gnocchi with basil, she loved it... Sammy was very friendly,  didn't get to meet Amy,  must say it was nothing like what was on kitchen nightmares. They must have changed the menu, If the food was the same when the show was filmed I must say I have a different outlook on Ramsay (huge fan) cause there was nothing wrong with the food. 

Will be definitely going back, highly recommend
