yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w Pretty awesome place next to the Linq!! The food is good and the place itself has a ton of old school charm !! You get house wine , awesome cheese bread , salad or soup and a great selection of Italian food .

The service was good and lighting is perfect ! Been here once before and had a chance to bring my wife and mom for dinner and walked out being stuffed !!
