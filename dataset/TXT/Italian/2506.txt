-raUM9T-1dKPiB5_vRmFYA Let me put it this way: my doctor would give Luke's one star. 

Put another way: one meal at Luke's costs approximately one year off your life span. 

And despite that, I love this place. Thankfully I have enough self-control to avoid going more than a couple times a year, which was greatly aided by my move from a downtown firm to Scottsdale. A bunch of my coworkers, all male of course, would get cravings for this joint and despite our better judgment head down and scarf down our fill of the most delicious, greasy Chicago-style hot dogs and sausages you can imagine. One of my friends was from Chicago and he has certified its Chicagoness. 

A female friend once wanted to join us, as we were headed out one day. She asked if they served salads. We must have laughed for ten minutes straight. 

If you're allergic to the Chicago Cubs, stay far away. The decor will kill you, assuming your choked arteries from eating here don't first.

EDIT: In case I didn't make it clear, and without getting Lukes into trouble with the EEOC or something... I really can't imagine a girl coming here and actually liking it. Any girl who does would probably scare me, a lot. So, while I'm sorry that Patti B's experience here was "awful" (lol!), that pretty much confirms that Patti is in fact a normal gal.
