- This was my second time there. We ordered the trout fish and Fusili. It was just two orders and it took them more than 1 HOUR to bring us the food. That was not pleasant, since we were starving by the time they brought the food. However, it didn't happen the previous time we went to Ciao. Maybe some sort of one time mistake.
