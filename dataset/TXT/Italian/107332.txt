FXiPQQGr_2bwlJ4wOrW2eA Where do I start?  Park in the back parallel with Summerlin Pkwy for an easy entry.  Weather permitting, sit outside as it is beautiful.  They have a great wine selection along with yummy cocktails.  Great selection on the menu.  We started with the Signature Chopped Salad.  It's presentation is really nice and tasted even better.  Anytime there is avocado, I am a happy camper.  I had the Ribeye and it was cooked to perfection.  I thought I was at some high priced steakhouse.  My wife had the Veal Milanese, she said it was fantastic.  We split the sauteed spinach and enjoyed it very much.  For dessert we had a sampler plate and nearly licked the plate clean.  The service was impeccable and to our surprise the Chef came to our table to thank us and see if we enjoyed our meal.  Prices are very reasonable as the quality of the food was top notch.  I love that we can have a high end meal close to home without having to go to the strip and even better is that you don't have to actually walk through the hotel to get to this restaurant.  We will be back for our anniversary in 3 weeks, reservation is already made.
