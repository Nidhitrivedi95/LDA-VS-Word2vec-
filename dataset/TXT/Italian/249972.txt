vL17CsjB1PsGgo3F-kppkw My favorite pizza joint in all of Vaughan.

They deliver hot and fresh, and their pizza is just amazing. The Gourmet (with bacon added) is the perfect pizza IMO.

We've ordered here many times, including for birthday parties, and the extended family has always been impressed.

They've messed up a delivery order once or twice but when we call them they are super apologetic and immediately correct the issue.

Love this place, they have a customer for life. 

(To be fair I've only tried pizza, I can't comment on wings, sides, etc)
