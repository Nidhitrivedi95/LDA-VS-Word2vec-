HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA New Items for this Visit:
A' LA VIE Pizza - Butter poached Lobster, Foie Gras Drizzle, Bourbon Maple roasted Chanterelles/Maitake Mushrooms, Butter roasted Lobster/French Horn Mushrooms, Roasted Garlic Sauce, Italian Parsley
Gelato - Chocolate, Asian Pear-Pinot Grigio, Juju-Honey

Call it good fortune or simply a matter of spending too much time on Facebook, but when Christopher Palmeri posted pictures of raw ingredients offering a free Pizza to whoever named all five first it seemed a no-brainer to take a guess, the answer of Foie Gras, Lobster, Lobster Mushrooms, Chanterelles and Maple Syrup winning one free sheet served up piping hot the following day at Naked City Pizza on Paradise.

Admittedly a fan of Palmeri and his Pizzerias, the location on Paradise still the most well appointed and family friendly with even more kitsch including the Jon Secada Poster and old Family Photos decorating the walls on this visit than prior, it was with another local Chef that a party of two sat down Friday afternoon to indulge in the "A' LA VIE" Pizza, the music of Elvis Presley playing overhead a perfect pairing for Butter Poached Lobster, cubes of Foie Gras, gently cooked Mushrooms and Garlic Sauce on Naked City's puffy Crust lightly topped in Mozzarella.  

Recently taking on another challenge as a Gelato maker, the ownership of two restaurants plus an express location, consultation at Bacon Bar and gigs at both Baseball games and the Speedway clearly not enough for hard-working Palmeri, it was with the whole sheet of Pie polished off that three samples of Naked City's first run were tasted, the Juju-Honey a bit icy in terms of the texture while both the Chocolate and Asian Pear-Pinot Grigio were beautifully flavored and silky smooth, even though the Chef stated that the freezer is running a bit cooler than he would like it.

*****Always taking chances and usually coming up a winner Naked City Pizza remains a quintessential part of Las Vegas' dining regardless of location, though the place on Paradise remains the most well appointed with the recent addition of Gelato giving fans or first timers yet another reason to visit.
