oH6QAuoTLFaX97oqqpLTMg This is a place that without Yelp, I would have never tried.  I have driven past it hundreds of times and never given it a second look.  I guess you can't judge a book by its cover.  While nothing to look at from the outside, the pizza was good.  While not the best pizza in town, it is one that I would be happy to eat any time.
