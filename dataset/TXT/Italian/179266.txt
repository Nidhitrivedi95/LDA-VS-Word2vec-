NUHNLaMg7aMesMdAiie73w This is Italian food for hosers, with not even an attempt at authenticity or hominess.  I'd give it one star but the service was reasonably polite.

As for the rest:  Atmosphere is nondescript and boring.  The bread was pasty and machine-cut and served cold with little packaged butter containers rather than olive oil.  Bruschetta was on the same icky bread and had way too much onion.  A Caesar salad had lettuce that was reasonably fresh but appeared to be sliced with a knife rather than torn and cheap tasting dressing that seemed like the kind that comes out of those little plastic packages at fast food restaurants.  An order of penne arrabiata was not spicy enough and was seriously overcooked.  Eggplant parmesan was not bad tasting, but in no way authentic  It came with a side of mushy looking frozen veggies and nondescript linguine.  Manicotti was rubbery and tasted like they has heated up some packaged frozen stuff and bathed it in sauce.  And speaking of sauce, it tasted like sour and cheap bottled pasta sauce without the slightest attempt to dress it up.

Better leave this place to the existing patrons who seem to crowd it.  My Italian housemate noted that there was not one face, either among the staff of the patrons, that actually looked Italian.

This place might get by in some small town where the word Italian is pronounced eye-talian but I think in Toronto one can find much better offerings.

Laura T., you CAN do better at home.
