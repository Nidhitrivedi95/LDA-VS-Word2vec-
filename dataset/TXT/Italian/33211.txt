5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA It was just great! I went with my friends from Los Angeles for NY Eve. Made reservation through Yelp! website.

Food was great! I had Cioppino - other than could use slightly less salt - perfect with beautiful view. My friends had Pasta, Salmon and Cioppino with Rizotto added, etc.

Highly recommend and will be one of my favorite Italian Restaurant... Great view of Las Vegas Blvd...
