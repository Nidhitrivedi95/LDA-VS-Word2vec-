oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw We had a table for eleven people and the service was better than excellent. We brought in a large bottle of wine (an Imperial) which they decanted an hour before our reservation. 

We ordered a wide variety of dishes, all of which were superb. The only minor exception: the Tuscan bean soup had a bit too much garlic, but overall everything was near perfect. I would rate this (and particularly the pasta dishes) above Babbo in N.Y.C. If there's a better Italian restaurant in Vegas, I haven't found it.
