Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg This is my absolute favorite pizza place here in Las Vegas. I've been coming to this chain since my college years (90's) so the decor has changed from kitchy (think Appleby's and TGIFridays- since renovated) to a classic rustic italian restaurant with numerous tv's playing sporting events. My favorite pizza is the Gotham- sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms.I've had other pizzas here but I no longer choose the road less traveled. My husband introduced the Gotham to some out of town friends- they loved it. I've had the eggplant parmesan sandwich and the calzone- which are excellent. They're both too big for me to finish, so plan on leftovers unless you wanna split it with a large party. The calamari appetizer is very good and worth mentioning. The service is really good. You get fresh warm bread and butter while you wait for your pizza or entrees. I am so glad that this place, even with its popularity and loyal following, still participates in the entertainment book, with numerous coupons. Also worth mentioning the huge pizza (30"?) that you can order to go, as well. Also, there are specials like the "50% off pizza between 2-4 pm" on weekdays only.
