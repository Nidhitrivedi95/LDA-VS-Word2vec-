wxzG81ZyWpBje_mU4aFLaw I ordered a 9 inch pepperoni pizza and a chopped salad to go. If I had a spare moment and if I was 21 it would've been great to sit down at the bar and order a drink or two. When I got home to grub I had to warm up my pizza in the microwave a bit. Had I eaten at the restaurant it would've been more amazing than what it already was. The salad was great as well. Not too much meat and the amount of dressing provided was perfect. I would definitely take a friend to eat at the actual establishment and enjoy a nice afternoon with great people.
