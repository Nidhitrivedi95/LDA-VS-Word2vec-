Z072pEHdos2Gjj3nMdR6uA I cannot stop raving about this place since I enjoyed dinner there Tuesday night 7/24. I had the best experience customer service-wise that I have ever had in a restaurant. My server was amazing, the food was delicious, and the decor was point on. It was a beautiful restaurant and very romantic! I liked that they didn't want the guest to have to lift a finger save feeding yourself! I will definitely be back and would like to commend every person working this past tuesday night for the excellent service. I was really impressed and have told anyone who will listen about how great you guys were. Each person working went out of their way to ensure we were having the best experience possible and it worked. Thank you for making our date night a night to remember!
