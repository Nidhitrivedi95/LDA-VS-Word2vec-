9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw I've never had a bad experience at this place.  And it is so quaint and wonderful.  I go probably for the atmosphere more than for the food (although the food is wonderful as well).  My one thing would be that because I try to steer clear of pork, maybe more chicken or fish plate options might be nice?
