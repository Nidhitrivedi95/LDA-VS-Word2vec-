G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q the decor is fabulous, elegant and timeless.    her name is on everything which is a nice touch without being offensive. the location of the restaurant overlooking the center of the strip could not be better !    high marks for service and the bread course which was unannounced and spectacular !!   I've never been given so many choices of things to spread or sprinkle onto my bread products !     the drink menu and food menu were very descriptive and everything sounded delicious !   we obviously couldn't try everything but what we did try was very well done, with one exception.   the "drunken goat cheese" was unexpectedly thick-ish slices of  hard cheese in the nature of Parmesan chunks with sons odd tasting crunchy things sprinkled on it and a small amount of a balsamic mix sauce on and under the cheese.     for dessert I had the limoncello soufflé which was outstanding !   service was excellent from beginning to end and the pricing was fair considering it's fine food in a celebrity chef restaurant in a casino on the Vegas strip.    5 stars !!
