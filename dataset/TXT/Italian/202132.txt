q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Great food and an amazing experience. The only thing that was a bit annoying was that we had to wait a while to get our check. Our server was no where to be found when the dinner was ending. Luckily the experience was so amazing it didn't take away from the night and out server was apologetic and hold us she was helping in the kitchen. When with my family and each is us got something  different. Everyone's plate was amazing!  High recommend!
