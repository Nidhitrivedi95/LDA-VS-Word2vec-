wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg Oh Grazie, how I love thee! I have been going to this restaurant 2-3 times a year for 15 years now and it has never left me disappointed! The staff are friendly and engaging (especially Jack!) and the Goat-cheese appetizer is a MUST FOR EVERYONE! 
I finish it off with the delicious Tiramisu Dessert and Cappuccino and my night is perfect. 
Great location, great food, pricing is a steal for the quality you get. I can't say enough good things.

GRAZIE!
