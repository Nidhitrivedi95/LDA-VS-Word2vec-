8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA I was in the mood for pizza and Amore served it up with great service.  I like this place and not just because I love Da' Bears!  The bread is baked fresh daily and plentiful, and I was able to order sausage and peppers as an appetizer.  As for the pizza I recommend the Margarita specialty pizza that comes on thin crust.  This is a casual place that does take time to prepare your food as everything is made fresh and to order, so for those that complain about the wait might want to bring better dining partners so the time can fly by as you wait.  I will come back as much as my diet allows, but it's worth every minute of extra time on the treadmill.
