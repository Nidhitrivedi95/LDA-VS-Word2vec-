You come here for the staples - antipasto salad and spaghetti with meatballs.  The drinks were pedestrian (expected) the bartender was obnoxious (entertaining) and the service was frenetic (it isn't CUT people).  All that said we got what we ordered in a timely fashion and it was really good.  It was the cheapest meal I've had in Vegas in like 10 years and very satisfying.

You don't come here for your big meal out if you are expecting great service and a romantic dinner.  Do that somewhere else.  Do this because you are hungry and don't want to break the bank.
