3awTUGMdUVrwEBkFFOxn9Q I am not going to talk about the food in this review. The food is just fine. It is great quality, well prepared, and exactly what you expect from Italian American restaurant. What I do want to comment about is the service. You are walking into their home. Fran and/or Jimmy will greet you at the front desk. My server, David, recommended food items as if he were going to eat them himself. I knew it wasn't because they were going bad and the chef wanted to make sure they got moved. He did not steer me wrong in anyway shape or form. Conversation with Fran and Jimmy as I left felt like I was in their home, They had invited me for dinner, and we were having after dinner conversation. It was fabulous! I can only hope that if they ever travel to Washington DC that I will have the opportunity to host them at my house the way that they hosted me in theirs. Go for the food, but definitely go for the service!
