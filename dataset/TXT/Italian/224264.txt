SMTMAaGjUfsefp9RIIfQmA Loved the ambiance of the place, it has a warm, family feel to it. I loved the spahettini with crab & salmon roe and my friend loved her pasta too. The service was great and very friendly. We had tiramisu for dessert and it was good, only thing i would suggest would be to put less cocoa on top because there was so much of it on top that it takes away from the enjoyment of the dish when the cocoa powder gets into your throat and makes you choke up, Lol Overall love it! Just less cocoa please
