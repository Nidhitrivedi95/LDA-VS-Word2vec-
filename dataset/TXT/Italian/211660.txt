R_epGBO7Cr1M0Ftc0JKV7w My wife and I wandered in by accident last night to this new Italian/tapas place. We were greeted by enthusiastic and knowledgeable servers. My wife ordered the osso bucco, which was phenomenal. I had the chicken parm, also excellent. Happy to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood that cares about its food and customers. Will be back for sure.
