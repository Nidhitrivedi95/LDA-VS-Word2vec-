LMdUoR00jPxQDWLYRq93FA Disappointing. Party of five to celebrate my mother's birthday. we chose the tasting menu. We were prepared to take our time and enjoy our evening, but after two hours we had only been served our second of five courses. We let our server know of our concern and she promised to expedite things. Another twenty minutes and we finally received course number three - at least an hour between courses.

It would have been tolerable if the food was excellent and if the service was impeccable. No such luck. How many times must the service staff need to be told that we would prefer to finish the food on our plate before it is taken away from us?  And the food quality fell far short of what one expects of a restaurant at this price point. 

At the conclusion of the meal, there was no acknowledgment by the chef or by management of the poor service. We have eaten in fine restaurants throughout the world and have enjoyed tasting menus at many Michelin-starred establishments. The only way in which Quiessence could be compared to one of those is in the price.
