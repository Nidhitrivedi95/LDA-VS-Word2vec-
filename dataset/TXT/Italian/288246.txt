ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw Walking down the street of Cleveland's Little Italy you are bombarded by the smells of pizza and the sights of fresh pastries. So when we were tasked with the decision to choose one of the greasy and meaty smelling places I relied on my boyfriend, and so Mama Santa's was chosen. 

We walked in and there was a long line (maybe 14 in front of us), surprisingly we only had to wait 10 or so minutes. I thought this place was small but there seems to be tables tucked in every nook and cranny. 

We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, onions, and pepperchinis on top. We also ordered some homemade noodles and meatballs since the Yelp tips were informing us we should do so. I sat, waiting for my food, mentally preparing myself for the carb-overload/coma that was probably going to happen. 

The noodles were okay...AHH! before you yell at me keep in mind I am not a big noodle dish fan. But as far as noodles go they tasted very grandma and homemade-ish--which was good!

The pizza on the other hand I can properly vouch for! The crust was amazing! I think there was an extra garlic seasoning on it. It was on the thinner side (more NY style if that is better for you to understand). What made this pizza unique are the toppings, everything was diced up, so the onions and pepperchinis were diced and every mouthful had its fair share of toppings. Yummmm, cue mouth drool. 

So if you are in Little Italy, this is a definite safe bet on getting some mom and pop Italian food and service!
