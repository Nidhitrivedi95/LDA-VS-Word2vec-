Meatballz offers a casual dining area very similar to the location in Scottsdale, with the same menu, and in fact I think there's substantially more seating at this location because of the back room.

If you don't go with the lunch special you could be looking at a pricey lunch.  My cheese ravioli with small soda was $13, and this is a pay at the counter sort of place.  Warning to health conscious and vegetarians - the "tomato sauce" is really a meat sauce.

Food is above average if you're grading it on a fast food scale, but falls behind if you're grading it on a casual dining scale (Bravi has a similar setup, with a nicer atmosphere, and arguably better food).

Plenty of parking... which I love.
