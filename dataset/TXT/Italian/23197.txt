Being an Anglophone in Montreal can sometimes be a challenge at some restaurants. Depending on how willing the server is to communicate in English, you could get the perception of poor service. I would have to say from my experience that Roxanne is an excellent waitress.

They have a prix fixe option for lunch which includes a choice of soup or salad, a main for under $20. The veal parmigiana was good, as was the minestrone soup. It's hard to tell whether there was too much salt in the food as it tasted fine.

Upstairs they have a banquet type seating for 30-50 people. I gather they host large crowds upstairs. The upstairs and washrooms appeared fine to me so I'm not sure what the other reviews found so disgusting.
