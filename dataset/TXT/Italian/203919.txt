Q9jOi1245KEyb-vehMUeFA HUGE portions. Chicken parm - you get two large breaded cutlets for the chicken parmigiana dish and a very generous amount of spaghetti. Spaghetti and meatballs - large portion of pasta with a few meatballs, delicious. The sauce is sweet, but it's homemade and fresh. 

I loved the garlic knots/balls and warm Italian bread and butter. We have enough salad for a couple of days. Basically you will leave here with lots of leftovers. Prices are fair for the amount of food you get. I recommend for a casual homemade meal dining in or for takeout. 

Oh! and we got a calzone with onion and spinach - ridiculous to think we would be able to eat this, tried a bite and it was definitely good - I recommend if in the area.
