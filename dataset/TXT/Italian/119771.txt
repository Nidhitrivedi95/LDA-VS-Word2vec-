H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g It had been a dream of mine to dine at Mario Batali & Bastianch's fabulous Italian restaurant Otto Enoteca Pizzeria in 
St. Mark's Square at the spectacular Venetian 5 star resort since I saw photos of it on Foursquare,  Yelp and on their Web site. 

I took my friend there last night as an early birthday present to myself and everything from the Caprese Ensalata appetizer with creamy homemade mozzarella to my main course of Ravioli Brassata, to the wonderful French bread dipped in the highest quality balsamic vinegar I have ever tasted with  extra Virgin olive oil, was fabulous.
 Our 2 waiters were knowledgeable and knew how each dish was prepared, which added to my appreciation of each dish as well. The atmosphere was truly breathtaking as well and hearing the opera singers, who were very talented, was a total extraordinary sensory experience!
