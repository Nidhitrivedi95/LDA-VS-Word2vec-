8pmGz3Lg4f_r7HdDZPa4dQ My fiancé, a friend, and I came here looking for a New York experience and we were not disappointed. The pizza was cheesy and the type of "grease that'll run down your arm," as the owner liked to say. Vinny, the owner, is from Brooklyn and was an incredible and personable host. I'd say he was half of the New York experience, the other half being the atmosphere, the constant traffic, and the delicious food.
