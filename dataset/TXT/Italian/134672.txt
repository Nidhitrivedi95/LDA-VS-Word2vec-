So waited excessively both times. Took a long long time for seating and service. And it was only Third full.
Then the food arrived after another anxious 45 minutes. 
The pizza was limp and soggy. And really not that tasty.  The salad was dry. The appetizers were cold. 
We came for a birthday celebration and everyone felt slighted(there was 8 of us)
Fortunately the beers and drinks came fast and plenty. But really folks, you should get it together. 
None of us will be returning. Enter with caution.  2 stars for drinks only.
