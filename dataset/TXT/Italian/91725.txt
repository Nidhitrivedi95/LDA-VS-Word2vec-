Een2yret0IwJUpHLwcxtRg This place is delicious! I loved the original aranchini! I studied abroad in Sicily and when I tried their aranichini it brought me back to living in Sicily! 

The archini house had four varieties to pick from including a vegetarian option. The aranichini is a nice size and reasonably price ($4.50). The staff and owner were very friendly and the restaurant was very clean! I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in trying something new! We will be back!
