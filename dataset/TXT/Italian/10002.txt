0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg My girlfriends brought me here for my bachelorette dinner. Our server Titus was awesome and they had a pretty decent wine list.

The food fell a little flat for me. 

The complimentary bread basket was phenomenal. My favorite was the focaccia with prosciutto.  Bread came with three different spreads: whipped butter mascarpone, eggplant caponata and a lemon infused olive oil.  Thy were all delicious but I especially enjoyed the eggplant caponata.

I ordered the Wagyu beef tartare as my appetizer. The beef wasn't as red as I would've liked it to be. It looked brown but I couldn't tell if it was from the bad lighting of the restaurant. The dish had no flavor and I basically had to force myself to eat it.

I ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli with a marsala reduction for my entree. I like that they make their own fresh pasta but the dish lacked the debt of flavor you'd expect from the components of this dish. It was like waiting for a climax that never came.

My friend really enjoyed her pea soup but the other girls didn't really rave about their dishes. 

The desserts (I forgot which ones we ordered) were great! We all definitely enjoyed that. 

The restaurant's decor is okay. It's somewhere between modern and classic. The lighting is really bad... Or good if you like it on the darker side. I like being able to see my food when I eat.
