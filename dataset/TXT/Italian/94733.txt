"A few days ago at College Street Bar, an establishment located in the College and Manning neighborhood, Gavin MacMillan owner and Carasco Enzo Dejesus an employee, gave a 24-year-old woman illegal drugs and alcohol inside the bar.
She was forcibly confined in the bar and sexually assaulted. Both are charged with forcible confinement and sexual assault according to Police."
