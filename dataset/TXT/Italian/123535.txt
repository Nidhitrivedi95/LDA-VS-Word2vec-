hlSj3nHeSNHujnagbWXlhg The Beaver Dam Benvenuto's - the original location - is wonderful. This one is a bit so-so (much like the Northside location). My food was alright: lobster ravioli. Nothing amazing, but tasty enough. The rest of my party (4 others) all had nice meals, but none of us were amazed. Desserts were lackluster. Service was very good, but the tables are overly large and it's really dark. I had trouble reading the menu.  A decent meal out with the family.
