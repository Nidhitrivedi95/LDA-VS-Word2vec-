r9g8h_NCbZFgmqTMuokaew Very bad customer service at the door
The lady asked us to wait , I tried to talk to her, for the first time in my life I got the hand "wait"
Then finally when she turned to me she said ( though half of the restaurant was empty) we are overwhelmed and YOU HAVE TO WAIT
the worst ever costumer service I have seen
they should at least learn how to deal with costumers before-working there
