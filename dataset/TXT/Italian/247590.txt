VBcmyBxAPcpzbbnPbFfttA I'm kind of shocked by the reviews for this place. We should set expectations upfront. 

Takeaways:
- if you like to customize your food, don't go here.
- if you like wine to cost under $12 a glass, don't go here.
- if you want wine from California, don't go here.
- if you don't want to give your business to a restaurant with a bunch of rules, don't go here.
- if you want 15 separate bills, don't go here.
- if you can't eat bread without balsamic vinegar, don't go here.
- if you can't eat "Italian food" without a good smattering of powdery Parmesan cheese, don't go here. 

Phew.  I hope that helps a bunch of people who might otherwise write more angry reviews because they fall into the above categories. 

Go here if:
- you want to eat an interpretation of Southern Italian food the way they eat it in Italy
- if you want to explore Italian wine
- if you like a chic and bustling ambiance and beautiful decor
- if you and your friend can settle up later or pay your one bill on a bunch of different cards
- if you're not a self-entitled dick who wandered by from the Eaton Centre and who thinks "providing good customer service" means a restaurant does what you want though you have no qualifications in either running a restaurant nor Southern Italian food

It's cozy & romantic & rarely disappoints.

I vastly prefer this location to the noisy Adelaide space.  The new(-ish) Rosedale location (Bar Centrale & the upstairs) is also quite nice.
