HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA Great tasting and visually appealing pizza. The service was slow since only one young lady was servicing the whole dining area. My wife and another lady with us ordered wine, but they were out. That was a bit of a bummer for them. Overall, 4+ stars on the food and service was about 2.5 stars. We'll be back next time in Vegas.
