XPLSNGSClW8gR5BTcvyOhQ This was my first time at a Buca di Beppo and I have to say that I was impressed.  The food wasn't the best Italian food (and probably not the most authentic, either), but I enjoyed the aspect of sharing that the restaurant promotes.

Between eight people, we shared four small dishes and two salads, much less than the waitress-suggested four large dishes and two salads.  The entire party was quite full at the end of it, so I'm glad we got the small sizes.  One of our party had a birthday and they made an effort to make it fun for her.

The interior was a bit confusing and I got seriously lost on the way to the bathroom, but that's okay.  It's also a little intense on the eyes (read: gaudy).
