The staff was super nice and friendly, and they work hard and fast. When I got there, the line was out the door, but they moved through it very quickly so don't get escared.

I recommend this spot if you are in the mood for some good, quick pie.  It's not expensive, and you get a good amount of food. I look forward to returning.
