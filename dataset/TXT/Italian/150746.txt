klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw We accidenTally ordered a steak slider from the lunch menu thinking it was the same as breakfast steak and egg slider featured on food network.
They were so accomodating and chef made the breakfast slider - no questions and they did it quickly.  They were worth the short wait!!!!
We are so happy with the food and Service.
