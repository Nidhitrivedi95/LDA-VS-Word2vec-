3q8MtOEIJ6nC7kVv_8Mfgw Best lasagna in town. Small, dark intimate atmosphere. This is one of my favourite date spots on the King West strip. 

Staff are a bit cold, making the place stuffy, and I haven't tried much on the menu cause I keep picturing myself licking my lasagna plate time and time again. Hence the 4 stars. 

Can't wait to return.
