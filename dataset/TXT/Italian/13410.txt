17Q4bVyFLxAJiht0lHdj-Q Went here for a little last minute outing with my co-workers. It's not bad. The hostess was very polite and friendly. Our waiter was really funny and helpful/knowledgeable.

I ordered a sangria and to my surprise it was actually good. I wanted to try something different and normally I don't prefer red wine, but this wasn't bad. I also ordered the chicken with avocado sandwich. It sounded good when I was reading it on the menu, but it was pretty bland. There wasn't salt and pepper shakers to sprinkle on my sandwich, but whatevs. I still ate it just cause I was hungry.

Atmosphere is nice. It wasn't that loud to the point where my co-workers and I couldn't hear. It's a nice hangout for an after work special with co-workers.
