Their wine by the glass selection is lacking with only one red wine and the Pinot Grigio I had tasted like the bottle had been open a while, but it was still drinkable (then again what wine isn't?). The bread was out of this world. Our appetizer was good, as were our pastas. However, like Danial B said, the chicken I got in my pasta was similar to Tyson frozen pink slime chicken. When I'm paying an extra $3.50 for chicken, I expect it to be edible. I wouldn't feed the chicken they served me to my dogs. We decided maybe they just don't sell a lot of chicken and still raved over the rest of our meal. At the end, the server offered us dessert and I asked if they had tiramisu. She said they did and we got some to go. Since this restaurant prides themselves on heritage I thought it would be good. When we got home we put it on the counter and about twenty minutes later got around to eating it. It was frozen. There was a small puddle of water in the to go container where it had started thawing out. They shouldn't have even sold it to us. We will go back, but we will stick with spaghetti and meatballs.
