SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Damn, this place sucks.   We ordered 4 different dishes and only 1 was decent - the spaghettini pomodoro

The bread they give you before the meal taste like they went to the local supermarket and bought some Sara Lee brand.    It was untoasted and dry.

Ambiance is cool though since you can sit out in the faux-outdoors of Cesar Forum Shops plaza and look at the sky.   

Food is overpriced for what it is.   I had to send back my chicken parmigana because it was burnt crisp.   The waiter asked if wanted something else (which was nice) and I ordered the chicken marsala.   That was just as bad.    

Just look over your shoulder and go to Spagos, 50 ft away.    Much better.
