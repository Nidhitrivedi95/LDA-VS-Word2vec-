m6rffQy85HUq82DjLq-YJg We were in the area and stopped at this place during lunch time. $7.99 for the lunch special was a great deal for what we got!!!! The Chicken Pesto and Spaghetti meatballs both were delicious. Will definitely come back if we are in the area again!  Service by Courtney was superb!!!
