cs1qJvnWUg_f8g020z_3PQ Pizza was cold and our reservation was totally screwed up! Friend's birthday and seats reserved months in advance but they turned away half our party! This place is a joke! If you want real pizza in the valley, go to Pomo. As a Naples vet, that place is legit and has service that would make the ritz blush. Bianco rests in its plastic laurels and should wake the eff up
