BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA Personally, I've never eaten there but my goodness does it look lovely especially with the congested, tiny, ridiculous parking lot full of cars being driven by people who feel the need to look down upon others who have a car that is worth less than theirs. My blood pressure rises so much in that parking lot, I average about 15 minutes in order to back out of my spot because there are those individuals who just don't know what rearview mirrors are for. Whoever thought that this miniscule parking lot was a good idea should have thought differently. My goodness. Anyways, it smells good, their salads are as fresh as can be, and the staff seems wonderful.
