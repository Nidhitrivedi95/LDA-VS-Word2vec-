xsFeeqZS6PoVvwseEefzEw I should give this place another chance. The décor is nice, the location is right in the middle of the downtown hubbub and the food was good. But I went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and WE WERE THE ONLY TWO THERE. Seriously, it was the two of us, the waitress and a cook. Talk about depression. But, in the name of trying something new, we stayed. The grub was just what I expected, but that's what I like about it. I like that there's a place downtown where you can grab fettuccine at 1 a.m. The braised greens were good, but I wish they were spiced better than just "butter." I can't say much for the atmosphere, as again, there was no one there. The interior was nice, but nothing I haven't seen before. 

So, if you're looking for some fresh-made pasta downtown, this is probably a good place to start. But maybe you should go for dinner.
