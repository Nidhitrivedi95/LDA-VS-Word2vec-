I really appreciate the shaved sausage they used on my NY-style pizza, rather than the crumbles and lumps most other pizza places use. The prices are very reasonable. I have also ordered the eggplant calzone, which had a little less eggplant that I would have hoped for, but had very tasty ricotta-mozzarella blended with tasty spices. I'm just an eggplant fiend, that's all. The shrimp scampi pasta was a little disappointing. Not a lot of flavor and the sauce was very watery. Garlic knots they bring to your table are AMAZING, and the calamari appetizer is equally satisfying.

Most of my experience at this store has been takeout ordering. They seem to have to have a lot of extra people behind the counter and I never know which one is supposed to take my order at first, until someone addresses me. Then again, I tend to come in at times when their dining room is not very busy.

Overall great service, and I still frequent here.
