6cf70OiTGqhn5JtHV4Y0bQ My husband and I ate here last night for the first time from the suggestion of our daughter and her boyfriend.  We tend to always lean towards Mexican food places but, we thought it was time to get a little out of our rut. We did not get there until a little after eight on a Saturday night and were surprised by how empty the restaurant was. We were a little concerned that that was a reflection on the food or service or both. We sat at the bar which was outside seating and pleasant atmosphere. We were waited on immediately and were offered menu suggestions that we went with. My husband and I split the Mediterranean salad and the Chicken Piccata entree.  Both were delicious and filling!! Then to top of our experience, we discovered the outdoor patio seating is dog friendly-whoo hoo!!!    We will definitely be back and next time with our favorite little four legged child.
