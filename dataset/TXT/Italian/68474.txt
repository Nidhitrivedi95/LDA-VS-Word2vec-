BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I am giving 2 stars not necessarily for the food, because the mussels were amazing and I highly recommend the Spanish risotto as well.  the reason I am writing is because my dining guest got FOOD POISONING from the Black Linguine Pasta with seafood.. (I assume it was squid ink pasta?) Either way, this wasn't just 24 hours of hell, but it has continued for 2 days now.... cannot keep anything down, doctor required!  I wrote Local Bistro to tell them about the possible dangers with Friday (1-20) dinner, but I never even heard a response back with shows lack of care and overall no concern for their guests...

We cannot even go there anymore because of this incident.... sadly they didn't even say "I am sorry"
