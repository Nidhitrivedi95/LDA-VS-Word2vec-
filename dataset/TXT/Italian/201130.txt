PXN0l42g6IWp18NGJ7yn5w I came here on a Saturday night with a party of about 7-8. Asked the waitress for a double Cosmo -- "we don't do that here, there's already 2 ounces in them" shes says. So I order a regular. What she proceeds to bring me was a Martini glass, half full, which tasted like juice. I couldn't even taste the alcohol and Martini's are usually so strong. It was my first drink of the night too, so it's not like I was already wasted and couldn't tell the difference. 

My friend ordered a Samuel Adams pint and it was served to her with 1/4th foam at the top (see pic). How is that acceptable?

And then, right before we left, we all did a shot of our poison of choice, and I swear my vodka shot was watered down. Another person in the group got a lemon drop and commented that his shot tasted watered down too. Wtf?! I've never experienced that in a bar/restaurant in my life. A martini, pint and shot would usually leave me feeling pretty good but I barely had a buzz going. This place is a joke.
