4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ Food first: outstanding! Not a sugar-shack red, not a ketsup meatloaf. These guys are the real deal. Service is a tad under the back of the house. But well meaning and competent. Overall, front and back create a pleasurable experience. Pretensions and noses-high may be welcome. But check attitude at the door. Enter expecting Good service and great food.
