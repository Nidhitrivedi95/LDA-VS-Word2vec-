dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg Come in every couple of weeks.  Food great and service usually good. Only complaint wait times even at just past 11 am on a weekday.  Waitress confused my wife when ordering $2.99 slice.  She had unknowingly switched her to a $15 pizza.  When brought out waitress refussed to change order and in snotty tone said that is what she ordered.
