bo4loBeLwkQqZ7HGrgxXRQ kept hearing good things about this place so finally tried it.  

ATMOSPHERE: authentic with a positive vibe. it's like you walked into a popular resto in italy!  It can be romantic in a booth, fun with friends at a larger table, or go for drinks at the bar or patio. i'll def come back with friends.

SERVICE: there were more than enough waitresses to serve all the tables so no waiting longer than you have to. 

FOOD: had 2 apps (Figs w/goat cheese/prosciutto & cheese/olive/cured meat plate), a bufalo mozz pizza and gnocchi in tomato sauce. the tomato sauce is divine!  im italian and have made hundreds of jarsbefore...it actually tastes fresh and like nonna's sauce.
Apps were creative and absolutely delicious.   
believe it or not every single gnocchi has hand rolled grooves! (like nonna taught me).
the pizza is amazing and a different style from the floppy terroni pizzas.  the crust is thin yet stays firm.  and again...that tomato sauce!  

DESSERT: we were so stuffed we only had cappuccinos.  OMG...that had to be the best cappuccino i've had. ever. including what i had in Italy!

LOVED the experience and the food.  I don't normally review restaurants but it wouldn't be right in this case not to 'cause it deserves credit for all the care put into the quality of the cuisine.   VERY IMPRESSED.

100% favorite restaurant in Toronto.
