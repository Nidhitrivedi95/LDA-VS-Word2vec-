i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Absolutely hands down the best deli/sandwich restaurant in the area.  From homemade rolls to mouth watering Lasagna.  You will be the next on Yelp to Rave at how amazing the food is.  Carlo you have done this part of the valley a favor, and this is by far my favorite restaurant.
