iwzVhM5CirzkNS5wTxwZeA The Strand was a good place to eat in Phoenix, but nothing that really stood out to me. It was not a true authentic Italian restaurant. It satisfied my group and I for dinner. I had the salmon with pasta, the salmon was great served over steamed spinach. The past was average needed more flavor. My fiend had the pasta mac and cheese, it was missing a crispiness on top. Overall, good place for the atmosphere, good service food was average.
