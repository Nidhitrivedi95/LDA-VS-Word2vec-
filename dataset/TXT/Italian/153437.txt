Kykw3ho8wHtLV6gr9qbWTg Much ado about not much! Ate there twice, and was shocked at how mediocre the food was. Yes, it has organic ingredients, but the chicken and pasta I ordered had minute amount of chicken, and it was barely mediocre. I ordered garlic and herbs on the side to add flavor to a relatively flavorless dish.
