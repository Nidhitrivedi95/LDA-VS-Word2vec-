pCWg4B0R5gauQR4SJ9VDmw I used to live in this neighborhood so I've ordered their pizza and loved it but I saw a video on facebook of them making a sandwich and it looked delicious! So I went in to order one and I swear to God it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! The service was amazing as well because I obviously ordered my sandwich the wrong way and the guys where kind enough to correct me HOT is the only way to go! I suggest to go on an off time like 2 to 4 because if not it's so busy you're gonna wait a while. (A sign that that place has good food)
