xXxg8CBBdt8P1VHmUl3v3g We decided to try this new spot on an early Thursday night to avoid any line ups. We were well greeted and were seated in a nice spot to accommodate our two kids. Overall staff is extremely friendly & attentive! We ordered an Arancini starter and three different types of pizza. Firstly, I should mention that my husband is 100% italian and we are lucky enough to enjoy Nonna's Arancini on special occasions. Sadly, this was not as good. The risotto was overcooked. However the outside breading was tasty and perfectly done. I was just missing the delicacy of the saffron  and cube of mozzarella in the middle. 
For the pizzas, we did their traditional margarita, Fungi (mushroom) special and a simple cheese & pepperoni. The tastiest by far was the margarita one. The others were just too bland and lacked the punch of fresh favor italian cooking is known for. 
I think this place has lots of potential but with so many pizza spots around, they will need to step it up a bit to impress this italian family!
