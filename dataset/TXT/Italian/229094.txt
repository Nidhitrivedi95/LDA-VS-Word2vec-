T-Im6cn0zGmIFmeKdH1WbA So this is an atypical review - we worked with Megan, Kelly and the wonderful folks at this location 2 weeks ago to cater a big team dinner for my kids soccer team while we were visiting.  They were incredibly helpful, completely accomodating and made the planning of this meal (for about 35 people) completely easy and fun.  The kids and parents loved the food, there were tons of great choices!  Everything - EVERYTHING was taken care of - we were very happy!  Props to all the folks that helped out... we'll definitely call you next year again and rec you to all our NC teams that travel to Ohio!!!!
