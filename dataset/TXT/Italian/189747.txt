P034NqfS_1sf-pC51170Kg At 7PM on a Tue this resturant was not even half full.  After 2 attempts to have Salmon cooked properly I gave up.  The portion sizes have been reduced drastically adding to the disappointment from a prior above average chain. The ladies rest room was a mess , I could go on but you get the idea
Just go to, Delallos for a fab dinner
