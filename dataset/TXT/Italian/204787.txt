QDJBn7I1EdtP9w4nYT24Pw Got delivery since Sui wok never answers their phone. Will never  do it again. Their hot and sour soup was so nasty. Just dark brown liquid and nothing else in it. Could not even take one spoonful. My husband loves orange chicken a hated it from this place. The egg rolls tasted horrible too. Trust the reviews on this one and stay away.
