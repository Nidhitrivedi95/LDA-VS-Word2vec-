NI-qN4OMMwd00uotl9WexA First walked in the place look very nice. Very spacious! The service was excellent and we felt we weren't missed. Our salad and the appertizers were pretty good. Now the down side was the main course. The steak was tender but it was over my mash potatoes and each time I'm eating my steak I also eating the mash potatoes a the same time. The was only couple strip of vegetable. My wife swordfish steak didn't make it well. All because we felt it was a little over price for what it is. I think 3 star is a correct rating for this restaurant.
