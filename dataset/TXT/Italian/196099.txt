pM4mWLjeaZJlcdUxut2lMg Haven't been here since giving up gluten, though I came here a few times in the last few years. The first time was very much a motivated visit, the other times I just ended up coming here as a part of a group.

The location is fantastic, the interior is very smart and comfortable, the ambiance is quite nice. The menu is pretty exciting, offering plenty of seemingly authentic Italian dishes. I saw focaccia, caponata, homemade ravioli, risotto, pizzas, salads and pastas, calzone, polenta chips, and much more... The prices came as the first shock. £9.45 for a mushroom risotto? £8.50 for spaghetti aglio e olio. £9.95 for a calzone??? I realize that Italian restaurants can get away with such high prices in this country, but I don't understand why. Flour is cheap, tomatoes are relatively inexpensive, and pizza requires very little cooking time.

The food is rather disappointing, considering the prices and pretensions. On one occasion I had a pizza here. It was small, the toppings were sparse, and the base wasn't that crispy. I had the vegetarian lasagne, which was just two layers of lasagne sheets swimming in a dense creamy cheesy sauce, which was quite nice, but not really what I was after. The ice cream here is extremely disappointing, the pistachio is very green and obviously artificial. It's a world away from the extremely creamy nutty, earth coloured pistachio gelato in Italy. I once took a tiramisu away, and found that it was just a creamy pile of... sweetness. I couldn't taste the coffee or the marsala wine. It cost £4.95. I'd rather have Robbie's mother's recipe, thanks. 

Though they offer gluten free pasta and pizza, I don't think I would be inclined to return, having read Claire L's review. 

 It's only worth trying out this place if you have the Vittoria card which offers a 50% discount on certain days.
