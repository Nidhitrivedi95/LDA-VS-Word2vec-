cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ Time flies! On January 28, 2017, we hosted our wedding reception here! This review is a LONG TIME COMING!  We wanted to thank Chef Marc and his incredible staff for making our Las Vegas reception absolutely memorable- people are still talking about how this was the BEST food they've ever had at a reception. 
In the weeks leading up to the reception, Chef Marc put together the delicious tasting menu.  We, as newlyweds, had a tall order as our guests ranged from vegan to the die-hard meat lover.   He created a selection that was out of this world.  Then he continued to add and add to the plate choices.  

We had over 80 guests and everyone fit nicely.  Lino made sure of that.  He took our thoughts and turned them into a reality that filled every spot in the restaurant without making everyone squished in .

The flavors, the choices, the ambiance, the love that went into our day from Chef Marc and his restaurant family is what we cherish and are so thankful for.  Almost seven months later...this review is still relevant and fully deserved!

If you have an important event, trust Chef Marc and the crew to take your vision as their own. 

Thank You and Many Blessings!!!
