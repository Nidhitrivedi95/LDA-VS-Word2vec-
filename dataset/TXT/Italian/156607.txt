L9gOopt5VB7_fcKULmaO7Q Tucked away in a small strip mall just south of hwy 9 on Airport Rd., lies a little gem of food.  After driving by for almost a year, I decided to give it a shot.  I think I was speaking with the owner on the phone to place my take-out order.  Without knowledge of the menu, I asked for a suggestion for a dinner takeout.  She offered pasta dishes, and a lamb burger, which makes me think this is their specialty, but I chose mushroom risotto, grilled chicken with a side salad.  
I am a unsophisticated foodie; I simply judge food by its taste but can taste the quality or lack thereof in food.  
The mushroom risotto was simple, perfectly cooked and a taste explosion! The rice was al dente, the fresh mushrooms prevalent but not overpowering, and the dish perfectly seasoned.  The sun-dried tomato/red pepper and greens salad was as fresh as ever, spiked with a great combination of balsamic and oil.  Note: if getting take out, ask for the dressing on the side.  The greens are an arrangement of delicate lettuces and seedlings, so the salad gets soggy quickly.  The grilled chicken was simply spiced,  with perfectly burnt bits combined with juiciness.  It is apparent by the flavour and freshness  of the food, that these people source local meat and produce, which is honourable and differentiating from restaurants in the area. The portions are massive, which is right on point for its country location. I Will return to try their Pizza and Lamb Burgers, with eagerness.  
The service is friendly and unassuming.  Locals.........please support this little gem of a restaurant. Our area is in dire need of a place like this!
