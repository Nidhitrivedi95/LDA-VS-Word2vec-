The meat ball is one of their signature dish, the shrimp cocktail is probably the less impressive dish.  The meat ball is flavorful, juicy and very tender.  Most dishes are on the oily side.  The size of the dishes are huge, so we usually share.  Besides the wait to be seated, its not a bad italian restaurant.
