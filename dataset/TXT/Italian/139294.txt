JFNv5sKeKAf1ZVPnfbzpXw I ate here today- I order the sampler which was Fried Zucchini, Chicken Wings,  Garlic French Fries, and Mozzarella Sticks. I love fried zucchini -but it was it was missing some type of season or something. Hand down the mozzarella sticks & sauce was the bomb and I will come back for those. I though the garlic fries was going to be dipped in some garlic batter and then cooked-well it was just fries with garlic powder& garlic placed on top of it. Wings were fair. I think I will try the pizza on my next go around.
