TLbx_MR2dyFztoyR5d9H2A This place is like a more "restaurant version" of Casanova's Brother's pizza. Salerno's restaurant was definitely very casual, but I'm casual, so it suited me well; my family is white-trash-casual, and to them, it was probably a nice change from Filiberto's.  

The carts they deliver the food on need to go! We are not in a nursing home, we are eating a nice Italian meal. I've seen this in other reviews, so owners- maybe you should take our friendly advice. :-)

The food though, now that's what everyone cares about. I got the cheese ravioli, which were delicious, and were a large serving. In fact- everyone got large portions and 5/6 of us took home leftovers. My husband got the veal and he loved it. Everything we had was awesome- and the salads and bread before the meal were great starters.
