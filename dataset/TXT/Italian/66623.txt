BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg Only place where i eat my pizza 
no other pizza place taste like Settebello!
restaurant is very specious with nice study furniture.
large area bar. they offer a daily happy hour from 3pm to 6pm.

i recommande their caprese salad, the emilia pizza, the vico pizza, the 5 cheese pizza!
the crust is very thin and just so so good! it doesn't stuff you like other pizza :) 
order a glass of Moscato and then you are in pizza heaven 

staff is very pleasant 
great place, good pizza, good wine what else???
