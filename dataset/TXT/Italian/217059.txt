Secondly, their food is amazing, in having the lunch special and wow. It's also extremely fairly priced. Thirdly, I met Tony and Uncle Tony, they are straight outta New York for sure!

I asked for garlic and sausage slice, they did not skimp on either, just the way I like it!

The only thing Ill do differently is that i learned that I love their sauce and next time I'll ask for got extra!
