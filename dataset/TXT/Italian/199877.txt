PSRZaGGxXmOmabL2si8pKw I don't understand the "call ahead" service Carrabba's offers when u call ahead 15 minutes before u leave the house and they ask how long till u arrive and then drive 15 to get there and have to still wait and additional 25 when u arrive? Confused and annoyed by this the food is good but customer service sucks! And by the way the hostess is very rude and should not roll her eyes at the guests that put money in her pocket! Be polite seriously! Call ahead is crap? Have reservations or nothing it's worthless to think call ahead is important ????
