FUqvrauxIP8bcI2aVeoXdg I was out with a friend a few weeks ago and we had just finished watching the fights and were looking for a place with some decent food at around 11:00PM on a Saturday night.

As we walked down King Street back to my place, my friend said, "Let's go to the Kit Kat, I know you will love this place". I replied "Sure, sounds good."

We walked in and got seated right at the window, it was not that busy being that late, but it was still open and serving food, which was awesome.

The server told us the Specials and after glancing over the menu, I decided upon a Seafood Pasta with a Rose sauce Special.

And we shared a few apps as well.

Well I was not prepared at all for the magnificence of the dish I ordered, I was really taken aback at how great it was. My friend was smiling all the time, he'd been going here for a few months now and had never mentioned this place to me before.

Now, my experiences could be unique to that night, but the service was excellent, the manager/owner dropped by the table a few times to see how things were.

I am REALLY looking forward to heading back there soon and trying another dish one of these evenings.
