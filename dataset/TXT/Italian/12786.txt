0XZkaHXjxHAhJc_jPtoJCA Came across Vita Social on a Saturday night to a surprisingly empty dining room. Service was slow, couldn't get TVs to play two different games. Manager seemed to be enjoying the leafs game more than being a manager. I really loved this place a year ago, I know it can be a hot spot, but menu was boring and place was lacking excitement. My braised short ribs were heavy, filling and absolutely fantastic. We also tried the gluten free option of their pomodoro which we weren't as pleased (presentation lacking.) I want this place to be successful, I think it could be a great hangout for locals, but strikeouts on a few aspects.
