1RROh1rSDB4ASIZ-kwxT2w I just celebrated my dads surprise retirement there on Sunday evening. 33 people attended. In the enclosed party room. It was an amazing experience. All of our needs were met. No clean up for me afterwards. I just sat back and enjoyed the event. The aesthetics were pleasing. The food was amazing! Everyone thought it was elegant and had a great private time! I love how you can close the doors to make it a private experience. Our two waiters were very diligent and accommodating. Would definitely recommend
