mLP-jIIRdoaYM7fJqqFurw My favorite Pizza Place in the squirrel hill.

Although I have to say I like their Subs even more than the pizza, (those things are just fresh and perfect.)

Also you can get a 6 pack / some good soda! This place is a win win that locals truly appreciate, many of us have been going for years and years. Never had a bad experience.
