usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA Oh the joys.  B Y O BBBBB.  What a special pleasure.

This is a lovely little place in Lawrenceville.  That tells you a handful of things.  On Butler street, so hard to park, but you will find something after you troll around a bit.  DOES NOT take a reservation, if you come on a busy night during the main dinner hours, expect to have quite a wait.  I believe you can call ahead and put your name on the list, but am not 100% positive about that.

THE FOOD has consistently been excellent.  All of the pizzas are interesting and delicious.  There are rotating seasonal menu items, and usually a special risotto every night.  Ask your server to be honest about what to get, and you likely will not be disappointed.  I have always succumbed to their desserts, only to be soothed into a post-supping coma, never into a ranting rave of disappointment or dejection.

Piccolo Forno has continuously maintained a high degree of quality in regards to service, food preparation and authentic italian ingredients.
