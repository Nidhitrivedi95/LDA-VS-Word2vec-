RC24XhaFXlntFlYrYmn_Zg Aliante sent us a coupon for this place, so we used it. The atmosphere was excellent - I loved the dim lighting, spaced-out tables, and classy decor. The food nothing special unless you consider how cheap it is - for what you pay, the food's pretty darn good! Our waiter was rather hurried; either there were people out sick or they need to hire more staff. Nothing was wrong with his service though. 

Overall if you live nearby and are looking for a cheap yet romantic date, I'd recommend this place.
