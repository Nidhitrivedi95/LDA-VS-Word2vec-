nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g I've eaten here a couple times over the last year and I'm pretty split on my findings.

One thing that I have to admit, I'm not the type to normally be impressed by salad... But their Funghi Assoluti is 5 star salad. I mean I don't even typically like mushrooms but I could destroy this salad without hesitation at any point of any given week. On the other hand, all the mains I've had were 3 star at best. Pizza was pretty decent, but was mostly made better strictly because of the hot peppers you can order on the side, they are really good peppers! One thing that let me down last time I was their was the Rib Eye Steak. It was a sketchy piece of meat, rather stringy and fatty and really underwhelming.

In summary - mixed feelings, 3 stars.
