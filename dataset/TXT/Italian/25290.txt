4HeS4zlbf-IbwEItbrISlw First things first, the 4th star is earned relative to the neighbourhood it's in.

This is a good, affordable Italian restaurant, not much more, not much less.  Thoroughly enjoyed my pizza, the bruschetta and the spiedini, but the calamari was pretty full of batter and oil, kind of disappointing.  They'd be better off to just grill it (plus it would increase their margins).

Regardless, the service was killer and pleasant, the atmosphere great for conversation, and the price was just about right (6 people with drinks for about $200).  

It's a great option that the neighbourhood's been missing, and a nice staple to have in my backyard (ish).
