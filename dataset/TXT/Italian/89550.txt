E0YuuRpK_4RpaUF7JK3mhg We were wanting to visit since the resturant had a write up on the chef Carla Pellegrino.  The food was good, but took a very long time to get to the table. About 40 minutes after the salads and soup.  Chairs were very hard and too low  for the table height. Maybe add some thick coushons would help.  Bread was cold and hard with a thick flour topping.  Wished it was warmed with some soft butter.  The olive oil and wine vinegar was nice touch.  Dont think we would go bac. We live 36 miles in the NW and drove there to try it.  Not a WOW experience.....but decent for the money.
