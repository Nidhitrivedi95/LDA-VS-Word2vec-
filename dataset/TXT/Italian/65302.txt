BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA I live 5 minutes from this restaurant and order the same appetizer on a regular basis.  For take out (at least once a week), I have to order TWO of the same appetizer just to get the same amount of food.  When I called to complain, the owner Fernando said to ask for him next time I was in the restaurant.  Well, I did this past weekend with a party of 16 - and that did not go so well. 
First, I asked our not-friendly waiter for a wine recommendation - he claimed they did not have any wine fitting my description (a spicy red).  When I asked for a taste of what he recommended, he just walked away - twice.  The third time, I finally got a taste and did not care for it. 
Second, I asked for the owner to stop by.  Fernando came over - and when I introduced myself, he could care less and told my group that the table next to us (comprised of about 12 elderly individuals) complained about our children being loud.  Our children were not even speaking - they each had an iPad and were playing games.  We actually just told our children they should put down the devices and talk to their friends.  Near the end of the meal, we had 4 (yes, 4) of those same elderly individuals come over and compliment us on how well-behaved our children were at dinner.  Obviously, something does not add up.
Third, the restaurant served a highly allergic child non-glutten free pasta.  Luckily, his mother caught the mistake before he ate the food.  The boy would have gone to the hospital immediately.
My takeaways are: 1) take out portions are MUCH smaller than portions served in the restuarnt at the same price, 2) not a child friendly restaurant, 3) owner doesn't seem to really care and 4) watch your order if you have allergies.
