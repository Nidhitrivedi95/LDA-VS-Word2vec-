3-6biVwm7VwPZ-k67jml-Q I have been on the hunt for Amarena Cherries ever since the Pasta Bar started my addiction over a year ago and today I sat down and called all over the valley for 2 hours before in amazement I found them at Andreoli.    After looking at the menu on-line I knew my husband would want to eat there and we hopped on the road for our adventure.  

We were barely two steps in the door when sure enough it was decided we would stay for lunch.  The young lady behind the counter, I am thinking the owner's daughter, couldn't have been more helpful.  I had picked out my sandwich on line, but switched to a daily special of rigatoni with ricotta and cherry tomatoes and my husband spotted peppers and sausage on the counter and he was sold.  

Our lunch was fabulous and we returned to the dessert counter for a treat to take home.  Sadly only so much fits in the fridge.  My husband wanted to have his parents come up right away as they are huge "real" Italian foodies too.  As tomorrow is Sunday and they are closed we will have to wait a day to return, but we will definitely be back soon.  I also loved the antique tables and items mingled in the store.
