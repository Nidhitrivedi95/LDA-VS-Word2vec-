fzxvmA3Ygu3yrQQ6-cEpTw Great atmosphere, service was also really good. Wish I could say the food and cocktails were the same but can't. Went there tonight and I will never be back. Spent $85 for two drinks, pizza and two appetizers. For those prices the food and drinks should have melted in my mouth but it didn't. I force myself to eat and my drink was almost undrinkable (lemon drop)
