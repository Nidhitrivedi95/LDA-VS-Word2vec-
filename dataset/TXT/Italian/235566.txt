tVyLQzyhhinKcGzlZIFZjQ I have to say we were disappointed.  We found out they had a thin crust pizza, and we were "yes!".  But the thin cheese pizza (which, in my opinion, is the best way to judge dough and sauce) had no flavor.  Really, you only tasted cheese.  Sauce had absolutely no flavor, and the dough was dough--brought nothing to the flavor of the pizza.  Now, I'll definitely say that a lot of people had stuff on their pizza--and perhaps that's how you're supposed order at this restaurant.  But a good pizza should stand on its own, and this one really didn't.  We had to add Oregano, parmesan, and salt just to give the pizza some flavor.
We had the Calamari--they were strips rather than rings.  They were deep fried with a heavy batter, and the oil was likely old.  The batter came dark, the marinara was too thick, and the calamari itself tasted old.
