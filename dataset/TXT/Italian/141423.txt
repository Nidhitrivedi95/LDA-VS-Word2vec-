jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg Very disappointing.   Been coming for over 15 yrs to the Summerlin location.  Quality has totally gone downhill.   Ordered pepperoni pizza, fettuccini Alfredo and spaghetti and meatballs.   Pizza was ok but pastas were horrible.  Absolutely NO taste.   Everyone in our group of 5 agreed.   It's like they forgot to use any garlic, salt, basil or pepper.    One of guests in our group hit the nail on the head...we should have known something was up when no garlic smell was either inside or outside of restaurant!!!!   Told manager and she said thanks for telling her.   Will NOT be returning.   Sad.  Had so many good memories here.    Olive Garden is so much better and not as expensive.
