h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ Food was good and reasonably priced.  But the service left something to be desired. Five minutes sitting up front before anybody said anything to us.  Would have normally left after that but we had a coupon and this was our third time trying this restaurant, due to similar issues of being ignored. Never got asked if the food was good had to literally wave him down to get an iced tea. Again the food is good and if you want to sit for an hour and a half for an appetizer and some spagetti this is your place.
