VxgjMl8tQrT4idJW_z8daA I went there for the first time tonight. Getting in was superfast even though it was quite busy. Unfortunately we waited a Really long time for service due to a miscommunication between staff, but Chris, the manager, was very kind and gracious and more than made up for any inconvenience.  Louis the other manager, and Hannah the server were all very friendly and kind and made us feel comfortable and appreciated. I will be back frequently due to the outstanding food and their honest apology for the situation. I was so uncomfortable complaing, but Chris assured us that's the only way to keep it from happening again to someone else and that they wouldn't want us to not come back due to a bad experience (how'd he know, that's exactly what I would do). Great staff. Great food and the best blackberry sangria I've ever had.
