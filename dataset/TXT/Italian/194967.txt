pjpUOlJLlkIxBZ5BquA2PA We called nearly a week ahead to make a reservation for a party of 14. When we got there, they had no record of having taken our reservation, and said they could only accommodate us outside (on a cold, blustery evening). We repeated that we had made a reservation and politely asked to see the manager. While we were waiting, the hostess that had been talking to us seated a couple of parties that walked in with no reservation at all, including one larger party of 6. Then when the manager finally came over, all he wanted to do was argue with us about whether we had called the right location to make our reservation. We ended up leaving and taking our business to the restaurant next door. I don't care how good your food is, if you cannot care for your customers properly, you will not get my business. Sorry, Pomo, but you suck.
