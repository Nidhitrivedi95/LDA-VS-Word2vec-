1VDP92FU2p8AqJw9vU11sw Stopped in for lunch while in the area and really enjoyed the food. Service was quick and easy. Great place to stop in for a fun family meal. 

We were doing lunch so we split some appetizers, we did nachos and the tackle box, we could have easily done just one or the other but wanted some variety. It was fun bar food type of thing. I was excited because it was easy to option everything to be meat free (not always possible with bar food). No hassle to get it done, and everything was correct when it hit the table. 

The kiddo had a kids burger and loved it. One word of warning HUGE portion sizes. I doubt I'd ever come in and not share so get friendly or get ready to take home leftovers.
