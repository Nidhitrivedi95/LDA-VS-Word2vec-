TVKenh65WwJX3zEr36zKCA Came here for the first time and ordered a dozen oysters which had more pieces of shell and black muck then any sort of flavor. Every bite was like chewing sand. I ordered the salmon which did save the night for me. My friend got the jambalaya and it came out like just like a gumbo. He asked the server but he insisted it was the right thing. This now brings me to the server... He spoke two words to us and they were short and abrupt. The beginning bread basket they served was stale and unappealing. I love sunset station but this place is over priced and not worth my time or money!
