5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA First off, this isn't an endorsed message I just love this place! Hands down the best italian resturant in Las Vegas. We go here to eat at least once a month and every time we have a visitor from out of town we bring them here and they all LOVE it and request to go back the next time they visit! Great wine selection, great bruschetta, I always get the eggplant parm (comes with your choice of pasta) or the ravioli (I'm a vegetarian) and my husband gets the chicken parm (comes with your choice of pasta) or the salmon (comes with veggies and mashed potato), everything is ALWAYS fantastic. They give you hot bread right out of the oven when you sit down which is delicious with the olive oil and vinegar. You can sit outside at night for a great view of Vegas which is always romantic :) The staff are all great and the manager is always walking around making sure all of the customers are happy. I've tried many many italian restaurants in Vegas and Ventano's is by far the best of the best. If you are planning to go on a weekend for dinner be sure to make a reservation as it can get really busy. Hope you enjoy this place as much as I do!
