FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q Excellent professional service. Establishment was clean.
I ordered the chicken parmigiana, it was so tender i could easily cut it with my fork. Entrees come with delicious garlic bread and choice of soup or salad both equally delicious, and they leave fresh grated parmigiana cheese on the table. 
Dinner portions are huge, well worth the moderate price.
