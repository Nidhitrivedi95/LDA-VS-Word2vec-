If you want more food for the money Chipotle may be a better option. They also have good a good, clean seating area and get your food to you fast.

I've had the Japanese Pan Fried Noodes, Indonesian Peanut, and Truffle Mac. Of these, I would have to recommend the Truffle Mac. It's more expensive than the other dishes (it was $11 for it and a soda), but it tasted really good. Friends I've went with also enjoyed in the regular Wisconsin Mac and cheese.

They have a Coke freestyle machine (the one with the touchscreen so you can choose your flavor of Fanta, Coca Cola, Sprite, Root beer, etc.), which is fun to use to test new combinations.
