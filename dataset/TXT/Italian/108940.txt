G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Oh. My. God.  The food we had was absolute perfection!!  We had reservations so we didn't have much of a wait (maybe 7 minutes), but we were told dinner reservations are 6 months out and lunch u can do walk-ins but you'll have to wait 30-45 mins.  Our lunch was incredible from the bread all the way to dessert.  I ordered the carbonara pizza and it was the best pizza I have ever eaten.  Someone in my party ordered the lemon pesto grilled cheese, which was phenomenal and came with zucchini scapecce, which I had never had before but was awesome...I'd rather eat that then French fries!  Even the bread with the pesto spread before the meal was awesome.  As far as strip restaurants go, it was on par for pricing, if not slightly cheaper for lunch.  I can't wait to go back and try dinner (I should probably make my reservation now!!)  Wait staff was very good as well.
