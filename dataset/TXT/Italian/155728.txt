L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw The day my friend and I found out Jamie's was in Toronto, our first thought was that we had to go! My friend and I went on a Saturday afternoon at 4pm. She had the Tagliatelle Bolognese and I had Jamie's Sausage Pappardelle. We both had the small portion of the pasta and we had the Artisan Bread appetizer. Our server's name was Marie. The bread was good but it was not Jamie's bread. It was ACE Bakery. I can get that from Shoppers Drug Mart. We were not warned about this until the bread came that it was not made in house. The Tagliatelle was very good except a baby would eat this dish and still be hungry. The Sausage Pappardelle was okay, nothing very special about it - but it was also very small portioned. We were not warned about the portion size. We wouldn't of minded paying more if we would of known how small the portion would of been. We both finished our meal in a blink of an eye. We paid for our food, left and went to the Yorkdale food court. My friend got a shawarma and I got a poutine.
