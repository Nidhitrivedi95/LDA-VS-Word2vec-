XmxRXzCFkzQK23kkHgUgLA Like a ghost in grammy's sheets, rattlin' chains and all, I was visiting old haunts. 

I used to work in Biltmore; cut my teeth banging heads, pulling bodies off the floor, making rich white women cry and telling wanna-be anorexic models "yeah, that extra weight looks good on you." 

Let's say I was in "Customer Relations". 

And it was warm today. my dogs were barking like Woof, and I needed good, good food and, oh yes, please, pour this weary traveler some libations to sooooth the hammered soul. 

Wink 24.

Wink 24. is the business. 

Atmosphere, Check!
Food, Check! 
Libations... CHECK!

"Drinks were like holy shit." --that's a direct quote from my wife. See we were just talkin shop & Peru, craftsman that he is, crafted us a crafty Biltmore Sunrise. Ya'know... Just cos. (Craft)
