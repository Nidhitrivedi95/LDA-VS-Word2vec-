8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg So my boyfriend surprised me with Stevie Nicks tickets here at dinner. Really the only highlight to the meal. We had a reservation and still had to wait 20 mins. Then every single table but us was served the big stick of bread, looked really good we really wanted to have some as we were starving. The food at least came out fast but was just ok, nothing special.

I get that the new theater just opened but a restaurant on the Strip shouldn't be this chaotic, servers were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Not to mention the place looks like it's being ran by 15yr olds. I'm only giving this place a star simply because my drink was huge and I needed it to deal with the dinner. Save your money, this place sucks.
