fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w I was really disappointed with this experience. I'll start with the food. The hummus platter was super tiny and poorly presented and the dips lacked flavor and consistency was not smooth the way hummus typically is which made it hard to dip. the Steak wrapped Asparagus had good flavor but there were two pieces. Two! The waiter did not guide us on the menu at all. We were a group of 11. He should have told us the asparagus dish only had two pieces vHe could have increased his check size (and therefore his tip) had he guided a large group like ours to order enough apps for everyone. I had the Kale and Hearts of Palm salad which wasn't bad but the Kale pieces were so large you couldn't eat them properly and the hearts of palm were diced small which made them almost impossible to eat. I would have cut the Kale more but the Busser never replaced the dirty knife I asked him to replace. The rest of my group seemed to enjoy their food although there were a few small mistakes with how things were brought to the table vs how they were ordered. what really surprised/frustrated all of us as restaurant industry professionals in this town was how poor the service was tonight. The waiter walked away every time someone was in the middle of asking for something, we had to ask the bussers to clear our appetizer plates off the table because they started to bring all of our dinner items before anything was cleared. The Busser did not seem happy at this request at all. We had to ask for them to clear empty cocktail glasses and empty bottles of wine off the table. People didn't have enough napkins or forks/knives and the waiter wouldn't stand at the table long enough for us to ask for more than one item. The kitchen messed up "hold the cheese" on a few items as well. Overall it was a poor experience despite the food being fairly flavorful.
