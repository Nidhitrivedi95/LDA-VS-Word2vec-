aBmuthrQ7yP8cnbgkxU5Ug Two bad things about this place: the people and the portions. The male (the older one--there is also a son I think) owner is a total scammer. My drunk friends and my sober self went in once, and he kept trying to pull one over on my friends to convince them to spend more money. I was on to him and kept telling him that we didn't want all that food. But in the end, he still slipped in an extra order we didn't want, and my drunk friend didn't notice. Sheisty! And second, the portions SUCK. I once ordered fried mushrooms for $5. I got FOUR MUSHROOMS. FOUR. What a ripoff!!! They weren't big. They were normal-sized. They should have been ashamed. I will never return, even though I live close.
