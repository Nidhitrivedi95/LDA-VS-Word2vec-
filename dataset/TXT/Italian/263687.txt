wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q I come here with my best friend on a regular basis  usually for a light lunch and some drinks.  

We have had 4 or 5 different servers over the last year and  they have always been friendly and willing to accommodate  any special requests or answer any questions. No one has been spectacular but all have been average or very good  and everyone has always been friendly and welcoming. 

The lunches typically are Italian Tapas or lunch specials, soup and salad. 

I have had pasta dishes on occasion and they are just OK. The tapas, soup salad and bread have been pretty good Light and flavorful especially on a summer day.  Perfect for a light lunch and talking. 

The wine  and cocktail menu is a decent selection for a chain and tend to have a good variety of flavors. 

The food I would give close to 3-3.5 stars. It is in a great shopping center. Ulta  and Pier 1 for her and Total Wine for me.
