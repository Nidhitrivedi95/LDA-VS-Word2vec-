We started with the small meat board. The soppressata was not edible. The rest of the cured selections where very good. We ordered the seafood bouillabaisse which needed flavor. The seafood was fresh but was missing flavor.   The server was outstanding she was professional and attentive. I will try it one more time because everyone has a off night. I would give it a solid 31/2 stars.
