Os1NdWfFCpz9FWa4gDOLRw My husband and I just enjoyed dinner here and I'm still stuffed but I wanted to let you all know that I have been to 5 or 6 Oregano's locations and all are excellent but the experience tonight was really over the top. 

We arrived at around 6pm and were told it would be a 25-30 minute wait. No problem, there's always a wait at Oreganos and it's worth it. After putting our name on the list we were immediately greeted by Kevin who offered to bring us a cold beer while we wait. Yes please! He brought us our beer promptly and then showed us to some seats on the patio where we could enjoy the lovely September evening while we waited. Who does that?! 

We were seated in about 15 minutes and were greeted by the lovely Kelley who took great care of us with a smile. She was on top of everything! We enjoyed our dinner salads and pizza with as much parmesan as she could pile on. Our usual is the XL thin crust with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. We like to have leftovers for the next day. The pizza arrived more quickly than promised and arrived piping hot with loads of cheese. Yum! Love this place! 

Parking is at a premium here but we were able to park at the Cigna next door so no problem. 

Oregano's has always been one of our favorites and our experience was outstanding. I hope our servers Kevin and Kelley will be rewarded for their fantastic job.
