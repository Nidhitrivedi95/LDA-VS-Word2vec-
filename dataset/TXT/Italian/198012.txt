pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I've been just to see what all the hype is about. And to answer the main question: yes, the pizza is very good,. Now, the wait to get said pizza in yo belly makes this place an annoyance. Yes, they provide ample seating area and a nice flow of drinks to keep you going, but to me, I'd rather go to Cibo Pizzeria for much better pizza and not much of a wait.
