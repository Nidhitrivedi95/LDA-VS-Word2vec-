k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw I enjoy this place, it's a really nice 24/hr non-diner/hotel boring café option for a late night meal.  The Menu is modest but everything they make is with care.  I like the Panetti bread that they serve, especially after a late night and cocktails!  I am a consistent cat, and always get the same item; the sautéed Italian greens, they are always, always amazing and prepared fresh.  

I like the old mafia vibe while dining, and the staff is super friendly and always willing to accommodate, this place reminds me of the east coast in a good small town way.  

It is a lovely casual bar, I am always happily surprised at the friends I run into there.  

Major drawback, they don't have avocado? w.t.f., I like salad.  I have also only been here between 2am-6am, so graveyard is obviously when I recommend for, I can't speak for the regular people hours of operation.
