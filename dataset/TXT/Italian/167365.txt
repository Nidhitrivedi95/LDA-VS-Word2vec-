Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw I love this place.
It's unpretentious, casual, deli and many home made items.
We ordered 2 spaghetti meat balls(huge), chicken parmesan sandwich, knots (yummy), Italian II cold sandwich, capuccino, tiramisu..... ) yep, too much for 3 people.. but I don't live in Vegas and i just had to get all I wanted.
I will definitely go back when I am in town.
