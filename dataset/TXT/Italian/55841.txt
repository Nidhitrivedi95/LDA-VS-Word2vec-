aKEEQqL1UFMieilnylI1gw Sometimes finding a restaurant that actually stands out in Vegas is tough! There are so many!! I can't say I've ever really had a bad dining experience in Vegas and I have been to some of the best places to dine there! This one, perhaps my favorite. I was staying at the Wynn for my birthday. We were arriving that evening so I wanted something in the hotel and a nice dinner that would appease my snobby food/wine side and my boyfriend's finicky side. Mission accomplished! The entry into the dining area is above a beautiful winding staircase. The place just oozes elegance. It was like a birthday gift having my waiter be from Dublin and I got to listen to him talk all night! I wish I could remember his name but he was the best! The fish case was a spectacular site and although I am NOT a seafood girl, my bf is and he ordered the scorpion fish. Watching them prepare it to be plated at the table, picking out the bones and adding vegetables and sauce right in front of us was amazing! I almost wanted to try it, but no thanks. I went with, you guessed it, the filet. By the way, one of my favorite dishes and this one was probably in my top 3 anywhere!! Including the grass fed filet I had in a castle in Ireland! It was that good! I only wished I had more room in my stomach. After salads, bread with butter accompaniments, entrees and then a special dessert for my birthday I was full until lunch time the next day!! This restaurant was sooooo amazing, I would literally go back to Vegas just to eat there again.
