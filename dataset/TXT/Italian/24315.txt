47y08rotkJr5gYMgG5IvTA Excellent lunch spot for Business meetings in Little Italy.  The space is well Decorated and quaint; It is very busy spot with professionals and local celebrities.  

The starters: calamari, beef tartare and tomato vegetable soup were amazing

Pastas:  our table had gnocchi, spaghetti bolognese, fettuccini carbonara with a side of flame grilled chicken breast and the fish of the day with vegetables; all tasted fresh and looked visually very appealing.  It was apparent that the pasta was made from scratch, on site: the sign of an authentic Italian craft and not the jersey-Italian chain attempts.  Everything tasted amazing, very good Café International!  We Will definitely be back!
