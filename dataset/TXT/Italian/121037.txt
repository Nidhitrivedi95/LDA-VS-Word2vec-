haGstZfcH0IeRPncH2oFPQ First time here tonight. The hostess didn't seem to know what she was doing. Told us she would seat us at an open table but then ignored us for 10 minutes. The restaurant was very warm, uncomfortable. Waitress was slow and impatient. When the pizza finally came out it was lukewarm. They ran out of water glasses and their draft beer system was broke. Not an enjoyable evening.
