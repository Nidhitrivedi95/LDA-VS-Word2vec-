Ava9H-t4scVmP7u_onh7pg I've been here a couple of times and I always enjoy it. A great place to go out with friends as there's plenty of seating inside and some outdoors for the nice nights. I'm not overly impressed with the food as there's nothing that stands out taste-wise. But it's not bad - 3.5 stars. They have a new fall menu supposedly, so you may be able to try something different. The bourbon apples on the squash pizza was a good mix of sweet and bourbon. The pots-de-creme was also a delicious dish overall, but needed more of it on the plate!

The mixed drinks are pricey but good and the beers are reasonably priced for the setting and atmosphere. The service we received from the staff supervisor who waited on us during a non-busy Saturday evening was excellent - 4+ stars. Answered all of our questions, made honest suggestions, and overall helpful. I'd return for another nice evening for date night or dinner with friends.
