YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg We went to a Christmas Eve Dinner with the family and I was let down hard! The Cioppino that I ordered for $50 was far from average. I've had a great cioppino and was not even worthy being called cioppino. The broth was like it was out of a can and the seafood was fishy (not fresh), more like frozen crap. Let's just say the entire dinner was a 1 star rating. The bill was over $500 and for what? I expected so much better. A big let down!!!
