FajhBSkrz5pSuKgylBPnvA I was in the Berri-UQAM area once again and I needed to eat. I started walking towards Le Village but passed this place and saw that they had pasta and pizza and whatnot. I didn't see the restaurant's name Da Giovanni at first (Da Giovanni? Why not Don Giovanni?). I walked in and saw that they were one of those nice little places where you could stop in for lunch or an informal meal. I'm letting you know ahead of time that their portions are quite large! Very generous! I was expecting a sort of side-dish sized spaghetti, but I received a dinner-size portion. Unfortunately, the one woman there taking everyone's orders and serving didn't speak English very well and we had some difficulty in communication. Apparently, I also missed out on another part of the restaurant, a whole other room. I suppose that and their menu warrants the rather cheesy Italian-music-in-French website they have! I'll be coming back for sure to check more of the place out and hopefully there will be more employees taking orders and serving. All the signs are in French, btw, no English. Anglophones are warned!
