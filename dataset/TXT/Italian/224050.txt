smBsHggLvIuABgntBvlYLw The food we ordered was very tasty! We got the artichoke crab dip, side salads and pepperoni/sausage/mushroom pizza. My pet peeve is when the sausage has too much star anise in it, but this was perfect; a lot of bite to it, super flavorful. The service was fast and nice, all good!
