XRWr5Vn_Gb60yrD5FETT5A This was the best meal I've had here and the Osso Bucco was to die for!
The service was great.  Friendly, engaging and very efficient.
I enjoyed the Cesar salad.  Nice size and very crisp lettuce.  The bread and dipping oil was okay.  The bread was nice and fresh but it had been left on the grill a tad too long and was a little charred.  As stated, the Osso Bucco was excellent.  Full of flavour, so so tender.  The sauce was excellent and I wanted to lick the plate!  Very good sides of garlic mashed and a vegetable medley.
First rate meal that I would definitely order again.
Interesting if you order a steak you can get a side salad for $2.95.  I think the most expensive steak is about $30.  The Osso Bucco is $34 but they don't offer the same deal; however if you ask nicely they were more than kind to make the offer.  Nicely done!
