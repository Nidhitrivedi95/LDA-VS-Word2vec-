jeTfL2kCyBtmFGSrSQHqVw We very much enjoyed our dinner at Bacaro for my fiancé's birthday. Both of us did the tasting menu with the wine pairings. Each course was very creatively designed and tasteful with excellent wine pairings. Two of our favorites were the black truffle risotto and the filet with butternut squash and chili butter. Our server, Paige, was very sweet and kind, and also very knowledgeable of the menu and wine. Thank you for helping us celebrate, as well as for exceptional service! We will definitely be back!
