JsUprRhyzQyukZmAhcOg0A I ended up coming here 2 days in a row for various reasons.

The first time I came here it reminded me of a restaurant that you would see in Las Vegas. Nice decor and clean -  just made me wish I was dressed up and inebriated though.

The food is pretty good -- I've had their chicken sandwich and salad. The portions are huge -- even their plates and forks are huge....why? 

Don't think I would come here again by choice, but I certainly wouldn't mind if I ended up here again :)
