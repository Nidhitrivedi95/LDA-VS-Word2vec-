GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ Just near the Poker Room in the Venetian, you'll find B&B Burger. As a big fan of B&B Ristorante, as well as a burger and craft beer fan, I had to check this place out prior catching a plane out of Las Vegas.

Craft beer selection is robust, with both drafts and bottles. And the pricing is acceptable, unlike some other pubs and establishments (I'm looking at you Todd English P.U.B.). 

The burger selection is well presented and I was able to order a "build your own" burger to my liking. Big points for Pretzel buns! And the "Good burger" earned it's title. Great flavor. Both burgers being loaded and slightly messy.

Staff was friendly and accommodating. Great views outside of the Gondola's and the strip.

While not the best burger place I've ever dined at, for a more median-priced option at the Venetian, I would definitely return. Also a great place to just drop into to grab a beer on the go.
