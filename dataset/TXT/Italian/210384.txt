qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ What can I say? The pizza is the perfect New York style and these guys do it right. Also they put the P in Personal Service. That's not something you see much in this area. Most restaurants treat you like a number. Not these "goodfellas!" They take their pizza and their customers seriously. They make it a point to welcome you to the restaurant and most of the time they call their customers by name. That is a lost art and you gents have my admiration for pulling that off! There's a lot to be said for tradition and this is the way they did it back in the day and they did it right! My wife and I had our second trip to the place today and had the large pepperoni. It was cheesy and had plenty of fresh cut pepperoni on top. The dough was the traditional NY style that you can fold and eat on the go. The flavors made me think I was back home at Mario's Italian restaurant and really made me long for the good old days! The proprietors made darn sure we were happy with our meal and the service was excellent! Try this when you go: Just TRY and leave without the owners thanking you for coming in. You will NOT make it out without them at least thanking you and possibly shaking your hand. Also the walls are literally covered with autographed photos of all the greats from the entire cast of  "The Godfather" to the "RatPack". The atmosphere was nice and quiet and the A/C works great so you won't be uncomfortablet! If you want true New York style pizza and some of the best service in the valley then look no further than this little place (locally owned and operated by the way!) on Val Vista just south of Baseline. You'll thank me later.
