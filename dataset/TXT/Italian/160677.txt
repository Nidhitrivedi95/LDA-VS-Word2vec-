LiSt3sVWELm7nfVIKJs0MA I don't come often anymore, as I said in my previous review, so I didn't know the menu had changed. Julia, my millennial waitress, asked me if I needed a minute before I even opened the menu, but I knew I just wanted the small spaghetti so I ordered. I was surprised a salad didn't come with it anymore, but they aren't very good anyway, so ok. I was shocked when she brought out the spaghetti--it was in a small, child-sized bowl. I tried to say something, but she walked away. I saw on the bill that it was a side order of spaghetti. Did Julia say that before she gave the order to the kitchen? Of course not. I am so tired of millennials in the work place who have no clue that going through the motions of working isn't the same as actually doing the job.
