ypIva71uwehmjr1pvLWr9g Wow! I am not a vegetarian in the slightest but popped over for a meal as I work nearby. I actually went 3 days in a row and I now might have a problem. Actually booked the restaurant out for my wife's birthday :-).

The fresh made to order pizzas are incredible. Amazing amazing amazing.

Had a chat with the gent who opened the restaurant and he's been working in Edinburgh restaurants a while and decided to pursue his passion of his own restaurant.

So if you're looking for an amazing pizza (Quattro Formaggi for me) check this place out! Authentic Italian, with lots of love and passion in the service a food! 

Have to say it. Best pizza in Edinburgh!
