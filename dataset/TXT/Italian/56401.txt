AKQbrvRBZvU5kB9Ut4gVkg Best part of the night was how incredibly informed the waiter was... however after we got our food he pretty much disappeared. someone else had to ask us about dessert and clear our plates. 

Appetizers very good (mozzarella ball was 5 stars!!), drinks ok. Bread was ok and served with infused olive oil that really needed some olive purée, balsamic, or other herbs on the side, but they were nowhere to be found. 

Mains ok, but not for the price, even the pizza was 'meh.' 
The pasta with mussels, clams, shrimp, and scallops was way off with the spices for my taste (too spicy for a seafood pasta dish, and I love spicy food, but not for this). 

We were very happy with walking in on a Friday and them being able to text us when a table was ready, but otherwise I'll keep going to other Italian restaurants no matter if they are cheaper or more expensive.
