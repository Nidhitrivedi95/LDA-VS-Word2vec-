RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ Hotel restaurant.... Overpriced for mediocre food and terrible service; right? WRONG!!

We had gotten out and about while in Phoenix but finally decided to stay local and went to the Pointe which is on the top of the hill from the resort we stayed at The Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort.

We walked from our room, not for the faint of heart, and the grounds, and the building are beautiful, rocks, fountains, landscaping and all.

The third floor is where the main dining room is and as we past the second floor leading up we past a Christmas party which looked sheik, and I thought wow, that's a good sign if locals go here. The view is breathtaking and my pictures don't do it justice but their web site does. We were seated by the window and Corey took care of us along with an unnamed busser who was equally skilled. 

We started with Blood Orange And Rocket Arugula Salad, and Roasted Butternut Squash Ravioli. Both Outstanding in the WOW category. We followed that up with: 
Pan Seared Diver Scallops
charred organic rainbow cauliflower, roasted sun chokes, black fermented garlic, apple basil evoo emulsion
And:
A filet Mignon that today I can't find on their site the way we had it. With mushrooms, and blue cheese. See picture.

We closed with:
Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Crème Brûlée
lemon cooler cookie, fresh berries

and coffee

We were not rushed for an hour and half, and the service was perfect. There, pleasant and efficient as we needed and disappeared when we didn't. 

It is pricy. What restaurant with outstanding view, ambience, service, and food isn't?
