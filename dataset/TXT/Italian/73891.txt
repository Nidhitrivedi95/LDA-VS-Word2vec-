cOWXtCz7F9GQhPIks8gm6Q Based on the great yelp reviews and food photos, my husband n I finally go to try this restaurant. 
It is a bit of hidden from Main Street n it seems like doesn't have parking area.  You will have to park in the opposite side of the street which is two hour free parking n was across by the underground.  
The atmosphere and service are good which I would probably rate 4 star, however, the food is only decent.  
The appetizer is crabcake which tastes rele like microwave food. 
For the main course, we order the ribeye steak and shrimp scampi pasta. It is pitiful that they have changed the menu which means I can't find the food from many of the yelp photos. Luckily the steak and pasta are all good.  I like the steak how they cook for medium, crispy outside and juicy inside.  The only con I can think of the pasta is very small portion but it tastes great. 
We order the tiramisu afterwards, I don't rele like it.  I can still feel the sand taste of sugar which doesn't blend well.
