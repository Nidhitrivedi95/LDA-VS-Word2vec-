3cbsPfoUUrysf-M8FI_0IA Decent food, terrible service.

We came here after reading an article that said this was a good place to get brunch. The article was wrong. Place was extremely hot, we had to wait 20 min to get a table and another 20 minutes to order our food. Waitress didn't bring our orange juice, forgot to refill my coffee, did not refill our water and took too long to bring the check. 

Brunch is cash only.
