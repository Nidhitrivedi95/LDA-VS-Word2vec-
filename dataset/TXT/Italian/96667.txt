esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA This place is frustrating.  For years this was the first place I went to for lunch after arriving in town.  Oysters are one of my very favorite foods.  I loved eating at the oyster bar and slurping down a half dozen Blue Points.  I would then have either their superb Caesar salad with grilled shrimp or excellent crab Louis.  But the service is horrendous.  They are understaffed and, while some of the servers are nice, here is the main problem: the servers, cooks, and oyster shuckers all share the same tasks.  It takes forever to get your food.  There is no management here whatsoever.

Worst of all, I had been coming here a lot and it got to the point where I would be sitting there for a good ten or fifteen minutes before anyone even acknowledged me.  One of the guys even seemed pissed at me for no apparent reason.  And the last - and final - time I went here, there were bits of shell in my raw oysters.  Despite some really exceptional seafood, this place does not know how to treat customers.  There are plenty of other places I would rather spend my money at in Vegas.
