9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw I really want to give this place a higher score, but I'm torn because while I have been here a great many times, and often bring visiting friends and family, I was pretty peeved at the service last Friday night 6-12-2015. 

I genuinely got the feeling that the management had taken the night off, and the inmates were running the asylum because despite the fact that the place was somewhat empty by the time we got there, late in the evening, the front-of-house staff was out-to-lunch so to speak.

The place was really noisy despite being half empty. The water they brought was warm as were the three glasses they brought. We also had to push pushes to the adjoining empty table because the staff wasn't removing them.

One thing they don't put on the menu is that if you opt to order a Coca-Cola vs. say some beer, etc., the soda comes in a can (which had a weird smell to it), and at $2 for a can and a warm glass, it's a pretty extreme 10x markup.

Food-wise, the pizza to get remains the tricolore.

We tried the arancini as an appetizer, and it lacked seasoning. The server brought a small tin of marina, which wasn't enough for the 4 balls, and when we asked for more, they failed to bring more. In the end, we didn't finish the appetizer because the balls got cold.

My father got the bolognese, which I didn't try, though he said mine had more flavor. 
I'd really like to try the other pasta dish sometime, as it looks quite good.

It would seem this restaurant has seen better days, but I'm not sure. If they make some small changes in the kitchen and retrain the wait staff, it might be worth visiting again.
