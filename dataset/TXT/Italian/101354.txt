fckUjXz1GKpafT4x7-MVJA There was a 40min wait for Valentines dinner,  understandable so my Hubby and I waited at the bar, ordered a bottle of wine. Our buzzer went off we went to the hostess area, we were then seated.  A manager came up immediately said told the waitress to leave our table. Proceeded to accuse us of bring the wine into their restaurant. Told him that we paid $25 when I could have purchased it at Safeway for $12, had him feel the bottle that it was chilled. He was oh sorry & walked away. Everyone in the room was staring, shaking their heads. I went to speak with Bartender, who apologized up & down knowing we were celebrating Valentines and early Wedding Anniversary. Manager came back to our table, couldn't give us a straight answer of how could we bring it in their place when we were called for the table from the bar area. They comped the meal but that doesn't excuse the fact how embarrassed we were, stating its hid fault for not looking into it before coming to us. Waitress was very nice.
