aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA I stumbled into Ian's Pizza after midnight, and after going out to a bar. I imagine Ian's, a pizza by the slice joint with creative vegetarian options, makes most of its money that way. The line moves quickly, and the patrons are as noisy as they come, but the pizza is worth it.

I had a slice of pesto pizza and a slice of macaroni and cheese pizza. The crust was nice and thin, and the majority of the pizza was comprised of the toppings, which worked out well for these pasta pizzas. The pesto pizza was great: it lacked a strong pesto sauce, but it had this excellent combination of noodles, cheese, and seasoning. The mac and cheese pizza was also tasty. The mac and cheese actually sits on top of a white sauce. Each bite was better than the previous. A part of me thinks that Ian's offers better mac and cheese on its pizza than some Madison restaurants offer in their dinner entrees.

The service here was fine. It's the kind of place where you tell one dude what slices you want , who tells another dude what pizza to put where, who tells another dude what to yell out. It was a bit hectic, and there was plenty of miscommunication at the pizza pick up counter, but it ended up alright.

I'd definitely return if I was in the area craving pizza, or looking for food after a night of drinking.
