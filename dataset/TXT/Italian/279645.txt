yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w This is one of me and my wife's absolute favorite places to eat I Vegas. We only found it when  we were at "Tickets for Tonight" getting tickets for Blue Man Group when the ticket agent asked where we planned to eat that night and if he could interest us in a discounted meal someplace. My wife was in the mood for Italian and none of their discounts were for an Italian restaurant. Instead, he told us we should go check out Battista's if we wanted a really great Italian meal. We went that night and have been going back every time were in town ever since. From the moment you step inside until the moment you leave it feels like you've entered a cozy restaurant in Italy.

The food is great! The all you can drink red or white house wine is pretty tasty. It's a multi-course meal finished off with a cappuccino. I highly recommend it to everyone who visits Vegas and wants a great meal experience.
