5p5YW_5bMOSuLIQjkJPO3w First off if you have not been here GO! it is hands down the best Italian restaurant in Wisconsin. Im serious, unbelievable. This is true Napoletano food.  

With that said, when you grow up in an Italian household italian food is something you hold special, almost sacred in some regards. You often feel that no one will make it like nonna or momma. Well...Salvatore does. He makes dishes that you just simply cannot find anywhere outside of Italy or someone's grandmother's house. 

I read a negative review earlier and could only think to myself that these people are probably used to the never ending breadsticks of Olive Garden. I have eaten here many times and everytime the food keeps getting better.  

This is a special place. It is 1000% worth going. If you have never been to Italy go to Naples 15 and you have.

This is as good as it gets.
