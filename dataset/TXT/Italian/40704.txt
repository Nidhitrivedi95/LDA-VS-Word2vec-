7HjVdfoTqs4YbKqmoyKOeQ I love this pizza hut as it is slightly outside city centre, it is much more chilled out and there seems to be less haste to eat.
They do a great selection of pizza, pasta and extras and it is great value. 
The staff are really friendly and it has a nice local feel to it as the staff always seem to know people eating there.
There is not much room to eat in though but you can take away or have food delivered.
