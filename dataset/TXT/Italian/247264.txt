VA95qAV2PRH9gtTi2Vfv4Q My friends just took me here on a recent weekday evening to celebrate my birthday.  I have been here many-a-time and agree with others that it is a good go-to place.  But you need to get there early if you want a spot on either patio!  This place is full of Yorkville-philes and I admit that while we waited for a table upstairs, we had plenty of people watching to keep ourselves amused.  So much botox, peeled faces, diamonds and mini-dogs in shoulder bags walking past!

If you can get a table on the upstairs patio, that's the best spot.  Especially the table in the far corner against the wall.  There are plenty of burlap wrapped outdoor pillows to recline on.

The food is good.  I had a pizza with rosemary and thin sliced potatoes that was really bland, by my friends enjoyed their pasta dishes.  I had a few glasses of chianti which made the meal that much more enjoyable.  Our waiter was not very friendly, and I actually recognize him from all the years I have been eating here.  He was just as unfriendly as I remember him being.  He offered parmesean and pepper to my friends and just walked away when I said, "I'll have some."

Overall I do like it here, but it's fairly standard, slightly overpriced Italian food.  Yes I will go here again.  Maybe for a different pizza.
