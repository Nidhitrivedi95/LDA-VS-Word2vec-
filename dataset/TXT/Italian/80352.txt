d5TMOfz_CrjKDGbIpfoVCA The food was excellent! We loved the fact that you can get different portion sizes-everyone can have a taste of everything! I would compliment the specific dishes but I can't pronounce half of them (authentic Italian names). 

The service was good but our server was actually kind of abrasive. I appreciate a server with a sense of humor that likes to interact with the table, but his humor was pretty sarcastic and even rude at times. Kind of put a damper on the night a little. 

That being said, I give dinner 5 stars and the "show" 1 star.
