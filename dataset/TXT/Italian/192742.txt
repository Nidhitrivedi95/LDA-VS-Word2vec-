pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ All I can really say is Wow!!! The food is great, the best Italian food I've ever had, pizza is wonderful.
Anytime I'm in Las Vegas I will be stopping here!!!!
Better food here than anywhere I've been on the strip. A local friend told me about this place and I'm so glad he did. With so many places to eat in Las Vegas you can get lost but this one is worth checking out.
The place is always crowded so you got to expect to wait some but great food is worth it.
