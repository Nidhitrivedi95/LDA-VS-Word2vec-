VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w I feel like a hillbilly!  This is my first time back to Vegas after 8 yr. Crazy!  "Wow it so big,Ma " and real purty. 

How do I rate the restaurant on food service, location or decor? 
Food wAs average,  the wait for a table inside was an hour, the location and view on the hot patio was amazing but itS 90° at night and too hot to eat.  The decor is supposed to be a Turkish bath leading up to the club on the second flooR. Cool bar nice lounge.  I hear its a small intimate club but nice. 

But wez here to eatz.  So, my friend lives here and says they're known for their balls.  Huge meatballs! !! Really with the heat we were full with that and the yummy garlic bread. It was a huge 4" meatball with Italian grown toMatos. Its just large not that tasty. I prefer small and tasty cuz really size isn't everything.  Then I had eggplant rigatoni. H'm whatever a little over salty a little dry and like most Italian I feel I make better at home. Prices are reasonable, meatball with whipped ricotta $20. Rigatoni $24.

Waiter was nice.  The benefit of sitting outside waS watching the cheesy. siren show at the TI. it seemed very similar to the pirate battle.   

We were too full to eat our food, so we asked them to box it. Remember my friend lives here.  The buss boy not understanding, since he's esl, stacked our food and tossed it. We only had two bites literally.  So the waiter says sorry, it's tossed.  If you want to wait it'll be a while.  OKAY. We'll wait. I'm still drinking my champagne anyways. So they prepared both all over so he can have leftovers. ;) I thought it was funny. The waiter was cool about it. 
Food taste average, but overall experience adds an extra gold star.
