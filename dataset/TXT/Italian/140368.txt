jkK0tP2Emh0nvKN5lHwtSw We hadn't eaten here in many years - we always felt it was not great.

We've recently been for dinner on 2 separate occasions and are now fans. The menu is varied, includes pasta, meat options, pizza. The flavours of the pasta and pizza we had were very good. Salads make good starters.

Portions large, prices fairly reasonable.  They have several choices of wine by the half litre.
