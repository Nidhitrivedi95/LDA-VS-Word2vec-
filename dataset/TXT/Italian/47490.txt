I made my reservation for 8 weeks in advance. This was my bachelorette party "nice meal out" and I was so so so excited. I had studied the menu for weeks, had picked out the wine I wanted, had planned my outfit. Saying I was excited is honestly an understatement. Of all the things I was prepared to be, disappointed was not one of them.

The service was seriously lacking. For the amount of money we were paying, the service was terrible. Our "captain" was terrible. He was far more concerned with the guys next to us buying wine to understand that we wanted to keep the cocktails flowing and get some desserts. The meal took 3.5 hours. If I thought the service was bad, I surely wasn't prepared for the food.

Horribly over-priced poorly crafted food. The "free" items they give you are flavorless. I've had better buffalo mozzarella from the pizza place down the street.  As for entrees, there were a variety of options at the table including lobster ravioli, truffle cream ravioli, chicken dishes, and some other things I can't remember. None of them memorable, some barely palatable, all of them over priced. 

The best part was I had to go back to the hotel room after dinner because I got sick. Great time...in that not at all way.


I would not reccomend this restaurant to anyone. There are far too many top quality restaurants in Vegas to waste your money here. I wish I had gone to Circo or Sinatra instead.
