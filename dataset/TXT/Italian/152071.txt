kR4NBNFf5SLpeAtZ-uPoPg Got a whiskey and banana while the hubby got chocolate rum and whiskey! This is the best creamiest gelato I have ever had. The flavors meshed so well together and the texture was so creamy and light. Better than gelato spot. Customer service is good too. 
We will be back for sure. I wish I could go in and get more right now! Lol
Try it :)
