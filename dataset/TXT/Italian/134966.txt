IT0IODInyhKbG4a_ka71MQ Disappointing,  ordered sausage pizza slice 1visit, excellent. Today, 2 slices, warm not hot on tin plate, burnt crust, no tomato sauce, stingy on cheese and thin slices of sausage falling off. Never again. Didn't complain because friend invited me and was paying, but never again.
