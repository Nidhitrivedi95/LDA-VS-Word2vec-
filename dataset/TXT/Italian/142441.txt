jpn329BeGpfAa9n1uPYOrA First timers tonight...my fiancée and I ordered take-out, Ravioli, Chicken Parm, and wedding soup. Felt as if I was back in my grandfather's kitchen as we began enjoying our meal. The ingredients were fresh, the sauce (very important) was on point, portions were adequate, homemade bread which was thick, warm and even more delicious when dipped in the sauce. We will be back, perhaps next time we will dine in their cozy, intimate atmosphere with a view of, and scents from the kitchen. Cannot wait for round two. Thank you Chef Frank!
