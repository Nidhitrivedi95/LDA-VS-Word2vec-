H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g Ok,so we stopped in for happy hour. We considered dinner as the menu looked great!  They asked if we wanted water. Never got it! Ordered a drink and got it 20 minutes later. Service was awful! The staff was hanging around 5 fold!  So many choices in Vegas! This was unacceptable. We settled for a weak appetizer at best and abandoned dinner to avoid future neglect!
