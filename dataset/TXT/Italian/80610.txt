d8LRNKz3_Cc5MlEQGWZ5Ag I was just moving into the neighbourhood that morning and needed to get a quick sandwich and coffee before the movers came, so I ran into this place even if the name irritated me and was soooo disappointed. The woman from the back kept barking orders for the girl at the front who was obviously new. My bagel with cream cheese and tomato and cucumber was terrible. The tomato was tasteless and had a very filmy consistency so I took it off my bagel completely. The cream cheese was very loose and the wrong consistency. I didn't even finish the whole thing. Who can screw up a bagel and veg? The coffee for a drip cup was nothing to complain about at least.

The meal was way too overpriced and my seat didn't even have a cushion which meant I was about to sit down on metal planks. They should either get rid of it or put another cushion on. I have a feeling no one really inspects the interior, or the display. The cakes were in cardboard boxes that looked like they were from Costco. I don't understand how people sit there to eat when Leslieville is booming with better cafes. Maybe they're making the mistake I made.
