tVyLQzyhhinKcGzlZIFZjQ My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time this past Sunday afternoon. We're new to the area and up until this point had not found a good pizza place. The food here was delicious. We ordered the garlic cheese bread and cheese pan pizza, both were amazing. The garlic bread was a meal in itself and arrived pretty quickly. The pan pizza exceeded my expectations. I especially enjoyed the crust which was buttery and flakey, something I had never experienced before. The cheese was gooey and fresh, and the sauce was well seasoned. 

Our server was polite and attentive. He let us know that the pizza would take up to 40 minutes. We decided to stick it out and just relax and enjoy the experience. The appetizer came out quickly, and the pizza did not take 40 minutes, more like 25 or so. I loved the food and highly recommend this restaurant.
