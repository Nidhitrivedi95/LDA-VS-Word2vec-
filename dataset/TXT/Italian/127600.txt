HVFKw_1abKVGYscxYKlKYA This place is as far from a Chicago Beef than I've seen here in Las Vegas. Starting out the beef here is packaged and shipped in from Arizona. When I asked one of the girls at the counter about the prepackaged beef she replied " even the Al's Beef in Chicago gets there beef from Arizona" hahaaa, are you kidding me?
Shes obviously not from Chicago! If you're from Chicago or know Chicago beef sandwiches then you know the beef is cooked fresh daily. The next thing I was disappointed about was the ridiculous prices. I'm not paying over $11 for a beef sandwich. And finally the customer service, the girl at the ordering register was extremely nice and outgoing. The staff you receive your food from are absolutely miserable and unprofessional. In my opinion this place won't last, unless it is supported buy a bunch of people who like overpriced prepackaged beef sandwiches. Sad to hear the word Chicago affiliated with this place :(
