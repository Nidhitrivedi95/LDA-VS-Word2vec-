SzTK3GPoFIkb6k322f1Mmw I love their pizza, but I tried to call to pick up a pizza tonight and was put on hold.  For 5 minutes!  I thought they forgot about me, so I called back and was asked to hold again.  I told them I wanted to order a pizza and was already on hold for 5 minutes.  I was told, "well, could you just hold for a couple of minutes longer?" and was promptly put on hold again.  I gave up.  They got issues . . .
