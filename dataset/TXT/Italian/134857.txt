IsN0qEzgAXBjbT3qn6lokA My wife and I were in the mood for pizza and asked a couple friends for recommendations in our Scottsdale area.  They recommended Humble Pie.  We split a medium pizza.  It was delish.  We ordered an appetizer.  Well, friend green beans.  First time for everything.  We both really enjoyed them.  They were unique.  We were please with our service and the atmosphere.
