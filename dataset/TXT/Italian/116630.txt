The Bread on the Hoagie was pretty good, but I thought it was a little on the dry side.  Would have enjoyed a little more Oil in it.  The ingredients tasted fresh and it was a solid Sandwich.....not the best I ever had, but pretty good.  Will have to come back to try some of their other stuff.

They're not open on Sundays, so I'll have to try and squeeze in a visit during the week.
