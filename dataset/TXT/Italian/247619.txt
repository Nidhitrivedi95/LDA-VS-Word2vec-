VBcmyBxAPcpzbbnPbFfttA This place needs to be shut down. Service is barely medicore with the wait and management staff ignoring you.

The prices are very high while the food is better from frozen, I've literally had better food from a microwave dinner. They're using location and budget baller diners who think the food is good because the price is high.

1. Mandatory tips
2. Barely any service
3. Will not split bill
4. Extremely poor quality service and food
5. Will not make substitutes for allergies
6. Entire establishment is a failure

Just don't come here.
