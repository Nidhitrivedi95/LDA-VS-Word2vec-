Located in the MGM, this fancy little Italian restaurant was our spot for my girl's bachelorette dinner.  We had reservations and everything went smoothly, staff was friendly and attentive.

I guess I just wasn't amazed by the food.  I only enjoyed one out of the 4 courses, but at least it was the entree.  Our four course prix fix meal was around 75 bucks:

*salad- looked and tasted average
*small bowl of spaghetti- basically tasted like prego or ragu over noodles
*grilled sea bass- this was good and it was actually a pretty nice portion
* dessert looked like creme brulee but was not creme brulee.  I wish I could remember the name so I could warn you all not to get it.  The waiter said there is an alcohol in it, whatever it was there was waaaay too much in it.  The dessert was awful and I could only take two bites and I was done.  I laughed to myself when the waiter tried to make it sound like this was the best dessert ever because of this special alcohol.
