jOseCpGmgbQWEfX2Wn_TGQ This place was amazing.  I went there for lunch today and I can't wait to go back.  I was greeted at the door by Angelo, the owner.  I felt very special and welcomed.  The atmosphere was very intimate.  Kind of reminds you of an East Coast old school Italian restaurant.  

The trio of pasta was excellent.  My favorite was the gnocchi in Alfredo sauce.  All 3 were fabulous, but the gnocchi was exceptional. 

I've already made plans to go back for dinner with my husband.  

I went on Groupon, just to try it out, but I would have gladly paid full price.
