fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w I have been here every day for the last four days, and it really is incredible. All of the staff is really nice and fun to talk to. Everything that I've had off of the food menu has been incredible. I also have found it hard to find a bar with such great food (or food at all) so this this place hits the spot. It isn't crazy loud or anything. 
Definitely deserves the five stars.
