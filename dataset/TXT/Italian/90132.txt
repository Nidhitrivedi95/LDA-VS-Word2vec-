E9b73ETPw0VYUJ2_YSJJdQ Desperately craving pizza, but not of the Pizza Pizza variety, I headed to Pizza Rustica for the first time on the recommendation of a friend who had walked by it many times, never been, but ensured me it always smelt "very, very good".

We arrived at about 7:30 on a Friday night, and I was surprised at how very small this place is. There are about 10 - 15 tables and a bar area, and unfortunately we got there just as the last table was snapped up. Luckily there were 2 spots left at the bar, and we were able to get a drink while we waited. A nice surprise occured when our would-be waitress approached us and asked if we'd like to order before we got our table, as the food would arrive as soon as we were seated. Nice one. My stomach at this point was practically jumping out of my throat, so speed was key.

Once seated (about a 20 minute wait at the bar), our food arrived approximately 5 minutes later. I ordered the Tre Carne pizza, with a ton o' meat and banana peppers, onions and tomatoes. The ground beef was fantastic, really flavourful. The pizza itself had a nice thin crust and a thin but balanced layer of sauce and cheese. I personally am not a fan of thick crust or too much sauce - less is more, so this suit me perfectly.

All in all my pizza craving was asauged, and the leftovers (and unless you are ready to eat a small horse, there will be leftovers) tasted even better warmed and with a little hot sauce the next day. The place itself is a little small, so if there are no bar seats I'd move along, as the wait isn't worth it if you're standing around for 20 minutes.
