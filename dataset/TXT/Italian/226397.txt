srIy6x9Z_6hEHuGPE6L0dw CRAP! Ordered multiple different dishes and all of them were lacking immensely. Would NEVER recommend. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because they deliver through FoodieCall.  Food did NOT taste the way Italian food should taste. Very bland. Overcooked. Small portions. ICK. No thanks. NEVER AGAIN.
