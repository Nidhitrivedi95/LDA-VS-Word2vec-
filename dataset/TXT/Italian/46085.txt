8pGD3zt6HEL2xzaT3lqMFQ Ordered on Foodora. The sandwich was just a big sloppy soggy mess with very little flavour. So much sauce which just makes the massive piece of bread soggy. Nothing spectacular about the marinara sauce. Tasted like something I could have made and it sure what kind of cheese they used but it had zero flavour. The salad had a tiny amount of dressing drizzled on top which meant for a mostly dry flavourless salad. 

The reviews seem decent though so maybe I had a dud. Will give it another try.
