hSBf_UpaesTHenfCy2YO9A East side mario's  is okay. Chain restaurant I've been visiting since I was a kid. It has its ups and downs.

The decor is interesting. Literally interesting, neat stuff to look at and read throughout the dining room. I kind of like that, each part of the restaurant offers something different in that respect.

I have mixed feelings about the food. The garlic bread they bring out prior to the entrees is warm and delicious. It may very well be the best part of the meal. The Italian wedding soup is Campbells brand. I'm not kidding it's seriously Campbell's italian wedding. The pasta is alright, nothing extraordinary. The thing about East Side Mario's is that all of the food is acceptably good, but nothing more.

The service is usually quite good though. Servers are always attention and courteous, and in a few cases hilarious. A good server always helps the experience in my mind.

It's worth a visit if you feel like an inexpensive meal out.
