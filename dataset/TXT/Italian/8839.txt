0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ I really wanted it to be good, but... Had the lunch special: 7" 1 topping pizza, caesar salad, & drink. Not a bad deal. I asked the guy behind the counter what neapolitan dough was. He had no idea & when he asked someone, still no real explanation. Not a good start.
The salad was good enough. Pizza was dry, not enough sauce or cheese & just dry. Bummer. I really had high hopes.
