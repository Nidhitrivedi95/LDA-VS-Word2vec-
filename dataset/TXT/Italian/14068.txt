1Bc4KYox4Fux-aLV4OfFnA Awesome unique style pizza. If you ever had a vinnie pie from Vincents pizza on rt30 then you know what you're getting. If not make the trip to try it out. You'll be hooked! This place has the pizza from what used to be Vincents. There's none other like it. Biggest pizza with the most toppings I've seen.
