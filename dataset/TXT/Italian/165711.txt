M8jzd1hpwI8p0JqcBCINZw This place was okay.  I think I'd stick to drinks and appz, and go somewhere else for the mains. 
I had the ravioli, my friends had the arrabbiata, veal parm, and penne alla vodka.  All so-so, particularly for $15+ for each.  And i wasn't particularly full after that.
The service was excellent, attentive, friendly, and up for some banter, which I always enjoy.
I had a few of the "lust" martini's, which had tasty mango juice, among some other stuff.  And, you just can't beat the cheap pints on Thursdays and Fridays.
