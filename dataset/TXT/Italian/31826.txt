5pObrGpv1Is5WLDeOFSDIQ Horrible experience! After waiting an hour I got a cold pizza delivered to me! Best of all it had no sauce! Didn't want to wait so just got jimmy johns next door! Called the manager, Denice to explain frustration of what transpired the previous day only to be told to argue with the rude manager. This place sucks!
