BMR_AsSBzTQHqW-SQabI4w Love this place! I usually do not go to Ross Park without stopping here. The best fish tacos I've had outside of San Diego, which is kind of funny considering it's a pizza chain. The staff is great, with Chuck and Carlos being my favorite. It's hard to order dessert there with the Cheesecake Factory being next door, but if your not a fan, the tiramisu is pretty good.
