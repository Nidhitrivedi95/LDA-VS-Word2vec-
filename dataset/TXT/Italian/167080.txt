Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw I can honestly say, that I've had the best "Italian" named Italian sandwich, in my X3 years of life.  Granted, it's official name was "Italian #2" but, I'm sure I'd like #1 too.  My #2 had Salami, Cappicolo and Provolone, very simple right?  It was one flavorful sandwich, with a bang.  The ingredients, meats and cheese were fresh as you could taste the flavors of everything.  I especially loved the Cappicolo, which provided such a kick to the sandwich.  I've eaten Cappicolo before but, it was more like cRappicolo because it never tasted anything like this!

The s/o ordered one of their Canolli's.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw?select=ub8c8QJ5J1U2B-hbfpYvLA  It was delish and cheap!

I love everything about Cugino's; their shop, the food, the overall feel, the smell of the shop, not sure what it is but Italian deli's have "that smell" and lastly, the family that runs it is pretty nice.

Cugino's, among the million other things about Vegas, sure makes me wish I lived there, well maybe more towards Henderson. :)  In the meantime, my jealousy shall continue.
