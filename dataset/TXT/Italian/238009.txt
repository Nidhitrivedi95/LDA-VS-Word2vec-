u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg This is where it all started, my devout love for Postino. I've been coming here so long that I remember when you could still get pizzas brought over from LGO next door. I miss those days!

I mainly go to the Gilbert location since that's where I live, but I still stop by here from time to time. In Gilbert, you can't get wine to go unless the bottle is opened so the Arcadia location is useful for picking up something on the racks to take home. This store is also less busy than Gilbert so I enjoy the peaceful atmosphere at lunchtime.

Postino, thank you for being a friend.
