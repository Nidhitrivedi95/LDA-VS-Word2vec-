2QBD8wYCrwgOGRfHKvS23w My wife and I were passing through and had a hankering for pizza.  We really lucked out with this place!  The pizza is NICE! They have a great house made balsamic vinaigrette. We also tried this little Jamaican meat pie that was sort of like an empanada with jerk spiced ground beef filling. Oh, so tasty!
Anyway, check this place out if you live in Kannapolis or are just passing through.  We will for sure.
