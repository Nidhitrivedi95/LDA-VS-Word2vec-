u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg I'd been hearing about Postinos from some food snob friends of mine so I decided to try it out this past Friday night.  Got there at 7 p.m. and scored a table with no wait in the middle of the dining room.  Immediately I realized it was a little too loud for the audience with the music playing, but stuck it out.  I was meeting my friend's parents who were in town on vacation and thought it would be a nice, casual place with hopefully great wine and food.  They loved the architecture inside, with the exposed pipes and brick and large, open garage doors.  The patio was probably not quite as loud, but was full so we were definitely stuck inside.  

I had a glass of $11 Malbec, which was fantastic.  We ordered the bruschetta and I im in love with the artichoke version as well as the apple and brie.  I was not blown away by the mozzerella and tomato, which I thought I had heard was a guaranteed good time.  I also got the turkey panini though which I got with a salad.  It was bigger than any panini I've ever had and I took half of it home.  It had  a pesto sauce that made it the best panini I think I've had in my lifetime.  (Maybe I've had ten paninis though in my lifetime so take it for what it's worth.)  The salad I was not blown away by and was not disappointed when the waiter took it away while asking if he could take it away.

Service was a little slow, but again it was a Friday night.  The wait staff is a friendly, helpful group and didn't rush us as we sat and chatted while eating for three hours.  

Valet is $3, which is fair, but what is a riot is when you walk out, if you had your keys, you could walk the twenty feet and get your car yourself.  But instead, you have to wait behind five people for the valet to hand you your keys and THEN you walk to your car.  AFTER tipping of course:)

Overall, I will go back for the paninis, maybe try a few other bruschettas.  It will be hard to not to to LGO next door though...
