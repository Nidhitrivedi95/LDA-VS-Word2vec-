r03BNov4Uyul5bJzlgWdJQ My husband and I went here to grab a quick bite. We both decided on getting the arugula salad with chicken breast, as we thought this would be quick, as we had an appointment to attend to. We waited at least 25 minutes for salad to be served to us. Menu stated arugula salad had cherry tomatoes and shaved parmigiano cheese. The salad we got was very small for price, there were maybe 6 pieces of halved cherry tomatoes and barely no shaved cheese. When I asked for some bread, waiter responded that "we do not usually serve bread with salads". He brought us 2 pieces  of white pizza reluctantly. From my experience today, I'll take my business elsewhere thank you.  Response from owner below very condescending.
