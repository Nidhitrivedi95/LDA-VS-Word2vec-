pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Based on the reviews that brought us to Pizzeria Bianco, we were expecting something more.  The pizza was just average (we had three different types).  I doubt that a month from now that any of us will even remember anything about the experience---EXCEPT, the caprese salad was amazing!  The in-house made mozzarella really stood out (but no so much on the pizza).  Also, I thought it was very overpriced for the return on flavor/atmosphere. Won't be back, there's better options elsewhere.
