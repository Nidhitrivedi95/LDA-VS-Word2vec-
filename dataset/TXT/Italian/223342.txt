SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw The best garlic knots I have ever had!  Delicious garlic flavor, without being too salty or too doughy.  I was surprised at how light and fresh they tasted.  If you like garlic knots, it's worth coming out of your way just to get these.

The pizza was a good value, but just not to my personal taste.  It was definitely New York style, with a strong herbs taste.  It was just a little too much cheese and grease for me, I prefer a lighter style of pizza. 

The $4.99 sliders are a fabulous value for a lunch-size meal (although they are available anytime).  The fries could have been a tad more crispy.

The customer service was friendly.  If you like New York style pizza, you should try this place out for sure.
