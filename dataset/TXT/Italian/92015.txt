eGTAC8EzcHiYnnZ52tijiQ Anyone in the West end should know about Stoney's!  They have fabulous lunches.  Their sandwiches are out of this world, fresh bread every day.  I most recently went there for breakfast on a Saturday and they did not disappoint.  I got a spinach fritatta and it was fabulous.  Big chucks of mushroom and cheese with spinach.  The side salad was perfectly dressed.

They have great coffee as well.  I would recommend going there for their Sunday brunch which I have heard great things about.
