lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ Came here with my family this past week.  Besides the annoying people at Excalibur trying to constantly sell something the overall experience was great.  The food was super yummy and priced very affordably. If you go to the Buca Di Beppo website they will send you an offer for a free small spaghetti, alfredo or baked ziti.  We opted for the baked ziti which was delicious. My husband ordered a pepperoni pizza which he enjoyed.  We had more than enough food for us and our two children. It is not fine dining but for a family in Vegas or a large group it is a great place to go.
