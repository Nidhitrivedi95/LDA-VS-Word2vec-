cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA I have been to the Giordanos in Chicago and fell in love with the pizza, so my anticipation was high. We went at 3 pm to avoid the line and long wait. It still took about an hour to get our pizza. When it arrived the pizza crust was burned and I was very disappointed. I will say that our waiter Camden was attentive to my concern and I do understand that the restaurant  is new and has kinks to work out. Manager Vicky came over to chat with us and agreed that our pizza was over cooked and comped our pizza. So cudos to the staff for making things right. Hopefully they will get their act together soon.
