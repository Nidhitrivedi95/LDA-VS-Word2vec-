dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg Holy Mario and Luigi. Now I know what it feels like when Mario eats one of those mushrooms and stomps on all those Goombas. By far the BEST authentic Italian experience that you can find here in Las Vegas. What's even better?! It's off the strip so you can enjoy reasonable prices and be spared the presence of annoying tourists. Magnificent tasting food, exceptional service and they have couches that you can sit or lay on as if you were in your own home. Whoever gave birth to Chef Marc needs to be applauded and given a nobel peace price.

YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU! YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU!

If you don't like the Tiramisu here then your parents must have only fed you out of the cheap freezer aisle at the local 99 cent store during your childhood life. Hell, I'll let you kick me in the balls and twist my little pink nipples if you don't think that the Tiramisu here is the absolute BOMB.

Thank you Chef Marc! You're the best thing since my $400 Gucci wallet.
