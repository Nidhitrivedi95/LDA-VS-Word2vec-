Branden reached out to my wife and I, and graciously invited us back to try the gluten free pie. And I must say, for someone who isn't gluten free, I really did enjoy it. But most importantly my wife, who is gluten sensitive, REALLY enjoyed it, and that's what truly matters. I have to say Branden, and the staff there truly went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our return visit. 

Myself, I tried the meatballs for an appetizer, and a slice of cheese. Both very good. The marinara on the meatballs was out of this world good!  

Thanks again Branden, and staff at Evel Pie!!  You truly understand the meaning of exceptional customer service, and you gained customers for life with your willingness to reach out the way you did, and as quickly as you did. You truly have a gift when it comes to pizza making (I consider it art!!) and your talent really shows.
