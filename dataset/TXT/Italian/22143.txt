3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A I decided to try this place after reading the review in Toronto Life. Called this afternoon for a reservation at 6 pm.

Keep in mind, I am vegetarian and I can only speak to that portion of the menu.  I was quite impressed that I had an ample selection of appetizers and mains to choose from!  

The food was absolutely delicious!  I ordered the arancini with arugula and caramelized onions which was comparable to some of the best arancini I have had while in Italy.
I also ordered the chick pea fritters on a bed of lentils, almonds and celery.  The bed was quite tasty but I wasn't too impressed by the fritters.
We also ordered the ricotta ravioli with garlic pesto and breadcrumbs.  That was a joy as well!

We had the cioccolato doppio semifreddo for dessert which was fanastic.

I really enjoyed the service.  The staff was very helpful while we navigated the menu.  They were indeed very unpretentious as so many reviewers have noted.  The only drawback was that they were a tad too attentive when clearing tables. A few minutes after each dish, our plates were promptly removed.  I couldn't help but wonder if they wanted us out of there..... very un-italian.....
