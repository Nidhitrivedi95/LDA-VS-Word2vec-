98V9R-7YT20KmcmJyMiJmg I have had the opportunity to eat at this establishment a total of 3 times - 2 lunches and a dinner.

This place serves high quality classic Italian food the way you would get it in Italy (well not 100% but you get the point).  A lot of detail goes into the plating, portions and the flavours - which enhances the entire experience.  The environment is beautiful, quiet and blends it self nicely with the whole classic food theme.

The service is good - though I think the price is a tad on the high side - but for a night out its not bad for a nice dinner date.

In closing - if you think East Side Marios is amazing, your probably not going to like this place because its beyond your taste buds lol but if you think East Side offers sub par Italian food then your going to love this joint.
