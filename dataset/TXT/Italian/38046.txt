We went on a saturday night and as expected the place was crowded and lively. It has a casual but classy vibe. We had a 25 minutes wait which flew by quickly by checking out the grocery store connected to the restaurant. The cool knick knacks and gelato tasting took care of time. We ordered the Margharita, Fallen Angel and Rocket Man. The crust and the toppings are both fresh. We also ordered the soda, shrimp ceviche and french fries ...all delights on a warm summer evening. And finally gelatos to wrap up a fun evening. My friend also took a chocolate cupcake to go and sent a text raving about it after....Parking situation is tricky but luck gods shined for us last evening. I will certainly recommend this place to bring friends or guests to so they can see a different side of Phoenix....
