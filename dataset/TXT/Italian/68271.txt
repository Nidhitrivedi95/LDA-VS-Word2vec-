BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag This was a lucky find from Yelp. We were visiting from out of town and wanted an Italian place that wasn't too pricey.

We lucked out with friendly staff and tasty food. Happy plates all around.

Luckily, we had a reservation as waits were 30-45 minutes. We were seated on time and were greeted by the manager and the servers. Service was professional and timely.

We had the fried calamari and two salads (Caesar and arugula) . The calamari was not rubbery and the dipping sauce was great.

For meals, we had the trout special, bolognese pasta, and a pizza. Everyone enjoyed their dishes.

Worth going to next time I'm in town.
