irwDkp2eMP2x-4MfunRt8g Ever since Planet Hollywood purchased Buca and changed the recipes, this place has started to suck just a little. I USED to love this joint. Now, I just like it. The prices have gone up about 20% from just a couple of years ago. NO MATTER WHAT, do NOT go to any Buca without a $10 OFF coupon. The Entertainment Books are flooded with them and they are easy to get a hold of online. Smack in the face with your $10 coupon and enjoy a good, NOT GREAT dinner.
