azE1DNVQFBU8boVbaJhj7w Pastas are good. Their marinara penne though seemed something that was heated from a frozen food.  I have had their lasagna and Salmon also, both okay. The food is not bad, but at this price range I expect a lot more. You can get the same quality of food for a lot cheaper in Pittsburgh. We have been here more than once, so I feel like they have been given the chance. Would not return.
