qtotIYIF9U1PCEzMl1iE2w Went there expecting good Italian at least good càlzone. Ordered  " the works" w pretty good!  however...The place had about 6 people total in it all impressed me as local bar flies. There was one fat sloppy looking woman who kept yelling her head off. I don't know if she was drunk deaf or both!!!The music they were playing there made rap sound pretty good....I hate rap with a passion!!! Save yourself go to Red Robin or Bahn Thai in the area I don't think I could have drank enough to make that place look good!!!
