K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ The only thing I really like about this place was that it's inside the Bellagio (gotta love their pina coladas) and they gave me and girlfriends a shiz ton of drink tickets - which they let us use on Champs. 

We didn't stay long for more than a drink each. Place was filled with random people they pulled from the hotel. One of their promoters Brian Ratleff was a complete sleaze-ball and made tons of empty promises. 

There are far better nightclubs in Vegas - this, is definitely on the far end of the stick (at least for me).
