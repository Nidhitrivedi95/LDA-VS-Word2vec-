JPmu9-2jd7nGIuTXEqT9zg We went there last night for the first time, after living in the area for years.  It was quite charming inside.  The prices were more than reasonable.  The server was friendly and attentive.  We had a nice relaxing meal by the sunny window. Something that we don't see in Cleveland much, sun!  The food was good value for the money.  It's definitely an Italian restaurant.  Good bread....
