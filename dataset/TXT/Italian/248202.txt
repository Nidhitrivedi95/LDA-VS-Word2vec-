Not only is the food amazing, but Franco is there to greet you and see you leave. He gave a free glass of champagne, and antipasto appetizer to start the evening. I ordered the penne shrimp as an entree and it was absolutely amazing. Shrimp was cooked to perfection and the sauce was fantastic. As we stood up to leave, Franco came running over and asked us why we didn't order dessert. After we stated we were full, he told us "absolutely not, sit back down. You have to try my dessert" and boy he was right. He gave us free slices of flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake. It was just as amazing as the customer service and the love Franco has for his business and his guests. We will absolutely be coming back whenever we are craving pasta, and I will never skip Franco's dessert again! Call days in advance for a reservation- they fill up quickly.
