0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw Joes is overpriced and overrated. It's also not worth the ridiculously long line it ALWAYS has. I live across the street and the line is out the door for any regular meal time. Their food is fine, and the atmosphere is fun, but I don't feel it's worth the price or the wait. The best thing to get there is the breakfast. The prices for those are not too bad, and you get a ton of food. Pancakes rival cracker barrel. If you go on a weekday morning, the wait isn't too bad for breakfast.
