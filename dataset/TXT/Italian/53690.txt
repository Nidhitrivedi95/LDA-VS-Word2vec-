I always get the veal Gorgonzola. And we always love the clams and mussels and the bread dipped in the broth is super fine.   This year my father got veal piccata, my husband got some sort of salad, my son a pesto pasta with meatballs, my mother chicken cordon bleu, and all loved their dinner.  Celebrating his 75th...hope to be back many years to come!
