mLP-jIIRdoaYM7fJqqFurw My first meal in Squirrel Hill while looking for an apartment (I'm moving from out of town) was at Napoli Pizzeria.  When I walked in there were several EMTs by the door, so I figured the food would be good.  What EMT would go to a bad pizza place?  

At the entrance to the left is the counter with some of the pies waiting to be heated back up in the oven and to the right several coolers with drinks in bottles from beer to soda.  I ordered two slices of pepperoni, which came out pretty quickly.  

The staff was friendly and the pizza had just about the right ratio of crust to cheese to sauce.  It was greasy, but not too greasy (read just the way I like it).  On a cold day, it was the perfect hot thing for lunch and wasn't too pricey either.
