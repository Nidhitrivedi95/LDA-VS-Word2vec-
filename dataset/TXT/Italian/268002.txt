XeUm1QS078kgjwONhul0ng One of my favorite lunch spots in the downtown/uptown part of Phoenix. It's the classic family-run Italian restaurant with some of the best pizza around.

Service is always friendly and prompt, which is no small feat at lunchtime, considering the place is typically packed. I think I've probably tried half of the menu, plus a number of the daily specials, and everything is consistently good. The New York style pizza (pick up, fold in half, go nuts) comes in large slices with generous amounts of toppings. 

As for pasta, I can honestly say that I don't believe I've ever had an overcooked dish here, which is not something I can say about most Italian food restaurants. The ravioli is very good, as is the tortellini (when it's on special). I'm also partial to their salads, which are quite large. Both the chicken caesar and the tuna salad contain ample amounts of meat, which I prefer.

And if you want a great base for a sandwich, you can't get much better than their focaccia bread, which is soft and delicious.

The one thing that does rankle me about Pino's, however, is that they now have a $10 minimum purchase for credit card payment. I understand their reasonings for the move (credit card fees can rack up in a hurry for small businesses and take larger than expected bites out of profit margins), but as someone who rarely carries cash and doesn't always order a lot of food, it is a bit of a pain.

There also isn't much parking in front, but savvy patrons know to check the lot behind the restaurant and come in the back door.
