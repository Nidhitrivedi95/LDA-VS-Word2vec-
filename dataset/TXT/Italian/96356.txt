One time I forgot they were supposed to deliver it to my house so we drove down there after an hour and 15 mins to pick it up but the green car with one headlights out just left to deliver it.  We were able to pay there and meet our pizza back at my pad.  

But other than Pizza, I like to order the Chief.  They pile meat on top of meat here.  It's so good.  And you get a special dipping sauce as well.  In the past I've had the fried chicken and fries.  They were so crispy and oily greasy, it was good.  Not healthy but I won't deny how good they tasted!  

Inside the restaurant there are some nice good size TV!  Definitely a place I wouldn't mind watching a game while having a bite, it wouldn't be as loud as other places.
