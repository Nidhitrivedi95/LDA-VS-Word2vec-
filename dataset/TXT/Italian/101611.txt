FdiZDOs8LbSnBpA_e5R5HQ I love pizza and was close by and decided to stop at the location on Arizona ave. 

I was a little judgmental at first its not fancy or anything on the inside, a few chairs and tables so this place mostly gets carry out orders I'm guessing.

The food...I love pizza as I've already said and I was not dissapointed with this place it was hot and fresh and they have flavored crust ( butter,garlic and Romano cheese) AMAZING will definitely be back
