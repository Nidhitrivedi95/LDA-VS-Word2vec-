eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg We came to this restaurant on a whim after hanging out on Fremont Street, and it was one of the best impulse decisions made. The service was stellar -- even though we happened to show up while there was also a large party being served, the staff was very attentive to us as well as the other smaller tables. The food was excellent -- warm loaves of bread with garlic and basil infused olive oil for dipping are provided to every table, and we followed it up with perfectly tender calamari. Every person at my table had excellent reviews for our entrees, and understandably with a very large party ahead of us, the food was slightly delayed coming out, but honestly I've been to places like IHOP and waited far longer. Because of that little delay though, the manager provided dessert for free. 

Which comes to the highlight of the dinner: the strawberry cassata. If you come to this restaurant you cannot leave without trying this Italian wedding cake or you're simply wasting your time. So light and fluffy and moist, I can confidently say it was the best dessert I've ever had. Every future trip to Las Vegas for me will include stopping at the Grotto for their strawberry cassata on my itinerary. 

Special shout out to Carol of the wait staff, such a lovely and enthusiasticand funny woman!
