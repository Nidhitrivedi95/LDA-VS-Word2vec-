s_CFR6l-ecfGZ3tw16PJDQ I was very excited to order from a place called Doughboys. We got a medium pepperoni pizza delivered. They said it would take an hour but in came within 35 minutes. The pizza was hot and not soggy at all. The crust was incredible and puffy, sauce was alright and pepperoni a at flavor. Yum!
