EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw I wish Yelp had a category 'fit for foodies' because I would put Crudo there. We all loved it and we ordered 8 different things. We got there early, sat outside and it was almost empty but the time we left it was full with a fun easy energy. We'll definitely come back our next time through Phoenix.
