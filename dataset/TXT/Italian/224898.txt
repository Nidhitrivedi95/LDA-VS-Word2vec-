The restaurant is in Maple, but the wines and olive oils are from Sorrento, and the cuisine is from Sorrento. It's how he ate growing up. Is there a regional difference? "It's just the way we use the product." The olive oil, the herbs, the cherry tomatoes; it's all fresh and bold flavour that makes us feel like we really are in Sorrento. Whole adriatic salt-baked sea bass is served table-side. Delicately cracking open the salt casing reveals a wonderfully tender fish. Homemade Caramelle di Tartufo are luxurious bons bons of pasta filled with ricotta and black truffle, and enrobed in a rich porcini sauce. This will go down as one of my favourite dishes of 2014. There is such a jovial atmosphere as music plays and decadent desserts seduce my sweet tooth. 

"I want to make my customers speak Italian with me", Cioffi enthuses.
