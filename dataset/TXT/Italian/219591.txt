SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg I went to herb and rye with a few friends for a birthday party, being that I rarely eat chicken let alone any other meat I was bit weary. 

When we walked in the steak house has the ambiance of a haunted house with there being almost NO LIGHTING,old antique decorations, and creepy paintings. The menu is very brief but VERY DIFFICULT to read with the lack of lights. 

I did find a pasta dish on the menu and ordered that, much to my delight. Also found an alcoholic drink that was very tasty. I made the mistake of telling the waiter I needed more time while everyone else ordered their first round of drinks and I didn't get another chance to order for about 20 minutes, also takes a solid 15 minutes for the bartender to make it. 

Over all great food and drinks how ever the ambiance and service time suffer badly, also pretty pricey it was $450 for 5 people. A great place to go for a special occasion, but wouldn't go for a random dinner.
