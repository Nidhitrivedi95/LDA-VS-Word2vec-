VsHhy9ixEze-AxNYt6UxLA I bought a coupon from LocalDines for Crust and after reading the reviews I thought I'd give it a try. I went with my bf and we started with the Caprese salad (full $7.95) It was good, but not your regular caprese salad, it was on a bed of lettuce and served in a bread bowl. Not that much caprese cheese tho :( and very thinly sliced. We ordered two of the rustico's since that is what they are known for. The Original Rustica - marinated tomatoes, fresh mozzarella & basil ($ 8; see picture) and The Palermo - fresh spinach, marinated tomatos, mushrooms, fresh mozzarella and EVOO ($8.50; see picture). They were both really good, thin crust so they are quite light for the size of them. The waitress informed us that we hadn't spent up to the $30 on our coupon (which was super nice of her) and offered 3 cannoli's to make it $30. SUPER good, this was my favorite part of the restaurant, fresh baked cannolis YUM! We would go back if we were in the area but nothing super super special -- i still like upper crust better :)
