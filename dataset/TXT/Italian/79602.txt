d1_Ko1DQ4QyB9BjnCFjVLw A decent Italian place up near Arrowhead that is just OK.  Don't be alarmed by the tragically boarded up shopping center.  Been there a few times for lunch.  Don't get me wrong, it's better than an Olive Garden, but after each time I go there - nothing strikes me much to rush back for my next meal.   The insides feature faux brick, with painted on ivy, stacks of wine crates and tomato jars.  Oooh, aaah, bleh. Yesterday I had the marinara chicken with tortellini...pretty average.  I had a taste of the 14th St. pizza - very good, btw.  The pasta chips were ick.  They need to stop that, NOW.  The service yesterday was OK, a bit long, but OK.  A good-sized selection of menu items featuring chicken dishes, pizzas and a build your own pasta thing.  Yawn.
