7qo6rqDjlHds8ObxzxBD4A What a find!  We gave this place a try after hearing from others how good it was and getting a discount through Local Flavor.  We had been to a pizza place that was previously in this location which wasn't very good, so we were skeptical.  Everything about our first meal here was absolutely fantastic.  Even though they were quite busy the evening we dined here, the waitress was very attentive and extremely nice....thanks very much Anna!  Between myself, my wife and daughter, we tried a number of different menu items including the garlic cheese knots, chicken parmesan, pizza and a salad....everything was VERY good.  We definitely have plans to return.  Nice to see a very well ran family business with such good food!
