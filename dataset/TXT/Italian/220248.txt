SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Went here for a group work outing arranged by one of my friends. She highly suggested it, and I absolutely love the happy hour they have daily. They have an array of appetizong steaks, sides, and refreshing beverages.The dark ambiance is splendid. Only suggestion is to offer wine and anything other than well drinks at a special price and provide a better parking situation. This is a go-to place with alot of anticipated business. I highly recommend for a fun outing with friends.
