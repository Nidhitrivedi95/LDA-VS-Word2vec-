mvsnt4q3A5TzcbPFolpsZQ We have an agreement with friends. We meet for dinner at a restaurant that none of us knew. I selected Tesoro based on it being centrally located and its Yelp rating. It was a pleasant surprise. We never felt rushed and enjoyed our wine and conversation. Our meals were superb, just like being in Italy. I had sole piccata, light and flavorful. A great place. Friendly, attentive and knowledgable staff. Highly recommended.
