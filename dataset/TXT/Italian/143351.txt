JsUprRhyzQyukZmAhcOg0A I went there for a mid-afternoon lunch. I ordered Grilled Mahi Mahi and an iced tea. The mahi mahi came with spinach and farrow. It was okay . . .  A-OK . . . not really. $25 for lunch for a small portion of fish that somebody had not bothered to season correctly - some bites were too peppery, some were not peppery at all - I don't like pepper. The spinach was good, but there wasn't much. The bread was okay - I'm not a fan of sourdough. The crackers with everything - a step up, but not a big step up. The farrow was good and there was a good amount of it. The tea was fine - not any better than what I make at home. 

 Oh, it is healthy - they halved the portion  and doubled the price. And, after tax and tip, I spent $25 for lunch - for that much money I expect a whole lot better than I got - way better than "I could have done far better in 15 minutes or less at home". I won't be back.
