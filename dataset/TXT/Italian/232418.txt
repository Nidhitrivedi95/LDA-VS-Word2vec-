tKi4OvAlckcVzeP92InsOQ We LOVE Fat Cats!  They have movies (with recliners), bowling, glow in the dark golfing, arcade and more!  Our experience has always been stellar!  Never had any issues- great seats, great movies!  The app and website are perfect.  The pizza delivered to your chair is delicious and always eaten even with picky kids (adults too).

If you are looking for a great date night or family fun/ this place has it all!
