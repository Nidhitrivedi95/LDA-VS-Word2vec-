qFqueIKCVF5PlXmjl1YY9Q What a fantastic end tons wonderful day! We haven't had gelato as tasty as this since leaving Italy. We should have known by the length of the line stretching out the door and along the sidewalk! Fortunately for us, the staff quickly served up those in line in front of us - and what looked like it could've been a 30-min wait was less than 10! Great, friendly service, and incredible gelato! Can't wait for a Frost Gelato to open up close to home for us!
