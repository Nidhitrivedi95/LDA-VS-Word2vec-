iziI_goVr962lPfxsAmAcg We tried this restaurant out because I had a gift certificate. We are so glad we did! We went on a Friday night and it there were a good amount of people there but not so crowded that we had to wait for a table. The restaurant decor is modern and they have a long bar.  I had a cucumber martini that was really good. We had the chicken wing confeit for an appetizer and it was fantastic. My dinner companion had the flat iron steak and I had a shrimp and pasta dish with a caprese salad. Everything was great and the presentation was beautiful. We will definitely be back!
