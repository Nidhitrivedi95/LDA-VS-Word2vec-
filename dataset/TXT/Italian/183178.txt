Ocq3pio5JGNKEGqzjAhkbQ The best Italian beef sandwich in Surprise. Glad we don't have to drive all the way to Portillo's or Luke's in Scottsdale to get a decent fricken beef sandwich. Haven't tried the hot dog yet but when I do I'll give you and honest posting. The beef with peppers, fries & drink was just over $10 which I find a bit pricey for a lunch deal.
