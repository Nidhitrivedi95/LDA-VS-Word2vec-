I was hungry a few minutes after I tried their $7 pellini concoction. First off, you had some moron kid with the personality of a doorknob making my food and then he has a "blowup" which in their cute little minimum wage world means he doesn't know how to roll a burrito that he has been trained how to accomplish. So, I get a thin tortilla with a layer of noodles and a tiny, tiny scoop of whatever veggies and protein I want. I see how this company is going to rip off customers by short changing them on chicken with a scoop that was literally a teaspoon size. The noodles need to be rigatoni or penne because the burro has no density without rice and beans. This is just another concept that Scottsdale people will probably enjoy for  awhile before the next dude wastes his daddy's money on the next big thing. You want a tiny bowl of watery noodles with chopped veggies and cold sauce or a spaghetti burrito that should be eaten by kids then get your butt over to this joint.
