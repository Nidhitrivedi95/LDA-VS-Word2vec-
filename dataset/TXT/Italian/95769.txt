epWC7CGRbNHkXM7G2ulYzQ This use to be one of my favorite places to go ever since I was little. It was always a good amount of food for your money until recently when they raised the prices and in all honesty it's not worth going back too. It's disappointing to see places have to do that. We will be back for the car cruise in on Thursday's but we won't be staying and eating. This past Thursday we sat out on the patio for dinner and waited for someone to come take our order for 15 minutes- the waitress apologized took our order, then we waited another 20 before we saw our drinks & food and they were not very busy at all. I would suggest spending your money up the road elsewhere. Or go across the road to Pizza Hut!
