esnvHQxunLTAckQpntqbCg 1 star for the taste of the pasta and the location.  Pasta was good but experience was not. Do not order the salad, it was tasteless with very poor presentation. no wonder why it is generally slow. Service was very slow. We live in the neighbourhood and love eating out but will not go back there.
