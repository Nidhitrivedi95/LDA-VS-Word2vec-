CElwRv4CtK56NljAuCwepw The bread they give you is so soft and warm. Amazing. Can't wait to come here again everything was delicious. I came in a big group and we all loved our pastas. I had the chipotle chicken pasta and it was packed with flavor and delicious. I added some crushed red pepper flakes and it gave it even more of a kick. We started out with the firecracker rolls (all three flavors) but the only one I liked was the steak one. Service was great and the prices were reasonable. Their menu is good for everyone, there is truly something for everybody! Definitely will be back next time I'm in Arizona
