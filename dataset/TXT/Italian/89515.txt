E0YuuRpK_4RpaUF7JK3mhg My wife and I love this place.  From the other reviews, it sounds like they may have had some challenges starting up, but our experience there was great both times.  We went later in the evening though.  The food was delicious.  I remember looking at my wife after the first bite and saying, "how in the world did they get that much flavor in just potatoes?!"  It was terrific.  We liked the decor.  I think their goal is to make it look more like a restaurant in Naples; something like stepping out of Henderson and into Italy for a while.  Hence the clothes hanging around and we liked that.

I think there was one Yelper that complained about Walter.  We found him to be very fun.  My wife is a very friendly out-going person so she struck up a conversation with him easily.  He is quite an interesting guy with some interesting stories.  Maybe he responds differently to people who are not so friendly; I don't know, but he is one of the many reasons we find this place so charming.

We had no complaints about the service.  We were not in any hurry either time we went; we were just enjoying being there.  But I don't recall anything taking longer than would be expected to reach our table.

As for the prices.  Well, we are watching our budget closer than usual right now because we are buying a house in Anthem.  So, we are only going out to eat at fancy places on special occasions.  Even so, when it was our anniversary, Bratalian was the obvious choice for us since we enjoyed it so much the first time.  When we can afford to go to a nice place, they are at the top of our list.  The value and the overall experience is more than worth it.

Love this place in every way and wishing them great success.
