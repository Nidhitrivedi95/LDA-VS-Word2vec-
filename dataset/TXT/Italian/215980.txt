RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ This place gets a 5 star in a heart beat. Absolutely romantic restaurant at the very top of a mountain in Phoneix. It gives you a breathtaking view of the city. Beautifully decorated patio area, with gorgeous flowers, nice breeze and excellent service. The food is perfect. This is an upscale restaurant you want to go to with a significant other or to celebrate something nice. It's soooo nice! :)
