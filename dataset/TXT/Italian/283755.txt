The service was exceptional, the lobster bisque was phenomenal, the "zip sauce" for the porterhouse was delicious, the sides were perfect, and all 8 of the desserts were great.  I would make a trip to DT Vegas from the strip just to eat here.  A must visit for anyone looking for a great meal and experience.
