My family (total 4 of us) came on a Sunday to try Paisano's for lunch at the new location in York Mills. I called a few hours in advance to ask them their hours and whether we could just walk-in for lunch at which time the person on the phone said yes, so I didn't think it would be an issue. When we arrived a few hours later, we were told by the hostess that this restaurant does not take any walk-in customers and only takes reservations. We could see many empty tables in a fairly sized restaurant- I guess all reserved. I had never come across a casual restaurant that works like this so I was surprised. She also informed me the restaurant was "running out of food". This was also the first I had ever heard of this happening at a restaurant. Thus, we were turned away. 

I gave the restaurant another chance on another occasion and called a few days ahead to ensure we had a reservation. After being put on hold for 5 minutes, the man on the phone informed me that they "only take walk-ins" for dinner as they were fully booked. That is fine, but it has just been extremely frustrating to try to eat at this restaurant and we were never treated respectfully or properly informed about the restaurant's policies as customers. I just feel if you are going to be difficult about getting a table at a restaurant and have all these policies just to get seated, to either publish them on a website or inform your customers if they take the time to call you on the phone. It's not even like it's some fancy fine-dining experience. I had the impression they were supposed to be a family-friendly casual restaurant.

One of my worst experiences at a restaurant.
