BaVtTt9pBoI8rrN35tsj_g I met my niece here who graciously drove up from the University of Arizona to see me as I was in Phoenix for some training.   Since it was her birthday week and I was in her backyard (she grew up in Phoenix), I let her pick the spot.  

She picked Olive Garden.   

At least one knows the food and usually the service will be consistent.

Our waiter was pretty attentive but I chalk that up to my dining partner being a cute 20-year-old.   :)

I don't know that I've ever had horrible experiences at an Olive Garden....maybe I should give the entire chain at least one more star for that.
