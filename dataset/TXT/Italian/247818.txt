vE4WR05o_c0pL_l4Aq2BlQ Fantastic! From the moment we walked in to moment we left, this was a fantastic experience. Staff was friendly but gave us space, the food was superb. The appetizer of rice ball thing was really unique and delicious. The prinicipe pizza was so good I wish I could have eaten the whole thing. Our server was awesome and it's a great location and ambiance. I'd like to go next door to try toscana next. I'll definitely be back. Most likely later this week. Oh, and they have a few gluten free options if you have a diner who requires that.
