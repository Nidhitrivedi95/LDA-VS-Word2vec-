Pg12K0aiPMz2FpmkzxQnaA This is the only halal Italian restaurant I know of so I knew I had to give it a try. I came here on a Friday evening with a friend after work and it took sometime to get seated as the place was quite busy. The decor and atmosphere of the place was nice and it was very clean.

I ordered a hot spot burger with saffron poutine and my friend got the penne picante rose (hope I typed that right) with Italian sausage. Initially I wasn't sure what the saffron poutine would entail but it was one of the best decisions I made, that poutine was amazing I really loved the cheesiness and crispness of the Fries. The burger itself was cooked to perfection and all of the toppings blended really well together. I will definitely be going back for more as there really wasn't any downside to this restaurant at all.
