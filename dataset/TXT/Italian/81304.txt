dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw Fiamma is a fair restaurant, although the prices are outrageous and I have had much better Italian elsewhere. My husband had the Lobster Bisque and the Lasagna Bolognese, while I had the Neapolitan Paccheri. We finished with the creme brûlée. Unfortunately, my husband was a little sick later on that night... The food is very rich. The service is attentive and the ambiance is nice, although the restaurant is a little too dark while the music is a little too loud.
