WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw I've been a fan of NYPD for over 10 years.  They are consistently good and provide good service.  The BF and I have visited various locations this year including the one at the airport and they have all provided pizza with a great taste.  We enjoy the pizza dough/crust that is made with NY water.  We also learned that you can get the pizza dough to take home and make your own pizza. 

At the last visit, we tried the fried fresh mozzarella.  I really enjoyed it.  The white pizza, brooklyn, and wall street are some of our favorites!
