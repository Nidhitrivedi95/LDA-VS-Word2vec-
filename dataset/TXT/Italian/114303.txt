GLObol9ZkKPQOQ1LMsqkew The food is amazing! Had the new harvest sandwhich it was great. The family had bruschetta and strawberry fields salad and they loved it too. Service was off though. Only reason for the three stars. Not very tentative. Ran out of my drink for about 20 mins and then he finally asked if we wanted more after we ate. Lost about four dollars because I would have loved another orange blossom! Overall great food but short staff both physically and attitude. The girl staff was great though! Hopefully if I come back the service will be more cognitive. Also no military discount?!?! Shoot give at least 5% for those who served. Definitely need to fix that lost a star there.
