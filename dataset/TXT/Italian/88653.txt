Veal Saltimbocca as thin and tasty as you could hope for, pasta dishes excellent. Calamari fritti the only disappointment; somewhat tough. One of the best cannoli's you will ever have ( with pistachio) and complimentary limoncello to boot. 

Service has been an issue in the past but not tonight; delightful knowledgeable authentic Italian waiter. Worth the drive from old town Scottsdale and a regular stop for our golf group. 

Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I am tough on Italian restaurants with a master chef wife and mother but this is a great spot.
