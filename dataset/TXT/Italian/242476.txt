umxki_So2--o08q9bkXK6Q Great selection of organic, vegan, and vegetarian items. Server was very friendly and knowledgeable. It got busy at lunch so off-hours are best if you can. The lunch combos seem like a good value. The regular menu items are a bit expensive, but you are paying for higher quality ingredients.
