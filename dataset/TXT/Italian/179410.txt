Last night in Las Vegas, for this trip. It was uncertain room service, Table Ten or????? Well I went back to Buddy's. Sat at the bad this time. Again the service (Danny) was stellar, the food was delicious and again, I ate too much and had no room for dessert. Gonna miss this place! 

Staying at the Palazzo we saw a show about the owner, his love for desserts. We checked it and thankful that we did. The restaurants pretty spacious but not a whole lot of tables yet we were able to get a reservation for two. Service was top-notch full bar there's enough there to please everybody. We ate so much from bread, salad to entree that it's a shame we didn't save room for desserts. What were we thinking! I feel like we got robbed by our own decision to eat it all because it was so good. 

Guess it means we have to go back! Great wine selection too!
