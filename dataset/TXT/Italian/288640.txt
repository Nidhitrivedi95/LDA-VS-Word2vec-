It is situated in a nice part of rocky river. The interior is cozy. Service is good. Choices are plenty. 
For some reason I am drawn to make a comparison to 'peppers' in Lakewood where the service is far more friendlier. 
We ordered the gnocchi ala napoletana which was well cooked and tasty. It was served with fresh salad. The other two orders were petto di pollo alla Marsala and petto di pollo alla domiziano. I have eaten better chicken Marsala in olive garden. The two chicken dishes appeared similar in taste. The chocolate mousse was just good. 
We were seated immediately, but for a Wednesday it was quite busy.  Weren't really impressed with our choice except for the gnocchi. Would like to try other menu items before being too critical.
