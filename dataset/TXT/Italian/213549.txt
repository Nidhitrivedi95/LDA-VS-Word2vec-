r6jbUGiyoN05mZ13apQGgw I really enjoy the pizza here, it's New York style and the sauce has a little just a touch of sweetness to it which I enjoy but I'm sure other may dislike it. Tonight I ran to get some wings and zeppolis. We got the 12 wings with fries half teriyaki and half garlic parmesan, at $8.99 for the meal it's definitely a pretty good deal since we all know wings can be expensive. The garlic parmesan is a dry seasoning which was good and not overpowering. The teriyaki was my favorite out of the two flavors, a lot of the time teriyaki on wings can be overpowering and either too sweet or too salty these were nice and lightly flavored just enough to compliment the flavor of the wing itself. The fries were decent nothing special, the ranch was a good ranch it had the pizza parlor taste to it. The zeppolis are awesome I looooove zeps so good, I used to get them all the time as a kid at the San genarro festival when it used to be at the Rio back in the day. Zeppolis bring me back to being a little kid and it's a magical time traveling experience.
