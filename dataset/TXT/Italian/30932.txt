5NUHLYoZS_iCp2JSt5tQZQ Try the filet mignon medallions... Delicious and the bartenders are great!!! Great food and incredible drink prices. The filet mignon medallions are fantastic and the mushrooms that come with are wonderful. Try the potato skinss out too, or the calamari, which was just right. Must try this place especially for happy hour... It blows all the other nearby restaurants out of the water, both price and quality-wise.
