nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow Just had the worst experience ever, and I have been coming here since I moved to Cleveland.  Was given water and bread by two different people. Neither said one word to us.  Server walks up, " did you want something to drink?"  That's was it.  Walk to the restroom and moved out of the way for the hostess and she passes without a word. Another gentleman from my table did the same for her and again nothing. Our server was very inattentive and curt. I'm hoping this was an isolated incident. I will give them one more chance and that is it. Very disappointing when I have always had a great experience.
