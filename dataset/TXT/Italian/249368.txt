VjaHHmV-rSkFaOAnU3faxg First let me clarify the 5 star rating is for the food only.  The ambiance is pizza parlor all the way and does not do justice to the magic happening in the kitchen.  The pizza is absolutely one of the best pizzas I have eaten in my life, and that says a lot coming from someone who spent 20 years in the East coast pizza belt (NY,NJ,PA).  I never bother to eat the crust of a pizza....I ate the crust at Salvatore's because it was perfection.   The market vegetable plate, was presented with 3 spreads and a board of crisp fresh vegetables that was a gourmet delight in it self!  Even the carnivore agreed. Clearly Salvatore's is a testament to the bounty of delicious fresh food available in Wisconsin and the incredible creative talent in the kitchen.   I ate a slice cold the next day and it was really good, not at all cardboardy like most pies when cold, and then I re-heated the rest and it too was delicious.  That's the hallmark of a perfect pie.   Oh how I wish Salvatore's would move closer to a location in downtown Madison more fitting to the talent of the chef(s).  Wait, it is August!  time for the Perseids, wish, wish, wish
