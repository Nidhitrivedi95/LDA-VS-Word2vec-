bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg "Due Forni Pizza and Wine" has unique pizzas and a variety of wines on its menu. It has attentive serving staff and comfortable ambience (in a weekday afternoon anyway). Its bar appears quite inviting. The enclosed patio with very large windows is nice, though facing only the relatively quiet parking lot by S. Town Center Dr. The menu is the same for both lunch and dinner; its prices a bit high for lunch, especially the wines, but OK for dinner.

It offers two kinds of crust for pizzas. My wife and I tried the thin/crispy type with speck. It had a rugged presentation, but its PROSCIUTTO and crust were delicious in every bite. The Caeser's salad was also excellent. Our glasses of red wine ($12.95/glass) were excellent but a bit too pricey [Wine prices vary from $8-$15/glass for average wines, and $20-$50/glass for the more exotic].

We were there in a late weekday afternoon, thus, only a few tables of guests there. Our attentive, friendly server told us that the restaurant got busy usually after 6pm.
- No, Due Forni does not offer special "Happy Hour", but does offer $5/glass of selected wines from 5-7pm, as well as "Wine Sampling" at 20%discount per glass.

We finished our meals before 6:30pm that evening, so we did NOT see any "Happy Hour Type" of crowd typically swarming at popular Roy's, Kona Grill, or Gordon Biersch around 3-7pm. The manager came over to ask us, quite sincerely, how we enjoyed our dinner - a very nice touch. We liked that. Yes, we plan to give Due Forni another try some weekends, when there will be a larger crowd.

In Short:
- If you like good pizzas, nice but slightly more expensive wines, and QUIETER ambience, say, for a late lunch/early dinner, then Due Forni is worth a try. But, if you prefer a more exciting (happily noisier) atmosphere of the happy hour with good food/drinks, then there are other better places than Due Forni.
