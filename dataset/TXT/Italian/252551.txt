VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Ate here last week (7/16/2011) with wife and brother and his wife. All four of us agree it might have been best meal we ever ate. Kobe beef carpacchio, lobster bisque, 12 oz filets and the 20 oz ribeye with bearnaisse left our jaws on the floor. Steak was as good as or even better than Ruths Chris or Mortons here in Orlando. Price felt like we stole our meals. Thank you Lavo for making our last meal in Vegas unforgettable after some shoddy dinners in other places. A must eat when staying in Palazzo or Venetian, or for anyone out there!
