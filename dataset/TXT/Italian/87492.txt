DvXpWBz5_-hZQuvu-RnSwQ Stopped in here to eat on a Sunday while shopping in Kensington. Was really hungry and the idea was to get a quick bite to eat before carrying on. Definitely picked the wrong place for that. There were only two people waiting tables and making drinks, for a Sunday Kensington crowd. They were overly busy and very inattentive. Despite the staff knowing we were there we waited for probably 15 minutes before having to go up to the counter and ask for menus. We were never offered water. Then we waited quite a long time for the pizza. I had asked for basil on mine, which oddly wasn't a menu option. I was told they'd be happy to add it, but when my pizza arrived it had one single solitary basil leaf on it. The pizza was served on rough wooden boards which is aesthetically a nice idea, but hygienically, not so much. Mine had chunks of old food stuck to it--pretty gross. We weren't given, nor were there available anywhere that we could see, standard condiments like grated parmesan or chili peppers. The pizza was pretty good, chewy crust and tasty sauce, and my husband's cappuccino was nice, but unfortunately the long wait and slow, inattentive service means I wouldn't go back.
