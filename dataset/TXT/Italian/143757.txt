JTKzGJvIK9yuoUf-erV2qQ Bar tender tried to charge double for drinks during happy hour. He knew my group was from out of town and tried to pull a fast one. After we pointed out the mistake and showed the staff their advertisement on THEIR MENUS, they still refused to honor the deal. AVOID THESE SCAM ARTISTS!!
