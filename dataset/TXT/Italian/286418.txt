ZHNxxsZrowzP-RedJ6cSFA My GF and I went here a couple of nights ago and it was pretty empty. I think we beat the Sun City rush.. lol  We were trying to find somewhere "New" that was good and we stumbled upon this place because of all the Google+ positive reviews on Google Maps. We had the chicken Marsala (OK) and Parmesan (Good). Personally, I like Elephant Bar's and Carrabba's Chicken Marsala better. The Chicken Parmesan and Marsala was better the next day as left overs. Their bread was Excellent. It melted in your mouth and they kept it coming. Lastly, the service and staff were extremely friendly. 

Overall, the food wasn't bad, but it just didn't catch either of our fancy's enough to come back to give it another try. Maybe we got the wrong items.
