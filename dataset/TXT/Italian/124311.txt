HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ Fantastic view, we went at dusk and could look north or south as the lights got brighter. We could see about 5-6 helicopters lined up from the north making a pass (with tourists) over the strip and then heading to the airport. The food was pretty good, the appetizers were nice and they had a nice variety. We had a "fixed menu" dinner so not many choices but it was all very good. I'm not sure the cost as we were part of a group and it was paid for by someone else.
