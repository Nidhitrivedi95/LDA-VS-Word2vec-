fbLYRHIZAt3q839whhaBUg So delicious! our service was amazing and the pizza was good, different than I'm used to. the portions are massive, so if you aren't a huge eater, I recommend sharing meals! my mom and I shared a big salad (the only sizes are big and real big) and it was more than we needed! we also got a pizza and took it home for leftovers! our waiter was very smart and on top of it. only complaint was that the atmosphere was very noisy, so don't expect and quiet calm meal! Definitely recommend though. I will be back myself
