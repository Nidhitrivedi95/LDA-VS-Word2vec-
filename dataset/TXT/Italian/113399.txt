Gh-qmVwvibLnNdqEZXcQHw I wish I could give this place more than 5 start.
My girlfriend and I started with the popcorn calamari. It was cooked perfectly! Light and flaky on the outside, warm and tender in the inside. We both ended up getting the pita. She got the monte Cristo, and I got a chicken and pepper. Both absolutely amazing. Passion fruit tea, perfect. Then to top everyrhing off, peanut butter cheese cake and a lemon tart. Perfect, perfect, and perfect. Small, not a chain, and perfect.
