SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg I heard great things about this place from numerous people. I met a friend here for dinner one night. We started off with the meatballs for an appetizer and had a few of their cocktails. I ordered the filet and the Truffle Mac and cheese and he had some pasta dish with seafood in it. I think it was a special. The food lived up to the hype. My steak was prepared perfectly and seasoned extremely well. We didn't have any room for dessert so I can't comment on that portion.

I would definitely recommend this place.
