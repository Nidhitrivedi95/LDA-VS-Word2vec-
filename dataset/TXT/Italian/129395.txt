i53HvxUdQEMllZ1XmpjjyA I have ordered from great places and I have ordered from crappy places. This place definitely makes the crap list. 

I ordered a pizza and sandwich around 6pm. I have the confirmation and everything, its good to go. Well at 7pm hits and there is still no pizza. I call and I am told they mixed my order with someone else's and I would have to wait an additional 45 mins. Well at 830pm comes and there is still no pizza. I call back and they tell me the order never made it out of the kitchen and they would have to remake it. They told me they would take 30% off if I was ok with waiting another 45 mins. I told them no thanks and they then offered me 40% off. Again, I said no thanks, and then they proceeded to hang up on me like I was the one that messed up. 

I used to work in the restaurant business. If someone waited 2 Hours and 30 mins for food that never came and then was asked to wait another 45 mins, it better be free. Sicilys Pizza obviously do not care about their customers.
