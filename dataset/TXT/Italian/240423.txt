UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ It was our first time at Floridino's. We had excellent service. Our waiter was a tall older man. He was very knowledgable, kind, and helpful. The Alfredo sauce was excellent, although it was a very small portion on a large plate. The salad was small, not cold, and cost extra. The spaghetti with meat sauce entree was good but came out looking like a child size portion.
Our bill came to $41.00 ( plus a tip of $10.00) and no beverages. We went home and were still hungry because of the small sized portions served. Not really worth $51.00 !! We we not be back or recommend.
