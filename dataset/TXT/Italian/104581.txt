fOKeVUHC7nb6c8G5sILdHQ I'm right around the corner, originally from NY, and this is like getting a slice of pizza back home. BUT Everything is good- if you're a wing person you must try the wings with a side of marinara or blue cheese. Spaghetti, chicken parmesan, everything it's good! Been eating here over ten years, never disappointed.
