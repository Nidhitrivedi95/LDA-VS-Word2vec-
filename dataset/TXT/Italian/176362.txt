NHzdf87ObSNIXrT5axTubQ I ordered dinner for me and girlfriend at 9 pm through their app. I was told by the app that it would be at the LATEST 1008. 1030 comes still no pizza. I call and the manager blames their driver. I worked in pizza biz do by this time there was probably one driver. I explained my concern and Danny said there was nothing he could do tonight because he closes the registers. As if there are not notes to be made to help me out in the future. When the delivery drive finally came he claimed that the driver that should have delivered went home is when I got offended. I finally got my pizza at 1045. So 40 min after my order and it came in cold. Is this how you run a business? I wanted to surprise my gf and instead it took an impale ok me. Then the delivery driver told me that I'd get ten dollars off my next order? Would you want a cold pizza at a 10 dollars off a 25 dollar order?  And the manager was awesome he played the whole the systems were turned off so I can do anything like you can't place a not to take care of a pissed off customer. I rarely yelp but avoid this place...
