tKi4OvAlckcVzeP92InsOQ We went to Fat Cats for a movie this Saturday. I love the leg room and reclining seats, but the concession stand is on the outside of the ticket taker so you have to leave the movie area and show your ticket to get back in. They call it recline and dine, but you can't bring alcohol past the ticket booth and the recliners aren't really suited to "dining". We will definitely go back since the ticket prices are cheaper than Harkins where you feel like you're in the 3rd class deck of the Titanic.   Biggest complaint? The armrests are all stationary so you can't sit close to Bae. If you want a good date place, try Cinemark at Mesa Riverview.
