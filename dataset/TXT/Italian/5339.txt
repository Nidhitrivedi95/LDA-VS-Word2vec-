_qA2HPqgLiBc-M4wRyml0g Went here on a Tuesday night to check out the $22 Pizza & Wine Special. I assumed it was going to be a generic personal size cheese pizza and a house wine but boy was I wrong! First of all they let you choose from any of their pizza's, and a whole list of wines. My friend and I shared the Burrata appetizer, which was super tasty. Its home made burrata topped with wilted kale, balsamic reduction and this apricot mustarda stuff which is a perfect pairing. Also no clue what the kale was seasoned with but really flavorful! We got the Sicilian pizza and it was perfect. My favorite thing about the pizza was that instead of using your typical pepperoni which leaves way too much oil and grease, they import some sort of spicy soppressata instead! Meatballs were really tender and the Sharps Hill wine was fantastic. We finished the last drop and bite of everything! Copper & Jen were our bartenders, both were very knowledgeable and welcoming. Between the staff, atmosphere, food and drink ... I'll definitely be back!
