Oven brick pizza with delicious flavors. Got the Italian Stallion "meat pie". Crisp crust, dough was light, sauce was just delicious. 

San Marzano Tomatoes D.O.P., House-Made Mozzarella, Schreiner's Sausage, Pepperoni, Prosciutto di Parma (Cotto), Sopressata, all just tastefully done. Every bite was amazing. 


$15 for the meat pie

Service was excellent.
