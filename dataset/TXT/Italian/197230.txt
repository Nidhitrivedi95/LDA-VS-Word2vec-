If you're craving real NY style pizza this is your place! The inside of it even reminds me of a NY pizzeria,  limited tables and space. It's usually crowded during lunch. It's definitely a good idea to call your order in whether it be lunch or not because they usually make the pizza to order. Unless, you're getting a single slice which they still heat up in the oven. Do yourselves a favor a head over to Luigi's next time you're craving pizza.
