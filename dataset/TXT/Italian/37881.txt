7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ One of my favorite places in Arcadia for a relaxing and cheap breakfast, lunch, or pizza. They have some really good and healthy food on the menu as well. Go to for breakfast is the commuter with salmon, avocado, havarti. It's super good. For lunch I love the chickpea lettuce wraps. Dinner time you can't beat the prosciutto and avocado pizza. The place also has a great ambiance and setup for casual socializing. Enjoy it!
