FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Would it be weird to say that my favorite thing about this place was the restroom..??  It was so much fun with the music all loud and so much space and so many mirrors, I just wanted to wash my hands in there forever and ever...such a happy, unexpected surprise (after a few beers, haha).  Yep, I see now that that really was weird to say...

But alright, starting over...came here for happy hour with a few friends.  Having to park valet was a little off-putting to me, maybe that's just the way it is downtown?  I wouldn't know.  It's just that I rarely have cash on me, so I cringe at having to give a tip or something unexpectedly.  Anyway, other than that, the patio seating was wonderful.  Loved that they had shade over the area so we could enjoy the outdoors without melting or bursting into flames.  Loved the $5 pitcher of beer happy hour special.  I didn't eat, but the bruschetta my friends ordered looked amazing.  How they were able to decide among all the mouth-watering options listed on the menu, I really don't know.  The girls also had a panini sandwich that looked delicious...we snickered a bit that the server said it was too difficult for the kitchen to slice the sandwich into 3 instead of 4 portions, but whatever.  They did accommodate our request to put our next pitcher of beer on ice for a few minutes before we were ready to drink it, so that was nice.  

This was my first time at Postino Central, and I will definitely be back.  Perfect place for happy hour with the girls.  Next time I'll make sure to go hungry so I don't miss out on that bruschetta!!
