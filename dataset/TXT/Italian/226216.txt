SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg I searched pizza delivery in my neighborhood & one of the options was Red Rock Pizza. In a listing of 1 & 2 stars, RRP stood out with 4. The menu looked different so I went for it.  Ordered (for delivery) mild chicken fingers & a half BBQ chicken/half Maui (add red onion) pizza. It arrived to my house in the time frame I was given & the delivery person was very pleasant (as was the guy who took my order). The ranch dressing was not my favorite- too running, not much flavor. But the chicken fingers had great flavor & texture & both pizza types were flavorful & yummy. I also liked that it wasn't greasy. In the pizza box, you get a garlic knot. Again, good texture & I liked that the garlic wasn't overpowering. Definitely worth a try & I will not hesitate ordering from Red Rock Pizza again. Oh! & it's worth noting: Their chicken fingers are baked. So when you have leftovers, they are still delicious the next day, unlike when they're fried. 350* for 15min & voila!, the breading & chicken have maintained their integrity!
