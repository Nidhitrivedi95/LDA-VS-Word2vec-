JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A Worst thing about this place: the disturbingly loud music. 

Otherwise, this place is pretty good. I've been several times and I'd highly recommend their poutine and pastas. The burgers and sandwiches I've had taste fine too, but portion sizes tend to be smaller than their pastas. If you are looking for something 'healthier', their pita pizzas come with a generous portion of salad.

Service is almost always pleasant, polite, and efficient. 

Would come here much more often with friends if the music was less loud as it just does not make sense to have to shout above the music, and other customers who are also trying to talk above the music.
