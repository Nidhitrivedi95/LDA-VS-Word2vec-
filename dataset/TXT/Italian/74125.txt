CPgyfcsyPegLha1ajaSRoA The portions are so big I swear you can feed a family of four off one dish. I won't eat the entire day we're going and I can't eat the next day (I stay full for 24 hours from these meals). The chicken parm is delish. Juicy and tender.
Fresh bread with oil is addictive and it's so hard to go easy and make room for the entree. Dessert is never an option for me. I wish it were but again the portions are huge and I don't have the ability to stretch my stomach that much.
