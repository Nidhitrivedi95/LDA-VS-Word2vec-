SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg Why didn't I find Lago sooner?! Best view of the Fountains in Las Vegas, incredible customer service (ask for Jennifer as a server) and AMAZING food. I went for Sunday brunch and had the duck and polenta to start followed by the filletino (small filet which was so tender I didn't even need a steak knife) and it came with asparagus and hash browns. The steak was very flavorful. 

Definitely go for the bottomless mimosas- it was different than any other one I've had. Comes with this cool flavored wand and a gorgeous, edible sugar decor with the glass. Very lively ambiance and despite how busy they were, the managers (Albert and Lucio) made an effort to make sure we were happy and felt at home. 

Now I'll have to try their dinner!
