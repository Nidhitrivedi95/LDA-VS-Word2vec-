5aRyuqJZSGp1fNXHQHMLjg Ordered the veggie pizza in person and cashed in on the free dessert (cheese cake for me!) from Yelp.  Price was as noted on the overhead menu but, then again, I didn't order over the phone or use delivery as others who have been charged fees have noted.  Also, no additional fee was charged for using a credit card.  Pizza was tasty, even after getting it home.  Have had slices for lunch there before and also been satisfied.  AND, they are Yankee fans!
