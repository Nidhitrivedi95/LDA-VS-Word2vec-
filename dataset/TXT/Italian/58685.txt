Oregano's in Scottsdale is a fantastic, fun place to get some Italian food in a relaxed atmosphere, maybe while catching a ballgame on the TV.

There's a pizza pie for everyone regardless of your preference - deep dish, thin crust, original, you name it. Do yourself a favor and get the guacamole. Holy Moly! I could have survived on that alone.

The wait stuff are young and fun, and I even did something I never do at a restaurant - I bought a T-shirt. A baseball jersey-style Oregano's shirt that remains one of my favorite tees.

Sidle up to the bar if that's your thing, you'll get great service, conversation, and of course, food. or bring a date and enjoy pizza, lasagna, spaghetti, you name it.

Parking is sparse and the wait may be a little long (get there early for lunch) but it's well worth it.

I just wish there was an Oregano's near me in Michigan.
