We have been trying to eat here for quite some time, but I am one of those people who does not have the patience to stand in a long line and then stress out trying to find a place to sit before my food comes out. Today, a Sunday, at 12:45pm the line was relatively short, and by relatively short, I mean not out the door.  My husband ordered while my son & I went scavenging for an inside table (104 degrees out today and the indoor seating is scarce), which I cleaned off with an anti-bacterial wet wipe from my purse. 
The food was okay.  I won't be rushing back.  Actually, I probably won't be back at all.  My son ordered a strawberry shake, which the strawberries were clearly frozen, not fresh.  The onion rings, that are boasted as being on "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives" is nothing to brag about.  As matter of fact they came to the table luke-warm and with very little flavor. My husband and I had the chicken pesto sandwich with coleslaw. Sandwich was ok, mushrooms had good flavor, but otherwise it was pretty bland. Coleslaw was much of the same, bland. Good crunchy slaw, but nothing special about the flavor. 
Overall, the food was edible, nothing outstanding, but nothing horrible. I was really expecting something incredible, especially since we love Joe's BBQ.  :(
