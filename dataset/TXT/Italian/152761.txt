KVpvE6pOPM9KMvak4HFsNg Very nice pizza joint in ossington. Went for the fixed lunch special $15 for a salad (beet or arugala), pizza (margherita / marinara) you can sub for any other pizza for $5, and biscotti or gelato (vanilla or chocolate). 

Pretty good deal! We ended up subbing for a nduja sausage and Ontario prosciutto & arugula pizza. Highly recommend both! However the Ontario pizza had a lot of salad on top making it hard to cut (then again both pizzas are thin so it was hard to cut either way). 

The sausage was a mild spicy just FYI. 

Gelato was meh. Plain flavors but what can you say when the special is so cheap?!  

Service is great. Would definitely come back again!
