jG1jcAeDw0pZTHCNC5kw_w It's been long overdue and I should have left a review several years ago when I first dined here back in 2005. This place is by far, MY FAVORITE PIZZA RESTAURANT ! And its just not any pizza restaurant---their pizzas are made old school the authentic Italian way in a brick wood fire oven like it is done in Italy. We live in CA, but every time we come to visit my parents we make it a priority  to eat at Grazie. Our favorites are the Scamorza  (appetizer), Insalata  Della  Casa(salad), Sofia, Dame Edna, and the Dolce  Della  Casa (dessert). We just came back from visiting Italy and Grazie is the closest place that I could think of for authentic Italian pizza! LOVE THIS PLACE!
