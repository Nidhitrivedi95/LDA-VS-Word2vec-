F4zvnOsgjEV9aVbKqBYRng We did not eat only Drink and sing. That being said we were probably the most sober people there and we had a blast. They have a crazy crew of Karaoke singers. Some of the best I have ever heard and some can just dance their asses off. 

The place is a dive, the drinks were poured properly, not too much not too little. Good prices. 

The karaoke sounded really good. (except the outdoor speaker) the KJ (owner?) was gracious, inviting and did a good job keeping the system rolling.
