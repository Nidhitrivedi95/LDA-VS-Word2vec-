pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Really good service yet really overrated pizza. I've had wood fired pizza at many different places around the world and personally I felt the pizza at this place was quite bland and in no way deserves all of the accolades that it receives. Also, for the price of two people at this place you could eat two meals at several other amazing restaurants around the valley. So yeah, maybe I have too high of a standard but I definitely feel I know food that blows my mind when I have it. However this is just not it.
