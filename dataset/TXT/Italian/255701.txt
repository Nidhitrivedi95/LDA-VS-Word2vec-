vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA I'm afraid this place is a lot of hype. Firstly, the music is crazy annoying. Upon first entering we were very pleased about the nice booths, and the decor...but after we sat down and started trying to talk, it became impossible to hear. I'm not against 1950s and 60s music, but the way it contributed to the atmosphere was both non aesthetically pleasing and over the top stupid. I felt like I was eating at Johnny Rockets. No joke! The food was good, but the fusion Italian thing feels so overhyped here and so unoriginal. This place tries too hard...I wish I hadn't wasted a night here, there are so many good restaurants in Vegas.
