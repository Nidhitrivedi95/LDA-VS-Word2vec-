FQM4pVt1jeZcBGLIsXhXNA Chicken Rollatini is to die for!   I had not been to Fratello's for over ten years but decided tonight to give it a try.   Really glad I tried it again.   Great food.   The house salad is not your typical simple salad and the meatballs were very home made tasting.   Definitely going back soon.
