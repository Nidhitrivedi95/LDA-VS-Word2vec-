7LzhLKAwS7PHUvaPIW833A Seriously the best Italian place I've ever been!! 
The salads are so fresh, with freshly shredded mozzarella, the pasta sauce is homemade, the pasta is made from scratch and the food just tastes absolutely amazing! 
I've been a handful of times since I found it a few weeks ago and I've tried the chicken parm, eggplant parm and pretty much all the apps. I highly recommend the app with fried Zuccini, eggplant, and cauliflower with the pasta sauce. Mmmmmmm!!!
