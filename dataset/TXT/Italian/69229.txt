bVTWcZWhtJc4IjWy_74CYQ Came in 20 min. before the store was closing after a 8 hour drive from SD, I wasn't sure if they'd serve us, I asked if we could just order something to go.  The host was very welcoming & insisted that they were still open & able to serve us dining in.  I was relieved as it had been a long day in the car & it was raining out.  We sat down, our order was taken, the food came fast & piping hot.  Our server was so sweet, in fact even the staff that wasn't serving us, greeted us & everyone was just so friendly.... maybe it was because it was almost time to go home... lol but regardless, everyone made it a very nice experience for 2 weary travelers.
