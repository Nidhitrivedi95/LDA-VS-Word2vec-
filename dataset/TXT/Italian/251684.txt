VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w I have been here twice and my recommendation is to have any of the pastas.  My friend had the lasagna and said the noodles just melted in his mouth.  I had the penne al vodka and the sauce was perfectly creamy.  

I had the pizza on my second visit and it was definitely good, but not the best I have had in this city. That being said, the tiny restaurant (there are literally only 5 to 6 tables all nestled against the kitchen) oozes charm.  

This place is hard to spot, but worth the try.
