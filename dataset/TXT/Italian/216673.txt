rtYKSdUHpQO2Nyqy1-uAsQ I've eaten here a few times and the place is a hit and miss. Service is friendly enough but no one wants to engage in a conversation but they are certainly not rude - they just want to take your order. Its usually quite empty when I go. Food is decent. Sometimes really good. Some time bland. Some times I can't even remember which means nothing to write home about. Your typical fast food lay-out with fast food hygiene and cleanliness BUT not with fast food prices. I would eat there more often if the price point was more accurately placed. Its too expensive for average tasting food.
