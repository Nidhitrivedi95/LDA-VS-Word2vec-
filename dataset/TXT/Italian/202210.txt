q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Wow! This place rocks!! SINNER Magazine had a tweetup party there last night and I couldn't have imagined a better place. The atmosphere, the people, the food, the drinks.... Everyone that worked there treated us like royalty and I would go back just to hang out with them! The food was yummy and the drinks were strong. I loved it and you'll see me there whenever I'm in Las Vegas :)
