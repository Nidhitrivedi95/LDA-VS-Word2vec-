I was recently in Vegas and staying at the Tuscany Hotel. My friends wanted to have dinner at the Tuscany Gardens which I was a little nervous about after having bad experiences at one of the other Tuscany restaurants, but much to my surprise this place is actually good.

The service was nothing to write home about, but was certainly solid. Drinks were constantly full and food was served still hot. Dirty plates were promptly cleared as well. You can't really ask for much more than that.

I ordered a dinner salad which was very tasty. The house dressing was excellent although I would have preferred a different choice of lettuce. Still, it was good and I ate it all.

For dinner I had the Chicken Marsala which came with vegetables and a side of pasta. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was very good. The Chicken Marsala was excellent and the vegetables were, well, they were vegetables.

Other people at my table had the calamari appetizer and they raved about it. I have had some bad allergic reactions to calamari in the past so I didn't try it, but it looked and smelled so good that I was tempted to risk a trip to the hospital for a bite.

Not only will I eat here again when staying at the Tuscany, I might actually come back to eat here when I am NOT staying at the Tuscany. I think that is a pretty good endorsement.

Well done Tuscany Gardens!
