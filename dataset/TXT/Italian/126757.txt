hTsZSiftorNUFb1VaHCHHg Since the day Nook opened I have been in love. I love the staff, the ambience, the food, wine, the neighborhood people the frequent the bar - EVERYTHING. 

The staff is so accommodating to their guests. If they can do it for you, they will. No hesitation. They are friendly and genuine. 

The food. So yummy. And consistent! You know what you're getting every time. The pizza is so delicious and cooked right in front of you and then in their pizza oven behind the bar. I think they have one of the best charcuterie boards in the area at such a good price. Chef Nick makes some soups that are so good I've ordered them twice in one sitting. The desserts I could eat every day of the week for every meal. 

The decor is trendy, but current is a better word. It doesn't come off as pretentious or overdone. It's neighborhood cute but romantic at the same time. Something I would expect to find hidden in an alley in Seattle or something. I love the music choices. 

Overall a place to not pass up if you're in Arcadia.
