gxi-tnX_ze-VTYAVSyvEpA Another great meal for my out of town friends over the holidays! We all went and had different pizzas and pastas and shared.  
The place is fast -casual, you order and pay and then the great food kept rolling onto our table.
Having the beer and wine made for a perfect night!!
