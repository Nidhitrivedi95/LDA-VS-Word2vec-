If it was appropriate to take away stars because one combo of dishes is so good that it becomes impossible to order anything else, I would do it. But alas, I can't.
Generally, I'm not too fancy. Throw some italian-american red sauce on anything and melt a buttload of cheese, then I will eat it and enjoy it. This place though. Not even Italian-American, but straight up motherland. Balanced, nuanced, creative & delicious describe every single dish I've eaten here. Truffle appetizers, cocktails, the afore mentioned entree and dessert, you name it. 
Probably the best restaurant in town.
