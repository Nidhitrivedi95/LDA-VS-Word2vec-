GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA I really wanted this to be a 5 star dining experience, but it fell short on both the food and service.

The service was slow.  Apparently don't tell your waiter you have no time constraints.  I was hoping to get a second glass of wine with dinner, but given the amount of time it took to get my first glass I was going to have to shotgun it in order to fit a second glass in.  The waiter never checked in or asked us how our meals were through out any of our courses.  The servers presenting and clearing the plates were more attentive.

We were looking at ordering a bottle of wine, but the price points on the wine list kept us away from doing that.  I know I'm going to pay a mark up, but I struggle with paying 3x the bottle price at any restaurant.  

The food was OK, but nothing that would bring me back.  We shared the octopus, which was good.  It was cooked perfectly and the flavors were great.  For the primi course, my boyfriend had the beef cheek ravioli and I had the linguine with clams.  The beef cheek ravioli was good, but the linguine with clams was way too salty and gritty.  I could get past the grit, but the salt level made the dish inedible.  The one thing I got out of that dish was feeling better about my own imperfect linguine w/clams.  For our main course we both had the short rib.  It was very tender, but half way through the meal it started to get dry.  I didn't care for the greens that they served on top.  They didn't seem to stand up to the heat of the dish and just got warm soggy

I really wanted to enjoy this dinner, but it was just average.
