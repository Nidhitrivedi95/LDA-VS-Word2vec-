qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ Super friendly staff and owner. Tony introduced himself, shook my hand and gave me some complimentary garlic knots (which were awesome). I was in kind of a hurry so I just ordered a flight to go but I have to say this the best pizza I've had outside of New York! This place is for sure the only place in Arizona I have found that has legitimate New York style pizza. you know that crispy, fold in half kind? every other place that says they have New york-style is garbage compared to Cassanova Brothers. I will definitely become a regular!
