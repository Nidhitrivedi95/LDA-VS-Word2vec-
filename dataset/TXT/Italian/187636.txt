OThAF-lt6d7jY-pB1ajWPg Amazing food!  Loved it!  My husband and I came here on a whim and boy, am I glad we did.  Jo Jo Carloni's is currently located in a small strip mall and you can easily pass it by without knowing that it's there. They will be moving to a much larger place in Berea this winter and I'm glad to hear that.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Even the staff on the younger side were very professional.  I really didn't know what I wanted to eat and quite honestly, we weren't expecting much when we walked in so the amazing menu caught me off guard. There were several appetizers I wanted to try (calamari, mozzarella balls, and stuffed banana peppers were the three I will be back for) as well as several main dishes that looked amazing so it was hard to decide.  I finally went with the Veal Marsala and it was to die for!  Probably the best I've ever had.  Dinners come with either soup or salad but do yourself a favor and get the Italian wedding soup.  It was delicious!  I loved it! Dinners aren't cheap ($20 for my Veal Marsala) but the portions are large and I felt you got your moneys worth.  I didn't feel like having a drink that night but they had a wine list consisting of Italian wines that was hard to pass up.  I will save room for those next time.  I also saw that they take $10 off bottles of wine for take out or delivery.  That's a bargain!  My husband had pizza. I took a bite and really liked it as well. As far as dessert goes, we took cannoli's to go and they were excellent. The other desserts, all home made, looked fabulous too.  I will be back and when they are closer to me in Berea, I'm sure I'll be a regular!
