i53HvxUdQEMllZ1XmpjjyA I ordered a steak and cheese "sandwich" that was actually a calzone and not a sandwich at all. The calzone was completely covered in salt and the steak was akin to what dog food looks like.
When I called to inform the restaurant that they made a mistake the woman on the end of the line tried to tell me that's just the way they make them. I told her that a sandwich is most definitely not a calzone. She then proceeded to argue and talk over me (lying) and told me that it clearly states on the menu that they make it like a calzone, when that is not true at all. What a creep!!! 
Shady business. The quality of the food is garbage. Do yourself a favor and do not ever order from this disgusting, unethical joke of a restaurant.
