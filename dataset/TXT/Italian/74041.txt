CPgyfcsyPegLha1ajaSRoA I have always loved Italian Food & Wine, Pasta II makes Italian just like my Mother use to make. I was here tonight and ordered the Spaghetti & Homemade hot sausage !!!!! Delicious (As usual) Ad a bottle of Merlot and This is Heaven !

Jamie was our waitress and although she looked very busy , She did an Awesome job of keeping us in fresh HOT Italian bread and drinks. She brought out this desert tray that will make tears come to your eye. Even though , I needed a freekin crane to lift me out of my seat , I ordered The Chocolate Moose & coffee.

Well ,I guess I'll be skipping meals for a MONTH.

The Parking is Tough , and the wait was about 30 Min to get in , and leaving the parking lot is a bit tricky. That being said , You have gotta try this place. ( Again ) 

Very reasonable prices. Excellent Staff , and the BEST Italian ( so far ) in Pittsburgh.
