pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw it lives up to the hype of being one of the top pizza places in the country.
the one that everyone goes to in phoenix usually has a 2 hour wait.  I called on a friday night and they told me the wait was 2hours.  Advised me to call the other location on 20th and camelback.  NO WAIT.  Quiet, quaint, amazing service
great wine list
apps were delicous

the pizzas are good for 1-2 people.  Outstanding flavor.
I felt like i was in italy.
The gelato..holy cow.  Even their coffee....
the couple i was with even raved about how everything about the place made them feel like they were back in italy.  
love this place
highly recommended
