pjpUOlJLlkIxBZ5BquA2PA Stopped in for lunch the other day based on all the great reviews. The lunch crowd was in full swing but I'm not sure what all the hype was about.
I had one of the paninis, which are truly HUGE, but it wasn't anything special.  It was good, hot, well made, etc but didn't live up to the hype. Maybe my expectations were too high?  I was looking for the "wow" factor but it wasn't there
