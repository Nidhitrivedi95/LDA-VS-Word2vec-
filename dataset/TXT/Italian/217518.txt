RZdrNayqoUjovdoJ4GWe-Q This was not good pizza.   Topings were good that's where the 2 stars go.   Pizza dough was like soft cardboard.   We got the meat mania.  Also got cheese garlic bread...   I could have made this with French bread with butter and melted mozzarella cheese ...   Got their garlic doughnuts..  This was a copy of Olive Garden's dessert that French doughnut with Hersey chocolate syrup..   Nice delivery service the guy was really nice...   But dont think we'll ever go back.
