pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA My husband and I had the pleasure of experience the 7 course tasting menu a couple of weeks ago. We'd already dined there before having one of their very creative pizzas and the must try chocolate soup with puff pastry.
The tasting menu included everything from a fruit and cheese plate and 2 desserts to steak medallions with potatoes, deconstructed Greek salad and, my personal favorite of the evening, roasted brussel sprouts with wonderfully crisped salami.
Enhancing the experience all the more was the knowledgeable, enthusiastic staff.
My only suggestion would have been to serve the 1st wine pairing before the course was served as we like to have our drinks served immediately upon being seated.
Truly a hidden treasure in downtown Phoenix - we will be back!
