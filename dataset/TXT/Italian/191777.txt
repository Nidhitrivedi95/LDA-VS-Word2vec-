pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ The quality of the food and the flavor is definitely there. The portions, however, are very small. For example, I ordered a Caesar salad before my meal, and it came out on a small plate instead of a bowl. I paid $10 for a about 5 bites of salad. It tasted good, but I was hungry. I then had some ravioli. Delish! But again, I got about 6-7 raviolis on a regular sized dish-$18. I spent about $30 on myself alone and left hungry.
