tLnIHvvhtDPmCLoUrDaMaQ We've been looking for a down-home traditional italian restaurant for quite some time.  Luckily we've stumbled on Mama Lena's.  The food was great.  Everything from the bread, butter, appetizers to the main course.  Our kids loved it too.  Meals at other tables looked wonderful as well.

Quaint atmosphere included an older guy playing music on a jazz guitar.  We will absolutely be coming back again.

As you would expect from a small town restaurant, it was very affordable as well.

The only thing keeping it from being a five-star, was the salads.  They were okay - not bad, just okay.
