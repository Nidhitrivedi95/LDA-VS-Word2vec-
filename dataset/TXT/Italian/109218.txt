G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q We had such a great experience here. No complaints at all. The food was great. Service was excellent and we were fortunate enough to meet Giada herself!

The restaurant was truly beautiful. The decor was so personal and modern. It felt like sitting in her living room. The views were spectacular as well. You can catch the Bellagio fountain show from your dinner table. 

The food was delicious. It was the lightest and freshest Italian food I have ever had. We ordered the spaghetti which was composed of handmade pasta, capers, and prawns in a light lemon olive oil sauce. It was so refreshing and not oily at all. We also ordered the frito misto which came with lemon aioli. The seafood was fried to a crisp perfection. The calamari salad we had was okay. We also ordered a margherita pizzete. It was so light and airy. 

Giada's also offers a very delicious bread platter with a series of different spices and toppings complimentary with your meal. It was great. She also have us Italian Basil Lemonade on the house. It was crisp and refreshing. 

Overall, we had a great experience at Giada's. Everything was perfect. Congrats on being the first female chef on the Strip!
