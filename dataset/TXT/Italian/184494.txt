OIBF9WI7vuWo03AyvJd-0g I had the most pleasant evening here with my girlfriend. I was celebrating an anniversary that was very special to me & the setting was perfect.

The service is not only the best I have received in Toronto, but possibly the best I have received in any restaurant I have dined in. It made the slightly higher prices seem more than worthwhile.

I ordered the rack of lamb, which was truly delicious, I would recommend it to anyone. The waiter was polite throughout & attentive to all of our needs. Needless to say my girlfriend was praised for her choice of restaurant, and we will be back.

Thanks!
