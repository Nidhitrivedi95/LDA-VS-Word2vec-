bXbCGFk3ZjLcTdQQB-xPyQ I've been waiting to try Luciano's and finally got the chance for a friend's birthday dinner. And it was well worth the wait! 

There were about 14 of us in the party so we were seated in the private dining area and that worked out so well! We were able to enjoy the evening and feel like we basically had the place to ourselves! 

Our waiter was Fernando and he was awesome! He was supper attentive and we always had what we needed and that's no easy task when you have 14 starving ladies! We started off with some sangrias and the bread with marinara. Those sangrias definitely packed a punch. Don't think of your typical sangria mix....kick it up a few notches and you have the Luciano's version. So good! 

To start, I ordered the Wedge salad which come topped with tomatoes, bacon, parmigiano dressing, and gorgonzola cheese. It's a classic,  not overdone or too fancy. Add to that the dressing was perfect! I'd definitely recommend. For  my dinner I ordered the Shrimp Fra Diavolo. My goodness. The large shrimp were perfectly cooked and the marinara and brandy combination was so flavorful! 

So glad I had the opportunity to give this place a try. The service and food were both excellent and I look forward to my next visit.
