0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw Wifey brought me here, she was actually looking for this other breakfast spot that had breakfast bagels but it wasnt there anymore. So we decided to check out this restaurant being it was right there and we were hungry. 

You walk in and get that old school diner feel (which I like) with counter and all. We were seated immediately and asked what we would like to drink. Menu is huge! So many options and you can even pick from their lunch menu. I actually intended on ordering the eggs benedict when something caught my eye....LOBSTER BENEDICT!! Holy crap that sounds freaking good. 

So within 15 minutes I had this delicious and awesome looking meal sitting in front of me, I drenched it with tapatio and dug right in. This has got to be the best egg benedict I have ever had. I don't think I would even try anything else on the menu and risk missing out on this the next time I come. They were not stingy with the lobster meat either, you savor every bite. 

With this awesomeness came these potatoes that were similar to chips only soft, they were equally delish, especially mix with the yolk from the eggs benedict. The service was great, she checked up on us quite often and refilled our drinks as needed. The eggs benedict was like $11 so for $3 more try it with lobster, you will not regret it.
