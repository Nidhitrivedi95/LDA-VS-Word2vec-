6I27BTuHI5PMvOBG4WS8NQ Stopped here on a whim. Had to locate a place with food for my son and something nice for the adults.  This place covered all the bases.  The atmosphere is really nice and quite.   The waiter Tim was pleasant and very nice to our son who was hungry and tired.   The starters mixed salad and vegetable soup were great.  We had a great selection from the menu. I had the evenings special salmon with egg plant and onions which was great.  My mum had the lamb chops which were also amazing. The ravioli was home made and great. The cheese was very flavorful.  For the price this place was a hidden gem. Thank you Yelp for having a place to find these types of places.
