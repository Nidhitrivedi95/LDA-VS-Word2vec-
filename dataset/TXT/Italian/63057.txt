I've been here twice now and had 2 vastly different experiences. The first time, I had the famous mushroom pasta and it was divine. The second time (yesterday), I opted for something lighter as I'd had a big lunch, and went for the grilled octopus. The portion size, I was prepared for (it's an appetizer). Although I can get 2x the meat at other places, I assumed that at that price point, it would be something to write home about.

It wasn't.

The octopus was overcooked and completely bland. I've never salted food at a restaurant before, but I had to do it because it was just so.... not good. The sauces it came with made little sense too. The octopus was served on maybe two mini yellow potatoes, which just seemed wholly unnecessary at that point.

My one friend got the Bucatini Amatriciana (glorified spaghetti and tomato sauce), and my other friend ordered the burger (the aioli served with the fries left much to be desired). They both agreed it was decent but vastly overpriced.

At $1/oz, the Gusto house wine is a huge redeeming factor. The red is very tasty and they made sure to keep my glass full. Our server was also awesome - attentive and a total sweetheart. Those two elements saved the experience somewhat, but now I know - don't stray from the mushroom pasta. Just don't.
