74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw 4|24\08 Returned to Onda as part of the dinner package for LOVE and had a very different experience than last time.

Menu extremely limited 3 items I believe and at $50 each not a good value when you can do a la carte for about he same price

And then there was the food: Caesar's salad, Minestrone, Veal Marsala, crusted Sea Bass with veggie and 2 small chocolate mousse(only dessert offered)
Service was slow and we were ignored essentially

This was a forgettable experience...see the show LOVE...skip the dinner package at Onda at least

Agree with Kristin S the tomato olive garlic in olive oil served with a Variety of Italian breads was a great start
Caprese  salad and Blue cheese with apple/on Romaine  were fresh and tasty
Ossa Buco on a bed of Risotto was soooo....good
Sweet pea ravioli with melted butter and balsamic vinegar was enjoyed at the table and later in our room
Dessert we split a  creme brule that was a solid finish to very good meal...there were no disappointments
