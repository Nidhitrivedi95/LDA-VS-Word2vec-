Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag We did the Sunday family style dinner as part of my bachelorette party and honestly best meal we had in Vegas all weekend! A ton of food for 20 dollars a person and it was soo flavorful! (salad, pizza, meatballs, chicken parm and 2 desserts). And all the entrees were delicious, every part was exceptional.  Shout out to our server Vance!
