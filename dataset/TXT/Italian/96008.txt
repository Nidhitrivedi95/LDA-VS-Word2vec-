eQCYur0033RkZdh5VjbF8A Having had brunch and dinner at multiple O&B locations.  I believe their strong suit is their brunch.  My wife and I ordered Huevo Rancheros and they had a special with Pork Belly.   

The Huevo Rancheros was delicious, my only complaint is that it could have had little more spice; the tomatoes in the pico de gallo could have be chopped finer.

The Pork Belly special was amazing.  The pork skin was nice, crispy,  charred slightly and perfectly seasoned.  They should add this as a regular brunch item - I'd get it every time.

Surprisingly, most brunch places downtown usually have long line ups.  But O&B has a big space so I know if I am hard on time, I will be heading here for brunch for good and fast service.
