I love how I just drive by places like this and never think to try them or never see them at all, I sure have been missing out. Like, how interesting to have the choice between pasta or Asian food, I wouldn't have thought to make the connection, so props to the owners. Normally, I would say that a place like this is "culturally-confused", but they do a good job at it so I can't complain. There was European and Asian decor all over the place, hah, loved the tele booth! It was so cozy and clean, the store fronts to places like these always throw me off, I never know what to expect inside.

I had a very large lunch today, my combo came with salad, soba/udon soup, and a Californian roll. I choose the Kitsune Udon, I never had tofu seasoned like that before, it was almost like eating dessert, in a big bowl of noodles, so very sweet. I'm not the one to purposefully eat Californian rolls but there's was great and so nicely presented. And to drink, (smirk) I had the Japanese Mojito, which had sake instead of rum (I figured why the heck not, I tried a mojito made with whiskey the week prior!). Shockingly delicious, def could taste the sake but in a good way, also there iced green tea was refreshing.

Now, with a full belly and happy heart, this afternoon's studying will be a bit more bearable. Thank you for an afternoon affair to remember Cherryblossom!
