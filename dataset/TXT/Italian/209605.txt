Ended up they don't have specials and tried to gouge money from us. One of my gullible friend fell for the water trap of having natural water costing $8 for each bottle and they brought us a few bottles.

Despite this, the lunch set menu is worth the try as the food quality was good and the deco within the store is amazing. I had a good experience overall and appreciated the dining experience.
