JI88Hdn6TM6rpYIUEk_xwA We wanted to come back here because we have been here a few years ago and thought the food was fantastic.  

I would echo a previous comment that the service is very slow.  They weren't crowded so I am not sure why it was so slow.  It is nice to have a leisurely pace, but this was excessive.  Our server was very sweet, and suggested a wine which fit our taste perfectly and was reasonably priced.

The food was 4 or a scale of 5.  Quite good, but not "out of this world good".  I must confess we are very hard to please, so a 4 of 5 for Italian food is a very good score.

The ambiance is quiet, with no TVs or distractions.

Definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a place with a slow pace.
