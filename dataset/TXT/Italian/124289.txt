HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ Enjoyed a fabulous dinner last night. It's the total package - Delicious food, awesome atmosphere and great service. 
We dined outside where the Strip is your backdrop 64 stories up. We started with the Heirloom tomatoes and gnocci, which were little puffy pillows of love. For entrees we ordered the Rack of Lamb and Lobster with purple artichokes. Both cooked to perfection. A great portion of Lobster in a flavorful and unique sauce, not your common butter or lemon. Only two downfalls, there was a bit more fat on the lamb than expected. Our waiter also tried to change our drink order to a cabernet to enjoy with the lamb instead of the white wine that was ordered. We didn't ask for the suggestion and felt as though we were be corrected about our choice.
This is definitely a place to treat yourself to a great dinner!
