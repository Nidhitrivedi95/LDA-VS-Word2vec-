366FaRQ1MWEHBhaEKTcriQ 5 stars. Everytime. My family has been coming to Spinato's since I was a kid and have never had a less than delicious pizza. I now bring my own kids here and they love it too. 
I love toppings but the cheese pizza is stellar. The meatball trio is to excellent. 
Can't say enough good things. Thank you!
