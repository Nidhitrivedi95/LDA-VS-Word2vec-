zYb4kj2R54R2YPeNm829BA First impression. 
Trash strewn about the front door , over flowing trash bin as u enter , weeds growing all over the landscaping . 
When the place looks like this on the outside , Its no surprise to see an empty establishment on the inside. 

The place has no real identity as to what it wants to be . Bar / Resturant  or what .... 
Food is absolutely nothing to be desired as the pastas are over priced and just not good. The food came quickly which tells me that the microwave is used frequently to reheat ur food . The same food that's ever so eloquently advertised on the menu as fresh. 
How can it food be so fresh when the place is dead/asleep ... No customers = no turnover = spoiled fast prepared food . 
The staff just looks like they don't want to be there . 
The management just don't care and the owners either are not aware or are of the same mentality. If this place is still around in a year I will eat my shoe..... 
Btw ,  I ordered a draft beer which was not cold . Even the coke was flat and had a weird flavor.  If ur appreciate mediocrity and have low standards for where u eat , than u won't mind this place and this review is not for u . But if care about quality , than stay away from this place . Instead of Sauce it should be called Shit !!!!
