Some notes:
-They begin with a seafood cart with the fresh fish of the evening. We elected to share the John Dory. Quite honestly, it was good but not worth the hype. I have had much tastier fish. 
-The pasta dishes were fantastic and the risotto was up there with some of the best I have ever had. 
-We had some langoustines. Hardly any meat. A big tease. Skip these.
Service was very good and this was a very enjoyable night. Steve Wynn even walked by with his wife on the way to his table and said hello.
