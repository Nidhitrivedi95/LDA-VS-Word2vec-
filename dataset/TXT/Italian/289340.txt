ZtJ6sTq7-5rL9ORUtQJHAQ We didn't have a reservation and they were more than happy to take us in. Hosts were nice and refilled my water without having me to ask even once.

I did not notice any girl hostesses or servers that night? Maybe they were off or something.

Food: Servers were very friendly in recommending something to eat from the menu. We had portabella mushroom as an appetizer and I had fish to eat for dinner. it was really good.

Prices were on the upside. This place is great for date night and small social gatherings. I would come back here.
