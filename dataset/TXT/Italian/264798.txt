wyKd4F1fAfDCA1rTxSoT_A Great 1st meal in Montreal. Tapas so we tried several things ranked in order...

Calamars Grilles...fabulous

Salad Caprese...nice take on the dish 

Raviolis Maison aux Homard...texture, flavor, etc, just hit all the marks of a good dish.

Carpaccio de Boeuf...solid. 1 of my favorite things to order but it was out-shone on this night.

Tirimisu...made it move (Seinfeld reference).

Still mad that my brother-in-law nixed the lamb chops in maple and pistachio crust. But all-in-all, great start to 4 nights in Old Montreal. Service was a bit slow, but it seemed to fit the vibe. Would definitely go back.
