rIWS5y7-hZYcFoCac4AXdg Frankie and Bennys is one of the main chain restaurants that you will find on out of town retail parks. This of course means that the only time you're really likely to come here is if you've just finished your shopping or are planning a night at the nearby cinema or bowling alley (both of these are roughly a 5 minute walk away).


 The food here is good - typical Italian/American fare - but well preperared and of a consistently high standard. My personal faves including the chicken and ribs, plus the salmon fish cakes - both delicious with their house mashed potatoe! They also do a nice range of high-calorie(!) deserts and some lovely starters - my fave here being 'Mamas Cheese Bake'.


 The staff seem to be different every time, but they are efficient and polite. Overall I quite like this place, even if it is a fairly typical 'chain' - you know what you're going to get and it almost always delivers to a good standard.
