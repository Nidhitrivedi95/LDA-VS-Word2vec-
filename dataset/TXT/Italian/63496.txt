b83NNHvvWQk-DTTzs-3WLA I used to eat here regularly, but since they took the hummus sandwich of the menu (and out of the app) I rarely go. It's so stupid because they still have hummus, it's just not a bag option anymore. I contacted customer service online and was told I could order a different sandwich and customize it in the notes section. But, given how frequently they would get my sandwich wrong before, it wasn't worth the risk. I got a coupon for a free one recently so I tried it again in person. I had to order an avocado one, hold the avocado and add hummus. It tasted fine, and was made correctly, but I still wouldn't be comfortable ordering it online without looking the employees in they eye to explain what I want. Bring back the hummus sandwich option!
