Today I called thinking I'll call ahead so my food would be ready when I got there, nope... Whoever was in there told me to call back in 10 min. I told the man I could just walk down there in that time frame, which I did. Turns out they were closed and seemed an hour late opening . As a customer this place lacks business sense.
