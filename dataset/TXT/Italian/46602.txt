8qNOI6Q1-rJrvWWD5Btz6w Used to love their Chicken Alfredo. After more than one bad experience though, I'll pass. Ordered Chicken Salads for work one time and all that ate it got sick. Was told that it couldn't be from the chicken because food poisoning takes 24hrs. We all got sick right after eating. Food is always cold when delivered too. Overpriced for the quality in my opinion.
