G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I've been wanting to try Giada for some time now.  My friends surprised me with a birthday dinner here and I was very surprised based on some of the reviews how well dinner was. First their customer service is THE BEST! In a city where you can pick any celebrity chefs restaurant to dine great customer service is a must.  My favorite was the Burratta! I had the short rib for my main course and it was perfectly cooked. The plate did need a pinch of salt but nothing to ruin the dish. My friends had the short rib as well as the rosiotto, all were pleased. I will return again to check out her brunch.
