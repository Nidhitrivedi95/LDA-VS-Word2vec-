Ojw5eTqzbv6k27_Df3q0-A We like to go here when we want to have a more upscale meal at place that's still kid friendly. 

The food is good. We've had a lot of different entrees and they're pleasant but nothing too memorable. We usually leave saying, "That was good," but if you asked us what we had a few days later we probably couldn't tell you. It's the atmosphere and reasonable prices that keep us coming back. 

Kids love drawing on the butcher paper on the tables (so do we) and they love the small, complementary fruit and veggie dish that comes out early to help occupy their time. 

We (the adults) like the fairly interesting menu, the bread (dipped in olive oil) and a decor that is on the verge of being "chain-like" but still manages to make it feel like "date night". 

Never a problem with service - although never any service that really "wowed" us either. Although we did book one of the back rooms for a birthday party and the staff was attentive and helpful. 

Kind of middle of the road, but reliably good is how I'd describe Biaggi's.
