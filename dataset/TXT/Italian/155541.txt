L23qeWacyCZFjF9DL6o04w Good fast delivery. Ordered through Yelp Eat 24 and it was seamless. 
We order traditional Buffalo wings and they were good. I prefer mine a little cripsier, so I'll request that next time. Wings were a good size and had flavor.

We splurged and got the Italian fries... I would say those are better for dine in as they get cool on the delivery route and stick together versus being ooey-gooey.

Overall good food and ervice.
