G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Giada, I hope you read this.  I have owned my own restaurants and quite frankly, I was embarrassed for you.  Firstly, the hotel needs to give the restaurant better signage.  We were given misinformation about where the restaurant was and took the wrong set of elevators up.  We found a manager on the floor who told us that happens to guests all the time.   
My husband and I arrived at the front desk and were made to wait for 15 minutes with a half empty restaurant.  Since he was on oxygen, I thought this was inexcusable.  While waiting I walked over to look at the assortment of olives etc. in the display and noticed the bread platters set up for service.  Almost all the dishes were cracked and looked like dishes that should have all been rejected for service.  
We were seated and enjoyed the Dry Cured Basque Salume, and Parmigiano-Reggiano appetizers.  Our server highly recommended the signature Spaghetti with shrimp, lemon and basil.  When it arrived it was under cooked, not hot and did not have the slightest taste of lemon.  We were very disappointed.  
Overall I would not recommend the restaurant but gave it two stars because we had a server who did a good job.  He did remove the cost of the spaghetti from our bill.  
They need to get back in there and take a good look at what is going on.  It needs serious help.
