JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw Food was simply blah at first the appetizer was served with the salad?????The mushroom salad was nice and fresh but the fried baby artichokes were over fried and like eating mulch. Our entrees took forever (thought oh good they'll be fresh and hot)when they came out the we're cold WTF sent back not paying these prices for cold food. The manager brought out a complimentary arrachinii (fried rice balls on sauce!? Not that good we've had better at olive garden) my wife's bread was soggy and smelled like lemon?? When the replacement entrees were served they were okay ( of course Pipping hot) but the ravioli tasted a little under cooked and my blackened cod was warm (very small) All in all our dinning experience was very sub par servers standing around cook were all just standing back there BSing not a professionaly run place I water like 15 min to get a water refill and that was after we had to ask for it. Will not return to Chinato and I hope Zak Burrells other establishments are better and this isn't setting the precident.
