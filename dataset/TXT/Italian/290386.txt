ZvtELJTUOh0yRrPxyyiakQ This review is for the location on Elliot Rd in Tempe, however a lot of my comments apply to the entire chain.  I've been to Oregano's many times since moving to the Phoenix area, and up until recently it was my favorite pizza place in the valley.  However since they have changed their menu things have really seemed to go downhill.  

The menu variety has been reduced drastically, many of the items that were my favorites are not even available any more (Chipotle Chicken Club Pizza, I'm looking at you).  No doubt this was to cut down on food cost, but the result is that a lot of the things that made Oregano's great no longer exist.  

The execution of the menu items that they do have has been inconsistent for me the last three or four visits.  Today at the Elliot location the stuffed pizza that we ordered came out way overdone, the crust was pretty burnt.  Anybody that has ordered one of these pizzas before knows that they take nearly an hour to prepare.  There was no way we were going to send it back and wait another hour for a replacement.  Unfortunately issues like this seem to be becoming common for the chain.  

I could go on with issues seen during previous recent visits, but the bottom line is that there are too many good pizza places around to spend any more time with this one.  I no longer recommend the chain, and probably will not return.
