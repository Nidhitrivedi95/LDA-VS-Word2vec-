pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ To start off we ordered the arancini and the pomordoro bruschetta and it was absolutely amazing the bruschetta was deliciously seasoned, nice and fresh, on a lightly toasted but soft Italian bread, highly recommend it! The arancini was absolutely to die for! Down to the basil it was served with, bellissimo! That alone got my five stars! Lol then we went on and order the baked rigatoni and the spinach and farro salad, OMG THE RICOTTA , on top of the rigatoni was the best! So creamy and fulfilling. the salad a nice balance of bitter salty and acidic favors . I was disappointed only at the fact I got so full cause I really wanted to try their canolis lol delish delish delish is all I can say!
