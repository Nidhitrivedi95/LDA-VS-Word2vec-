NILiO6pq_0vLnCUn7KuU0Q What a cool little place. 

Everything is very traditional. Fresh made pasta, sauces, meats and deli. 

Their pizza sauce is very very good. They also have pre made pizza dough. They also have Gluten free dough available for purchase. 

I will say this... My favorite sub in all of Madison... The OTTO. So very tasty.
