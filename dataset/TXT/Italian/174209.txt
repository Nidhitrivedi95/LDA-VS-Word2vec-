nBl_4gw5ecGzNkHyzfii8g this is a really great restaurant.  I've tried a bunch of their pizzas and they r all REALLy good.  thin crust, all delicious.  But the dish i think about randomly is their Ravioli di Zio Paperone -homemade ravioli stuffed with duck confit, fig, roasted butternut squash, sauteed with oyster, button mushrooms and parmigiano. MELT. in. your. mouth goodness! actually SO good but the portion is a bittt small for my liking.  I'm always down to come here.
