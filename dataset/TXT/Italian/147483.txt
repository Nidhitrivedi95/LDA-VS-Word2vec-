KBQcNy9k9G8_a5WtrVGH8w A-OK indeed.

It seems like this place has had better days.. I've loved coming here for years but i think the service and quality of the food have slipped a lot in the past while. 

I still love the ambiance. The wooden tables elbow-greased to a silky sheen. The old, quiet waiters who tuck your chair in for you if you're a lady. The candle wax that's that's been melting into the windowsill for decades probably, candle after candle, becoming a funny monument to this place's stagnancy. 

I do love the shabby charm of the place, though. And I like the food. It's nothing near authentic or creative but its always been fresh for me, the flavour is generally balanced and enjoyable, and the seafood, veggies, and meats taste fresh and good quality. Comfort food. The menu is extensive, but I only ever order caesar salad and pastas. I love the hot and smoky and the squid ink linguine. Gimmicky, cute little dishes with good ingredients for a cheap price. 

It's cheap to eat here and its nice and cosy to sit in the window and do some people watching. I like to go here for casual, comfy cheap dates. 

I hate the idea of getting pasta for takeout because its so easy to make and so nice to eat fresh and hot.. but as a heads up their takeout menu is a couple of dollars cheaper for every dish.

It's a good idea to make a reservation if you're eating in because this place is tiny (and the seats by the window are nice and private). The most recent time I went to this place, which probably only seats 15 comfortably, the waiters had taken a boisterous group of ten or so and it was very distracting and disappointing. Best to go when its not crowded.
