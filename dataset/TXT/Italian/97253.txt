esnvHQxunLTAckQpntqbCg I had a really lovely experience here. Myself and a friend came for a 1 pm lunch on a Saturday. Bright open white space and lots of seating.  I had the special tagliatelle with wild boar ragu and it was sensational. The pasta was so fresh and light and the sauce was flavourful.  The portion was perfect for lunch - what a treat.  The owner (originally from Milan) was so sweet and a pleasure to chat with.  Will definitely be going back.
