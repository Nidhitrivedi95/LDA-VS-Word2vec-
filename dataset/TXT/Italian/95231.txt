eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg I was simply stunned at how delicious and seemingly authentic the food was here. I hope the next time I dine here the food stays consistent, the chef who was working the nights I've went is GOOD! I grew up eating my way through North Beach w/my Grandmum, so we are a bit snobbish and jaded when it comes to our Italian food. I was surpirsed to find something this good in Downtown Las Vegas. I love sitting in the extended dining room area so I can check out the pool!   ;)
