Mi5uhdFB9OJteXPd0_IKfw Dined here on 4/2/17. Service was fast despite the crowd. Kassidi was our waitress, and did an amazing job! She was informative and helpful with our menu related questions, and we never had an empty drink! Our food was served promptly, and the orders were accurate. Generous portions, great food! Kassidi went above and beyond with her service and friendliness! Strongly recommend this location!
