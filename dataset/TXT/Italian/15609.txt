1Tak6Q-IlkDrdmLwrEZeSg This is a great locals spot! My husband and I went here on a Saturday night around 9 and did not have to wait to be seated. I had the chicken and artichokes and it was delicious! They also have a great house sangria. I was going to order their raspberry beer, but our server was honest with me and told me it was really bitter and suggested the sangria instead. I'm glad she did.

The prices were good and the portions were large enough to have left overs the next day. The first time you go in mention it's your first time there and you'll get a slice of their cheesecake for free! They were out the night we went, but they offered us German chocolate cake instead and assured us we could have the cheesecake next time we're there. I'm looking forward to it. :)
