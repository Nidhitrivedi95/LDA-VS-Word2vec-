bKrQEKxC9S5k-oz5VKiNVg Finally got around to trying this pretty spot in my neighbourhood, located just on the corner of the Parc de la Petite Italie, across the street from Triple Crown Dinette. The food was simple but fresh and tasty, we tried the beef and tomato meat balls, the onion bhaji, the mushroom risotto, and the brussels sprouts with pear. The risotto and the meatballs were super delicious, really nice flavours, well cooked, I will crave this and go back for it plus a glass of wine any time. 

The beer list was limited to like 4 and not much on it that I like, but the wine and cocktails offered an interesting and affordable selection. 

The room is very pretty, warm and well laid-out with a few picnic tables outside, and the staff were friendly, quick and well informed about the food. This place is like an updated family restaurant and a great addition to the neighbourhood.
