D2RoOb4UkH2azf8DgvNfUA This location is officially a Wing Street now. Which means more, better, wing options, wedge fries, mozz sticks, and sandwiches. This location has been one of the better Pizza Hut's Ive been too. As along as you go in before or even after rush hour you'll have  great service. If you want pizza for dinner be sure to order before dinner. As silly as it sounds, you'll avoid having to wait an hour or more just for your pizza no matter if its carry-out or delivery. Ive learned the hard way thats theres no way Im going to get fed in 30 mins. I had a mix up once with my order, the cashier didnt know what to do about, I assume they were new. But one of the waitresses stepped in and took care of the situation for me. Got me a fresh pizza made with the correct toppings. She even offered me a store credit for next time if I didnt want to wait for another pizza to be made. 

The dining area has greatly improved since the first time I ate here a few years ago. Now they even have flat screen tvs up. I stopped in to pick up a pizza for the super bowl and was surprised the dining area was completely empty. I think for next year I'm going to skip on inviting ppl over to my house and just have the super bowl party at Pizza Hut. Heck! If we can the place to ourselves and not have to clean up, why not?

And be sure to sign up for their rewards program!!
