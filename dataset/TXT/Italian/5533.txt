_qA2HPqgLiBc-M4wRyml0g I found this place on Yelp, it definitely stuck out because of the rave reviews.  My friend and I went, and we were both blown away by what turned out to be one of the best dining experiences we've ever had!  As an appetizer, we ordered the house made burrata.  It came with wilted kale, a fresh apricot compote, and toasted rustic bread.  What an incredible combination of flavors, they all complimented each other beautifully.  The burrata was fresh and creamy, hands down, the best burrata I've ever had.  It was so delicious, that we completely forgot that we also ordered a pizza.  We chose the "Flavortown", which was drizzled with delicious truffle oil, that I could immediately smell, as it was being brought to our table.  As soon as we took a bite, we completely forgot about the appetizer we just had.  The pizza was amazing, I've never had anything like it...ever!  It was cooked Neapolitan Style,  which goes into a 1,000 degree oven, and brought to your table within 90 seconds.  I highly recommend this place, which I have now bookmarked.  I haven't stopped talking about it , since we went on Saturday.  I can't wait to come here with friends and family.  Lastly, our server Kassandra was very sweet, and very attentive and engaging.  When the Chef and Owner John found out how much we enjoyed ourselves, he came over to introduce himself, and thanked us for coming in.  It wasn't too busy when we got there, probably because it's hidden in the far end of the shopping center where it's located.  Don't let that stop you, it's well worth it!
