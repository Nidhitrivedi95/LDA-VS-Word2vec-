TLbx_MR2dyFztoyR5d9H2A I must say I'm surprised with some of these reviews. I've been coming off and on since they opened. Ross does a great job and is almost always there. Most of the time I order the pizza, but I've also had dinner several times in the restaurant including a great Valentine's dinner a few years back. They are in my rotation of places to go. 
   The restaurant is clean and service is good. Yes, the atmosphere is a little on the dull side. Kinda like a pizza pub trying to cross over to finer dining. My guess is if they could get a better interior you'd see more people coming in for supper, but that's why I don't own these places only eat at them. 

  Ross has great food and fresh pasta every time I stop by.

  Pizza = Thick and cheesy like I love it. Crust is chewy and tasty. And I love the italian sausage they use. 

  Chicken Parm= Out of this world. Love the sauce and they use a nice plump chicken breast.
  
   Ravioli = Fantastic, fresh made and one of our favorites.

  Try it and enjoy!
