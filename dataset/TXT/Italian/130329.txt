iag4htR8F7FmE9zpz7_GMw Both pizza and pasta are delicious. I have tried the Smoke Prosciutto and Salsiccia (pizzas) and both were fantastic, the fist is sweet and the second one has some heat. 

The Carbonara pasta is my favourite, I haven't tried one that good in Canada (my fav is from my city Medellín), and now I always craving it. I went two weeks ago and my companion made a mistake ordering the pasta and they brought me one I didn't want to! I told the server and she was happy to change it for the Carbonara at no extra cost! So no disappointment. 

Desserts are good. Fair prices. Excellent quality. Bottle beer/wine available. Simple menu.
