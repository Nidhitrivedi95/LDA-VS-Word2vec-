So132GP_uy3XbGs0KNyzyw Somewhere, between the days when the Italian mob used to run this town and today, Italian restaurants in Vegas started acting like the coward bully who only starts picking on people and acting like a big shot when he thinks the teacher is not coming back. Most of them have great food and many of them try to show off their connections to the days of old, pretending to be something they never were and never could be.

Casa di Amore is one of those establishments that has a real connection to Vegas' past, but lacks the pretention of those other joints. Everyone here, from staff to management to the customers who make Casa di Amore their regular stop, is genuinely low key and laid back. They're far more interested in making sure you enjoy yourself with some old-time Vegas than trying to pretend they are some big shot from the glory days.

The food is exactly as good as you expect and never let's you down. The price point is extremely reasonable, especially on half price wine bottle night. 

Stop in and you'll be made to fell at home - with a great meal and a fabulous experience.
