nS6QENxe6YODNrQ45bpC-A Late night or 5 am food on a Saturday night? Don't want to leave your hotel room? This place is it. Fast Italian, so don't get your hopes up. Got a dinner salad though and was pleasantly surprised by its size & quality. 2 girls late night snacks delivered...$13 plus tip. Can't beat that!
