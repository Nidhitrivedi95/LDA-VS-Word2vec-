UYUoQEbKcoFXs-0VRxrO1g I take huge offense to someone recently posting that the employees are rude.!! This is the one of the very few places that I honestly feel that the employees are happy to be at work...well, maybe not happy to be at work, but they are consistently very cheerful, very attentive and they go out of their way to ask if everything is okay. They even arrive to take away your trays and trash. I have mentioned in previous reviews how impressed I am with the staff!!! I have even said that one can go in grumpy and leave happy because the employee vibe will rub off on you!! In a previous review to that one, I mentioned how happy the employees are on a consistent basis because it is true and noteworthy!!

Like another reviewer stated (and I have stated before) their buffalo pizza is excellent!! I do recommend ordering extra chicken because we like it with extra chicken. Their spaghetti and meatballs are really good! The star are the meatballs! I like the texture and the meatballs have a hint of sausage flavor. YUM!! The wings and pizza are outstanding too!! 

We have been going to this Sardella's location for many years. Never does it disappoint!!
