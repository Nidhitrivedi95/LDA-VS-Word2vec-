DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw It seems like I've been patronizing Ferraro's for over 10 years. We first discovered Ferraro's, at their old location, when I asked our concierge to recommend a good Italian restaurant off the strip. I'm glad I tipped that guy well as Ferraro's has been our go to place since then. I'm really happy that the food quality and service has not suffered with their move. 

We arrived earlier than expected for our dinner reservations but were seated promptly. Service was perfect from water to dessert. Our server took her time explaining the specials, how they were prepared, she checked on us regularly and basically made us feel like we were her only customers, which we were not.
We started with the fried calamari which was perfect. For my entrée I chose the homemade gnocchi with pesto. My wife opted for the lobster ravioli. You sometimes forget how delicious and lite homemade pasta is... The pasta at Ferraro's is just that.

Ferraro's provided desert as we were celebrating a special occasion, which was very gracious of them. I capped off the dinner with an espresso and Sambuca, nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention their wine book, it's not a list. I'm kinda clueless when it comes to Italian wine but others have told me that their wine list is A++.

Ferraro's is fantastico!
