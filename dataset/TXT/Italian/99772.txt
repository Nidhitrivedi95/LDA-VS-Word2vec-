F56TiSa71Tk4PIQ0HN8oag Had a nice lunch here with friends. The warm Pizzazz sub with capicola, ham, & provolone on a  sesame seed bun was tasty, and really loved the option for grilled asparagus & zucchini instead of fries. A friend enjoyed the grilled portobello, and another had the Italian sub. Friendly & fast service. Cool location on the circle!
