q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Went to dinner last night with my husband-made reservation and off we went.....loved the entry way (guy who poked his head out the peep hole was funny) the whole atmosphere was a cool experience- the guy who walks around singing ol town songs was good entertainment-if u give him too much eye contact he will involve u in his performance so if you want privacy its best not too:)  our waitress was HORRIBLE!! She came to our table a total 3times (got drinks-took order-brought check!!)which made for a very long dinner-1 1/2hrs.....the bus boys/real waiter is who I found at end of night and handed a tip too!! 
Salad w/dinner was ok*Rigatoni Trafficante was delish I must say
Husbands 14oz Ribeye I wanted to break out a scale-NO way it was more than 9oz *mad i didnt take a picture to post.....my husband looked at me and said the garlic mashed potatoes had 0% flavor....I tasted and was sooooooo disapointed:( 
Coulnt believe they charged 39.95 for this steak !!! Bill came to over $80
And it was sooooo not worth the dough.... sorry this comment comes from a real italian who knows how to cook.....but its good for a one time experience if you just get the pasta.....
