zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA This is the best pizza I have had in a long time.  I ordered from Uber Eats for home delivery.
I got the 12 inch thin crust pepperoni pizza.  This pizza was perfect.  Lots of cheese, not greasy, the crust was perfectly crisp, the sauce was delicious and a perfect amout of italian spices scattered on top, and it arrive hot.  This will be my go to pizza place.  Oh by the way I ordered from the Hualapia location in Summerlin.  P.S. I recommend ordering from Uber eats, and please tip your drivers!
