qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg This restaurant was hands down fantastic. This restaurant was located in the Venetian, which is gorgeous and completely unbelievable visually. Tons of italian restaurants but this one was much more reasonably priced than the rest. Service was efficient and quick...in and out in less than an hour. No fountain sodas which was a little weird, but the food was the highlight! DELICIOUS. cannot rave enough..get the chicken parm...out of this world. my friend had the chicken primavera and couldn't stop raving. def a must go.
