3h9K-ZsuG0PwhmyiPrXKhA I cannot believe how amazing this restaurant is! The owner was opening the door for me as I walked up, and was extremely personable and welcoming.  The restaurant is small and cozy, and the food was by far the best Italian I've had in any part of Arizona! Their spinach ravioli was to die for, their beverages are cold and refreshing, and the desserts...don't even get me started! I asked the owner what he would recommend for dessert so he brought me a canoli and a "brownoli", which is a brownie stuffed with canoli cream and dusted with powdered sugar. It is probably my new favorite treat on the planet!! I would definitely and will definitely visit this restaurant on a regular basis, as the owner was very kind (and hilarious), and the food was both reasonably priced and delicious!
