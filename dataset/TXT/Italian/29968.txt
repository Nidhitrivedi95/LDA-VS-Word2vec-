5G-ulG_g_MpcIYlNzaCMmA As the rating suggests...as good as it gets.  OK, so it's not cheap, but in my opinion it's one of the best Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.

Go hungry, and plan on spending at least 2 hours.  I love the grilled sausage and peppers appetizer.  My wife thinks the greens 'n beans are excellent.

We always do a pasta course as well.  The tomato basil sauce with a touch of cream is fantastic.

Their signature dish for years has been the double cut veal chop.  Can't miss.
