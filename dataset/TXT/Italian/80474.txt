D6RDpCS1lfgZdPuLHlpsHA Visited Marcello's for dinner with my family and arrived during happy hour. I asked the waiter for the happy hour deals on wine and he proceeded to open the booklet on our table. I ordered two different wines throughout the night but when the bill came neither of them were happy hour prices! He then walked away, I assumed to fix the bill, but came back informing me that it's only their house wines. You'd think he would have told me that from beginning! As for the food, it was... Meh. Big portions but very oily. I ordered the veal parmigiana which came with an excess of sauce. We did have the eggplant appetizers which is a must have!
