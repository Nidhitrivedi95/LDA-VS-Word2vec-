vUDqNV3RhI3FmZRwS7039g I didn't come away wowed but it was a good experience. Menu has quite a variety and the live jazz was pretty cool, but I don't know, something was lacking. The oysters we had were a little smallish, I split a Caesar salad as well. Dressing needed a little more to it, felt a little bland. Fortunately it came with anchovies to give it more of a Caesar feel. Had the Lobster Fra Diavlo for the main course... think cioppino with a little kick to it. Had half a small lobster tail, mussels, clams, a couple of large shrimp and some fettucini noodles mixed in. Wasn't super filling but it wasn't bad either. Had a darn good bottle of wine though, a 2000 Elk Cove Pinot Gris. In the end it felt like an average meal with typical service. Might try the meat if I get a chance to go back. A few other reviewers raved about the steaks. The specials they offered the night I was there were pretty creative but I just wasn't blown away.
