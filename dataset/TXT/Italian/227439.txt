SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Went here with my parents yesterday to have dinner. We were seated right away. The prices were pretty expensive, but the food was good enough to make up for it. We had a show to watch at 8, and it was already 7 so we were hesitant about when the food was going to be served, but it was served almost right away. The service was alright.
