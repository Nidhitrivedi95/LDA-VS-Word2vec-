dNHDXn2ot4mFc2YfIFBNhQ I went here on New Years Eve of 2015. Why is it so dead?! I am not complaining because we (party of four) got a table right away.

The server introduced herself, took our drink orders, brought them, took our food orders, brought that, brought our check, brought it back, and dismissed us. It was as you would always expect but nothing too special.
