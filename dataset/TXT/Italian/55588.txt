AjJMzRFJjORg-TrpR4DIGQ Where do i start? The service was very good! But it ends there. Food was one of the worst. My husband and i ordered marinara mussels, fried calamari for appetizers. House pasta and lamb shank for main. It came with a choice of soup or salad. We both took the salad. We were told that it would have a balsamic vinaigrette but the salad came without any. The bread basket was sliced sandwich bread from the market. The industrialized ones. Then, the mussels...they were so tasteless! The calamari came with a cold tomato sauce and mayo. Yes, mayo from a tub. The pasta said to be served with a prosciutto rosé sauce but the chef forgot the prosciutto. My lamb was so salty from the powdered sauce mix and the pasta had cream thrown into it. Both dishes had over cooked pasta. And ya, my husband had a chunk of sugar in his pasta sauce! Nothing was good. Everything was bad! I felt like the owners thought that we as customers are idiots and that we could/would eat all this crap and pay for it! Will never recommend this place to anyone. Will never set foot in this place even if it were to be the only restaurant available!
