OIpS3O5ifR0wFu5PdvMM5w Constant problems with this location. I like pizza hut, but not this location and unfortunately it's the only one that can deliver to me. Occasionally they get it right (and when they do it's REALLY GOOD) but most of the time.. problems. Today the pizza was over an hour late and arrived completely cold. When I called and asked where it was they told me it was "on the way." It took additional 45 minutes AFTER HE SAID IT WAS ON THE WAY. Even getting anyone to answer the phone was nearly impossible! Absolute worst customer service. Done. done. done. done.
