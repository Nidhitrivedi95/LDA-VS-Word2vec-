0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw DO NOT EAT HERE... especially if you have kids. this is the same name, but "not affiliated" with the other Omelet Houses. This store is not run the same, and they are not customer friendly. Everything is an upcharge. 

I refuse to order adult portions, and spend $12 for each of my kids to eat, when they only are going to eat a small amount. NO KIDS menu, no kids drinks. i tried to order from the "specials menu" which also says "kids under 10 anytime" and No special prices on HOLIDAYS. Are you kidding me? 

$7.89 for dry greasy eggs that my daughter didnt finish because they were poor quality.

My family does not eat PORK. Upcharge for turkey sausage, no turkey bacon! We will not ever return to this place ever. Their prices are already high enough, in my opinion, to absorb the cost of a single tiny Jimmy Dean turkey sausage patty. $3.99 for a single patty of turkey sausage... WOW! definitely not customer friendly pricing strategy. 

The server was nice, and friendly, and understanding, but agreed that the place was not kid or customer friendly. Had we not already ordered and received drinks, we would have left without ordering.

They can try to gouge the seniors and folks without kids who may patronize this place, but I can definitely see them going out of business.
