Or maybe I wasn't trying the right thing.

Had their Caprese, when asked about maybe having a side of chicken with it... was denied. Turns out they grill their tomatoes and mozzarella. Fine, by me - but it really didn't do much. She offered prosciutto instead and that was a failed suggestion, because it added nothing.

My dinner partner had their pasta special. Penne pasta with chicken, vegetables, tossed in a red sauce. Nothing spectacular to note.

Service was slow.

The thing about service in a restaurant is timing. The server works itself in your time, and it's not the other way around. I could have been on a gondola and down the canal in between the time I waited for the dessert menu (which we decided to skip because it took too long) and asking for the check.

Thanks for trying, but I'll be somewhere else on the Strip...
