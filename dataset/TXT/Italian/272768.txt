Da Emma has now officially joined the ranks of "just any other Italian restaurant" in Montreal.

This used to be my favourite Italian restaurant in Montreal. I would make it a must stop for everything from birthdays to wedding anniversaries, to graduation fetes. I'm not quite sure what happened here. :(
Between getting cold (yes, COLD) pasta sides to getting a different side from the one that I had ordered, albeit without even having been told. All the way to not even getting acknowledged half the night by our server (I had to flag him down most of the time. Really?! When many main dishes are over $40, why am I running after servers?) To getting bottled water when it was never even requested. I had even asked to get another table in the restaurant (as it was pretty much half empty) and the table I asked for didn't even have a "reservation" sign on it. No big deal, right? Wrong. I was awkwardly told "Sorry, we save that other two-spot table in case we have to push two sets together for a party of four". Okay, that's fine.
Know what happened? 
They pushed the tables together alright - for another couple. They had their nice big spot and we stayed put. What happened to saving it for a party of four? Am I missing something here?... 
What a disappointment. Cold food is never okay. Off nights happen, but it won't change that I'm likely not going to go back. Having been to many top restaurants in New York City like Babbo, Del Posto and Scarpetta, I'd say Da Emma should re evaluate their service. Times are tough, people! If you want to keep charging your exorbitant prices you better make it worth the customers' time and money. What a shame.
