It was lovely.  At a recent dinner, my friend and I started with the cheese platter.  That was a nice compliment to the wine we selected.  The wine list is excellent.  Dinner - sea scallops prepared over risotto.  Nicely done.   Excellent spot for business dinners, large groups or small intimate dinners.  Just outstanding.
