They have approximately a million bottles of wine all over on display, it seems like more of a place for a higher end business meeting than a romantic setting. 

The food is a work of art, very talented chef, you notice it when the bill comes, it was over $100 for me and my wife to dine here for supper but I feel it was money well spent. I don't believe I could get this artistic culinary spectacle anywhere else.
