iLLzOJLU4tPAN9UUHlyZiQ YUM.....    First time here just had some wine and appetizers and they were delish. (Recommend the polenta dish!)  Last night a few friends split some entrees.  Wow... so well prepared and tasty.  The flank steak was everything I thought it would be and the chicken ? cacciatore was perfection!   The spinach is garlicy lovefest!      Red Sangrias rounded out the meal perfectly.  Highly recommend!
