YDJGN_WXkXBAp2LTXvjyaA Do not go!! The food is average with small portions and very overpriced.  But the service is really what was awful! It was packed so obviously some folks like it but our experience was a HUGE disappointment.  Until management realizes they have to train their staff if they plan to charge those prices and provide a casually elegant experience I doubt it will change.
