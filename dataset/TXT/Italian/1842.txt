-j0CbYvlwuJ3Tfx__X38gA My husband and I visited this restaurant last night for our 1st wedding anniversary (pretty special event). The food was definitely a 5 star review- the portions were generous, they give you a house salad, bread, and a side of pasta before you even get your huge entree. My husband had the veal chop (so great and huge), and I had the special of New York Strip (also delicious and HUGE). We ended our night with the lava cake which was to die for- highly recommend! You can't leave without getting their desert!! 

But why give the restaurant a 4 star review? The only reason we are rating this experience as a 4 and not a 5 star review is due to the service. When attending a restaurant with such good reviews, and paying a pretty penny for the food, you expect top of the line service. I would like to note that our waitress could have been new, but if that was the case someone should have been assisting her. The hostess recognized our 1st wedding anniversary, but the server did not mention anything at all. She was very concerned with a table of 6 behind us- it took at least 10 minutes to get water and another 5 after that to get our wine. We had to ask about the specials not on the menu, and she spilled Parmesan cheese all over my dress when putting it on my salad (I didn't care just wanted a small apology). It would have been nice (since we reserved the table through open table and noted our anniversary), if the waitress could have acknowledged or even asked if we were celebrating since this was our first time at the restaurant and the hostess acknowledged it before we said anything. I have been to many nice places, so this is why I feel that I can be critical of the service. My husband and I would try this experience again though, and hope for better service or that our waitress has gotten more experience there!
