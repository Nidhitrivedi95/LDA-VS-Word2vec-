5p60nXyjQruKvEZix6ahVQ We were here for the first time celebrating our anniversary.   Stopped in the bar area first for a drink and found the atmosphere very nice, but oddly on a Saturday night, only 2 other people.  

We were then seated in a large beautiful dining room, but nothing intimate about it.   Our romantic dinner was not to be had here.   Acoustics are horrible due to all the beautiful stone around.   The tables are very close and. Or what we had hoped at all.

I had the Caesar salad and my husband had the caprese.   I hate to say it, but it was the worst Caesar salad I have ever had.   It was served in a bowl, didn't seem like romaine lettuce, had 4 croutons, no cheese and barely any dressing.   My husband loved his caprese as it was full of flavor and the buffalo mozzarella was excellent.  I ordered the veal Parmesan and my husband had the raviolio (not sure of spelling).   The veal was very thick, which was odd, and served with a small portion of spaghetti on top.  Just ok, not great.   My husbands meal had many different flavors.   There was braised beef, egg, and other things which he said made every bite taste different.  He liked it, didn't love it.   Not sure why they asked if we were celebrating anything special when we made the reservation as nobody ever mentioned our anniversary.

As we were finishing, the people next to us were brought Caesar salads that looked very traditional.   They were served on plates, romaine lettuce, cheese and more croutons.   I hadn't planned on saying anything to the server, but once I saw the other ones I had to.   She kindly removed the charge from our bill.

Service wasn't great, and as I mentioned, the acoustics are bad so hard to have conversation.   Wanted to like this place more as its so pretty, but likely not to return.
