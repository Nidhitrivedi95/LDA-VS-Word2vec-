w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q Dinner was poor. Not the very high quality I have  had in other locations. Crab cakes were great, also the onion straws. Then dinner got poor. For a class operation that takes pride in their steaks what was served bordered on one star.  
My son  had a Delmonico and I had the Strip.  Both came out properly cooked. Problem was is that their was no taste. Massive doses of salt did not help. And we don't normally use salt.
Service was good but no concession even though we advised her before they were half eaten.
Poor quality has no place in this operation.
