Lu5hB_5YtX5Re2067Zf3cg We had dinner here on a Sat. Night. I got the seafood pasta. It was really good and liked the flavor and spice of the red sauce.  Typically, I like a thicker sauce though... It was a thin sauce.  My date got the veal. He really liked it. We had a nice glass of wine.  Overall, a very pleasant meal, good service, and a nice atmosphere.
