LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA I've been to Maggiano's several times in CA, but this was my first time in LV.

The food was good as always. The fettucini alfredo was the best I've ever had. My sister's chicken parmigiana was pretty tasty too. Again, definitely should share your plates!

What I loved most about this location was that it's right on the strip, and if you get a table by the window, you get a spectacular view of the Wynn across the street and all the bright lights of the strip. Perfect location for a romantic dinner.
