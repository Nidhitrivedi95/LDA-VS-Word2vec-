mJYzopHZZEXVJJrsue34aQ I really wanted to like Tommy V's -- unfortunately this review will be less than flattering.  I'll begin with what I did like:

The happy hour drink specials: $5 glasses of wine, $3 beers, and $5 house cocktails from 5-7.  Not bad.

What I didn't like:

The pizza: The pizza tasted OK, but averaging around $15 per pie - which one hungry adult could easily finish -  was a bit outlandish. The quality was nowhere near that of The Parlor, LGO, or Grimaldi's. At those prices for "personal" pizzas, I'd expect to be wow'd.

The service: We were surprised to see only one vegetarian pizza on the menu (not including the standard cheese pizza).  When we asked the server if we could substitute veggies for meat on any of the pizzas, he acted like he's never heard this request before -- and he had to ask the chef.  His sanctimonious attitude about substituting artichoke for prosciutto was just odd. And when he finally allowed us to make the substitution, the pizza came out wrong.

We gave it a shot, but most likely won't be going back.
