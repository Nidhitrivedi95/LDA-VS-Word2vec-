WyKJkdw7PEZD1I0qtPN17w Wow disappointing! So much potential...just falls short. 2 adults and a child $117
Went for dinner. Tons of service people buzzing around. Older crowd. Nice decor. Very loud. Nice looking full bar and well set tables.
That is the end of the good. Ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer, veal Marsala, shrimp and lobster penne, and kids Alfredo rigatoni.
Goat cheese app: extremely bland and boring
Veal Marsala: Gross and side pasta grease is still coating my mouth 2 hours later
Shrimp and Lobster pasta: slimy and fishy
Kids Rigatoni: overcooked pasta slopping around in half and half.
Ordered a Vodka martini that was great and an Old fashioned which was horrendous (same bartender).
Despite all the service people (and there were a ton) the service was really lax and unattentive. The customers were kind of lost in the busy work of the staff.
This was our first and last visit here. The above meal cost us $117. For a few dollars more we could eat at a prime steak house. Huge local disappointment. Bottom line...sub par Macaroni Grill with a giant bill at the end.
