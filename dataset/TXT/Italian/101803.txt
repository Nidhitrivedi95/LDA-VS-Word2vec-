fdX_eu-dCaKsDaK_itNIzQ Pros - Food was made very very fast, we ordered and started eating in no more than 5-8 minutes. Very decent portion, I had to box 40% of it home 

Cons - I've had better pasta. On menu everything looks great but the food came on a common looking oval dinner plate, which made the food looked even more bland than it already was, like *almost* something that came out of a can, same can be said for the taste

Overall - 

Food - Nothing great. I ordered the Tutto Pasta, bowtie in red pasta sauce with a bit of chicken, a bit of mushroom and not a lot of anything else, the sauce was more orange than red, nothing stood out from the dish

Price - For the price you pay ($15 tips included for 1 dish of pasta and water), you can definitely find something else better on State St.

Service - Average
