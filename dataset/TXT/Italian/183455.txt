oejQ4bWsJaKszf98xjNrrg The Abruzzo Salad will forever be one of my favourite salads, that I will continue telling everyone about. 
I LOVE my food, and I like my food to not be simple & bland.. Ive always wished some place would have a salad on the menu that I would actually genuinely enjoy, & then I was introduced to an Abruzzo Salad by one of my co workers. 
Its filled with EVERYTHING. From Cold Cuts , to MUSHROOMS (my favourite) , olives, tomato, onions, carrot, green pepper, and Mozzarella !! With simply delicious olive oil dressing to perfect everything, It is very oily, but I love it like that.  I Add chicken to it, and is perfect. 

Portioning is amazing. The Small salad is too much for me, so nevermind the large salad. Very Filling. 

They are very accommodating, on multiple occasions when I was starving they delivered to my work for just one sa

Ive also tried the Gnocchi here, with Rose Sauce, Also fantastic. 
love this place,
