fUhgw2iXXS3TETqU4eZU6Q Almost 40 years I've been on the westcoast SoCal and Nevada.  I couldn't find a decent pizza until this place. Kind of remind me of the original Kracker's pizza in Massillon Ohio. 
Anyway the place is just right not too big or, too small very clean and cozy with the aroma of a bakery. The thin pizza crust is almost pastry like you could eat it plain but, on my last visit I chose to top it with Meatballs, Sausage and, cheese....AMAZING!!!
Definitely the best west coast pizza by far.
