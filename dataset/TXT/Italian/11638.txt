0s1DqJlSSgR1Ftg9Q_HEOg Went here twice over a 6 month time frame. Each time I ordered the lunch special slice of pie, salad and a drink for $7.95  and I was sorely disappointed. The slice of pizza was days old, without any flavor, lacking any ply-ability and truly tasted like a reheated piece of wood. No - wood may have had a better taste!
