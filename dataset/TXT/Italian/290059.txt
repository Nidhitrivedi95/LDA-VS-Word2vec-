zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA We went here for my bookclub.  The waiter was fabulous, despite being slammed with a few other large tables.  He took the time to understand my wine preference and made a great recommendation (which I unfortunately can't remember).  I had the cream of mushroom soup which was wickedly rich and creamy and the house salad which was nice.  It would have been the perfect light dinner had the bread not been so delicious that I also enjoyed too much of that - my bad.  Will definitely be back to experience some of their other dishes.
