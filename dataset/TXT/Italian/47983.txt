91diBNaSiwHr6tUXXJee-Q We went to Anthonys last night for dinner. We had a great seat outside. I was looking forward to the Lobster ravioli but it was not on the menu.  We ordered wine and calamari.  The calamari was a little undercooked, I ate what wasn't ,it was great. I mentioned it to our great waitress, she comes back and she felt horrible, She said the owner would take it off of our bill and would like to buy us another glass of wine, we're like wow thanks.  I had ordered the Portabella mushroom  ravioli with shrimp, excellent and hot down to the last bite, well it was so much I could not finish. Not having hot food is my pet peeve .. The owner comes out again and felt very bad about the calamari and he offers us homemade gelleto also. How wonderful the gelleto was. We were treated like family and way more. We will be back. Thanks for the great dinner and service.   Bobbie
