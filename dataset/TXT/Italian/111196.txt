There are a variety of salads which come in two different sizes. I call them "huge" and "really huge." I always get the Greek Empire salad. The dressing is amazing, and they pack it full of olives, which makes it even more incredible. 
The garlic knots are doughy and seasoned. I love the sauce that you dip them in as well. Grade A on everything.
My husband loves the Meatball Sandwich and the Pizza of course.
Cute atmosphere, very small.  Old school. Lots of Rat Pack on the stereo.
