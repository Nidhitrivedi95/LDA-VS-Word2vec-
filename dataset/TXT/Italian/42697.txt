7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg I had been trying to make it to this establishment for quite some time now, and finally got to experience Bruno's last Thursday.  We were seated right away, drink order, appetizer, main entrees ordered in the first 10 minutes.  Noticed instead of normal Frank Sinatra/Dean Martin type Italian classics, we were listening to what seemed to be light dubstep.  Our first hint at our food was 40 minutes later when the waitress said our appetizers were 'almost ready'.  Calamari was standard, maybe above average, bruschetta was 'meh'.  fast forward another half hour before we were told our entrees were almost ready. She got the ravioli.  Again, very standard if not slightly above average.  I got the potato encrusted pan seared walleye.  It was pretty terrible.  Potatoes were grey and soggy instead of golden brown and crispy.  Fish was overcooked, terribly bony, and tasted slightly spoiled.  I decided this all within the first two bites (I took a second bite even though I spit out the first one).  First time I have ever sent an entrée back.  Service was lacking.  I think the attentiveness had been reserved for the 6 top next to us.
