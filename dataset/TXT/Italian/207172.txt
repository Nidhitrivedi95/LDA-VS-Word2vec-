QGUeajuwtOSegh7JbrbuXA Came here with a large party one night. A few of us arrived a little early so our table wasn't ready yet. It wasn't a long wait but we still decided to get a drink at the bar. Bartender was lovely and made cocktails that were both strong and delicious. 

The space was quite nice, clean lines with simple, modern decor. Once the rest of the party arrived we were seated and had nice attentive service throughout the night. 

The crostini platter was good, there was a decent selection and everything was fresh. The rice balls were weird in my opinion. A few people in our party liked them but I thought it was too rich and the texture was just too odd for me to enjoy. The meatballs were really good - I think that was the only thing everyone agreed was fantastic. We had a few other things that were only okay. 

Overall I enjoyed my time at the bar more than I enjoyed the food. I would swing by for a drink again though if I was in the area.
