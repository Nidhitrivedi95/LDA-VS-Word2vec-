UHPjDgiEHnTe7-MP-b2kyQ After receiving -2- poorly cooked Veal T-Bones, The first I asked for Med-R and it came overcooked and dry nearly burnt, the 2nd attempt was seared Rare as Veal Sashimi... The owner came to my table and began to lecture me on how Veal can't be cooked between the 2 versions that I had been given! In fact the owner was rude, disrespectful, and angry.  He told me that I had no right to send back 2 steaks and that I should leave!  

My friend and I completely shocked and speechless stood up and walked out.

I have been to this place a handful of times in the past and always had adequate experiences, but to be treated this way as a customer is disgusting and there is no excuse for this poor behavior.

What I will share with you is this restaurant caters to an older demographic of guests.  There are many regulars who visit this establishment, who are used to average food, below par service, and most likely don't know any better to distinguish from very average to a truly worthwhile dining experience.

The owner waltzes around bragging and telling stories of his past and of Italy... Some people may want to be in this kind of environment, however do not plan on going here if you want privacy as this place is very small and lacks the kind of romantic italian ambiance that one who hope for.  

If you are looking for really good food save your time and money.  The food is average at best!  The prices are not some great value either.  The average entree price is just about $18, and apps/salads are each about $9 on avg.

Truthfully there are better places to eat in the valley and there should never an instance where a customer is treated so poorly by an owner.  

Close your eyes and imagine seared rear meat-- I have had seared tuna sashimi that was more cooked than the steak that was brought to me.  This is inexcusable and poor execution.  Makes me wonder who they have working in their kitchen.

Pretty disappointing. Epic Fail!
