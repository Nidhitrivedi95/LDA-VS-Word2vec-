NlBifQZCNUAnbuo_wKIVpg I recently just moved to this side of the mighty Grand River and was looking for a decent place for pizza. The first time i ordered i picked up my order. Staff is super friendly and nice. The first order i picked up was a specialty pizza the Piazza deluxe and garden salad with cheese....very good, light on the sauce and reheats extremely well (it's hard to find a piece of pie that taste good reheated but this one does). The salads are really good...fresh dark greens, taste like a salad should!
The 2nd time i ordered, i ordered delivery, i ordered the Meat Monster....it was good...again light on the sauce....actually the sauce is almost nonexistent and the delivery driver was about 20 min late (on top of a 50 minute wait for the delivery). Still pretty good pizza but i'm concerned about this sauce thing!
Last night ordered delivery..meatball sandwich and more salad.......i don't understand the meatball subs....to the human eye you're blown away because they're so big....oh, i should mention, delivery was on time and driver very friendly. Back to the sandwich...the 2nd half of the sandwich went into the garbage this morning...ehhhh, just not my thing...there's like 40 lil meatballs on this thing....and again...i can't find sauce!!! These nice people have an aversion to sauce and i don't know why?!?! When i walk in, instead of saying Bada Bing for $1 off..i wish we could say it to add sauce to the order! I also got 8 Spicy BBQ wings and those actually were pretty good.....mostly because THEY WERE LATHERED IN SAUCE!!
So, overall you could do much worse and i think i still have some investigating to do and may see if i can just order sauce on the side to add to my food....you could definitly do much worse in picking a place...you can tell these people take pride in what they do and it shows so i'm not going to bash them, i may return...it just won't be every weekend.
