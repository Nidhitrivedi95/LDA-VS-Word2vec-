tYbK94fl50os3h_RjpY4gw Two slices of cheese pizzas and a drink for $4.99+tax. It a great deal because the cheese pizza is awesome. Especially when they re- heat the pizza the crust magically gets tastier and crispier. Perfect cheese to sauce ratio. This is the only thing I have ever ordered from this place. If you find something good why not stick with it right?
