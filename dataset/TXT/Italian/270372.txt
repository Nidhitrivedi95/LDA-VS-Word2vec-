xmWs-su5eB5_57CIw4sqfw Very nice comfy place on the inside. About 10-15 tables nice decor. Service is OK sometimes it takes a while to even get a glass of water. Food is delicious and prices are fair for the portion and quality they serve. I wish they would make the outside more appealing something about it I dunno....if it wasn't for my friend pushing me to go here I would have never stepped foot inside the place. From the outside it looks crappy and run down, but it's complete opposite on the inside. Try it if you've never been!
