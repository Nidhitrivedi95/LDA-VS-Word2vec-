CrIWqmuO2uQWwl3z11K_BA We came here for a friend's birthday dinner on a Wednesday night. The decor was pretty minimalist, and the highlight of the space was the pizza oven. Personally, I did not appreciate the visible storage shelves showcasing supplies, but I could see they were going for a hipster-ish vibe. 

There wasn't a ton of people there, but it was more than the single server working could handle. The server was not over enthusiastic about her job and it showed. She would disappear for long stretches of time and she didn't seem to know the wine menu whatsoever. Additionally, she did not tell us that we had to pay up front, so we were sitting there for 20 minutes waiting for our checks and boxes for leftovers before we all decided to snag boxes from the shelf near us and go search for our server. 

As for the food, it was fine. The only interesting thing about the pizza was the oven it came out of. It looked like they tried to make the presentation nice, but there were things like plastic cups for sauces on our appetizer that made it look cheap. 

I probably wouldn't go back here because of the service and the fact the food was disappointing for its prices.
