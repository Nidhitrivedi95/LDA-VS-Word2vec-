SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Bad service always puts a taste in my mouth that can ruin even the BEST food. 

To start. The Hosts at the front are rude bitter broke 12 year old girls that can't even afford to dine here so they work here 

We arrived on Tuesday at 5:00 pm for dinner 

The girl ( I guess her names ELLIE ) seats us I ask for one more chair for my purse ( which shouldn't have been a problem since the restaurant was dead anyways ) she looks at me and tells me no. 

I grab a chair from an empty table because it was an empty restaurant and it shouldn't matter. 

This bitter bit** comes over rips the chair from my purse and laughs and says "oops sorry guess we need the chair " in the MOST condescending tone ever with the stupidest fakest giggle ever. 


She's lucky I didn't call the manager over to embarrass her. She's a rude condescending little twat I've ever experienced in my life I hope she's fired.
