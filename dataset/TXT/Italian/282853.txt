Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ This place used to be amazing.  5-star amazing.  Used to be.  Prior to August 1st, this restaurant was owned by the same people who own Pizza Rock - and had the same homemade pasta and delicious pizza at a much cheaper cost.  It was our hidden gem off the Strip.

As of August 1, 2016, Stations Casinos bought the restaurant.  The menu has changed, the pasta is no longer homemade, the meatballs are not nearly as good as they used to be, and prices have increased.

The service is good, of course, and the people are friendly.  But I'm giving Little Tony's 2 stars because they used to be one of my favorites and now my disappointment is crushing.  

So to everyone who's been here before -- it's not the same.  It's not even close to being the same.
