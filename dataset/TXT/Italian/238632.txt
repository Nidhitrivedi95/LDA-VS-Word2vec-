  Came in and was greeted by hostess immediately, bar / restaurant had some old Blk/Wht movies playing.  My guest was super impressed with the light board menus. Manager came by the table during my meal to thank me for business.  Great vibes just like the spot in Frt. Lauderdale.  Your going to want to grab an order of Rice Balls, Truffle Fries, Clams Casino, Tagliatelli and a Veal Parmigiana and a glass of Barolo.  Thank me later.
