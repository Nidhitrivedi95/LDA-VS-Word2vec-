7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ My friends and I came here for my bachelor party dinner. This was my second time to Carnevino.

Here are my thoughts: 

Venue - Very nice and designed well. The high ceilings made this place standout in addition to the layout of the restaurant. Great for group and a date type of setting. 

Beverages - Generous pours is all I say. The wine menu selection was great.  

Appetizer - We skipped out on this and focused on the side dishes. However I've had the jalapeno crab black ink pasta and it was great. 

Main Entree -   The dry aged rib-eye was fantastic. It's amazing how aging the steak makes a big difference in the taste quality. They leave the bone-in as it helps with the flavor of the steak. Best steak I've ever had.

Service - They definitely do not let the ball drop. From checking in, being seated, ordering and continuous service through out the night was outstanding. I never had an empty glass of water. 

Nice benefits - Table side carving of the rib-eye added a nice touch and they cook the steak perfectly. 

Other notes - Take a picture with the bull! Try the mash potatoes with the poached egg.
