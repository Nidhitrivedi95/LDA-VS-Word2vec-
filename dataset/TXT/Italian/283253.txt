Small strip mall pizza joint that bills itself as New York pizza and has won the Best of Las Vegas 2013, 2014, and 2015 in the category of "Best Traditional & Non Traditional Pizza." But don't be fooled by the awards... 

I'm giving it 3 stars vs 5 stars because it's not horrible and most people would like it. Although, I debated giving it 2 stars....

This pizza wasn't to my taste. I prefer a spicier sauce vs a sweet sauce and a crispy crust or at least one that's cooked... 

I love New York pizza. Give me a good hard crust, the harder the better and I'm a happy woman. 

But Joe's couldn't deliver. Instead I got a crust that was limp and flaccid. 

Apparently you have to ask for well done or your pizza is barely cooked. Have eaten lots of New York pizza but not once have I had to ask them to cook it.

Ordering is assembly style where one person takes the order and another rings it up. 

The menu is extensive but there are no prices for slices. And that's where you get burned when you order 2 or more slices. 

A slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni cost $8.70 with tax. No drink, just 2 slices of pie. Say what?  For a few bucks more you can buy a 12" cheese pizza.

There's a self serve all-you-can-drink fancy soda machine.

Communal seating with a single table for two by the door, table for four, two bar height tables for six and a long wraparound booth with three tables.

Would I go back? No. It wasn't the worst pizza, but I like a sauce with bite and crisp crust. I'd rather eat something I enjoy than eating just to eat. If I wanted to do that, I'd buy a sandwich from CVS.
