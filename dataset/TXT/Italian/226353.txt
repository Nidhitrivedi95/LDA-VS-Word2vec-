srcfY2_U5_0k7dzZQX6sAg Beautiful restaurant in the old port of Montreal. A group of us had supper there on a weekend and it wasn't packed at all. The salad bar is a plus but isn't really something special. The garlic butter that came with the bread, though, was excellent. There is a lot of choice on the menu for people with different tastes. Different meat options, vegetarian options, different pastas... something for everyone! All of us enjoyed our meal and the bonus was that the prices were extremely reasonable compared to other restaurants in the area. Not the best pasta plate I've ever had but it was still very satisfying as I finished the whole thing (i had the linguini with prosciutto and blue cheese).
