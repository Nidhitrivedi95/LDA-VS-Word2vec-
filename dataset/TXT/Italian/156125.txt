l4x5FFzfiCFrGN0S-uZbBQ this place has a lively vibe because the tables are set close together. it makes you feel like you're in a busy big city. we really enjoyed the food - right from the appetiser (mushroom polenta, I think?), the pastas (one with the eggplant, all I remember was that the other was a gnochhi pasta) and the dessert (ricotta torta and the other was something chocolatey).

would definitely visit again!
