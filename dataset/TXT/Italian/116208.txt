GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA Expectations were high.  The service was excellent. The food not so much so.  Calamari was fried to point of being hard vs crispy. Octopus was so tenderize as to be mushy.  Neither had flavors that jumped out in mouth.  The main courses were equally uninspiring in terms of flavor. Perhaps great recipes...But this food was poorly executed in the kitchen. Really disappointed given the B&B price points!  Off today to one of the sister properties.
