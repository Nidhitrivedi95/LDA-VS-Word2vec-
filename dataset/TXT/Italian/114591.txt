gMONN1bKUHlNKPrYGSADLQ I wouldn't recommend going here.  Ordered the pizza and it was pretty bad. The crust taste really burnt (although visually it didn't appear burnt, which was odd). 

The toppings were okay. I think they could have been a little more generous though, given the price. 

Pizzas are around $16-18. The only good thing about this place is the location imo.
