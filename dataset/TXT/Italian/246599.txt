V1JEkeAem05hps5ZCmMIgw I had a wonderful experience at The Rigby. I had the sliders, and they are AMAZING! I hate coleslaw. The pork sliders came with slaw on them and they were incredible. My server was incredibly polite and attentive. I loved the food, had fantastic service, and the drink specials were awesome. I had a great time, and it was amazing. I will definitely be back. Also, the cheese curds? Best in Madison. Absolutely incredible!
