roz-ed8kvBF6fwKBPeJ49Q My friends recommended  the restaurant.  It was not busy at 6.30. The place was empty by 7.00. The waiter seemed annoyed  that we did not order any drinks . The bread we got was toasted and had a little  garlic. Wished there was a little  butter. Soup or salad came with the meal the salad was drenched  with dressing . The potato  leak soup was very good . Portions  could have been larger . We had the gnocchi.  Which was very good,  a little  soft .  I ordered  a spicy shrimp  with angel hair pasta. It was  decent . Prices  averaged 15 to 24 per dish . We did like the tirimisu  which was very good .
