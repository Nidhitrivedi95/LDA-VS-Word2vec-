iNhP0ejUf2jVzaR5YCOoEQ We had been here a while back and decided to come again. It is a very nice restaurant with a cosy atmosphere (not too bright and not too dark). I ordered the angel hair surf and turf and my wife had the salmon.  The food came quickly and it was delicious.  We also decided to have tiramisu for desert and I was surprised by the size of it (bigger than I expected). It was creamy and delicious. The server was friendly and helpful throughout the whole meal. Will certainly return.
