Z1uxCfpF_pqpohvwb_1O8Q Always awesome. Drew and his staff really know how to make you feel welcome. Must try the Manhattan clam chowder. IT is amazing (where else can you get a good Manhattan style clam chowder in Nevada?) the shrimp with mushrooms and cream sauce is excellent.! Prices reasonable too!
