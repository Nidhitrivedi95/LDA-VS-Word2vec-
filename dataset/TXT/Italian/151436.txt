kp-FRmyPxjsAoEK1-21rSQ So this little place...

A friend and I had dinner here on 2/2/14. He had been before, I had not. Apparently they expanded the restaurant which I think was a smart move. I noticed they had a small bar as well...not sure if this was because they now had the space but good for them! As soon as we walked in we were acknowledged, greeted and seated quickly. Immediately thereafter our drink order was taken and things only got better! 

The friendly server, Gabriella was pleasantly eager to take our order. We ordered salads, lasagna and garlic rolls. I ordered veggie lasagna. The salads were delicious. Just the right size. The lasagna was also very good. I'd never tried vegetable lasagna so I can't really compare, but the noodles were right, the sauce was right and yummy yum. Again, a great portion for the price. The atmosphere was very family oriented and everyone seemed very pleased.

Orders were flying out of the kitchen, the staff were managing it very well and seemed to work well together. The owner, Mr. Riccio working right along with everyone, came across like a nice guy and someone who valued every customer that graced his entrance. A great place for a cozy Italian dinner. Great job Mr. Riccio, I'll be back!
