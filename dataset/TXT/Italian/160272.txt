LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw Oregano's is seriously one of the best places to eat. I love their southwestern influence on Italian food. The Pablo Picasso salad is by far the best salad I've ever had. It's warm and hearty and full of flavor. Their calamari is really good as well. I've never had their thick crust pizza, however the thin crust is super yummy! Also, Alfredo of the dark with chicken is a spicy version of the dish that comes with a poblano pepper. So delish! Also, you must save room (if you can) for a pizza cookie...a-may-zing!!!
