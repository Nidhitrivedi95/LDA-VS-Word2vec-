fYqr99HXATERIGXQmjSgmw I wanted to like Bella Frutetto, I really did. I guess from the raves I've seen on Yelp, I expected a lot more. Not so much. From the inattentive, nonchalant hostess who was too distracted to greet us - let alone seat us to the tired decor, we certainly expected more.

The bright spot of lunch was Patty, our server. Loved her little bit of sass, little bit off snark. She made us  smile when after waiting quite a long time for the hostess to return with a gluten-free menu, she strode off to track one down saying, "What's she doing, printing one?" 

The food. I had a simple penne with tomato basil cream sauce and sausage. The pasta was waaaay over-sauced...more like soup than pasta. Still, it was tasty. Adequate. My daughter had a trail mix salad. She enjoyed it, but it wasn't anything you couldn't get anywhere. Adequate.

The cost of lunch for a bowl of pasta, a salad and one iced tea? At lunch, not dinner? $30. Eat n Park at the end of the strip mall would have been better and half the price.

One more thing. Rarely do I talk about plating, but the presentation of the orange-ish pasta in an orange-ish dish was not thought out well. For the money, more thought should be put into every aspect...from the substandard hostess, to the surroundings, to the attention to detail in the preparation of the food, to the plating. It could have, it SHOULD have, been so much better. Adequate.
