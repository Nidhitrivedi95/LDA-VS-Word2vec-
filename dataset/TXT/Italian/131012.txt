ifEHr-ZnGFSKgJVsywiAFg I really wanted this place to be great, but it wasn't.. 
To start with it took a while to be seated and there were only two other couples there...it was a very calm Sunday evening and at least two waiters looked over at us standing there at the door. Next, after drinking about a third of my sangria I noticed there was a bug in my drink! The waiter got a new glass, but didn't bother to apologize...I realize it could have been someone else who prepared the drink, so I didn't let it ruin our dinner. 

The rest of the dinner was okay...our waiter had a horrible attitude and it took a while to get refills on water and drinks.  I won't be back here any time soon! The lamb chops were undercooked, but the tortellini was delicious as was the bruschetta.
