FyKefsWq62xeXpje0Flcig Exceptional! We stopped here for lunch after reading some reviews and we were not disappointed. This place is off the beaten path, but worth the trip. Being from NY, finding good Italian food is not easy, but this place rises to the task. It makes sense since the owners are actual Italians from New York. We had the eggplant parmigiana sub which was superb. We also shared the chicken focaccia sandwich which was outstanding. We plan on trying the pizza next time which we were assured was legit. You must try this place if you are looking for good Italian food.
