We had the stuffed banana peppers as an appetizer.  They were stuffed with hot sausage.  Very good.

The house salads were spring greens with olives, cherry tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers.  Very good.

The bread was at least a day old ... yuck

The spaghetti with hot sausage was enough for 2 meals.  The restaurant was willing to replace the cream sauce for a marinara for the shrimp ravioli with lump crab meat.  It was a great choice.

For dessert, we split a slice of almond torte. It was wonderfully moist cake and the icing wasn't too sweet.

Would definitely go back to try other menu options.
