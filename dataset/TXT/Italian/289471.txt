ZtJ6sTq7-5rL9ORUtQJHAQ I don't venture down to Henderson much...by choice...but I am glad I met this girl in a coffee shop.  If I hadn't I would have missed a great Italian Restaurant.

The atmosphere is top notch.  Every place setting was perfectly laid out, and the tables were close enough to be intimate but not so close that you were rubbing elbows with strangers.

The calamari was tender and breaded to perfection.  The 75 dollar tasting menu with matching wines is exactly what all tasting menus should be.  Lots of food, thoughtfully prepared with exceptional ingredients.  The wines were exceptional and complimented the food to a tee.

Great for dates, romantic without being TOO romantic.  I say this is an excellent place for a group of adults, a first date or a married couple out for a nice meal but don't want to spend 150 a person.

The wait staff was attentive without being overbearing and they answered every question my date had.

Highly recommended.
