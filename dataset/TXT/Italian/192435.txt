pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Pros: Food tasted good, service was prompt (probably need reservations on a weekend), dinner comes with bread sticks (dipped in olive oil?), staff was friendly, abundant portions (lots of doggie bags). Had Caesar salad (meh), Crazy Alfredo (tasty but oily),  glass of wine, and a cannoli (very good).  With tip: $52!!! (One person).

Cons: Place is really noisy. No real parmesan cheese, but rather the cheap stuff you get at Pizza Hut. Waiter will suggest a salad, but does not tell you it is extra. 

For $52 I expect a better dining experience.
