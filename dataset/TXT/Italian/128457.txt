HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA Let me start by saying I LOVE Naked City Pizza. That being said, I don't think I can come back to this location. I walk in and a short girl with long black hair takes my to go order. Customers come and go, 20 minutes later I'm still standing there. I keep looking over and making eye contact with the girl at the desk who took my order to make sure it wasn't ready. She's there having a long personal conversation with some guy. Finally about 5 minutes later (25 minutes or so later) she walks over to me and says "excuse me sir but are you waiting for something?". Are you serious? You're the one who took my order! So I tell her what I ordered (which was just a simple order of suicide fries) and she's goes and picks up the box that I saw the cook sit down 15 minutes prior and hands it to me. No apologies or anything. Her reply was "well we had a lot of orders I can't remember everyone's face". I'M THE ONLY PERSON STANDING IN THE RESTAURANT BESIDES THE GUY WHOS TAKING THE ATTENTION. AWAY FROM YOU DOING YOUR JOB! If my time isn't valuable to you then I won't bother. Everyone else at Naked City is awesome but it's a shame how one person can make you never want to return to a business again. Well I guess I can still go to the location inside Moon Doggies.
