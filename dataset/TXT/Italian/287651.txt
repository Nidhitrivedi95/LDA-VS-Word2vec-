zmfa8RNxqSuOJ9Nx-CMs_Q Wow, this place is good.  I had the insalata tricolore (everything's lower case here), which was actually mediocre, but my pasta dish made up for it.  

Of the 10 pasta dishes, 6 are fully vegetarian, and the rest can be made so.  (Don't panic, they had lots of meaty specials too.)  

I've had a lot of so-so pasta over the years, but my linguine syrenuse (rapini, black olives, mushrooms, roasted peppers, garlic and olive oil sauce at $13) was delicious.  Best pasta dish I've had in as long as I can remember.  My cousin chose the salmon special and said it was excellent.

All the dishes I witnessed here looked and smelled great.  Next time, I may try another pasta, AND order a pizza "for the table".

We didn't have dessert, as we opted to go to Il Gelatiere, a few steps north on Mt. Pleasant.  Check it out...http://www.yelp.ca/biz/il-gelatiere-toronto
