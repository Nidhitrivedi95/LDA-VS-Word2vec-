_MHUEErH3KW_KvVSOjyYhg Pat's has great NY style pizza, fresh ingredients and will make it to your liking. They put the basil on after cooking the pizza without giving me a funny look. Try the meatballs! They are scrumptious!

Their wings are not so hot, they tend to be on the soggy side. Their salads are huge and delicious and there is something magical in the ranch they use.. I get take out here at least twice a month and they have never done me wrong. They have great lunch specials too.
