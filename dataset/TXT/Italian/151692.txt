KPKQLzVKqLgEPKOWrSCRtg I was very curious to check out a Monroeville standby, but I was not at all impressed by my meal.  The wedding soup, for example was not even average.  Oddly enough, the Crème Brûlée was pretty good.  The food is very much Italian American, not the exquisite Italian cuisine that I love.  The prices are fairly high for what you are getting, quality wise, however the portions are good.  This place is just not my first choice.
