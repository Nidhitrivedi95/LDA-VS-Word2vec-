MLQeuiL9rqOq_rDKGEcU0A Couldn't have been happier with my experience at dinner last night.  The food was excellent!  I went with a group of 5 people and was able to try a ton of different menu items and they were all fantastic.  Try the pizza!  This is a great spot for a small group dinner party or for date night.  The lemon tart was an amazing way to finish the meal.  Plus they have Bastianach wine!  You sure can't find that at the LCBO... Can't wait for my next visit.
