1bYtt80iwckHNPJyIl4qQg We ate there for the first time last weekend, the hubs ordered the lasagna and I had the stuffed eggplant.  We also shared an appetizer sampler- the oliva tapenade was wonderful, the Turkish bread is delish- warm and fresh. The stuffed eggplant was good, as was the lasagna; however, the lasagna was steaming, so it may have been microwaved.  Not that it's a felony to do so, but it was not expected. We shared baklava for dessert- unlike a previous reviewer's experience, ours was flaky and yummy. 

Beer and wine only, so know before you go.
