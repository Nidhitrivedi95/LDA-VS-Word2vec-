Lu5hB_5YtX5Re2067Zf3cg I have driven past this place so many times that i finally decided to try it with my sister. We waited by the front door to be seated for a while that we thought maybe there is another entrance...nope just was setting the pace for the evening.

We were sat finally, and I like the menu because it has some of my old Favorites from Il Posto when they were opened. We started with the Caprese and it was delicious the Mozzarella was great! Now we finished with that and our server would just keep walking by and basically refused to take our dirty plates because he had better things to do like speak in Italian with the Manager which by watching them seemed as if they were fighting-VERY professional.....

For our Entrees we each had pasta dishes that were from Il Posto. My sister had the Rigatoni withe Peas in a Creamy Tomato Sauce with Sausage-She enjoyed it. I had the Pecorino E Gamberi-Penne with Shrimp and Zucchini in a white wine sauce Delicious and light!  

Ok so now we have finished our Entree's and our server is once again going back and forth with the manager but this time the manager is now enjoying himself some  dinner and a beer at the bar-must be nice! Finally he comes over and asks us if we would like desert we got the Tres Leches-Not good very dry. 

And Finally we are just sitting there waiting for our check to come and our server is too busy doing his sidework!!! So i finally asked the busgirl if she could grab it for us-this whole evening consisted of horrible service with the fact that he could care less about his job he obviously just goes to work to hang out and BS!! I will finish with that the food was great and I just hope that the next time if I decide to go back that he is not our server!!
