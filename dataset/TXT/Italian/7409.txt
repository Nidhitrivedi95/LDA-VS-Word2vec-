0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw Joe's is simply, amazing. The customer service, from the management, to the counter, to the bussers, is outstanding. You are greeted, and checked on throughout most of your visits. The large outdoor space and picnic table setup is huge for me and my family. The kids can run around and explore before and after we eat. What steals the show though, is the food. I have tried just about everything on the menu and have not had one disappointment. I tend to go back to the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, Southwest Burger, and BBQ Platter most often. I believe the BBQ gets shipped over from Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert. The portions are more than generous and complimented by some really good sides. No alcohol, but just eat and then walk over to 12 West for a beer, or Garage East for a glass of wine! Avoid peak times if you don't want to wait in line. If you do encounter a line, it usually moves pretty fast. Plus, stay, it's worth the wait!
