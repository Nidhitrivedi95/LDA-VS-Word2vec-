l-Zjik0MbpabQPv-nNp9YQ I've tried a lot of items here & most are good. The almond cookies are great. The donuts are good especially the apple fritter but sells out early. If want these either come early in day or preorder it the day before. I've also tried the almond & chocolate croissants & it is also good.
Coworkers have brought in bread which is good.

The only bad review I have is the cake, ordered the strawberry shortcake. I was disappointed in it, the cake itself was quite dry. I've gotten better one at Loblaws & should have went with them or Sobeys. Maybe it's been sitting there for awhile, so not fresh.
