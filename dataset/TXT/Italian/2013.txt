-L88B-PrtzwujhLuYc2k_g Friendly service and atmosphere could be fun but the food was anything but good.   Pasta was cold, over-cooked, roasted veggie pizza had little vegetables and the 3rd plate (don't even know what that was) looked like a frozen dinner that was microwaved. All bland, tasteless and sad food.  I don't expect fine dining at restaurants like this but this was below all expectations.  

I really don't like to give a 1 star but the food at Joe Badali's needs help.  Major help.
