Tgc2dTcE1xOey2OUt_PvXA We come for pizza but stay for the pizza cookie. This place is always busy but we found the best time to go for lunch is around 11:30 and dinner you need to get there by 5 to avoid waiting. Everyone in my family likes something different. Here are our favorites: Oreganos Favorite Salad, Italian Gold Wings, Chicago Italian Sausage Sandwich, pepperoni thin crust pizza. Their midday rush menu is great. My coworker & I split the Heck A slice and salad, it's perfect for two when you get it to go. The heck a sliced is really 2 huge slices. Laid back atmosphere.
