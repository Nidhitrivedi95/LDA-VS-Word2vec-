My best friend was planning to take me there before we went to a show, instead we took a couple friends of ours and made a party of it! A little pricey but WELL WORTH IT! I had the gnocchi and it was incredibly filling, the portions were reasonably sized. I also ordered a meatball (everything is a-la-carte) which was easily the greatest meatball I have ever eaten and ever will eat haha. It was made with multiple types of meat and stuffed with cheese with a tomato sauce, cheese and garnish on top. Service was good also, she was a little slow about getting our check but we were also in a hurry to get to the show. I will be coming back for sure.
