oUvqwPJkorOnYZFKRt0oEg We went to Baci to celebrate with family.  They were extremely accommodating.  The food was good. 

Minor issues: I do think that the server should be less concerned with us keeping our silverware after the salad course. Just go get some clean forks and hand them out.  Also the Fox news playing on every TV is just disconcerting when you are trying to enjoy a night out.  Propaganda and pasta just don't mix.  

Otherwise, fantastic.  I would recommend to everyone!!
