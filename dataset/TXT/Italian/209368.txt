qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA We were hungry and looking around for some Italian food. Were a little bit afraid to go in, but were happy afterwards :)
We got the linguini alfredo which was delicious and creamy. I had angel hair with tomatoes, garlic and some herbs. Very good.
The red wine (chianti) gets a 10 ! 
We shared the tiramisu ... OMG... mmmmmmm we want more - we want more...!
A pre calculated tip, but because the food was excellent and the waiters were friendly, we had no problem with it.
It's a pity that we discovered this resto not earlier.
Will recommend and will return.
