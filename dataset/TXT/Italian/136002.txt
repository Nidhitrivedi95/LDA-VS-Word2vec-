IXUoO2QcFergBHdR4wPf9g Finally have a good food spot on our little stretch of road. It's all fast food and one awesome Thai spot, after reading the reviews for The Porch over on Indian School that is also new I feel super lucky to have Pitch a couple blocks up! 

Been here twice and tried two different pies, both good the Mia with mixed olives for the win though. Meatballs were good. Alfredo tortellini on point. Sliders were yummy but messy because of the sauce art but you can wash your hands. Cocktails are on point as well, wish the happy hour was 30-60 minutes longer but whatever. Tad pricy but no worse than other spots in Scottsdale and better than a decent amount to be fair. 

All in all, happy camper.
