pVntIctjRuspaO_ULf5zOA The food here is great. It's the service that has me not so impressed. I reserved for a party of four. Two of my guests got there before me and the hostess refused to seat them telling them there was nothing under my name. I arrived about five minutes later and told her there absolutely was. She then proceeded to seat us on the patio--in a pretty crappy spot I might add...but not before she assumed we were using a Groupon...nice. We weren't by the way. I guess we just looked like the "type" to her...whatever that is. But I kind of wish we had gotten a discount considering.

After we were seated we were brought water. We ordered our drinks and waited. They arrived and the waiter placed them haphazardly on the table--he could barely remember what belonged to which guest. 

We ordered our food, and I ended up ordering an appetizer...which ended up being served after the main course. 

The food, like I said, was delicious. Rich and filling. Even the brownie and ice cream we ordered for dessert was great despite the fact that it was served less than 5 minutes after we ordered it, which had us skeptical. 

Like I said the service could be improved though. Our waiter was a bit of an odd duck. He mixed up our orders, bumped into my friend without even noticing and at one point even had his butt in my friend's face as he was serving another table.

Finally the whole one bill thing is just stupid. Unless you're with a family or on a date, what is the point? And in this day and age how is that you can't separate the bill. Just dumb. Be prepared to deal with the foolishness of having to do the math yourself.
