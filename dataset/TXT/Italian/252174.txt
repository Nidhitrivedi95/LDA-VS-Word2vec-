VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w This review is for their LAVO Champagne Brunch! My new favorite place to hit up in vegas during the day now! :D

One of my girlfriends knew a promoter and walked 8 of us in. They placed us at a table near the entrance. Free alcohol and free food!? What more can you ask for!? Waiters brought out pancakes, waffles, pizza, garlic fries, salad, etc. mmm! They also give you neon glasses, glow sticks, sweat band, and foam glow sticks! Definitely a hipster/raver party haha. They do have an outdoor area for you to smoke. Weird to come out to see the sun and then walking back into the club with glow sticks everywhere. Haha only in vegas. The Dj was pretty good, played mostly electro songs. Their go go dancers are pretty hot too, especially the asian girl. ;)

Overall, I would definitely come back here. B)
