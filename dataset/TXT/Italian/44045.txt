84ezTxVxTCmI65_UeYRJcA In the aftermath of a snowstorm, I walked over here for some gelato because, when the craving hits you, and you find out about a delicious gelato spot in downtown Toronto, might as well grab some, right?! 

First, location. It's located at the southeast corner of Jarvis Street and Adelaide Street East, just across from the northeast corner of St. James Park. 

Second, make sure you 'check in' on Yelp. This spot has great offers for those engaging in the 'check in' option, including 25% off breakfasts or size upgrades for gelato and coffee (the options change). 

Third, the menu and ambiance. It's very clean, relaxed, and casual, with modern décor. It looks like they have a number of options on their menu including pastries (their Nutella brownies looked amazing!), sandwiches, and their specialty pizzas. And of course, their gelato - they have some really interesting flavours available like Vanilla Rosewater, Kit Kat, Coffee Crisp, and a number of others. I had a Small cup of the Vanilla Rosewater and Coffee Crisp, and I loved both - the Coffee Crisp wasn't as sweet as I anticipated, which I liked. And the Vanilla Rosewater was so, so fantastic! Great flavour and aftertaste - it literally tasted like rosepetals! It's not for everyone, but it's a unique flavour that you should try at least once!

Lastly, service was so friendly and sweet. When I visited on a Tuesday around 12PM, I was informed that they actually have a Tuesday special where you can get 2 flavours in a Small cup (instead of just 1 flavour). They were so very patient and welcoming, and really made you WANT to come back to their establishment!

For my Small cup, I paid around $4.00. I also had a bit of a friend's pepperoni pizza, and it was delicious. I will definitely and certainly back - a great first-time experience.
