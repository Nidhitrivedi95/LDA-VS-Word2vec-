dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg I'm so conflicted! On one hand, we were able to get seated in under five minutes of arriving. On the other hand, the food didn't sing to me, but rather just hummed along to a common theme. 

Evidently, not drinking alcohol has either effected my taste buds or my perception of food, because I cannot honestly say I was impressed with last night's meal. The Boom Dip appetizer was okay, after adding red pepper flakes. But the Alfredo The Dark with chicken was such a limp noodle for me. Was that really chicken lunch meat sliced thick in my pasta? The cheese wasn't melted, and I couldn't find any alfredo sauce in my pasta bowl. Par for the course, I ended up getting full and bringing about half of the dish home. If, at lunch, I decide this was a good meal and I was just misguided by not having alcohol with my food, I shall update my review.
