eRNDudpCqrDuRaz4-reNOQ Excellent food and friendly service in this unpretentious Italian restaurant.


 I had a delicious melanzane al parmigiano to start followed by a pizza with asparagus and prawns; my companion had garlic mushrooms and chicken with a blue cheese sauce. Couldn't quite manage a dessert each after all that! Coffee was nothing special, but then, I don't go to restaurants for the coffee.


 Their lunch menu is an especially good deal, and from the chatter I overheard between waiters and patrons they clearly have a lot of customers who keep coming back!
