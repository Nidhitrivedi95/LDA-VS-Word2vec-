SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ We got seated within 15 minutes during prime dinner time (with no reservations). This was amazing because my husband & I were hungry and tired.

The service was excellent. Our drinks were refilled before we even knew we needed them refilled. We're lactose intolerant (why are we even bothering to eat Italian?) and our server never made us feel awkward about it. He made excellent recommendations based on our dietary concerns.

The food was good - I had the rigatoni bolognese which good. Flavourful sauce, hearty. My husband had capellini al pomodoro which was refreshing and light. Both of us really enjoyed our bruschetta to start with as well.
