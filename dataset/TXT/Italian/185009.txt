oJSa5HCiZXKLXxggQmecEQ Campagnolo had high expectations to live up to after reading all the Yelp reviews the few days before, therefore...here is my review:

Service - very friendly and knowledgable about the food and drinks. The wait time for our mains was a bit lengthy however, we were there on a busy Friday night though so while I may be lacsidasical my dining companion was quite hungry!

Cocktails - Best Dark & Stormy in town!!

Appy: Prosciutto & Burrata - the prosciutto was your standard cured meat, however they do give a healthy portion (Yay!!). Paired with the Burrata a match made in heaven! The grapes served with the Burrata have an interesting texture and temperature and didn't quite do it for me. But the cheese and toast that it's served on made up for it!

Mains: I had the Pappardelle with Rabbit and mushrooms. Normally not a huge pasta eater, I ordered this cause mushrooms and pasta make me drool. The pasta was pretty basic and I ate the mushrooms up, however I found the rabbit to be quite bland and not really adding anything to the dish. Whether this is a characteristic of the meat or a lack of seasoning, I'm not sure. 

Dining companion: The Cassoulet - what didn't this dish have! Duck Confit, Sausage and a variety of veg. He enjoyed it quite a bit! Caution: this dish is more than enough for one even two people!

Overall, food was good and ambience was cozy and intimate. Would go back but not before I knock off a few other places on my list....happy dining!
