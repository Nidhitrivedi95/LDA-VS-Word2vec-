juu7S1nP5eirbeJ8-rfguw My first visit, my husband's enjoyed dinner here with colleages several times.  We enjoyed our meals and were pleased with the flavor of both the tilapia topped with crab and shrimp and the crab and shrimp cakes. The roasted veggies were tasty and my husband enjoyed the crispy potatoes.  Service was friendly but empty soup crocks never left the table until the end of the meal.  We both tried unfamiliar wines and enjoyed the Travolo red and the  Reisling.
