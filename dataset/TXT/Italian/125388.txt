Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A Friends recommended Caffe Boa and I'm so thankful they did. With the star rating, I'm not sure I would have ever made it here. We arrived during happy hour so sat in the small bar area. The bartender, and I wish I knew his name, served us at the table. He was excited when I ordered the Aviation drink saying it was his favorite and he said he'd make me a great one. I'd never had one so was branching out. It was really good, and not too sweet. He even brought the bottle of lavender liquor (?) out to show me the bottle. We ordered happy hour appetizers, the skirt steak and shrimp dishes... and both were exceptional. We were too full to move into the main restaurant for dinner and finished our evening in the bar enjoying every minute. With Mill Ave right there, and some hustle and bustle and other places with happy hour going on, the calm and welcoming atmosphere of Caffe Boa was just right. Our friends highly recommend the lasagna, yet we didn't get to try it. Next time...
