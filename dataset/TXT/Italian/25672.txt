4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg Classy establishment from start to finish. It's our second night in Vegas with a crew of 23 (7 kids) - we do this trip annually so we've got some experience dining with a large group. Allegro certainly ranks up there. 
Friendly, fun and elegant. Classy service, great food (with rather large portions) and fantastic management. Bravo!
