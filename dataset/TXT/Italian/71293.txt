I also enjoyed the atmosphere. It's a mix of modern design with classic pieces, such as the wood fire oven. They have a flat screen tv on the wall that does not play the sports game. Instead they play La Vita Dolce and play opera over the radio. The only downside was having to give my email to find out where there new location would be.
