w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A We ordered one of their specialty pizzas with clams and garlic combined (forgot what the name was for it) & a Caesar salad. For our drinks we ordered coke and their flavored peach ice tea. I liked their peach tea a lot & I wouldn't recommend putting sugar in it because it comes already sweet. The pizza we ordered had a lot of garlic in it so if you like garlic I would recommend getting it. You can also definitely taste the clams inside & it was quite delicious. Caesar salad was served with bread too & I enjoyed it! I felt like the service was a lil slow & for as busy as it seemed we didn't see a lot of servers making their rounds. Overall good was great though!
