KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ The absolute best place in vegas for italian food.  Where to begin?  At the beginning I suppose, right?

They make a pear and gorgonzola stuffed tortellini's that are the best.  Served in butter with pine nuts.  Wow.

Another winner is the "Pepperoni Arrostitti", which are Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Tossed with Golden Raisins and Pine Nuts.  Incredible.

The pasta is perfect.  I recommend the Orecchiette, because I like the idea of eating little ears, aside from the fact that its entirely delicious in san marzano tomato sauce.

As a main course, you have to try Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken.  Don't ask why, just try it and send me a thank you note later.  

Another main course you need to try (but maybe not at the same sitting..  maybe) is the Pollo Scarpariello (Chicken Sauteed with Hot and Sweet Italian Sausage and Yellow and Red Bell Peppers
in a White Wine Sauce).  Try it, send me a thanks later, same place.

The meatballs?  What does one say about perfection?  When I went there, the waiter brought us out a couple meatballs without us asking for them.  I said "We didn't order these".  He said "Try them.  You don't like them, they're on me."  Well, they were gone when he came back 20 minutes later to check on us.  Enough said.

The Italian Ricotta Cheese Cake is sweet, but not too sweet, as is the Cannoli.  Both go perfect with the coffee, espresso, or some anisette.  You really can't go wrong with this place.

And why is it decorated like Christmas all year round?  Because the previous owner one year decided to leave the decorations up after the holidays, and never took them down again (at the NYC location).  Its in tribute to him.  

Oh, and if you see a huge ox of a man at the front, thats Tiny.  Say hi, but be nice.  The desert is a big place my friend.
