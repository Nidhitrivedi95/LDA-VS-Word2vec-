dCgWmN4DuGBSDG4liWH3OQ I called twice to check that a groupon was valid.  I was told that it was still valid.When I walked in, I immediately explained that I was troubled that I had already used the groupon.  Three times, I was assurred that it was valid.  When the bill comes, the manager arrives and says it had been used.  Groupon had sent reminders that I should use it soon or it would expire.  I was livid and the manager was OBNOXIUS.  If the restaurant offers groupons to get you in the door to "experience" the restaurant.  I had an experience and will NEVER return.
