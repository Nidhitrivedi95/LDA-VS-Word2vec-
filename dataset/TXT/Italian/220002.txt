SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg UHHH!!! My stomach feels like it is going to explode. I am so full. I cannot eat another bite... but there is still half a dish of truffle mac'n'cheese. All are common responses when visiting Herbs & Rye. 

I have been so bogged down with work, or work related situations that I was set on treating myself to a nice meal. I called up a friend and we met up for happy hour. Both of us didn't feel like drinking, so we opted for their food specials. The deals are limited to five or six items, but they offer some meals for half off. Instead of just filling up on quick fryer food, H&R includes a few steak and a pork chop entree. We began with the spicy mussels ($10 HH, $22 regular). The tomato sauce was so good that I was scooping it into empty shells to slurp down. For my entree I got the 12oz. bone in strip cooked to a medium rare with the peppercorn brandy sauce and the truffle mac ($17.50). I have to say this was near perfection. Yet, I would have been happier without the sauce. My friend had got the same steak with the chimiccuri and asparagus. I stole most of her sauce. I should have listened to our server, the chimicurri was much more flavorful and bold. Usually I am not a mac'n'cheese person. My gaze usually zooms over these words, but Robyn and Kevin L. swears by it. Luckily, I trusted them and ended up a winner. 

By the end, two steak dinners with an large order of mussels to start cost us less than $50. Even though their HH list is minimal, Herbs & Rye's offerings are more than satisfactory.
