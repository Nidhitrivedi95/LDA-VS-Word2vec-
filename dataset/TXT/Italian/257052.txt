We started with the braised artichoke which looked amazing and tasted even better. We then moved on to the linguini and clams and Ravioli Bianca prepared with a
delicate ravioli a browned butter, fresh basil and roma tomatoes with roasted nuts. All this while enjoying a perfect glass of Pinot Noir. A definite must try.
