h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ My family and I have come to mezzo for several years and used to love it and saw this place as a hidden gem in Vegas, but I'm pretty sure we will no longer be coming back. Hubby and I come for date nights all the time, every year we do mothers day, but for the past year our dining experience has been nothing but frustrating. 
Service was so slow. The food has always taken some time, I used to attribute the time was a thing for quality, but an hour wait time is TOO long on multiple occasions. Food tastes great, but quality has come down, and has been inconsistent. And by golly, can a girl get a refill? Took forever to get water at the start of dinners, took forever to get our bread, forever for our food, and my table had to ask several times for a refill on multiple visits. And, on mothers days, my aunt ordered 2 mimosas, was charged 3, and the wait or said, "uh no you had 3." Buddy you hadn't cleared any plates and she clearly only had 2 empty glasses. He repeated, "you had 3 but I'll take one off," rudely.
The yelp rumors are true. Place is going downhill. Maybe, just maybe if yelpers tone changes we may possibly consider coming back. But now, we say farewell.
