6okGKL2PA7kkc-GjZzNHnA I'm only reviewing based on service, NOT the food (since we didn't eat any!). 

We came in here starving and had a lukewarm greeting from the two hosts. Ok, fine. Whatever. Maybe it was the gloomy, almost-about-to-rain weather.

We were seated in a booth near a table of what seemed like 15-20 people. Unfortunately, we had the same server they did. Which means, we didn't really get much attention....if at all. 

The only thing we really got was water, which arrived later than expected. And we put in our order for the lobster mac and cheese appetizer. After a couple of minutes, we were pretty much ready to order. That's when the server began to take the bigger table's order....and we just weren't having it.

Our logic was that she could've taken our order first to get us out of the way rather than have us wait for her to take the order of 15-20 people. So, learning our lesson from the horrendous service at Picanha in California (we told ourselves if we had a feeling that it wasn't gonna be a good experience, we wouldn't stay), we went with our gut and just left.

Oh well. MAYBE we'll try some other time. 

At least we quenched our thirst with some water.
