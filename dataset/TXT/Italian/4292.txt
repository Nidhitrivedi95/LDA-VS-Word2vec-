Food: considering that nervosa in yorkville charges the same for their white truffle pasta I'm not sure how they couldn't get the mushroom risotto right at this place. It says there is a splash of white truffle oil on the menu, I couldn't taste it at all, might as well not even mention it. 
The duck, much better at la banane (where the food and experience was amazing btw!!!) the duck here was in so much sauce, the fat wasn't melt In your mouth fat it was chewy and obnoxious to finish. The wine was expensive - but good. 

Staff: the first server that came to our table barely said hello to me and immediately assumed that my boyfriend was in charge of all the orders? What year is this again? Even after my boyfriend told him to ask me what I wanted he stood still and still was waiting for him to give an order and didn't look at me. 
We asked to get moved from right next to the door and initially (even though more than 7 tables were empty) he didn't seem like he wanted to move us, finally we were given another table and the server was very friendly and we have no complaints about him! 

Overall: didn't enjoy the food and start of the service and wouldn't return.
