I4KLIuqnYu_zPV6RCfEtQg My wife and I were recently driving across country toward Montreal and spent the night in Laval. We had no idea where to eat but checked out Yelp to see what might be in the area. We decided on this restaurant. You should go here!! We were very happy with the delicious food but also impressed with friendly and personalized service from the owner and his staff. This place is definitely worth checking out ! We were so happy! They also do catering! Too bad they don't deliver in the USA !
