x7_dQJcIii29X7XL6FdfhQ Pizza of crap!!! Called this restaurant while I was staying in the Marriott on business. Mind you I haven't ordered from Pizza Hut in years but decided due to a long business day, I would go ahead and order some pizza. 
Well when I called and placed the order through the reservation line, the lady told me it would be approximately 30 minutes. After 45 minutes I called the local restaurant the manager told me that the driver would be leaving shortly and said that the people in customer service did not know what they were talking about because his drivers were busy and they should have told me 45 minutes to hour. 
When the pizza arrived, not only did the Driver put the bag with the pizza in it on the ground while he had me sign the credit card document. Then of course to my surprise opening the box the pizza was completely cold. 
Mind you this pizza was not cheap... Full price thin pepperoni pizza for $25. 
When I called the manager and explain to him that this pizza was cold and he proceeded to tell me "the pizza is not cold", I explained to him I am here with the pizza and yes in fact it is very cold... Then the manager yet again  insulted me by telling me I did not know what I was talking about. So again,  I would not recommend this restaurant at ALL!!!!
