yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg Horrible & the rudest person (owner) seating & answering phone asked if reservation was needed and hung up the phone & when arrived he was so rude, the restaurant was highly recommended by local folks, I will never go back due to the rudest person I have ever encountered in my dining experience. So unprofessional for a restaurant owner.
