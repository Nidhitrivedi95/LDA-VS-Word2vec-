xFOjC9yqSEecm3q9HZ1s4Q I would say Amore Dogs, out of the three restaurants in the same Dogs group, is probably the most iron a nice shirt or shove a bit of lipstick on feeling, as it just feels slightly more formal, with more of a chic edge to it. The lighting and whiteness of this restaurant make it very attractive, as does the sweeping bar and signature pooch art adorning the back wall. It all works really well, as does the homely and super relaxed feel of The Dogs, and Seadogs, so this is definitely yet another culinary hit for David Ramsden, the owner.

The food focus here is Italian, and again, similarly to the other two restaurants, everything is quite shockingly reasonable at times, considering the tastiness and quality of the food you're devouring. Rigatoni al Amitriciana always appeals to my half Italian taste buds, as does the amazing seafood linguine. There are also pizza, soup and salad options to be had, all reliably very decent, so hesitate not in entering any of The Dogs restaurant portals.
