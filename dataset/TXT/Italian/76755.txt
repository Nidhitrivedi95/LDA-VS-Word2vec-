CvpXZRF-I7wfm19dW1jOXA Absolutely Gross. I have been numerous times and the experience has been good. Not great. But good. My first lunch Experience today at mark rich was aweful. Wings were overcooked and dried out garbage with an overcooked breading I don't remember ever getting when I am there in the evening. Stromboli was good so you get the second star. Never order the wings again. Don't bother complaining to the staff cuz they will justify their food and not try to correct it or remove it from the bill. I should of purchased wings from the Albertson's across the parking lot. Which I am sure where they bought their ranch dressing and nasty hot sauce.
