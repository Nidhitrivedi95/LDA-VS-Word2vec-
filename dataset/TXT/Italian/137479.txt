j54J0Ky4ruVbN_NTJ3daFg Excellent Italian food.  Very cozy - not a place where you want to have a business dinner, but go if you have some close friends and you don't mind yelling over the table.  The food is fantastic - any of their raviolis will do.  Service is attentive, and their pastas come with soup or a hefty salad.  Reasonable prices, given the quality.
