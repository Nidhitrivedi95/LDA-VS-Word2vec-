C-1vkiwcWIuWCNYhwDLCow Sandras pizza is great and traditional.the Chicken Parma is the best in the area! 
I am typically here every other Friday for lunch and I am always greeted with a smile and a delicious lunch. The sandwiches are huge and loaded with fresh ingredients.
The restaurant itself has a cozy environment and is usually quite busy for lunch. Can be a little pricey but you get what you pay for here and you are paying for fresh great tasting food!
I highly recommend Sandras
