nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Buddy V's Ristorante is a lovely place to go for home-style cooked Italian food.  The menu offers a variety of appetizers, salads, pasta, chicken, veal and seafood.  Last but not least, the cakes are insanely delicious- not surprising, seeing the restaurant is owned by the Cake Boss himself.  Do whatever you have to do to save room for dessert!
