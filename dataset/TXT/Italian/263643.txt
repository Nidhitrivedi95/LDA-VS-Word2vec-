wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q RAGING DIARRHEA!!!!!!

Tiniest table on earth. Cramped and uncomfortable.  Soup tasted like a can of progresso.  Our server, Guy was horrible!!  We ate our meal without any refills on our drinks.  We even flagged him down and he avoided us.  So I literally left the restaurant thirsty.  Bread arrived after our meal, which took 30 minutes to get.  Plus to top it all off, the men's restroom was filthy.  The floor was wet and littered with paper towels, and toilet paper and the sinks had no hot water, which I believe is a health code violation. 

Horrible, 100% AVOID.  Total waste of $70.  Ruined our evening which was supposed to be a celebration for a family event, especially since 2 of us got raging diarrhea within 30 minutes after dinner.
