rxr0kjcVwX22QI2Hq5iA4w I've been to Grappa on a few occasions (haven't visited this new location yet), and had to share their greatness with yelp. Honestly Italian restaurants generally don't impress me- most pastas are just mediocre and it's always the same old schtick. However the first time I dined here, they won me over. The service is always great and charming, the atmosphere is cozy, and the food is always top notch. I always get their mushroom & truffle linguine and I've got to say I wish I could recreate this at home to save me some money. It's perfect, has the right amount of earthyness, just enough acidity, and the hearty mushrooms make it a filling meal. 

All in all, this is one of the only Italian restaurants I'll frequent and I cant recommend them enough.
