ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg I first went to crust over 5 years ago and the food has always been fairly good. After the disaster that was the street eats festival today, I was happy to go eat lunch at Crust instead. I went with the BF and another couple (Erin B and her BF). We all shared the meat and cheese plate, which was good, but nothing extraordinary. We each got a rustica pizza and they were all really good, I got the classic, the BF got the New York, Erin got the one with pesto and bacon, and her BF got the meat. These pizzas are a funny shape, but still tasty. We didn't have the best service today....our water was empty through most of the meal, but generally the service is good. I do wish they would bring back the 'pot brownie'....a brownie in a metal pot with banana, nuts, ice cream, whipped cream....completely delicious and amazing....how can that not be on the menu???? Overall, a pretty solid pizza place.
