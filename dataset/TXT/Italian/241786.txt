ukAUNyzUcBA4Su8UKjaJKg I came here with a group of friends for summerlicious. The inside of the restaurant is a lot nicer than the outside so fret not if you think the exterior is chintzy. The start of the dinner was good with my veal meatball appetizer, which was easily the best dish of the night. It was juicy, perfectly flavoured and just delicious. Unfortunately the rest of the meal made me wonder if I just don't get Italian. The next dish was the veal lasagna, which was also good but very salty. I was downing that water to settle my taste buds. Next up the fried cauliflower, which sounded great on paper, was very bland. I had to pour the parmesan cheese on it to add some flavour. Lastly for dessert I picked the lemon tart, which had a veeeery lemony filling and a stragenly hard crust. Honestly, if it werne't for the veal meatball I'd rate this place a 2/5 but it's kind of unfair I guess because summerlicious isn't always representative of a restaurant's true quality.
