Ih0f0UyhFufm3C7kR72DSQ Great place, great food and exceptional service.  Easy 5 star rating on this one...

We decided we would all do the Chef's tasting menu (5 course) with wine.  The food at every step was fantastic.  I don't remember exactly what everything on each tasting plate was, but I will get you close...
1st Course - salmon tartare, green salad, light buttery sauce
2nd course - homemade pasta with crab, tomato slightly spicy
3rd Course - miso cobia (best course of the night)
4th Course - beef tenderloin with cauliflower purée 
5th - various desserts

If the cobia was on the menu next time, I might just get that, but there was not one disappointing item on the tasting menu.  Oh yeah, the wine was great too...
