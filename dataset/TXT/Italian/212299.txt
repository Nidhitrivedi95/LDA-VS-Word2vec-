r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA Amazing food! We went today (Saturday) for a 1:30 lunch and we must've gotten there between crowds. You can shop for what you want to take home while you wait to get in viewing distance of the on-the-wall menu board. The line moved quickly and once we placed our order, I think our food was at the table within 15 minutes. We ordered full portions of ziti and chicken parmesan because we wanted leftovers. Both came with amazingly tasty seasoned garlic bread and a refreshing side salad. We could've easily gotten away with half-portions, but now we have dinner for the next few days.  The ziti had a marinara/cheese/cream sauce, so yummy, and the chicken parmesan was a full-on tomato sauce that perfectly complimented the chicken which was easily eaten with only a fork. We had to stop well before we'd eaten half our entrees to share a chocolate shell canoli, which was out of this world. I think I'm going back next weekend. The only drawback is that all your food comes out at once: salad, bread, entrée, dessert. But it's a small price to pay for perfect.
