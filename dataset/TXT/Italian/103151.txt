What a shame!!!  Such a disappointment!!!

If you want to be ignored by the servers, insulted by the management, disappointed by the food, harrassed by drunk/high kitchen staff and have all the friends and acquaintances you invited to dinner leave upset, then this is the place for you!

I won't go into detail like I typically do with my other reviews, but let me say that the owners of Harvey American Public House need to take a LOOOOOONNNNGGGG, hard look at the inner workings of this establishment.  Gathering the staff for a "respect the clientelle" pep talk and mandatory drug screening wouldn't be a bad start!  

No one from my party will venture here again.  I recommend anyone else considering a visit to the Harvey American Public House to stay away, as well.
