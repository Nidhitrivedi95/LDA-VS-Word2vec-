XguKrY0dAuaK1W6HUlUQ1Q I have been here on a few locations for dinner with my boyfriend.  The interior is old & dated, but the food we always ordered (from the restaurant) was good. I always ordered the eggplant & he ordered the lasagna.  

One night, I sat at the bar to have a few drinks and dinner.  I quickly struck up a conversation with a businessman at the bar.  My friend joined me for drinks & our service went completely downhill.  Her kids sat at a table on the bar side & they were never waited on!  My friend at the bar gave them his bread because it was obvious they were being ignored.  The bartender, that is known for his rude jokes, never came back to us!  I ordered the chicken marsala and it was awful!  I would have sent it back otherwise but didn't want to stay any longer.  The business tried two or three times to pick up our tab (which was very generous), but the bartender would not let him. I couldn't believe it!  He told the guy "no" twice.  It was rude beyond belief.  I wasn't looking for a handout, but he offered, I think, because my best friend and her children were treated so poorly. 

I will never return.
