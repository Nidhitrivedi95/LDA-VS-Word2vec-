eGTAC8EzcHiYnnZ52tijiQ My boyfriend and I have been here numerous times over the last few years- mostly for the Sunday brunch.  The portions are big enough to fill you up, no matter what you're ordering.  I typically go for the Eggs Benny which is on nice fresh bread rather than an English muffin.  The hollandaise is perfectly decadent.  So much flavor going on- delicious!  My boyfriend usually gets the slow roasted lamb sandwich- and I can say as a person who didn't really eat much lamb up until a few years ago, this sandwich will convert any non-lamb eater because it's to die for!

Sundays get ridiculously busy so realize that you're likely in for a bit of a wait not only to order, but also to get a table. I don't mind the cafeteria style dining (order and pay first, then find a table) - I'm used to that from when I lived abroad.  However I do know a lot of North Americans aren't quite used to it.  

Overall- I recommend this place to everyone, I've never had a bad meal.
