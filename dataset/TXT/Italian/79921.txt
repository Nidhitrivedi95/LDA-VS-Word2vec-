d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew My friend from Arizona suggested I try out the wings, he had heard there was a location in Vegas. I went to the Streets of New York website to check out the menu and saw that they have Happy Hour, clicked on the link for the Happy Hour Menu. The website states, "Enjoy food and drink specials from 2:30 pm to 6 pm, Monday through Friday at all Streets of New York locations!" Cool!!! I had even preselected my order in my mind.

I arrived at the restaurant around 3:40 pm on Friday. I walked in and the waitress was on the phone and saw the sign to seat yourself. After awhile the waitress greets me and I ask about the Happy Hour menu (there are no signs mentioning a happy hour anywhere). She said, "There is no Happy Hour on Friday." Since, this was my first time here and thought to myself maybe I misread the website. I was still able to order from the lunch specials (10:30 am to 4:00 pm). Ordered the 6 wings and a slice, soda, and a slice of the pumpkin cheesecake.

I loved the wings! They were meaty, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, just the right amount of sauce, and great buffalo flavor. I liked the crust of the pizza but it didn't seem like there was any sauce and it tasted dry. The pumpkin cheesecake was dreamy! It was light, creamy and the pumpkin flavor was subtle.

I will be back for more wings and cheesecake for sure! I would also like to try more items during Happy Hour, apparently not on a Friday though. Like previous reviewers the wait staff seemed to be going through the motions and not especially welcoming. I would given a rating of 4 stars for the food only but downgraded based on service and false advertisement of Monday through Friday Happy Hour.
