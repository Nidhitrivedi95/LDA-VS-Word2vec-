1UmZSifNBsygSWzbfKiAew It's a four-star place, but Jeanna thinks $10 for homemade lasagna is pricy and Greg gives two stars for what he calls average food with great service. WTF? 
This place has gotten better as time has passed since opening. Quality ingredients like Boar's Head meats and dough made fresh keep me coming back. I admit I live close by and might not travel too far out of my way to get here if I didn't, but only because a good Italian restaurant isn't too tough to find in this town. This one is clearly better than average, or at least it is now. The growing pains are over, so take my advice and enjoy some fresh, authentic Italian cuisine next time you're in the area. Pizza and Stromboli are particularly good. You won't be disappointed unless you're as unreasonable as some of the other reviewers have been lately. I could give an honest 5-star if they served beer & wine.  Due to lack of booze and ambiance it really is only a 4-star place, but had to award the fifth star to make up for the lack of fairness shown by some other reviewers.  It's a solid 4-star, and it's only a cold beer or a pleasant glass of wine away from being a 5 'er.
