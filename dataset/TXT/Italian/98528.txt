ewEDv_q-K0fV0FepkHB8sA I haven't been to the Tornado Club in about 5 years but this was always the special occasion restaurant we frequented in college.  All of the steaks are excellent and well cooked.  They got some good beef in the midwest ya know.  This is the first place I tried venison and its been the best tasting and least gamey I've had anywhere.  The best dish on the menu here is the coquille st jacques (sp?).  The mashed potatoes, the scallops and the sauce are perfectly married and served elegantly on a cleaned out shell.  Its the perfect dish and many of my friends have ordered 2 - one as appetizer and another for main dish.  If you're a fan of frog legs and escargot you'll be happy to know these dishes also shine.  I guess anything with a lot of butter and garlic is bound to be good but these are especially lovely.  

The last time I was ever there during graduation weekend a bat, yes a bat, started flying around the restaurant.  It got through an open window in our dining room.  You've never seen so many 21 year old guys jump underneath a table so quickly.  Anyway we eventually shooed the bat out the same window.  For our inconvenience we got free liquor and free desserts.  Not a bad deal for some starving hungry college kids.
