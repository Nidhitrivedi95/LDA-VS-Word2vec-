OuiNJhOCqw14wQ1NZXjmkQ I had been before on a date and bumped into some old neighbors (one being Italian was a good sign). It's really a combination of a coffee bar, nice seating area with an atrium feel and a reception room attached to the right. I recalled the food being quite tasty even compared to Italian cuisine in Italy itself. I especially remember the marinara sauce standing out as being right on the mark. It had that little tartness that I love and is hard to find done right at restaurants (in my opinion). I don't remember the service being off the hook, but it was definitely not a negative. Since those meals went well, I figured why not try again, but now with a party of four. This time the service stood out, but not in the best way (we all agreed). I was surprised, as I began to recall the previous visit having been pretty good. Thankfully, two things happened. The first was that another server helped out on a few occasions. The second the marinara sauce was just as I remembered it. The stuffed bell pepper, mini bocconcini with cherry tomato salad and Italian sausage with Dijon mustard were also very tasty and fairly priced at $3.99. The fettuccini carbonara was quite rich and creamy (a good plate to share - as we did). The Baked Lasagna was satisfying (it's bathed in 'the' marinara sauce). Last but not least was the seafood linguini (with white sauce) at $16.99 - a value, filled with fresh right sized shrimp, bay type scallops and plenty of other goodies including chopped garlic. I stated out loud - I would be back just for that stunning dish. Wrapping up a lengthy yet fun late lunch we shared a piece of red velvet layer cake and an apple torte. They were both great with lattes and cappuccinos to wash them down. We all joked that we were still full hours and even a day later. I almost forgot despite all the carbs we ate - the warm crusty Italian loaf was worth the wait. I used it to sop up the sauce on every dish. Oh, yah baby 'the' sauce.
