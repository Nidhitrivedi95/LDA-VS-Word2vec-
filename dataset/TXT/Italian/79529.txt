d1_Ko1DQ4QyB9BjnCFjVLw We went in today for an early dinner around 5pm.  We we're seated instantly. After sitting for about 15 mins without anyone  acknowledging us in any way, shape, or form, we got up and left. The manager had even been wiping and setting tables next to us and didn't acknowledge us. The two waitresses in our dining room, which only had 5 tables seated including us, walked passed us at least 3 times with drinks in hand for other tables. As we were walking out, the manager had the nerve to say "Thank you!" As if she hadn't seated us, and ignored us 15 mins earlier. We ended up at Ah-so on 75thave instead and the night was perfect there, where we gladly probably spent 3X what we would have at this joke of a restaurant.
