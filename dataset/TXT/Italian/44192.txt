88Mq2edCXyXRtjmY_Vkarg Ricos is a wonderful example of a restaurant that knows it's cuisine and customers. Quiet dining in multiple rooms. 
Their angel hair pasta with pine nuts is exceptional and a wonderful appetizer . Also not to be missed is the zucchini as well as the banana peppers.
All of their specials are fantastic especially if they have Wall Eye Pike and Virginia spots.
And for dessert a true pecan ball with real hot fudge or caramel. 
We have never been rushed and have been promptly served.
Rico's is a special restaurant indeed.
