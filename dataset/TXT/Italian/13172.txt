14O6gNqpd3bcnIAHPFT58g Oh my! I think I've gotten as close to heaven with the cuisine from this little slice of Italy. I had the Zucca(Butternut) Ravioli! Basil had, my husband had their lasagne - he says it's the best he's ever had. Robert was out waiter, ask for him! He not only was attentive but entertaining, as well.

We had their special, $55 for a bottle of wine, it was excellent. Appetizer - I had the calamari, very light & the garlic aioli perfected it.  Also a green salad with vinegar oil & then the main dish as mentioned above.  Our dessert is Tiramasu & coffee. Such a deal. Definitely recommend this place!
