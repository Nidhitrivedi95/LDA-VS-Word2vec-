JogUSDKa1xyG3lLEmD4Xjg This restaurant was great from beginning to end. The pesto & bread was good, everyone's food looked delicious and from the quite table you would agree that it was. I ordered the Scallops as my appetizer and they were so good, the only disappointment was I wanted more of the purée cauliflower. Then to my surprise they brought out a palate cleanser (lemon sorbet) before the entree with I enjoyed since no restaurants really do that anyone. For my entree I had the lamb chops and it was every bit of delicious along with the cheesecake I had for dessert! I would highly recommend this restaurant.
