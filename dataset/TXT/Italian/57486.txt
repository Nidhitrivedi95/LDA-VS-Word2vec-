anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg Ok I have a Lincoln town car. So I pull into the parking lot. Some lady runs up to me screaming I cant park here. I was shocked. I asked why. She told me to stage somewhere else. I asked stage? She told me limos cant stage here. Im not a limo stupid lady. I left never to go back. If the owner reads this talk to you parking crew. You lost a customer
