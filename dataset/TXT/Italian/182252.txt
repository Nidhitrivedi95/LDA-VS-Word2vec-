oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw We needed a quick place to eat at before going to the Michael Jackson Cirque Show.  We were seated without menus and actually had to ask for them.  Although there were many waiters hustling around, it took sometime to get water, appetizers ordered etc.  The waiter was a little odd, but friendly nonetheless.  We ordered the spinach lasagna and the Margherita pizza, which were both good-sized portions, however nothing extraordinary for the price.   I probably wouldn't eat here again if I had to choose.
