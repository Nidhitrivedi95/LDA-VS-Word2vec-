The waitress said that they were prepping for dinner, which resulted in us waiting for over 40 minutes to receive our ramen and meatballs. It was a little frustrating since we were eating before a baseball game so we didn't have that much time to waste. 

I'd still go back to get the spicy ramen, but probably not on a day where I'm on a time crunch in case it takes a while.
