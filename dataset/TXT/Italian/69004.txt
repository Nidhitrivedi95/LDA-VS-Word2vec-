bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg Happy New Year!!! This is a wonderful hidden gem of a restaurant. Our first time there and the service and food was Fabulous. I had the Chilean sea bass, and my husband, the Veal Chop. The owners were so gracious and greeted us like family. Needless to say, we will be back. Service is top notch, servers were knowledgeable in menu, everything about our experience was on point!
