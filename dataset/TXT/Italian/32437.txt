5V3TKtbaK23u6FCvv-08zQ Sat upstairs with a group of 12. It is very warm up there so be warned!  Food wise, I was impressed. We ordered a variety of different dishes and all had very positive results. I had the rack of lamb and it was outstanding!  Service was spotty though. Professional, but spotty. Because the amount of wine flowing, the heat on the second floor started to make it in unenjoyable and thus my 1 star deduction. Decor meds serious updating. A little on the tacky side. But a very nice evening.
