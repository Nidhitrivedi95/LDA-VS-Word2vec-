w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A Finally decided to try out Metro Pizza tonight and we were not disappointed.

The hostess/host were super friendly.  They were giving out Parmesan chips to snack on in the waiting area.  The bartender was super nice as well.

We ordered
-garlic romano fries:  these were piping hot upon arrival.  We dipped these into ranch and it was yummy.
-chicken wings: asked that chicken wings be well done, with the hot sauce on the side.  Came out just like how we asked for it.  Yay!  points for Zip (our waiter, but we gave him that nickname since he was quick and responsive) for getting it right.  These were yummy too.
-Honolulu Pizza: with anchovies.  We were afraid that the individual would be too small so went w/the large.  I ate half of my slice and was FULL.  It was very delicious, and I will get to eat the rest of the pizza for the next 2-3 days.  yay, no need to cook!
-Tiramisu:  not balanced.  The mascarpone cheese overpowered the coffee taste.  I wouldn't order this again.

Forgot to mention that they give you a basket of warm crisp on the outside/fluffy in the inside bread, with butter.  I took some of this to go too.  

Overall, this place is wonderful, especially since it's right around the corner.  Definitely recommend to those who wants yummy pizza and friendly service.
