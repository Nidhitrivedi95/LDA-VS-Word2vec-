SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg I think this place is awesome. The atmosphere is great, food is delicious, and the prices are ridiculously low during happy hour. The hostess, bar tender, and our waiter were really nice. I never post yelp reviews but i couldn't get over how much i liked this place. Okay thats not really why, i just wanted to point this out because ive never seen business reaponses so savage before to 1 stars. So, i was bored as hell at work, i work night shift, and im going over the reviews. And my co worker has gone here too so we were just talking about the place. I start reading these 1 stars and i come across nectaly M. responses from herbs and rye. They're savage af but pretty entertaining to say the least. My night flew by trying to find 1 stars, then crossing my fingers hoping...no...praying that there's a response from nectaly. I dunno, maybe ill even get a savage response. Well...now, we wait.
