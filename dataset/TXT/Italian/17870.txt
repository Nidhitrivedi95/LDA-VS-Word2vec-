2I7QtHJI-izdThjghMaT1g The lunches are excellent. I was pleased with the many choices on the menu.  I particularly liked the mussels and the chicken Marsala.  I seldom eat bread, but after tasting it I had a second piece. Even the dipping oil was unusually tasty. I would highly recommend lunch at Cafe Toscano.
