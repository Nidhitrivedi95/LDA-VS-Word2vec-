cOWXtCz7F9GQhPIks8gm6Q a last minute pick because Glendale Glitter was a dud, I picked up my phone checked out the best Italian Restaurants in Phoenix....I had a hundred to choose from. I'm so glad I stopped here! If you don't see something on the menu, ASK.....the chef wants to make you happy.....it's a win - win. We stopped on a Friday night, they had intimate live music - you can have a romantic dinner or sit at the bar and watch football. The staff was friendly, made you feel at home and the most important part was the food was amazing. It's a small place and it reminded me of my home town Chicago.....you won't regret it, stop by! yum yum
