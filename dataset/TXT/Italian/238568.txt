u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog Review only for drinks at the bar--- Great bartender! Sat down and was quickly presented with an iPad of all the various drink options. Lots of cool cocktail combinations made expertly and quick. Really impressed with the fast service here because so many other places I've been to here can be quite slow. Bartender was also cheerful and friendly. Will definitely go back for drinks. Only draw back was a bunch of obnoxious investment bankers lurking at the bar, but I can't really fault them for that.
