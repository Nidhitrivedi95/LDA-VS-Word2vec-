FQM4pVt1jeZcBGLIsXhXNA One of our favorite places to go when visiting Avon! The veal and chicken Fratello are beyond good. We add the mushrooms and it really makes the dish that much better. The shrimp Alfredo was awesome very creamy and lots of huge shrimp. Our server Bill is a true professional, amazing server and such a nice guy. He always remembers us and takes great care. If you haven't been this is a must go. Ignore the outside and old school feel the food will delight.
