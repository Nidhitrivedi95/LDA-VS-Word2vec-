qRTbYc7ennnwfr992kfjdA We got married at Caffino in July. We couldn't be happier with our chose. We had a wedding of 100 people and the size of the restaurant and the surrounding space was absolutely perfect for our day of celebration. We held our ceremony in the back ally ways early in the evening and then used the premise for our wedding photos. Th inside of the restaurant was able to accommodate 50% of our guests and the other 50% was seated outside under the stars. The setting and atmosphere was romantic, relaxing and very European.  You'd think you were in Italy. The food that night was fantastic and presented beautifully. Cocktails were lovely and the casual bar setting worked well for my new Irish family ;)

By the end of the night, we were dancing under the stars. The best part was that our guests were free to roam the premise and enjoy a very relaxing night. Both my husband, my guests and I truly enjoyed our experience at Caffino. 

Stephanie was great at keeping the plans and the day simple and organized. The staff that night could not be better. They made the transition between ceremony, cocktails, dinner to dancing seamless and easy. They were also very friendly and extremely accommodating. 

Thank you, Caffino!
