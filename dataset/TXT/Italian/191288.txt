PebX-Sf_h4FJGgsRAA5Fng I was told about this restaurant by a co-worker and then she gave me a gift certificate there for my birthday. It is tucked away in  a strip mall. Not the best location for visibility which makes it difficult for any restaurant to succeed. I am not a big Italian food fan but because she highly recommended it and gave me a gift certificate my husband and I went. The decor is about the best you can do in a strip mall, but that is not what is important to me. It is the taste of the food. I asked our server (the wife of the chef) what was best to order in their restaurant. She said lasagna. I don't like lasagna. But, if she recommended it then I wanted to try it. She also recommended a wine with it and since I am not much of a wine drinker, she offered to bring me 3 different ones to try first so that I ordered one that I liked. I thought that was great! When the lasagna came out to our table, I was delighted it was a nice size serving since my husband is a big eater and he always finishes my meal for me. I took the first bit and immediately noticed how it just melted in my mouth. The noodles are so buttery thin that you it does not overpower the flavors of the sauce and cheese. I was hooked! This is the best lasagna I have ever tasted and I have eaten in Little Italy in NYC over 25 times and this was much better! My husband had the ravioli which was also delicious. By the way, the olive oil for dipping the bread in is the freshest and best flavor I have ever had. I asked if they sold it because I wanted to take it home with me. They get it from Italy and so do not sell it. At the end of my meal, she brought me out a to-go container full of their olive oil. How is that for service?!! This is my go to restaurant for Italian food!
