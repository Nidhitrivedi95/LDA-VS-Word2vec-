u71djaZjecGVU1MqMevQ4g Came here for Dinner and have to say the place is great. The service is impeccable - great recommendations on wine, quick service, very professional. The quality of the food is what you'd expect from a place that calls Yorkville its home. It is a little dark inside, but certainly a good ambiance for those on a romantic date. 

Overall, highly recommend if you are looking for a top Italian dining experience in Toronto.
