-httBl6DSZiUtDX4SQWtag I was very disappointed to have stopped by here... had wonderful memories of some of the most delicious biscotti years ago on a visit.  Now they are expanding into the bread business.... Psst!  Your bread is as hard as rocks, the bread dough hadn't been allowed to rise, and what kind of a starter are you using?? b/c Enrico Biscotti breads was such as waste of my money & time!!  Could have swung up to Whole Foods for something 200% better.
