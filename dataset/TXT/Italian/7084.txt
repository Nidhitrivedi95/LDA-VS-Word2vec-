The sweet potato fries are fantastic, the meat is a higher quality, the lettuce and veggies are fresh and not the cheap, bagged, romaine variety you get everywhere else.

I like how they use fresher, local ingredients and promote a farm culture. The grounds nearby are very country-styled, with big benches under trees, outdoor seating, it's a country vibe, and I like that in a city environment.
