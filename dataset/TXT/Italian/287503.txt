zLAjobZ6B_0tgJsB41FNuQ Good food and fast service, lots of families. I had the chicken bacon ranch pizza. I was underwhelmed with it. I'd heard so many people talk good about it that I may have expected too much. The kids liked it and didn't complain.

Beware of the parking lot on a busy night for some reason people park just about anywhere and block people in up against the fence area. Kids in the car ready to go and now you can't back out...that was pleasant ;)

We'll return, nice place.
