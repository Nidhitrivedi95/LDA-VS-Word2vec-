0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg I must say, I've been looking forward to visiting my favorites chefs restaurants in Las Vegas. I was thoroughly disappointed at the pasta preparation at Scarpetta. My pasta was actually crunchy, not al dente, Mr. Conant. My wife enjoyed the lamb ravioli, but agreed the pasta was undercooked. 
Talk to your chefs.
