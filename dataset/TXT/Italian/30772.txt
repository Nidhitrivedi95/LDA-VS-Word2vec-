5mmF-H_4emxvultbneKFWQ New to the area and looking for good pizza to take away.  Tried Redendo's after reading the reviews and were very happy!  The spot is hard as heck to find if you don't know exactly where you are going (it's behind Jiffy Lube!) but once we finally got it home, super tasty!  We had ricotta, roasted bell peppers and mushrooms and the ricotta was flavorful, creamy and just great.  The crust is not too thin, not too thick and has its own flavor.  We will get it again!
