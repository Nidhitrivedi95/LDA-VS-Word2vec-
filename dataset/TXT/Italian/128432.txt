HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA I love the pizza and food at Naked City, and I was sorry to see the tavern close.  But people need to be warned.  Wait time can be extreme.  With only four other parties in the restaurant, we waited more than an hour and a quarter for the one pizza we ordered to be brought out.  It was worth it, but I was prepared for it.  We also resorted to helping ourselves to plates and flatware.

Other problems include the downgrading of beer, moving away from a solid collection of craftbeer to a handful of options.  Also a serious downgrading of the menu.  The better sandwiches are now gone.  This isn't the place that rocked us, even given the awkward location, a couple of years ago.  We'll still return, not as eager, and knowing it may be a long wait.

5 star food, 2 star limited menu, 1 star service.
