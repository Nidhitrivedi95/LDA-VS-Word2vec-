J5puhDnVL9WetWnWWDMhQw Cute little place tucked away in a corner. Small place with warm decor. Food is excellent and even the house wine is not some cheap stuff but decent good tasting wine. Bread in the house is perfect. I had the Penne Con Sausage and the tiramisu for desert. The penne was perfect and well cooked and tasted really good. Will recommend and come back. For weekends do remember to make a booking.
