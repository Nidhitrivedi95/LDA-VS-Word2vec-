e8kK01COAK614-RuKlXHug Wish I had more stars for this place! 5 is not enough. I love the vibe, the food is top notch and the beer selection is unmatched!! I really liked the outside seating with the string lights.  It was perfect for a summer evening. We started with the poutine, my favorite food. It was stupendous. I ordered the panini with two chicken meat balls, smoked Gouda, and pesto cream sauce and it was BOMB!! My husband had the grinder with beef meatballs and provolone cheese. My kid had a slider with government cheese and he loved that as well. Our server, Bruce, was so knowledgeable about the menu and he was great at making sure we knew how to order and the portion sizes for each option. I will definitely come back to this place!!!
