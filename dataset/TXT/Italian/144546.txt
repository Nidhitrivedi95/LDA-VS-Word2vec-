k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ I'm front out of town, and the party I was with was craving Italian. It was within walking distance of our hotel, and had great reviews on Yelp. The decor, mood, and lighting were excellent. What a great fresh looking restaurant. 

The few beers they had we're solid choices. I had a dark red beer that I had never had . Surely Delicious. I had the Spicy Seafood Linguini. The ingredients we're fresh, great presentation. But it was bland, not spiced at all. Looking for Garlic, or even salt. I had to add some. It looked amazing, but lacked in flavor. 

I would come back and try something different for sure. The rest of my party had a Fungi Pizza (loved it), A Salad (loved it), Duck Risotto (thought it was okay), Plain Risotto (Bland, no flavor)

Thanks!
