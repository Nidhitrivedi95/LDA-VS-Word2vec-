kz7O0_o6WrDQk1Kl8dKeHQ Gonna make this review short and sweet. The amount of food you get does not match the amount of money you spend. 2 salads, one with salmon, a side of mashed potatoes and 1 beer totaled $47 before tip. 

We are not cheap people but I'm tired of these trendy restaurants popping up in central Phoenix with these petite portions. They will not get our money again.
