aYjZc-3aVbPIPaJgGiUK_A Last time I was in Madison, I truly enjoyed the dining experience here. I remembered that I had the risotto dish that was heavenly. When I would think about Madison, I would think about that dish.

With my most recent visit, I made it a point to come back here to get the risotto!! About the restaurant, it's a tiny space at the corner near the Capitol building. It's got about 12 small tables, and some bar seats. It's a great place to have one of those intimate-conversation type of place. I ordered the risotto again, but it wasn't the same as what I had last time. I had a cheesier variety last time. This time, it was as creamy, and melt-in-your-mouth as last time, but it had potatoes and tiny little flowers in it. Interesting. I prefer the other variety I had, but oh well.

The dessert was the best part of dinner. It was a really dense block of chocolate ganache, with seared marshmallow, on a river of caramel (that's what I think it is, at least), some graham cracker crumbs, and some kind of gelato. This description is not doing it any justice. It was so good though! I would definitely come here again when I'm in town!!
