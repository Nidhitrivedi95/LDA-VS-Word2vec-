The restaurant was a recommendation from a friend I knew who knew the owners and said it was a great Italian place. Upon arriving we took a look at the menu and I can say is an Italian this menu is very varied and had a lot of the traditional Italian  meals that I'm familiar with. We decided on having a 16 inch margarita pizza for the four of us. The 16 inch pizza was more than enough to feed the four of us. The crust was excellent and the sauce was also very well-prepared. 
Service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and seamed to enjoy working at this venue.  
Alcohol prices were very good with $4 for well and $2 for beer.
