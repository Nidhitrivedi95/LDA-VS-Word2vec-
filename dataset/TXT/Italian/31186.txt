5OV1bavavdsYyfeBRNiOeA Should've had the big-a** peanut butter cup in the dessert case. Coulda, shoulda, woulda...but didn't. Instead, I opted for the Warm Lobster Salad and Turkey Club. My bud Jesse ordered the Caesar Salad and Cavatelli.  Both salads were sad little guys.  The Lobster Salad has a LOT of potential though. The lobster itself was delicious, but the accompanying endive needed a lil' something else. His Caesar Salad was a little embarrassing to bear such a name.  It was romaine, period.  The good news is, the bread basket was fresh and complemented by a delightful olive oil, parmesan and herb-infused dipping combo.  

Onto the main courses: My turkey sandwich was decent, but uneventful.  At $7 it wasn't grossly overpriced, but a little too much.  Jesse's Cavatelli was definitely the highlight of all things Osteria.  It was unique and delectable; nestled in a nice broth and shaved cheeses.  Yum.

All things considered, I'm not sure it's worth a trip back (save for that peanut butter cup).  The atmosphere is a really nice "casual classy, " but there are just too many other awesome options in the 'Burgh!
