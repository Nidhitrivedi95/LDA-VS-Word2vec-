9WIn1fMJoDPqkc5HOQdybw The food is fabulous. The service is not what you would expect. We were there on time for our reservation and had to wait 1 hour and 15 minutes for our food. Our appetizers came out quickly, but the dinner was another hour wait. We have friends who returned a few weeks later and had the exact same experience. When you have such a wonderful menu and great food, what in the world is gong on with your service staff??
