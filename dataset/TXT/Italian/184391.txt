OhTsSYXoD4Poc14JrjIhBw Had Gene Marie in catering cater a party for my family a couple of weeks ago and went to pick it up day of and she insisted we canceled the order...nothing was ready they had to make everything from scratch and the food was HOURS late. She kept blaming it on my family and being super rude, after we had text messages to confirm that she said food would be ready for the date and time we had scheduled. It was absolutely horrible she was so rude and will NOT be planning any more catering orders through her from that party on. DO NOT RECOMMEND. If I could give 0 stars I would.
