fhcILBrz9r2vs8Y3l52hbg I know Pacini mainly for their unlimited bread bar,  where you can grill your own slices of toast with different buttery spreads like garlic, tomato or pesto. I hadn't been to this chain in almost ten years and I'm glad that hasn't changed. However there has been some significant renovations. I believe all Pacini restaurants have undergone the makeover, more booths, comfy sofas and a very elegant, classy vibe.
 
This St Jerome location is charming, located in an old building near the river, it reminds me of being in the Old Port of Montreal or old Quebec City. 

This is a great place to be on a date, have an intimate party or just relax, their terrace is also huge and the environment is peaceful. Don't come here so much for the food. The portions are on the smaller side, and the sauces really plain. I had the Alfredo which tasted like cream, but without parmesan, I had to add so much salt. My bf had the tomato sauce pasta and that was equally lacking in flavor. 
The Pacini brand has opted for a new menu that is a lot more health conscious, as one can read about on their website. On the main page you will see the face of their nutritionist spokesperson. They have cut out all transfat, lots of salt and any unnecessary additives. Unfortunately that has been the cut back in taste. Perhaps their more expensive dishes such as veal, duck risotto or steaks would be more appealing. 

They used to serve free soup or salad- that has been eliminated, even their trademarked chocolate covered cherries at the end of the meal have disappeared. 

Nice place to hang out, come here if you love the unlimited bread like I do, it's so fresh and actually better than the main dishes. You can get a cheap lunch option for less than 12$, then it becomes worth it.

Btw, they have a good birthday discount. The percentage of discount you get is equivalent to your age! I can picture lots of old folks coming and getting an almost free meal of their choice.
