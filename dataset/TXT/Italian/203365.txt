Q4RSmF0s-AkaegrLFCLEbg From the exterior to the interior of this fine Italian restaurant, its intimate setting and Italian inspired decor will delight any guests looking for a memorable dining experience. There were 7 of us and we had a lovely round table perfectly tugged away which provided us with some privacy. We all tried different dishes and they were all great. Their extensive wine list was amazing. I am most impressed by the care and attention of their staff. By the end of our dinner we wanted to come back the next night as their menu was extensive + they have daily specials that are equally delightful and mouthwatering. Donatello is definitely a hidden gem in the city. I can go there every night while in Toronto.
