vNQkym5qZ-E-4AJ4IQ5JEg Man, I read the reviews and really was excited to try this place. I'm no going to make a long winded review but I am going to tell the cold hard truth...

There was a gas leak and they were being forced to close early. Thier solution was to cook everything and bring it out to the table at one time.  Ugh!!!! A 5 course meal in an hour and 15 minutes.  If I'm spending $150 for a meal for 2 I'd like it to not have all the courses at once.

Next, (and this is unbelievable) we were on the second floor and at the bar 5 feet away was A PAIR OF HOOKERS. LOL!!!! How do I know they were prostitutes? Well between drunkenly and loudly dropping the "F" bomb they would drunkenly and loudly discuss business. When we asked if they should be shut off we were told there was little that could be done BECAUSE THEY WERE REGULARS. I swear I'm not making this up... I should post in tips "When making reservations ask to be seated in a room different from the prostitutes."

I will say the service was a 5 star quality and the food was good. To be honest I'm not sure if I'll go back or recommend to others like it was recommended to me. Based on all the other reviews I'm guessing it was just a off night....
