IK3ZMsxyd2Z95lLupp0sQw Noticed them while buying pasta next door. Decided to go in and was pleasantly surprised to see the baked good selection. Got a few sweets as well as (self serve) buns. The cannoli was creamy and the shell was nice and crispy. The egg tart was also good. My low score is because during cash out, the cashier stuck her hand in the bag of buns to see which 3 I chose. They're in a clear produce bag, no need to touch the bread with your unwashed hands. She's handling cash, she shouldn't be touching food like that - very unhygienic.
