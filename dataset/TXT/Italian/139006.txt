jei_nG0uhrvTSXEFL2K9bw Went here for the first time despite some of the reviews and was impressed. I loved the atmosphere (spacious and modern), several tv's ideal for sporting events, etc.. Fair pricing and food was good. Server was pretty irritated with us, although it wasn't busy and we met with another couple (she could've been a little nicer). 
Will definitely return & recommend.
