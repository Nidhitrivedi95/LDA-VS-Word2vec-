0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg My favorite restaurant in Vegas, and my dear friend treated me as farewell meal. Even though I'm leaving Vegas, when I visit I will always return here. This is my 7th time here and I always try something new. This time it was the pasta with octopus and bone marrow,  topped with very delicious bread crumbs! The name of the dish was Gargnelli or something like that, regardless it was exquisite! My friend and I shared the polenta, because even if you come here 100 times you MUST have the polenta with fricasse mushrooms!  That is in my top 5 list for sure, but tonight something was not spot on I must admit, but I still enjoyed it. If you like cocktails the San Remo is the bomb. I have learned to make them at home because I enjoy so much! Luis our server deserves a huge shout out because he was wonderful.  This is another fabulous part of Scarpetta HOSPITALITY is A+++ all other places should send their staff here to learn from the best! I sincerely enjoy this restaurant and have turned many others on to it and they would agree :-)
