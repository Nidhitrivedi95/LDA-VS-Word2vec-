18NP-qL3VIJEBJGpns7aTw Gluten free pizza for me!!! Yay! We order from Barro's pretty frequently now that we know they have gluten free pizza and you can basically build your pizza to your liking. The caveat is that with gluten free, as with alot of places, its more expensive. So much for having an allergy and not going broke! However, I have learned that gluten free pizzas have to be cooked seperately. Hence the reason you get only a 10in pizza instead of being able to order the fat butt American large marge size. I love the crispy crust, also. However, Barro's has been soggy on the crust at times, and we have since found another source for gluten free splurges. And don't expect any coupons or deals on gluten free pizza here..
