u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg After a long day of rock-climbing, we were looking for a place to sip some wine and order a few hors d'oeuvres. According to Yelp, Postino's seemed like a suitable choice.

It didn't take long before we were raving about our choice. Postino's nailed everything. The setting was casual yet sophisticated with outdoor seating heated via lamp. The wine (or mimosa for me) were delicious. The main sell is their bruschetta. For $14, you can choose four different set of toppings out of a list of eight or so. Each one is spectacular from the prosciutto & mascarpone to the salmon and pesto. The butcher block is an equally tantalizing option--quite possibly the best goat cheese around. Finally, if you aren't convinced yet, the happy hour specials are more than a mere $1 wells. Stop by, you won't regret it.
