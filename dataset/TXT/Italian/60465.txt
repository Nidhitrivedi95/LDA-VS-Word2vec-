The clearly famous one is the Mac and cheese pizza, the elbow macaroni noodles somehow stay tender and evenly covered in the white sauce and cheese. 

The spinach pizza had a Alfredo base and came with large portions of Porto 'shrooms drizzled with pesto oil. Not as good as the counterpart but a good option nonetheless.
