iL2-xJ4-eMsJk88PsbivbQ I went on a hunt for the best pizza joint this weekend. This was my third stop. Someone recommended this place to be and I'm glad that I decided to try it. Ample parking. Small little place but just the perfect size. Super friendly staff. We ordered a large cheese pizza and because we checked in on yelp we got 12 free garlic knots. The knots was okay. Nothing too exciting about it. The pizza was thin crust. Just the way I like it. It stays intact throughout the whole meal. A large will feed anywhere from 4 to 5 people. Plenty of leftovers. I will definitely be back
