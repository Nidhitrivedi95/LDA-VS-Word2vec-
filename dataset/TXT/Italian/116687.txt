GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q This place was awesome. just moved to the city and wanted to grab some good food with a buddy, found this place and saw it had good reviews so we gave it a try. 

We told the cashier we hadnt been there before and she tooks us through the menu and was super friendly. she went on to tell us how everything was fresh and store prepared. everything was made to order. 

while we were waiting, the owner came over and gave us samples of different dishes and told us what he recommended. he told us how the company started and where he came from.

the food came out and it was amazing. got the roast beef sandwich and it was easily the freshest roast beef I've ever had. after we ate, the owner showed us how he prepared everything fresh and why he did things the way he does. 

we went for lunch and left with a new favorite spot where we were treated like family. 

Thanks Chris and Joe, we will be back soon!
