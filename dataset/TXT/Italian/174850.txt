The bowl of pasta delivers a great angel hair noodle with delicious sauce and unlimited refills.  Their salads are also to die for.  The best thing on the menu is the pizookie or pizza cookie.  It is totally original to Oreganos and if you have not tried it and you have a sweet tooth, I highly recommend it.  Its a huge thick cookie freshly baked in a special tray topped with three scoops of freezing vanilla ice cream.  Absolute bliss!
