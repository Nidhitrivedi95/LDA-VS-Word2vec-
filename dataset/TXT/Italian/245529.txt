UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Hit up the happy hour 3-6:30! Come early because the happy hour is only in the bar area and outside couches. Anthony and Jeremy were our servers and they were both great. I suggest you have a martini because the mojitos and sangrias aren't very strong, though they are both tasty. Get the burgers if you're hungry, they are big enough for a meal.
