nsw3tlB-hwz4KbPYcuaSww We didn't plan to make a special trip here and didn't have super-high expectations, but on our first visit, Novanta prepared us some really tasty, fresh individual pizzas with quality ingredients.

The atmosphere is pleasant and casual, with unpadded banquets (a bit uncomfortable), metal moderne bistro chairs, and bare wooden tables. 

The restaurant appeared to be very clean, although since kitchen and prep areas are visible to customers at their tables, you must ensure that floors are clean, that you sweep under racks and cabinets every night. 

Also -- staff should be wearing food prep gloves when not prepping food. We saw our chef take out the garbage while still wearing gloves, then returning to the kitchen where he may have kept the same gloves on. 

The staff appeared professional and even courteous on our first visit but on our second visit, our order-taker was suddenly seized by an urge to say something a bit odd and not at all flattering about my appearance. Not a big deal, but I'm just wondering what the upside is of ever going down that path with a paying customer. 

Even so, the food was pretty good this time, as well.

Finally, while Novanta gets an A for effort with regard to the new, large B&W photos on the wall (apparently depicting steps in cheese-making processes) -- but, truth be told, these are NOT appetizing photos. Not at all. I don't wanna look at these vats of gooey, white pus while I'm try to eat. 

We might be back. In the meantime, management should have a sit down with their chatty servers, covering some of the basics of customer service. 

Docked a star for dopey counter-people and huge, gross wall photos.
