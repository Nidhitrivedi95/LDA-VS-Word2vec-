IsN0qEzgAXBjbT3qn6lokA Came during lunch, the first time...and while I was left waiting to be seated a little too long, the visit ended up good enough to warrant a return visit a couple of days later.  Lunch special the first day - Caesar Salad and (thought it could be a potential mistake that turned out VERY good) shrimp pizza.  Wonderful value in a high energy environment (don't come here for quiet).

Second visit was after lunch, but before dinner and this time I sat outside. Again, a little wait before I was noticed waiting to be seated, but that's my only complaint.  The spaghetti and meatballs spoke to me when I looked at the menu and it delivered!  Nice, thick gravy and the meatballs were perfect.  I'm a fan and will be back when next I am in Scottsdale.
