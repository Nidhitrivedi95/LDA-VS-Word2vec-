yiN4aDHeW0kBvZQE1bYTLQ After reading the reviews, my expectations were high and I was . . . disappointed.  This is a restaurant with an identy crisis . . . is it a pizza shop or an Italian restaurant?  

We arrived on time for our reservation to find nowhere to wait for our table.  Patrons have to wait in their cars.  Our table was jammed halfway under a counter on one side and directly in the path of passersby on the other.  The bright florescent lighting and lack of music (basketball on TV instead) did nothing to create ambiance.  Service is slow and confused.

We ordered the antipasta plate and stuffed banana peppers for appetizers.  Aside from the prusciutto, the antipasta was ho-hum.  The peppers were very undercooked and still hard.  The bread is delicious, however, although we had to beg for dipping oil.  The dinner salads were OK, but the house dressing was a little too acidic.  For entrees, we had crabcakes and veal picatta.  Clearly very high quality ingredients were shamefully not well prepared.  The crabcakes (actually balls) were made with too much breading and were overcooked.  The picatta was way too heavy on the lemon and too light on the capers and white wine.  The side pasta was the highlight of the meal.  The pasta was al dente perfection and the tomato sauce was extremely fresh and flavorful.  Everything lacked presentation.  For instance, the picatta was five pieces of veal on a plate with sauce poured over it.  No style, no garnishment, just thrown on a plate.

This was an not an inexpensive meal ($100 for two) and definitely not worth it.  Might try the pizza (take out), but not likely to return for dinner.
