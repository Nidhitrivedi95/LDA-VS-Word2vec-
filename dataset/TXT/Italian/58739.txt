aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA Any Phoenix native will tell you Oregano's is the pizza king of the valley.  

They do thin crust AND deep dish well.  

Many people opt for their famous Pizzookie (ice cream cookie) dessert as well.  

The only downside of this Scottsdale location is that the parking is a female dog.
