ShvyFmkiQAvRL9rS1_DEUg Right one block away from the Schwabstrasse S-bahn stop is this unobtrusive Italian restaurant. The interior is somewhat cheesy, the muzak Italian pop, all in all a funny experience. So do people in the hood think, because to me it appeared to be a popular meeting point for (older) locals.


 The place is run by Italians and the food is accordingly seemingly pretty authentic. The pizza I had was not uebergood but OK, the housewine that went with it was actually better: 7/10. What I really liked was the family-man owner, a friendly chap. A solid 4 stars from me.


 The only real downside was the smoking room door left open all the time, hence rendering the whole concept of having a separate smoking room obsolete, right?
