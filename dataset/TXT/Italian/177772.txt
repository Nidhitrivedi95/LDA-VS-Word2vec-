The ambiance was great. Small, rustic, with faint smell of the roaring wood-fired oven.

The food was very good. My wife and I got margherita and sopressato pizzas, respectively. Both were delicious. (So delicious, in fact, that several days later when we were strapped to find another late meal near our hotel, we carried out the same order.)

Service was good. A bit hands-off due to it being end of the night, but attentive enough.
