2S-NV3clYHDbDEmqT8fuGg What a nice restaurant. The folks made us feel welcomed right from entering. Celebrating a cousins birthday was delightful! Appetizers were yummy. I had spaghetti with meatballs, the sauce was rich and delicious. One of our party had the seafood pasta, he was happy. The endless porkchop was tender with a side of pasta. We closed the place down..but were never rushed or hurried. Thank you for a really nice dinner. Jennifer, our server, was just as sweet as her Mom!
