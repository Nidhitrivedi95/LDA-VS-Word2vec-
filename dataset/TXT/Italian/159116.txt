LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA My wife and I, along with our couple friends, stopped by Maggiano's as we were walking down The Strip. We ordered the Tomato Caprese for an appetizer that was very tasty, The dishes are massive in portion and the food is delicious!. Ordered the mozzarella and it was  delicious. Had the New York Strip Steak and the Veal Porterhouse and split both of them. The NY Strip and  the Veal Porterhouse was absolutely wonderful. It was perfectly grilled and  tender. Remember they  serve nice big portions so please share them.
They always have Sinatra playing in the background.
Two people were roaming playing songs for you.
