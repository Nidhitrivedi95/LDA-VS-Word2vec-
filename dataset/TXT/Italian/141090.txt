jluEI1ZDQDeJlbl-M3YH3Q Despite all the bad reviews I've seen before attending, the experience wasn't as bad as I thought. The view was great, got seated quickly and staff was attentive + friendly. However being seated by the window where the view was just a lake, by night there wasn't much to see so I highly recommend requesting seats near the buildings/ CN tower for a better view. 

In terms of food, the appetizer we ordered was brought out pretty quickly but the entrees did take quite long. Taste was okay. (I enjoyed the garlic bread more) The ricotta cheesecake felt somewhat dry. Overall bill was quite expensive so I don't recommend dining here often. 

Yes the atmosphere and view were pretty great, but the review to an extent lives up to what most people have already commented. Not worth spending that much for a pretty view.
