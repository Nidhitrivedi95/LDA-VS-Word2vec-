ZBSiW9qT95tJ2xL9JnHpWw Excellent food and customer service!!  I ordered a take out delivery right after a bad rain storm.  The credit card machine was down and all I had was $11 on me.  The lady said, "don't worry, I'll just take that".  It was about a $25 order.  We order from them all the time and now I tip the driver extra!  A large cheese take out is only $10.  Great deal and much better than Metro!
