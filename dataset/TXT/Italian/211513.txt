r-wz3rmeNGLBMOqtfXnxog Very authentic Italian food  the special was Sinatra chicken which was excellent, a very mildly sweet tender chicken served with pasta. The lasagna was also very tasty, individual layers of heaven topped with a wonderful light marinara sauce and plenty of mozzarella.. The only dessert they had available was canolli's and they were also very good. The service was exceptional...it is located in a strip mall and the sign is a little hard to see in the corner but don't give up, well worth the search.
