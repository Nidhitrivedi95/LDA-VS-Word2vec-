F5BCXUpQpCRPeFmWnQmSJA I used to come here often a few years back.  About once a week or every other week.   Great food, but very slow service.   I really don't like it when you first walk in, they don't acknowledge you.  No one greets you, they almost try to avoid eye contact.  It's confusing, you don't know if you're supposed to wait or just go grab a table. If you're supposed to wait be seated, well...no one comes to you.  But then...when you do grab a table, you're unsure if they're going to give you service.  I always have to ask for a menu.... and when I'm ready to order.   

Service was slow when we came 2 weeks ago, because there was only one server for our late lunch.  But this made me realized why I stopped coming here.  =/
