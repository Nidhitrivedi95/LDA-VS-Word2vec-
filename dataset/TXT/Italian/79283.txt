D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg I came here for my birthday place seemed okay nothing fancy view was nice you have to get on a elevator to come up...
Well service was okay for some reason our server didn't know our menu when we asked why he said he was coming from another restaurant because NOVE was short staffed 
Our food was bad my husband steak was basically all fat we ended up returning my mashed potato was all butter would not recommended I'm not going again
