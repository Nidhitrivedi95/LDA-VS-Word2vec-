LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Visiting Maggianos was one of the best experiences I had in Vegas.  We found it on Yelp from the glowing reviews and they pretty much all held true.  The service was friendly, the food was ENORMOUS and subtle in flavor.  We vacuumed up everything.  The wine was fine and they served us hot bread rolls with olive oil and balsamic vinegar before our appetizers.  All in all a way classy italian place for EXTREMELY cheap.  I couldn't believe I had such a delicious meal in an elegant environment AND wine for only $20!  Highly recommended.
