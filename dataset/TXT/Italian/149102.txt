Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA My wife and I were married in the High Roller wheel on April 25th and had our 30 guest dinner party at F&B immediately after.  All of the guests, my wife and I could not have been more pleased with the professionalism and courtesy of the staff as well as the delicious and well-portioned food!  Not to mention the wonderful beer and wine selections available.

Working from the group menu we selected the following:

Appetizers:  Meatballs and Garlic Cheese Bread

Pizza:  Bianca, Gianna and The Parma

Pasta:  Bucatini Alla Bolognese

Desert:  Cannoli

Everything was presented in huge portions and all were fresh and tasty.  Some of the favorites among the guests were the meatballs, garlic cheese bread, the Gianna and The Parma pizzas, Bucatini Alla Bolognese and of course the cannolis! (I think that was pretty much all of it!)

During our "scouting" trip to F&B my fiance and I also had the Salsicce and Reggio-Emilia pizzas which were also excellent.  Being mushrooms lovers we especially enjoyed all their mushroom based pies.

My wife and I are pizza addicts, we had a truly great experience and would definitely recommend F&B to anyone for any occasion and we will certainly be back as we frequent Vegas often.
