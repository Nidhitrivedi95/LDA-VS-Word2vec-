We arrived at peak and our service was a tad slow - however once the food was ordered we didn't have to wait long for the risotto balls and mozzarella salad to arrive. Inhaled the food, it was so flavourful and satisfying. The mains were unreal. I had a small bowl of the melt in your mouth gnocchi and the rest of the table had the crispy chicken and stuffed salmon. We were all beyond satisfied and would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants high quality food in an unpretentious atmosphere. The staff are all very friendly and the cost was well below what we assumed it would be for the quality of food. We will be back with all our friends.
