1eyfFwXY0NCS7SMXmgl_Dw I'm surprised this place has not been reviewed yet.  I've been a fan of this place for a couple of years now.  This location is much better than the one that was located at the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace.

The atmosphere is nice, service is friendly and most importantly the food is good.  Definitely a good place to go with friends and family.
