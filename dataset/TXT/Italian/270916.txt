XPgurhZwZgNAwHcrpoe3Zg Niccoli's Deli is another great find! It never ceases to amaze me how people pass by great little mom and pop places like this to go to fast-food chain restaurants.

I happened upon Niccoli's looking for real italian bread. I'm not sure theirs is exactly what I'm looking for, but it's so much better than anything Subway, Quizno's, Port-O-Subs, etc. could put out! 

I ordered the Italian Sub which I thought was pricey at $7.75, but OMG it was well worth it. Enough for two people to share, although since it was so good....you guessed it, I ate it all myself.

Although they're a little far from my office and there are good choices closer to me, I'll definitely be back. If you like neighborhood spots with things in a little bit of disarray with great food served to you by your "Italian Aunt" this is the place for you!

To let you know how well I liked this place, I'm not even done with my sub and I'm writing this review!
