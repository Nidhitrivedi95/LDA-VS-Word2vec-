-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw My boyfriend and I have had excellent food and good service here. Their free flat bread/crackers and their beef carpaccio are amazing. For entrees their chicken limone and their chicken under a brick (marsala) are both excellent. Their whole menu is a delight and I wish I ate more pasta so I could try their carbonara, vodka and salmon dishes. Maybe some day after I run a half marathon...
