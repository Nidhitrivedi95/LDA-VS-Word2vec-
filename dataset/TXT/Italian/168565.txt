MM5Fdfqf87QpTkHIKZNVdg Well....we went back, it was my sons birthday and he chose Spoon & Fork.
Big mistake, we entered and waited for three minutes for someone to greet us!
We were taken to a table and waited 5+ minutes and no one came to serve us, or even look at us. We got up and walked out the door, I asked the guy at the front " what gives"??? no one working tonight??  He said " what's the problem, you have only been here for 5 minutes"
Unbelieveable. Please don't go here!

NEVER NEVER again will I enter this establishment.
