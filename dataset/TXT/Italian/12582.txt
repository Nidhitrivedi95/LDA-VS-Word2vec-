La Fontana is the place for cognoscenti of Italian cuisine, but it's neither snobbish nor expensive. You can eat your fill, with an excellent wine and aperitif, for a very good price. Look out the window to see the Water of Leith raging past - the salmon tastes as though it's freshly caught on the spot.
The restaurant owner, a friend of mine, is an Roman who has lived in Edinburgh for over two decades and knows a lot of chefs and other restaurant owners. The knowledge shows, and Alfredo is an excellent host.
