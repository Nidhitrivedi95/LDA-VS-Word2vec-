2O_b-IAAW7SoPt__RX1Kww I was very disappointed in the buffet. This Italian restaurant did not have pasta in the buffet. The hostess seating everyone was saying there was soup and salad in the buffet but there was no soup.  The service was good.  Price is high for what they had. Better off ordering from the menu
