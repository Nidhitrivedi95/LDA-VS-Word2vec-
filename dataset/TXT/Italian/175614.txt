NFHlMOEyVsbqY_VQNJFafQ The service is slow and leaves you wanting. One of their hosts was taking a personal phone call while he was seating patrons. He was more focused on arranging his evening than helping the customers. The bartender made a comment about being busy but not even 1/4 of the tables were full. The lack of acknowledgement and service was very frustrating. I wish I could rate the food but the lack of service and disorganized management of the restaurant caused me to leave. After waiting over 15 minutes it just was not worth waiting to see what surprises awaited with the food. Simply put, we walked out because there was no service.
