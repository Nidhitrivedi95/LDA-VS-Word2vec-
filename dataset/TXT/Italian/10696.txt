0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg My girlfriends and I came here for a bachelorette party and we had such a great dinner here.  The service was phenomenal and the decor was so classy and glam.  I thoroughly loved my duck foir grois ravioli and the desserts were so gorgeously presented and delicious to boot.  I will be back!
