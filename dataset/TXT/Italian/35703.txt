 I've mostly frequented the lunchtime buffet, and I'm pleased to say it's one of the better buffets I've been to. They keep the pizza coming constantly, and it clearly comes fresh from the oven straight away. The salad bar, too, is refreshed frequently and makes a nice fresh change from all that pizza!


 The staff are friendly but don't hover over you while you eat and are easy to find when you need something.


 If there is a disappointment here, it's in the toilets, which are literally the size of matchsticks. If you're a larger person, you may have trouble fitting in them.
