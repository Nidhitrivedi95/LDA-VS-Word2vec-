VA95qAV2PRH9gtTi2Vfv4Q Great place to have lunch on a sunny day when you're quite hungry. I suggest ordering a pizza because I believe it's their specialty and they're filling and not too expensive. When you're done, hop over to the gelato shop just next door to complete your Italian dining experience!
