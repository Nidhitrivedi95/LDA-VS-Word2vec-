SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg I've attended the Gold Elite Event, as well as several other times for client lunches. 

The dining space is open, bright, modern, fun, but yet welcoming. I think there are ideas that I would take into my own home one day. For example, the chrome shelving at the bar with the white background pops! 
If it is a nice day, it is nice to sit on the Patio, but it's also nice to be casual and sit at the bar. No bad options here. 

For the food - I really like the tapas idea since I'm always one to share and try many dishes during a meal. 
Some of my favorites: 
-Caesar Salad with mini hearts of Romaine
-Caprese, simple but flavorful
-Braised pulled duck meat with polenta - Like butter! 
-Italian Fries - Yas! 

Lago started to serve Brunch and I need to check it out soon!!
