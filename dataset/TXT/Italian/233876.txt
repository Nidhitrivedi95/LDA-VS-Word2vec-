Tp07u-0AOFRfQhtNpAXaQA We usually go for the pizza but this time I wanted to try something different. In ordered the spaghetti and meatball. It was okay the sauce was so watery that it seems like I was eating noddle soup. The meatball had no flavor what so ever. We also order the chicken wings which never disappoint. Always crispy and nice and saucy! The salads were nothing special seems like they just opened a bag of spring mix and put it in a bowl. What saved dinner was the dessert we had. It was a zeppoli sundae! Lots of cinnamon and sugar recover zeppolis topped with ice cream topped with lots of whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. Yes is it delicious
