mJ_ucQ2_3hfTsmCcKb-hgw I don't get it. 

This place gets write-ups and great reviews, and I cannot for the life of me see why.  The food is mediocre.  Some of the combinations on the menu look innovative, but in practice, there is a lot of stuff on the plate that doesn't really add to the flavor of the dishes.  My agnolotti didn't need 7 kinds of vegetables accompanying it when they were all mushy and flavorless.  

The service is worse.  Our waiter was astoundingly condescending and unfriendly, explaining what tapas are and what bolognese sauce is - I guess we look like we think our idea of great Italian food is Pizza Hut -  and slow...it took on average 15 minutes to get each drink, not because the bar was busy but because he was standing at the end of it BS'ing.  The price of the meal was not in line with the amount or quality of the food we received. 
 
In sum, this place is thriving in a downtown area with otherwise great restaurants, when it is on the level of a pretty good place in a far suburb. 

 For exceptional Italian food, walk 150 feet across Market Square and go to Il Pizzaiolo.
