skQ-HIR664Ivp2-A4kOfnA Cucina Tagliani... cute Tuscany style inside with booth and regular table seating. Service was prompt and food came out quickly. If you check in, you get an onion wing combo for free... that's normally $8.99 or something like that. Pretty good deal if you ask me :). Our server brought our waters and garlic bread after taking our drink orders. The garlic bread was tough and chewy - I didn't care for it. 

Appetizers:
Onion/wings combo - 6 naked wings; we asked for the sauces on the side
Zucchini fritters - fried zucchini coins; they were okay - not bad
clams in spicy marinara - the marinara wasn't very spicy but the clams were well prepared; not over or undercooked.

Entree: 
Spicy sausage rigatoni - generous portion and it was tasty however, I was expecting sausage where they came out more like a meat sauce/ground meat. 

Dessert: 
Cannoli - I don't like cannolis... this was ordered for the table but I had to try the filling anyway cuz I'm a growing girl. lol The filling was gritty ---this just solidifies the fact that I am never going to be a true Italian. Oh well - I'm going to stick to being Asian.

With so many options around - I'd probably wouldn't be back unless my Italian parents want to go back.
