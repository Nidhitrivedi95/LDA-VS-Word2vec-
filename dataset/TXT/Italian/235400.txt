TVYJx5iUkLJFiuiXc8rxEQ Anticipating the pizza craving that I always get after happy hour I'm going to pre-order a 10" original deep dish, mushrooms, spinach, and homemade sausage from the nearby Nellos for tonight.

Nellos crust, on any occasion, is one of my favorites. There's something magical about it. The bottom of the crust is just firm and thick enough to withstand the weight of the fresh and flavorful toppings. The combination of the bottom of the crust and the fresh and homemade toppings is just the beginning. 

The edge of the crust steals the show. The light and dark gold color's of the edge draws you in right away. Each bite starts off crunchy to the tooth and ends with a soft and chewy melt in your mouth dough. The crust is a big component on why their pizza is so delicious.

I've only been to their Ahwatukee location but I'm sure the other locations are just as good. Their pizzas and their tiramisu are worth 4-5 stars but everything else on their menu is just ok. But who needs to try anything else when you have crust like they do.
