8yoe08nCUpjDQ56Y9qVPKg My husband and I tried it for the 1st and last time. The owner is abrasive and cheap. We ordered a Chili dog w/no onions and a polish dog that came with mustard and grilled onions. I asked for the grilled onions to be on the side. He said "I'll have to charge you for that". My reply was why, onions come with it? He said I have to charge for the cup. Normally charge .97 I'll only charge you  .25. Really??? How stupid. I laughed at him        My husband informed me the side cups are .02 cents a piece. So we waited patiently for our food. When we open our hot dogs. It was obvious they were not quality hot dogs. Very average. My husband is in the business and told me 7 11 sells better quality hot dogs. Save your time and money
