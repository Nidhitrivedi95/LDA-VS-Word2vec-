Calamari was overdone, tough and greasy and the marinara is out of a can for sure. Side salad was wilted, tomatoes had green cores. Grid iron shrimp was all lemon juice and spaghetti. Veggie calzone was 80% bread, 19% ricotta and 1% tomato and banana peppers. On top of it all, we had a 50% off coupon for second entree that they didn't honor because "the calzone did not come with a salad".  Did not stick around to argue. Don't waste your money.
