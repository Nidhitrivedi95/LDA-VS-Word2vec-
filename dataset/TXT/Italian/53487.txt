A4aU9qMO4yxv4q3dqHZjmw After 4 years I finally found a pizzeria near Streetsboro that my husband enjoyed as much as Angelo's on the westside. Angelos will always be his #1 spot, but he didn't complain about his pizza I picked up from Antonio's. I went here after Googling several pizza joints in or near Streetsboro area. Trust me we've tried them all,  sooner or later he's disappointed by them.

I got his usual small pizza with pepperoni,  extra sausage, lite onions, lite pizza sauce, and well done. I ordered myself 6 pieces of pepperoni rolls w/cheese. My only complaints were his pizza slices were a little small. Thats the only reason why I gave them 3 stars. He liked the crust, he said it had a sweet taste to it.  He said to continue getting his weekly Friday night pizza from here unless I feel like going to Angelos for a treat.
