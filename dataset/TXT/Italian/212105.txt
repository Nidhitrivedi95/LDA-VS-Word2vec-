r38xMabrCDVLhkkiVKBtSQ For a buffet it's not bad. There's variety and all. I would give it a 2.5. It's not as much variety as I hoped For. But there's enough to find something you'll like and stick to. The ice cream was bomb. You're better off at east side marios. You get what you ask for in a buffet. If I would compare it to another buffet such as Mandarin I'll take Mandarin hands down
