WwSwuMu_menj4BzTdrKUdQ Was in the mood for seafood: had the grilled calamari and the portion was very very small- probably the smallest I've ever seen in a restaurant, although it had some very good flavor. Tried the shrimp and scallop melody; which contained questionable tiger shrimp. Once again it was a very small portion and tasted great.

Get some carbs and you'll be satisfied. The risotto was good and was a great portion. Above all the food tasted very fresh and service was also above average.
