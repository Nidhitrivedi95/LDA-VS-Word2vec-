hsDkxhc-_YYsVqAeQBJJjg So everyone remembers Cheers, right? (Google it if you're too young.) This place is Cheers for me. Every single human that works here is friendly, knows the menu back and forth, and can make an intelligent conversation. 

Best friend Emma and I came here on a Saturday night near the end of happy hour in December. Josh's suggestion, and I'm so glad he knew this place. 

The menu is huge. Sandwiches, salads, pasta, and your traditional greasy bar grub. Emma had a hankering for cheese sticks, and I asked Tim, the barkeep, what he suggested for my starter. He said Fried Zucchini. Man, he was speaking my language. After a short wait; everything was steaming in front of us. Emma's cheese sticks were just that, but still melty and delicious. Those zucchini planks though. WOW. Tim said they hand bread them to order, and slice them fresh everyday. You could tell. And their ranch was amazing too. 

Then came the sandwiches. I got the Roast Beef Au Jus. HOLY CATS this sandwich is large. Emma decided on a steak hoagie with lettuce, ranch, and tomato. She loved it. The bread was toasted just right on both sandwiches. Mine was apparently the last roast beef to be served that day, and I'm so glad I got it before they ran out. That sandwich was good. Even hours later as leftovers, Josh said it was great. 

Find this place. Go. Now. Sit at the bar. Get food. Get happy. Tip your bartender. 

Happy Eating!
