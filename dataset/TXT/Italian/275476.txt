yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg Outstanding Italian food in Old Town tonight.  We started with a antipasto and calamari - both good enough to get us excited about the entrees.  The Chicken Parmigiana and Shrimp Scampi were incredible.  I doubt you could go wrong with anything on the menu.

Definitely a leisurely pace and couldn't be farther from a chain restaurant.  Fresh ingredients, an outstanding menu and authentic charm make this a local favorite.
