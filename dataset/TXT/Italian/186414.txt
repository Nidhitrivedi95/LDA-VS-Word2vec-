OqYZdBUgmId7tZMAVpiFCw Came here for lunch. Beautiful space and patio. Right in my neighborhood. I really want to like this place. But it's just a little bit of a meh to me. The menu is extensive but traditional (not innovative) which is fine. And they do their traditional things well. I got the lamb chops and house slalad from the lunch menu while my bf ordered from the summerlicious menu. He's happy with the veal he got but he's in general happy with any cooked meat. He was really happy with the tiramisu. I liked how the lamb chop was cooked too, tender and nicely seasoned. But it comes with string beans and a big piece of carrot. I don't know, what's next, some mashed patato and gravy? Just not my type of thing. The waitor was nice, though. If you are into old school this could be a 4 star but not for me.
