xmWs-su5eB5_57CIw4sqfw A true Italian loving Las Vegas living the American Dream. Riccardo is the owner of this quaint little traditional Italian restaurant. From my experience in Europe, this is almost atypical of the family dining experience in an Italian restaurant. Family recipes, cooked by (or at least supervised by)  the owner represent the ballast and hallmark of this restaurant. Riccardo bought this restaurant (From Gina) in 2012 and brought his third-generation restaurant experience with him from his birth-home of Genoa, Italy on the coast in Northern Italy near the border of Switzerland and France.

This restaurant and the owner of this restaurant are a significant contribution to the Las Vegas culinary scene. This is a unique offering amongst copies of copies. The food is as authentic as the air you breathe, being recipes handed down from generations. 

There are few independent restaurateurs in Las Vegas who can offer such a wonderful dining experience. This is one of them at the very top of the quality scale. A superb wine list accompanies the superb dishes. A white tablecloth red wine pink sauce experience.

Expect to spend $80-100 per person, order appetizers and soup and salad plus the entree and get to-go for the leftovers.

Ask about the "7 day discount".
