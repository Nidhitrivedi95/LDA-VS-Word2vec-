PaH33N0LI-qitEtS9aMKxg A lovely place for warm-up drinks before going to see a stand-up show at the fringe - though it turns out we didn't really need it, he was actually very funny sans alcohol. At least I think he would've been.

We were craving wine and cheese (admittedly I seem to do so for most of my waking hours) so this place halfway up the most amusingly named street in Edinburgh (yes my sense of humour is quite immature sometimes) seemed an ideal spot.

It wasn't too busy on a bank holiday weekend early evening and after a moment of dithering we took a high table for two next to the bar. My friend chose us a Portuguese red wine from their hefty selection that I hadn't heard of before; a great choice on his part as it was really delicious and went down far too easily. As did one of their large mixed sharing platters - I would've liked a bit more cheese relative to the amount of meat though. The salmon and pesto struck me as oddities too - maybe swap those out for some grapes and chutney instead?

The service was very friendly with our waitress happy to have a bit of a chat when she brought the wine over, but otherwise I guess we were quite low-maintenance customers. We ended up spending more than we probably intended on drinks and snacks but then we kinda skipped lunch... ok never mind excuses, sometimes you just need good wine and cheese and this place delivered :)
