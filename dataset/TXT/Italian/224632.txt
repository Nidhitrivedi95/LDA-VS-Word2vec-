sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg I was visiting Pittsburgh for a friend's baby shower and ended up going here for dinner in the evening after the shower. From the photos and reviews of their other restaurants, I expected that the pizza would be delicious, and it looked like it would've been from the photos. The crust was a bit too soft for me and the sauce tasted like it was right out of the can and slopped onto the pizza without any seasoning at all. I don't know what it was about the pizza but it just tasted pretty half ass to me. I can find better thin crust style pizza in the Midwest. Go somewhere else for pizza and don't waste your time or money here!
