YDeN4OHayfKocEo7Tz4jMg Went here for Dinner last night. I'd say it was a 4.5 star meal! Really, really excellent. First off, they make their pastas in house daily. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive. Started off with delicious Italian bread balls with a pungent olive oil and sweet balsamic dip. 

This place has REAL Caesar salad folks. If you don't know that means ANCHOVIES. Not to my taste they did ask if you want them I said no. The salad itself was delicious, with very fresh cherry tomatoes and a tasty dressing....not too heavy. Just right.

The star of the meal easily was the fresh pasta dish. It was a Parmigiana and Black Truffle cream with chicken over fresh Tagliatelle pasta. Just a delicious flavor! Oh truffle where art thou......I mean how does one not love truffle over fresh pasta. Clearly one of the best I've had in Charlotte. Almost as good as Passion8 Bistros mafe by Italian Chef Luca.

Decent wine selection, reasonable prices, and a nicely decorated interior makes this place a great date night option.

Highly recommended! For those of ypu who panned it after they first opened, you should come back and give them a second chance. My palate says they clealy got their act in order!
