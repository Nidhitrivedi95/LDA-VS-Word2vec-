dulgBrNtDCGjYcbQa2E6uA Very very disappointed!! 
We are going a lot to fine restaurants and this was absolutely bad restaurant!!
Not mentioned the steaks are so expensive! And we waited an hour and half!!! To get our food !! 
Too bad Michael on simco- we will not come or recommend on this place ever again!!
