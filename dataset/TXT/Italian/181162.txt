nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Had a 3-course lunch meal here. The portions were so big I could not finish my lunch and had to get the rest to go. I got the calamari for app, pork chop for main and the lindt ice cream. They were all very very good. Nicely presented and tasted amazing. Service was also really good.
