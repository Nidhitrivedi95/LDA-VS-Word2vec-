The restaurant is is nice on the inside, and has a very cordial staff. The service is executed well, although food and beverage knowledge was lacking. The worst part was the food. The Chefs Board appetizer advertised a chef's selection of meats and cheeses, but  turned out to be a grocery store sampler. The beet salad was really a mixed greens salad with a side of depressed beets; hardly enough to name the salad after it. The chopped salad had the same dressing as the beet salad, wasn't chopped, and was poorly constructed. The "Housemade organic pasta" selections sounded excellent, but one dish was worst than the next. The shrimp risotto featured dried shrimp on top of overly-peppered, dried out risotto. The chef's trio of pasta was mediocre. Had to pass on dessert given our experience so far.

I Yelp a lot, but dont write many reviews. I spent two days in the Phoenix area, and looked up all of my dining choices on Yelp. I went to The Arrogant Butcher downtown for dinner(fantastic) and Vovomeena for brunch(also fantastic). This place, however, does not deserve 4 1/2 stars. I wish I had my $90 back.
