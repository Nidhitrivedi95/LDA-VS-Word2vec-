ewEDv_q-K0fV0FepkHB8sA Kind of a weird entrance.  They have two and if you choose the wrong one, you come in at the end of the bar.  We chose wrong but the staff was polite to point us in the right direction.  Seated promptly and the service was great.  Fantastic special drink choices and extensive wine selection.  I ordered the peppercorn filet with mushroom sauce...... Fantastic.  The other dish was 1 1/2 king crab legs.  Everything was cooked to perfection and served in a timely manner.   Many thanks to our hotel staff for their recommendation.  I see why the said we should try it and so should you....!!
