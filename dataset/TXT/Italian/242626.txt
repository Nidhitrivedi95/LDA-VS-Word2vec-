UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w Being from Chicago, you can guess that I'm going to be picky about pizza. I live by myself, so I like to order delivery once a month. I didn't want to review after my first pizza' it was delicious, but a mess. I ordered sausage and green pepper and the sauce was to die for. I also ordered chicken parm done perfectly! I thought this was gonna be my place! So I ordered again last night, just pizza and wings and, once again, the pizza was a mess. All the ingredients had slid to the side and cheese was resealed. You know the look. The crust is so good, the sauce perfect, but they can't get it to your house cut and toppings spread all over. I don't know what the problem is but when you receive your pizza like that, you can't get that perfect, cheesy first bite. And of course, the left overs are a mess, had to tear the pizza in where I thought the slice was. Disappointed, this would have been my new pizza home.
UPDATED REVIEW: The owner, Jason, was concerned that I had received my pizza in poor condition. I reordered today, and my pizza was PERFECT! Delicious, meaty, perfect crust! Thank you for being so concerned about your customers, I really appreciate that. By the way, I also ordered the Chicken Parm, and there is something so addicting about that sauce, it's my favorite!
