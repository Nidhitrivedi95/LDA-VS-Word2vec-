E_4qAaFMthmlF4hjLjtolg Just had a company outing here for about 20 people. They blocked off an area of the restaurant for us and really took care of us. Home-style warm decor and very attentive service. But the best part... The FOOD was incredible! Totally didn't expect this quality of food. I'm talking top notch 5 star ingredients prepared by a chef that knows what they're doing, seasoned and cooked to perfection. I don't live in the area but when back in Toronto and planning a corporate dinner, will definitely be back!!!
