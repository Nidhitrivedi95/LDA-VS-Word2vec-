nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg I came here with the fam for dinner before my sister and brother in law headed out of town for the holidays. It's a solid place for Italian food with decent wine list. 

I had the Saltinbocca, which was pretty good. My mom got the lamb and gave me a piece since she couldn't finish. We split a few tiramisu for dessert and they were delicious. Service was great.
