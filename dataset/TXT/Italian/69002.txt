bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg Such a wonderful little restaurant in Northwest Vegas! Great ambiance, great food, great service.  Although it's an Italian restaurant, have the empanadas appetizer...you won't regret!  For dinner we had the seafood ravioli and chicken/eggplant special, delicious.  To add to the experience it's a family owned place, owner is full of gracious personality.
