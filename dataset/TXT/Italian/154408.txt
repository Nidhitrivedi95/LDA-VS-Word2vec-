My second stop for Summerlicious 2013 took me to this Italian restaurant, after looking at the prix fixe menu with the combination of looking at reviews here. My party of five arrived at 6:30pm and were seated immediately and served cold water.

I ordered the following from the prix fixe menu:
- Caesar salad
- Penne Cacciatore
- Cheese cake

The menu also came with flatbread as a starter, in which I did the usual Italian way of eating by dipping some extra virgin olive oil. Mmm, not too hard of a texture unlike Hot House Café yesterday!

The caesar salad was nothing special, and I was satisfied enough with it. Everyone else ordered the baby argula salad and seemed to love it...maybe I should've ordered that instead. The penne cacciatore was picture perfect, with the exception of the rose sauce, which I felt was slightly too watered for me as there wasn't that pungent taste that came after having the pasta. Finally, the cheesecake was very good, again I was satisfied enough with it to have no complaints about it.

My relatives enjoyed the salmon filet (fish of the day), veal marsala, and veal chop, and were all satisfied, with the exception of one who argued the veal chop was too dry for her. I also had a small sample of the tartuffo ice cream, which had quite unique of a taste, however I didn't like the red (strawberry?) portion very much.

Service was fantastic, and to my huge surprise, very quick for an Italian restaurant. We were out the door by 7:35pm, and I had my car parked till 8:30pm!

I didn't have a look at their actual menu to see if it's as much of a value as this. If so, I definitely recommend this place for people living around the area.
