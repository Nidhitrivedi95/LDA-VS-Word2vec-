They stared at the counter any time they came near me and I watched as no less than ten beverages were prepared for other customers, all while I was ignored.

I began to look around for a line or designated "ordering spot", but found none. I looked back at both men, looked around again and watched as someone standing right next to me, who'd come in after me, had their order taken.

I reached the conclusion that for some reason, I was persona non grata. I have literally never been treated this way in my life. I'm not sure why I was deemed not cool enough to give them my money, but luckily for me there are plenty of similar/better places nearby, so I won't have to find out.
