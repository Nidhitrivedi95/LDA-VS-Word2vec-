BaVtTt9pBoI8rrN35tsj_g I was very disappointed this evening. The service was very slow. My tour of Italy combo look like the lunch lady had slapped together with the large spoon at the cafeteria. My guest ordered the same except substituted an entree. Our server told us there would be no difference in charge. He was incorrect, it was actually an $8 increase in the bill. Instead of haggling with the manager we decided to not dispute the bill because we were there long enough already. In the future I would highly recommend that your servers get acquainted with menu substitutions. I will probably more than likely not return to this Olive Garden.
