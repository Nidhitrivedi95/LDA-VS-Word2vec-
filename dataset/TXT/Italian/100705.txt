We were seated right away and handed menus as soon as we sat down. Ordered chicken (consists of 2 chicken tenders) and waffles ($15). Pablo was our efficient and friendly server. We were in and out of there in under an hour. Water and coffee were refilled timely.  Music was a little too loud for a Sunday morning but I guess that's the vibe they want to achieve.
