zra20XPGVL9P3i5hMoKjig Nonna Urban Eatery is a small Mom & Pop restaurant that offers a daily changing global menu.  On the day I went it was mostly Italian with home made hand crafted pastas and they offered several Asian Dishes with raw fish. The dining room is mostly classic looking but very open and bright during the day. Dinners can view the open kitchen.

If the Cucumber Lollipops are on the menu YOU MUST GET THEM! because they are AMAZING! They are made of raw Tuna, Yellow Tail, Salmon and a little avocado wrapped in the thinnest cucumber on a stick shaped like a lollipop. They taste incredible! A small pile of peppery greens dressed in a zippy ginger dressing concludes the plate and it goes together like magic. Bravo! One of the best things I tried all year!

We also shared the House Made Campanelle Pasta with Salmon and Asparagus. The pasta was made nice, the sauce was lemony...asparagus was fresh....fish had a nice sear.....leek was a nice touch..... but I wouldn't get this plate again because the fish tasted slightly fishy but not bad. I also thought it needed one more flavor...maybe just a pinch of saffron or just a fresh herb.

Our server was very friendly and helpful and even suggested a local museum to visit.

It's possible to pass this restaurant by even being on Main St. because it's located in a tiny Micro Mall of a few shops that are in a cluster near the end of the street.

You come here for a unique menu that you won't find anywhere else!

Tons of Potential Here! Because the Cucumber Lollipops really rocked!
