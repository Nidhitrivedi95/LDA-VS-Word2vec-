oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw We had dinner at Lupo the day we arrived in Vegas.  Our experience was not very pleasant.  The hostess tried to seat us in the doorway at first, but we rejected it and were finally seated in a decent place.  The service was not good - our waiter kept apologizing for the long waits - including our drinks and food.  The food was fair.  We ordered risotto and a salmon entree.  The risotto was crunchy and the portion was small for the price.  I ordered a beer and it came in a glass that was chipped and cracked.  We had show tickets at the Mirage and were'nt able to eat without rushing.  We loved staying at the Mandalay Bay but wouldn't go to Lupo's if we returned.
