Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A It's a buffet but definitely not a high end buffet. 

Full of fried foods to fill you up, but there is a selection of fresh fruits too.

Dinner buffet boasts a variety of seafood. Snow crab and shrimp to be exact for a price around $25/person. Let it be known that there is NO snow crab in sight!  I mean it's something to boast if you're serving king crab legs and lobster...but snow crab legs...come on now!  Ultimate fail!

And my crab leg craving goes unsatisfied. 

Sadness!
