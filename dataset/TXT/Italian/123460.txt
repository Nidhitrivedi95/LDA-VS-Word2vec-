They start you off with fresh baked Italian bread and a garlic butter which is quite good. For the entree I had the spaghetti with clam sauce with I side of their sautéed mushrooms. The dish by itself was ok but when I added the mushrooms it jumped to wonderful. They end the meal with ice cream or Spumante which is good but I was so full I didn't eat much. I also had a cup of coffee which was a good cup of restaurant coffee.
