kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ I love Central Bistro! The ambiance is relaxing and never fails to boost my mood. It is an open environment where I can watch the game and listen to live music--whilst taking my taste buds on a wild ride. When the music isn't live, it is usually nostalgic '90s alternative, which adds to the aesthetically-pleasing decor and layout of the place.

Though I have only eaten there for brunch, I hear from my colleagues that the dinner is amazing. When brunching there, always get the donuts as an appetizer--you won't regret it. The steak and eggs and the chicken and waffles are also food of the gods.

Always swimming the extra mile, the service is immaculate! There is this super cool, skinny, blond dude that is really good at waiting on his section and makes everyone smile. This one waitress was also fantastically humorous. Class. That's all I can say. 

Tl; dr: Excellent servers, fabulous music, great brunch.
