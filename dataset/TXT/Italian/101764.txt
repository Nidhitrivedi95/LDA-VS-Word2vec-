fdX_eu-dCaKsDaK_itNIzQ My son and I went last night before seeing the Christmas Carol at the Ovature center. The location is great for a pre-show meal being right across the street. The service was fine but could have been more prompt, especially near the end.

I had the cream of spinach soup which was actually really tasty. The bread they must make themselves and was a highlight of the meal. It was warm and went perfectly with the olive oil/balsamic they put on a plate.

My son had the kids butter noodles which of course he enjoyed and I had a pepperoni pizza. It was very flavorful.

I like the quaint ambiance and we enjoyed our table location upstairs with a view of state street.

I'm tempted to give it four but it is not quite there yet. I would potentially go back if I had an engagement downtown and the prices were extremely reasonable.
