u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Service here is snooty.  We came on a busy night but the hostess was a bit rude and told us there were no tables despite being able to see many open tables.  If I was Johnny Depp I bet there was a table for me.  There are other places that actually want your money.  Skip this one.
