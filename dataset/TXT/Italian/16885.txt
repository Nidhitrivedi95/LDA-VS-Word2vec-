22so15K1aqikL9FHt37CSQ I love dp dough! I have a craving for it often. The calzones are great, filled to the brim with cheese and toppings, and served with a nice, slightly spicy marinara. I knocked 1 star off for delivery because whenever I order delivery my calzone is soggy and lukewarm by the time I get it. I recommend you pick it up from the restaurant and eat it while its fresh and hot! My favorite is the Roni Zoni, the combination of mozzarella and ricotta cheeses is divine!
