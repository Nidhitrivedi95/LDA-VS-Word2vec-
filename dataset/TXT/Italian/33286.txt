It included not so fresh fried halibut with pasty crab stuff on top, over done broiled asparagus and tomato, shrimp (good sized), rice (not Risotto they claim it to be) in a champagne sauce with skin on it that had to be peeled back. Disgusting and sent it back. Waited 15 minutes for wine to finally come out. We had a $10 coupon that stated for use on any day and the server refused to honor it or even so much as offer to ask management about it. For close to $100 for 3 people (one just ordered a bowl of soup), this was the worst food and waste of money.
