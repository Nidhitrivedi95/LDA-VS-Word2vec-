I wouldn't recommend this place if you are Miller Lite (or similar)- cost is the same as their craft beers.  Their pizza dough is great, toppings are fresh, wide selection. Only thing is, I'm a sauce person. I like a lot of red sauce on my pizza. They are not heavy with their sauce. Random- their homemade potato chips are great. Also, consider stopping by for trivia Wednesday nights- low tech, but fun.
