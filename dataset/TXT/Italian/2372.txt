-PUPEpMsjBjk_rX5lFaWng Food is always delicious here! The staff were all great today too - helpful, friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable. I LOVED that the bacon wrapped dates were on happy hour because my husband won't eat them so it's nice to get a smaller plate of them. The only thing that disappointed us was when we realized the bottle of wine we ordered was 3X the retail - I thought 2X was more the industry norm. But maybe this is because of the minimum wage crap.
