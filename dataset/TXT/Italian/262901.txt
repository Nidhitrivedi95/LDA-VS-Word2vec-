We experienced less than mediocre service, my food came out way late - about 15 minutes after the other 5 people at our table received their orders, we had to ask for drink refills at one point, we also had to ask twice to bring out a dipping sauce to go with our tables meals. Once for the sauce, a second time ten minutes later to remind them that it never came to our table. A mistake like burning our pizza and taking an extra 15 + minutes should warrant the floor manager to come to our table and apologize at the very least, which didn't happen.

The restaurant is setup more like a sports bar than a sit down and enjoy your meal type of pizza spot. Inside is pretty loud, difficult to hear, and hard to hold a conversation due to the distracting TV's playing sports located in every direction. I understand I wasn't in downtown phoenix and perhaps the local clientele expects this sort of place when dining out for pizza, but it surely wasn't for me and I don't plan on visiting again. 

After all the shortcomings of the service, the kitchen mistake, the management, and the restaurant itself, I did actually enjoy the pizza. It was reasonably tasty, but not worth the $15+ price tag for a personal sized pizza, especially when your dining experience is super lame and uninspiring.

Humble Pie, I know you can do way better than this - I know I'm not the only person who writes of crappy experiences at this place. Apparently you've been giving bad service since you opened doors and haven't taken the hint yet.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, might I suggest delivery or perhaps Digiorno?
