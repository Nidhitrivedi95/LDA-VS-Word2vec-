FdiZDOs8LbSnBpA_e5R5HQ Fellow Michigander and Jets enthusiast and they nailed everything down to the ranch dressing. Look no further than the deep dish style pizza. Not like a Chicago deep dish that's all dough, it's a light and crispy crust that literally has no other comparison. Haven't had a good slice of pizza in Arizona for 3 years until today. Thanks Jets! You taste just like home.
