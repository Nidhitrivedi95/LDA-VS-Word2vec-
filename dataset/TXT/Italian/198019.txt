pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Quaint little pizza parlor with old charm character. Space is small and accommodates parties of 1 - 4 quite comfortably not too sure if I would recommend for larger groups. Located just a block away from Chase Field, Mr W and I decided to partake in some wood fired pizza and wine before the game. Meetings had us running behind so we missed the first two innings of the game but I think that was a benefit for us because we were able to grab a seat at the bar without the wait. We had a perfect view of the brick oven and the courtyard of the square. 
We shared the tomato, mozzarella and basil salad. The tomatoes were firm and sweet and the basil was garden fresh. The olive oil is what really brought all the Flavors together on this simple but delicious dish. We also shared a bottle of 2011 Toscana recommended by the bartender whose name, sadly, has slipped my mind. We ordered the white sauce pizza ( Biancoverde ) and it was really good! Garlic flavored and topped with arugula. We had asked to add mushrooms and prosciutto both did not make it on to our pizza however, the prosciutto was brought to us on the side and it was deli delicious! 
We were so deep into conversation and even offered a glass of wine from our bottle to the bartender ( he happily joined us in and out of moments as he worked ) that we hated having to leave but our seat for the game were calling. 
I would say this dining experience was quite lovely, but I would have loved to try the pizza with the mushrooms and prosciutto incorporated. Also, prices are on the higher side so I am having to give Bianco's a 4 star "better than most" wood fired review!
