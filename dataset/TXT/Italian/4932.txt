_MW_OR1UgzWoxzbhcOsIHA Cute Mom & Pop joint.  The owner was walking around to tables chatting w/ the regulars.  The waitress wasn't overly friendly, but did a nice job checking in on us.

First the negatives:
1. The cleaning solution (I overheard the waitress tell a guest it was Lysol) was soooo fragrant that I almost gagged on it.  Again, I'm a fragrant intolerant so I'm sensitive to it, but seriously, had I been eating I'm sure I would have tasted Lysol
2. When I order a 'za with basil on it, I expect basil...big fat leaves of basil, not flakes dusted from your mom's old spice jar.  I feel like this is a bit of false advertising.
3. No sauce on another 'za.  Maybe I didn't read the description, but if you aren't going to put "normal" sauce on the 'za, say what you're putting on (or not).  
4.  Expensive.  I get that you have to cover your food costs....but seriously for two almost "personal pan" size pizzas it was $25!?  Ugh.
5. The parking lot sucks.

The Positives:
1. Cute.
2. Clean.
3. Cute kitchen guys (yes, they all told me goodbye as I left)

Would I go back?  Maybe.... but maybe not.
Disappointing, especially since I'd read such good reviews.
