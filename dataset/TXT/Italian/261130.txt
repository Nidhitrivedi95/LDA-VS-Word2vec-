WPV0ucYjnb2HOrNxSopv6A Legitimately good pizza. (As said by a couple of New Yorkers, for what it's worth. Not to be flauntin' pizza cred, but we know what we're talking about on this one!) We generally eat here at least 4-5 times a month, and the pizza is always our go-to. The pasta dishes tend to be so-so - I've ordered the spinach portabella pasta on multiple occasions and it unfortunately always misses the mark for me...really oily sauce that separates almost immediately, so 5 minutes you're eating noodles in a heavy, oily soup. But the vodka penne is good.Calzones are pretty solid too!
