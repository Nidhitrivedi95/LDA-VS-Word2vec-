RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ We are having a large meeting at the Hilton resort where this restaraunt is located in March 2013, and were considering the restaraunt for one of the group dinners, so had a complimentary meal here (dinner) during an event planning trip in January 2013. The food was excellent, very tasty and you cannot beat the view. I also enjoyed the cocktails, and a member of our group had wine, and had eaten at the restaraunt before and enjoyed the wine selection on that visit as well. I didn't care for the restaraunt manager or wait staff very much -- stiff and absoluely NO sense of humor, but I cannot fault delilvery or the ability to answer questions, the no sense of humor thing was a personality thing and I probably shouldn't be trying to make jokes with every waiter I come accross anyway. But I would definitely dine here again, it was a wonderful experience.
