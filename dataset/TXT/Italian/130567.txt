Iam7tYWhssw_rscSBkeRIQ The pizza here is good. 

I don't know if I would say that it is the best pizza in Pittsburgh though as others claim. It is on par with most New York style home neighborhood pizzerias. 

If you are in the area, stop by and try a slice and be your own judge. 

We will definitely stop back through whenever in the area. Don't think it will be an out of the way destination though with other options around our neighborhood. 

This place can get pretty crowded and parking is very sparse so make sure you have someone that can run in and pay while you either drive around or wait.
