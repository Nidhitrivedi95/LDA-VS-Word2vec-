RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q Add me to the Maria fan club. Seriously, I love that chick. Hand to God, if I ever had to fight in a trench, in a war, the first person I would want on my team would be Maria. She's a doll but she might kick your ass. "For sure!"

We started with the spaghetti calzone. Yeah, you heard me. They take spaghetti and they stuff it in a calzone. In. A. Cal. Zone. It reminded me of when I was a kind and we would make spaghetti sandwiches. No, I'm not kidding about that. It was delicious and I have dreams about it. They have those really thin metal forks that only pizza places have and mine kept bending the dough was so nice and thick and good. 

The sauce for the pizza and the calzone is a happy thing. Tangy but sweet, as well. I could eat with we a well bent spoon. The pizza was good but we only got a small due to the calzone. Next time, I want to go with more people and get a bigger one so I can love on the cheese and toppings.

Lastly, the sodas come with that really awesome crushed ice that looks like jagged little pellets. To me, that's a clear sign you're in a good pizza joint.
