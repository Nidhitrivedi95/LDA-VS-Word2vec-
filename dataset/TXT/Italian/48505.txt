97-_E9JpqbUmaUg33-SOyQ If I could give this location NO STARS I would. First time ordering from this particular Pizza Hut. Let me just say the large pepperoni was every bit of disgusting!!!! I've had better pizza from Little Caesars & their pizzas are ONLY $5. Now the boneless wings were just as bad. I ordered them mild &  when I opened them the sauce was so strong with a tart smell I couldn't even eat them. 

The pizza for sure was NOT FRESH. Even the marinara sauce on the pizza looked super old. I can't believe that a well known pizza place would have the nerve to deliver such a disgusting piece of sh*** like this to my door step.

Which cost me $30 dollars between the pizza, wings & tip. 

I will NEVER order from this atrocious a** PIZZA DUMP EVER AGAIN. 

I think Little Caesars is definitely giving this place a run for they money. With $30 I could have gotten a way better quality pizza then the sh** I just received from PIZZA DUMP. 

Oh and when I call & complain they offer me a credit or a new pizza.  I don't want your credit, however I did accept the new pizza which I will not eat. 

Because what I really wanted to do is drive to this location & throw that nasty a** pizza & wings right in their Fn faces. 

I could have wasted my money on better things.
