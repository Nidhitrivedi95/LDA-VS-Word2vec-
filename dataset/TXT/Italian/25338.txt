The tomato basil meatball soup is incredible.  And my main, the veal chop with red wine and mushroom sauce was perfect.  Pan fried with a slight crust and very tender.  Wow.  Very good.

Our server was very cool, but that probably has more to do with my gorgeous wife.

Now if they could just provide a tartuffo for dessert.
