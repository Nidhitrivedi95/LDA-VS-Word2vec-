The oil was misleading though as the medium was hotter than the "hot"; great touch.  The meat lasagna was a great combination of flavours.  Apparently the unique taste was a touch of pumpkin (wtf? I'm glad i didn't know). If dessert always tasted like the sticky toffee i would opt for dessert more often.
