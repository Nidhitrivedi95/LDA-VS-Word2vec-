YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg The service (waitress) was terrible! Some of the worst service I have received at a restaurant to date. Especially for this level of dining.

The atmosphere is great. A nice place to unwind and have a drink at the bar. The food is good. The menu is constantly updated. Each time I have been here I have had something new. I have been here many times and the food/atmosphere has always been great. 
However, during my this last visit on January 6th, things have changed. The atmosphere was there. The food was good. The service- the waitress... not so good. In fact, her hospitality and behavior was quite terrible and I was definitely not pleased. I was entertaining co-workers from out of town and was embarrassed that I had suggested Panevino.
Issues; slow service, did ask if we wanted to order drinks, tried to talk us out of ordering an appetizer, did not offer parmesan cheese for ravioli dish that obviously needed it, tomato soup was warm at best, offered cracked pepper and there were no salads on the table. Order 2 Peronis and she delivered 1 (had 2 on the tray). Just completely clueless.
I do have to say that the manager did show great concern for the issue when I brought it to his attention. He offered to provide desert or wine to correct the issue, but I was up front and let him know that I was concerned for the service and was not looking for freebies. He did end up removing some items from the final bill.
In closing, I will eat here again because I believe that everyone should get a second chance. I just hope that I do not have a similar experience, because there will not be a third time.
