biFv9mXsP0V4omBUy1Z-MA I have ordered both carryout and delivery from this Pizza Hut location and will continue to do so because customer service is excellent and they always have some pretty good deals going on. 

The employees are very friendly, in-person and over the phone. They don't mind going over all specials that they have and they always apologize if the pick up line gets long. Also, the food is always hot, fresh, and ready or delivered on time. It may not be the best pizza out there, but I think its still pretty good for the price.

Here are some of the deals they have right now:
-Mondays: 2 medium pizzas (up to 3 toppings) for $6 each
-Tuesdays: $10 pastas
-Wednesdays: wings are $.50 each
-Carryout special: $10 large pizzas (up to 3 toppings). I always take advantage of this one!
(and no, I do not work there, haha!)

They are also located near Yogoyum, my favorite frozen yogurt place!
