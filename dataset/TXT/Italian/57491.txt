anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg My daughter & I dined here on June 25th. It started out rocky, as we waited for our table & there was a woman with 2 small boys in the waiting area & the little one was screaming the whole time. Why someone would come to this restaurant @ 7:30pm with 2 small children is beyond me. One was maybe 3 the other under 2. All we kept thinking was please don't put them next to us. Well, sure enough, just after we ordered they sat next to us. They were out of control...I mean, even for an Olive Garden, they were out of control. Right as I was about to go up front to the maitre D a young man came to our table and said he was so sorry about the people next to us & he wanted to buy us a drink and put us at a different table. His name was Evan & he was the owner. I couldn't believe it. I've never had anyone do that before. Really a class act. Our dinner & evening was saved due to the owner taking care of us. Dinner was amazing,, but I would go back just because of how the owner handled our situation.. Thank you, again, Evan. You are a first rate owner that takes care of business.
