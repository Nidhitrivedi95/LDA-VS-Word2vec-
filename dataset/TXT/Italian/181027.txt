nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Food was excellent.  They mainly offer a fixed price but for groups, they offer shared dishes. On this night, my friend and I chose the fixed price menu.  Each of us had different choices and shares some items. The decor is nothing special but the food and service made up for it.

For appetizers, some of us picked quail while others chose soup or calamari.  I tried the quail and it was delicious. It was a great start to the evening.

Most of us chose the pasta, pork chop or liver as the main dish. I chose the blue crab as I was thinking it was different but it was a messy experience.  The pork chop was actually nicely done and the portions were generous.  

Dessert was a choice between mango panna cotta or strawberry sorbet.  The panna cotta was refreshing and I quickly ate all of it.  Overall, the experience was excellent.  Too bad they don't change the menu often.  For $25, it is absolutely a great deal.  I will be back once they announce a new menu but definitely worth checking out as the food / decor give a homey feeling.
