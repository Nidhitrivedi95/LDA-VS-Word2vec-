AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw Stopped in for a quick bite and beer. First time in. Pretty dead at 5pm on Monday, but hey, it's Monday. Always slow in the industry on Monday. Service was great and the first and for most think I observe when I walk into a new place. Ordered the BP Pineapple Sculpin and the smoked wings. Delicious! Wifie had the Brussels sprouts and  fried chicken skins (covered in honey). Sprouts I liked; skins are not our jam. Good vibes though and some cool overhead music. Nice decor in the bar too. It's also a full bar for those hardcore shot drinking drunks. I'll be back at some point for dinner. In the meantime, this crew deserves a 5*
