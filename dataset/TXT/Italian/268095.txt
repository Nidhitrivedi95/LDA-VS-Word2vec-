XF4w6wG1JOvfKZlQcxiWgQ Went here for the first time and the customer service was fantastic! The owner was very nice and approachable. I had the smoky pollo pizza and added artichokes and it was amazing! I will definitely be going back! 

The minor downsides - not a lot of seating and because of the 1000 degree open oven it was pretty hot inside. Luckily I work across the street so i will definitely be going back for more but to go
