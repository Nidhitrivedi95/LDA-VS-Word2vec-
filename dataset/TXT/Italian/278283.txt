YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg Absolutely wonderful! Wish I could give 10 stars! Mark (the assistant GM) and Amanda (our server) were top notch...You can tell the staff wants you to have a great experience. Very attentive to detail. Mark's recommendations on drinks and food were awesome! Home made bread, pasta, meat cooked to perfection....If you are looking for a mouth watering meal and nice ambiance, this is it. Very fun looking out onto the runway, (you don't hear the planes). Make a reservation or go there now...You won't be disappointed!
