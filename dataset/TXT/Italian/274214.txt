y0QzKWNVoXCbZpk6uhEgGA We had to try this place because it looks nice and seems to be held in high esteem among the locals.

We've ordered from here 3 separate times. First, it was a veal sandwich.. probably the most tasteless I've ever had. Then, mushroom, pepperoni and green pepper pizza... which wasn't bad. 

But the last time was the clincher. We ordered rigatoni with italian sausage. The pasta was probably the worst I've tried.. just bland.. but the sausage wasn't sliced, and it was really thick... the thing looked like .... let's just say ... unappealing. I could not bring myself to eat it any more than a single bite.
