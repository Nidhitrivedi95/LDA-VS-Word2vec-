w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q First off, I have to remind myself that this is a restaurant in a hotel on the strip. That said, it is a nice restaurant. Our waitress was rather rude and unaccommodating, but the man busing our table was really kind, quick, and helpful. We ordered the lobster and were pleased. The lobster and sides were cooked well. However, I'd have to admit, the bread basket was my favorite part of the meal. Our visit wasn't anything special, but it was nice.
