r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA Stopped in here on our way to Luminarias in the Garden at the Desert Botanical Garden. We had the grilled portobello sandwich and the caprese salad, both delicious. It was also happy hour, so we both got glasses of wine for $4! They have a great selection of pastas (like pappardelle, which I can never find!) and sauces. They even have muffuletta filling!! Friendly staff and plenty of seating on this Friday night at 6 pm!
