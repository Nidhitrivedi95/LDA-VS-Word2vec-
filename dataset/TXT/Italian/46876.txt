8un5h1h8NXs0hzeVraaPbA Before I moved to Arizona I did go to Olive Garden. Please don't tell any of the Italian restaurants that I respect. My only defense is a $25 gift card, can't let that go to waist.

1st Note:  When I walked in I did realize how much I miss the bread sticks and the salad served at the table is always a great way to start a meal.

This might be my third chain review but the service deserves to be yelped about.  My server started off with an free offer for a tasting of a glass of red wine.  I said "why not"
After dinner a manager offered a complimentary small dessert  with  choice between strawberry or lemon tart.

What an experience, I actually want to go back to this Olive garden. 

Also joan B. with one review and one star, I'm a minority, I even walked in a half hour before close and everyone seemed please greet us at restaurant.  Maybe they have shaped up their policies.  

This place deserved the very hard to give corporate 4 star and sets this place a little higher than the other Olive Gardens, Bottom line the service was so hospitable I had to be the fourth person to yelp about it.
