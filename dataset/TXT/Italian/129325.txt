i53HvxUdQEMllZ1XmpjjyA I ordered one small pizza and one medium pizza directly off their menu with no special additions.  That is not what was delivered to my door.  This was late on a monday night too. Not like some busy weekend rush or dinner hour to get in the way.  

The real frustration came in trying to fix the order. After calling the place three times, I was put on hold, hung up on, unable to talk to the same person twice, major communication issues, and not once offered an apology or way to fix this.  They really need to work on the customer service. Over two hours later I was left with two small pizzas totaling $ 35.

While I can't vouch for the actual taste of the pizza since I ended up with plain cheese, the service sucks.  This place just lost my business. Not worth the hassle.  I wish the best of luck to the rest of you!
