eVv6cnwhabK8ig5Di2hXQQ Normally a great experience, last night was an exception. A suggestion would be to cross train the bartenders to wait tables. I counted literally 4 bartenders for 3 people, 2 hostesses for a slower summer night and 1 waitress for 6 tables. We had a hard time getting the waitress' attention, no water and wanted a second beer - got nothing. Food was good though. Loyal customer so Ill be back & will hope for better service next time.
