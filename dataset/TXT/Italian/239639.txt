u9R0_pvEkl7QGPJYH3j1sg Great place for lunch! It's a non-descript restaurant - looks like a diner when you walk in, but the place is always packed. The food is delicious and reasonable! The fried mozzarella is huge like a brick! I've had the bruschetta and calamari - both equally great!  The portions are huge so don't load up on the appetizers like I usually do and then end up ordering a salad! Service is usually spot-on - I have never had any problems here. I find it is consistently good - so if you are an Italian food fan - you will love this place!
