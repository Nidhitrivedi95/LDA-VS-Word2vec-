D2nfOrnJ2OBlX_428sKyMg I tried it for the first time yesterday and ordered the Buff Japanese Pan w Marinated Steak.  The nutrition facts for the options are pretty scary so I figured something named Buff would be a safer option.  It was actually pretty good.  

The highlight of the experience was the amazing soda machine.  (I'm from the South... I say soda and you say pop).  It blew my mind.  I hope to win the lottery and purchase one so I can jerryrig it into a wine dispensary for my living room.
