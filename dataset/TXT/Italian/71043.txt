C4sVRSWeWuXo0OtnXewsjQ I don't see what is so good about this place.  The Penne and chicken parmigano is good but the portions are very small for what you pay.   While the chicken is an alright amount, the amount of pasta is really minuscule.

It is very oily, when you reheat it the next day it's drenched in oil.

Might as well go to East Side Marios it's about the same and you get bread and unlimited salad.
