ARWLV46iIa3Dvt1y8-SPpA My Husband and I took my Grandma to Ristorante Giuseppe this evening.  Since it was a weeknight after a storm there was practically no one there, which was fine by me since I already knew this place could get crowded (based on other yelp reviews).  My Husband and I shared the one of the pasta specials, which was baked ziti with all sorts of meats.  It was creamy, cheesy, meat filled goodness.  We also had a salad and garlic bread, which was also unique since it had a kick.  My Grandma had the pork parmigiana, she loved it.

Overall, this is a small Mom and Pop shop and it was VERY good.  It's always nice to support great places like Ristorante Giuseppe that are family owned and have great authentic food!
