N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ I just came here, last time I was here in July I had a gluten free pizza that was great. Today the price was hyped up! I ordered the same gluten and a supreme. This time the pizza was awful! I highly doubt coming back after this. The pizza was so bad it would tear apart. As the dough was very soft. Same happened with the gluten free. And was also very oily, yuck. Something has changed and I'm not happy as I once was. I left a 4-5 star last time I was here. Also ordered the bread knots and they must have been dunked In butter, the paper bag was soaked and was dripping all over my car seats. Worse experience In pizza ever. These three items cost $55 all around terrible!
