6kD0vTLj3oZJm7kXRSvfKw Place was full, but we got in without much of a wait.  Ordered the calamari to start--it was honestly incredible, especially for the price. Salads were okay--the house dressing made it. Bread was good.  We went with the basics for entrees--veal parmigiana and chicken marsala. Fantastic, both of them.  I'm picky about the way my pasta is cooked, and they did it perfectly. Too full for dessert, so can't comment.  We'll be back!!
