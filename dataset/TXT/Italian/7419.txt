0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw This is my new favorite hamburger joint.  I have driven past many times and finally had the opportunity to give it a try this past weekend.  AS you can see from the 700 plus reviews...this place is popular.  The line was long but went very quickly.  My husband ordered a hot dog and fries and I went with a burger and onion rings.  In really thought it all was very tasty!  I LOVE the atmosphere here...from the diner type of appeal to the farm feel as you pull in.  I can't wait til it cools off a bit as sitting outside seems perfect.  Nothing fancy here....but calm and casual...my cup of tea! 

The  coffee shop next door looks great as well so that may be my next venture.  the family also owns Joe's real BBQ and Liberty Market.  I may venture over to Liberty Market as well ..it seems they have this food thing down.

Side note, I spoke with the mgr while we were there and while I forget his name, I have to say, the guy hustles and is also so friendly...opening doors for people and stopping to say Hi, but not in an annoying way....
