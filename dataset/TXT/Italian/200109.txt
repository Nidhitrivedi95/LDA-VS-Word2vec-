pt7p4klGicvPZe04mhhVGQ Been coming here for years(I can remember when it was Roy's).  The pizza and meatball sandwich are fantastic and though I'm not a big wing fan, they've always gone over well with friends and family who are.  Very friendly service and even when I don't order an advertised "special" they always apply discounts if they apply.  Very happy to have them as my neighborhood pizza joint!
