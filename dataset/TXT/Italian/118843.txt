GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ Disappointed to say the least. Ordered the antipasti platter which was beautiful to look at, but the contents were not worth the price. 

The fried shrimp fritto misto is made for those who enjoy a side of veggies with their deep fried batter. If you love oil and flour, you're gonna be thrilled! A skinny dried up piece of asparagus inside a huge cast of batter is not what I signed up for. 

Maybe the burgers are delicious? I didn't try one
