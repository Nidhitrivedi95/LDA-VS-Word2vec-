u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg I've wanted to try this place forever since I'm a big bruschetta fan and I've heard theirs is amazing.  Finally decided to check it out on a Saturday around 3pm. Parking is valet like pretty much all of Arcadia but valet is complimentary during lunch, Nice! 

We were seated within a few minutes of arriving.  Checked out the wine list and was pleasantly surprised to find that all wines by the glass were $5 until 5 pm. The selection was good and I really enjoyed the 2 I tried. Service was friendly and attentive throughout without being annoying. 

We ordered a board of bruschetta of course. We chose the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula, & Tomato, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, and Prosciutto with Figs & Marscarpone. I liked the sweet/savory combo of the Prosciutto one best and my BF said the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula, & Tomato was everything he wanted and more. All were delicious tho! Can't wait to try the others on my next visit!
