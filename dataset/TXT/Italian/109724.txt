G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q The wife and I decided to check Giada's restaurant out as we were walking the strip.  We were greeted by the hostess and grabbed a seat at the bar.  Service was exceptional and the staff seemed to emulate Giada's enthusiasm (as seen on her show).  I had a glass of both versions of her sangria.  They were both very good.  My wife had espresso drink that was very good as well.  We shared some cheese and meats as we dropped in for a snack.  I like the decor of the restaurant.  It definitely has a Giada feel to it.  My only complaint is that the restaurant is a bit overpriced when compared other other restaurants in the same class.  All in all, a place to definitely check out.
