zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g Tried the Di fara special. I'm not a pizza fan but this was something else! Enjoyed the softness of the top 3/4 of the pizza vs crunch of the olive oil drenched crust. The pepperoni is very different from the typical pizza too... friend said this is how it's done in Italy. She is Italian and an amazing cook and for her to speak highly of the Di fara and also meatballs says something.
