5sTFevXhGx01eLT4wF7Urg Met family at Tanzy while shopping with my daughter for her birthday at the Quarter.  Lunch was good, portions sizes are generous. My daughter and I both had the Tanzy Salad with Salmon, very tasty, with a good portion of salmon but eat it with caution since there are olives in the salad and not all the olives apparently are pitted. My daughter luckily didn't break a tooth when she bit down on 2 olives with pits still in them which for the birthday girl didn't make for the most comfortable eating experience. We seemed to be the only guests there for brunch so we had our server to ourselves.
