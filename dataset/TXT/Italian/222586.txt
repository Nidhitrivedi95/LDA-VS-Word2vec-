SiKTElhCaJGhAdySd7JSHA Happened to be in N. Scottsdale, and was happy to find this place just across the Scottsdale/ Cave Creek border.  Actually had a friend tell me about it, decided to try it for myself.  

I got the cheese ravioli with brown butter sauce, and HOLY COW, that sauce was so good I wanted to just drink it.  I cook, and have browned butter for a number of recipes, but they did something special with this sauce, wish I knew how to replicate it at home...  I also got the kale house salad, the salad dressing was sweet and unexpected and super delish.  For sure lemon and maybe some honey in it?  It also had tomatoes and a very generous sprinkling of sliced fresh parmesan cheese and something else crunchy- toasted breadcrumbs? Not sure, but really good.

Anyway, I'll definitely be back.
