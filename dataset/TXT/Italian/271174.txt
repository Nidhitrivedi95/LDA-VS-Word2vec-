XqSN1PtZkJ6QorOUa9AAdA Horrible food and service don't waste your money, there's much better in Scottsdale for less money. Went there during summer and had some great food. I liked it so much I returned with my boy friend the second time on Halloween. The menu had changed and it was terrible food, also bad service. I was looking forward to going on the complementary gondola ride but it was not offered by the server???. After paying 160.00 for dinner that I did not eat because the food was so bad, I was a little upset so I called to tell the manager that the food was bad and their new menu was terrible and to ask about the gondola ride. I spoke to a guy who said he was manager of another restaurant there and the manager would call me, no one ever called. Save yourself a disappointing evening and go somewhere else.
