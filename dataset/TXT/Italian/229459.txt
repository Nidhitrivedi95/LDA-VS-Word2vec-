t5Ip9ggWaam6qAUH0WPKVg Love all of the food at nypd pizza. They have amazing gluten free pizza and delicious salads. The staff, including the delivery team is incredibly friendly and always smiling. It's great when staff is knowledgeable about their food especially because I am gluten free and not by choice. I find a lot of places think it's to be healthy and don't really understand what it means. 

Definitely recommend their gf pizza. One of my regular spots in Scottsdale.
