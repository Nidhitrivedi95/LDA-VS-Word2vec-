The prices are a bit high for basic Italian food ($20 for an entree vs. $15) but it was the tasty, saucy, carby mid-range Italian food of our dreams.  And the bread! Maybe it's because I was so hungry but the garlic rolls were extra delicious and buttery!  I liked that it looked like a little hole in the wall and had "outside" seating, we didn't have to wait at all, food came out quickly, I would reccmomend this if you were looking for moderatly priced satisfying meal on the strip.
