2A1wvIFdKQZZe-vtTO7olQ Ate here a couple of weeks ago for my aunt's birthday. Good food, a little pricy. My aunt loves Carrie Cerino's so we took her here to keep it in the family, without the older crowd. The place was packed and they were very accommodating for my reservation. The table was ready to go when we got there, but good thing we booked a reservation... We would not have gotten in any other way. 

Overall a great experience!
