T7yKffTuhiIZclsgjfgowA Gotta give the full stars to Pizzeria Via Mercanti. I planned a lunch for my family and needed a place that can hold 9 people comfortably. PVM delivered with amazing food and service.
Today was hot... I mean HAWT! Patios and a picnic in the park would've been so uncomfortable. PVM had a great space and it's air conditioned, water was ready for everyone.
We shared family style:
- fried shrimp and calamari
- fried pizza
- arancini
- mozzarella and tomato salad
- margherita pizza
- vegetarian pizza
- neopolitana pizza
Good and condiments (EVOO, balsamic and spicy pepper infused olive oil) were Amazing! Both adults and kids were happy and full.
The servers were very patient and accommodating. I had to change the reservation for another hour because some people were late. Service was all smiles and quick. 

Highly recommend Pizzeria Via Mercanti. Delicious food, Amazing service... Takes me back to Rome.

Side notes:
- they missed preparing an order of seafood risotto but we were so full and cancelled it anyway
- our server pointed out that gratuity has been included in our bill Since we were a table of 9... Really appreciate that!
