PFQU2koM2WymKJh8O6UcoA We've eaten at Hoffstot's many times, and the food is always excellent. We order the antipasti platter, salads, and I usually get the blackenzola. It's always fantastic. Their service is usually pretty good, too. 

I'm only giving it four stars because we always make a reservation but almost always end up waiting anyway. The last time we waited over an hour past when our reservation was made for, and there was no room at the bar so we had to wait outside  in the middle of winter. I don't think that's acceptable - especially when the staff at the front was unapologetic. Most restaurants would give a free appetizer or drinks, or at least apologize for the wait.
