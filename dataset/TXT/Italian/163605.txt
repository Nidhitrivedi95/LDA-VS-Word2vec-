LWwAMZUiH6iBaL4a6jGRWw Pasta Cucina USED to be an easy five star in my books. My family would visit all the time. Unfortunately, they changed... If you're used to Pasta Cucina, be warned!

They no longer have the breadsticks with marinara and alfredo. This was a staple to Pasta Cucina and they replaced it with a generic loaf of bread. 

The salads no longer come with the meal... they're now ala carte. $9 for a salad on top of my meal. This isn't exactly "fine dining," so I'll pass. 

They took veal parmesan off of the menu. This was a huge disappointment to me. The eggplant was like mush, so be careful!

The waitress was wonderful, I will give them that. The manager didn't care about our dissatisfaction. He comped the eggplant which was beyond generous, but it would have been nice to provide honest feedback to the management team. We used to be loyal patrons; some management would find our feedback valuable.
