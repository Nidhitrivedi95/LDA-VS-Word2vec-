I absolutely adored Sugo. Attentive service, laidback atmosphere and very large portions for the price! I like how their menu isn't overwhelming, but provides a good selection of Italian classics. 

I highly recommend the mozzarella sticks and the eggplant sandwich, which at $10 is super filling and so flavourful!

I'd love to come back here to try some of pasta dishes - both my friends got the pasta and said it was amazing as well.
