3b4efqz06QrLQ_w2xLc4pA I am writing this more for the manager Kelli than for the restaurant or our server. We actually had pretty bad service, though we did not get a chance to complain about it. We were seated quickly, and our service seemed very new at his job.  We were there for lunch.  We ordered our food and received soups and salad before drinks.  We were finished with our soups and salads before we caught the attention of another server who came to our aid and apologized for us not having our drinks yet.  She alerted the manager as we did not complain, just asked for our drinks.  Drinks came and then our entrees.  Our server came by a couple times and apologized but was still very weak at his job.  Hopefully he is given another chance and receives more training before his next guest arrives.  The 5 stars go to Kelli though for just coming out of nowhere and comping our meal.  Having a meal for free is very nice, but considering we didn't even complain but that she took the initiative to make sure that we were taken care of and happy with our experience - that's why she gets the 5 stars.  Great job Kelli - keep up the good work!
