BgAV4IwXkd8gpuyUJX2wnQ Had the same experience as K.F. when we walked in.  No one was there to seat us and no seemed too anxious to do so.   If the food was good, we might have been able to forgive that, but it just wasn't good at all.  Started w/ the fried calamari which was soggy.  Both my husband and I had a pasta dish which neither of us enjoyed.   Don't know if the pizza is any better, but we won't be going back to find out.
