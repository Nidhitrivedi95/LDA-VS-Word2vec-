38-sjGYYVcQEKrZe5Nu47A Went here for our 5th time last week and took a friend who has never been.   We were dicing but all of us got away with having to try drinks which was good.  I was so looking forward to the ravioli with the tomato sauce and was a bit disappointed when it came out, perhaps they changed the recipe but it used to have a spicy kick to it and now it was just tomato sauce but thats alright.

The food and service was amazing!

And its been remodeled and we loved that except the bathroom used to be private and now its public--Meaning it used to be one room with a locking door and now its not, I dont like that at all but hey, Im a weirdo.    :)

We will be back!
