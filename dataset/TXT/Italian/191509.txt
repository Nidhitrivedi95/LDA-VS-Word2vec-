pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ Food mediocre.  Had the veal, tough as shoe leather.  Sauce was good.  My friend had a shrimp and pasta dish that was good.  Felt they were dishonest.  The waiter said he was going to bring us some bread, then he asked, 'garlic bread or regular'.  I asked for garlic, not knowing that they were going to charge me $10 for garlic bread.  The waiter made it sound like it was regular complementary bread served at almost every Italian place I ever ate.  
Service was also slow.  Would not ever go back.  Very, very expensive for so-so food.
