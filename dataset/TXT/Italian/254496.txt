VWR1zQYVyHAFRcF1acKczA WAndered into this little gem today not knowing what to expect.. Downtown Mesa is dying for a place like this. I ordered "The Med"..half sandwich, which after seeing it made me wish I had ordered the whole. It was absolutley delicious..roasted peppers, a generous slather of some type of GOAT Cheese and just enough greens ...to satisfy. I also ordered the antipasta and wolfed it down!! This is a clean little place...Jennifer is extremely friendly....glad I walked in!! I will be back. Ever since Guido's left Mesa...I haven't really found a deli i like. I am hoping that Cucina di Vita expands their "deli" selection soon. :)
