_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw First visit to Pomo Pizzeria and was a wonderful experience! There was a slight issue with the timing of our food coming out all together in our party of four and the manager promptly came to the table and apologized as well as made things right actually above and beyond my expectations and more than right. We will definitely be returning with friends and family.
