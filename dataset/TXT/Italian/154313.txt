kzbH1_l7VTSfFFcwTqY6vA This is a wonderful neighborhood  eatery.  The staff is friendly and treats you like you are family.  The pizza, pasta and soups are just like my Nana made.  It is a hidden treasure in Crafton.  It reminds me of the restaurants on "The Hill" in St. Louis.  The only draw back is that it is a little crowded.
