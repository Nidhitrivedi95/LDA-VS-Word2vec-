The ground floor was busy so we were proposed the 2nd floor. There it's actually even better. You can enjoy the large window roof. 
The burger was not too big, maybe a bit small for a man. I took the antipasti risotto. It is a risotto served in a ball shaped. Really good. 
Only negative point : it is too loud !
