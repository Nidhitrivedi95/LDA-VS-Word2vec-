Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA Disappointing. I had high hopes for dinner here. We were staying at the hotel this restaurant was located inside, and breakfast had been quite good. I ordered a seafood pasta dish, which was almost $30, with no included salad. I  got a  plate of pasta in red sauce, with 3 small shrimp, 3 small scallops, 3 tiny clams, and 3 mussels, one of which was empty. The server did not check on us until we were over halfway through our dishes. Once he did, we communicated our disappointment and he did notify the manager, who discounted our meal and eventually came to apologize and offer us a free dessert, but by that time we were just ready to go.  Our local Italian restaurant in Tennessee would put this place to shame.  Skip the convenience of the hotel location and seek out something authentic.
