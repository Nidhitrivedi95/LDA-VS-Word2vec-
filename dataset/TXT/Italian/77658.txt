cZAU9Gs-rIv8DvsVp3qUTw I rarely leave bad reviews. But I could not find one positive thing about my first time here. Service was terrible, we only saw 1 person working the entire place. Food quality was less then poor. Atmosphere was terrible as well, you could hear a pin drop. I hope the owner turns this place around for his/her own sake.
