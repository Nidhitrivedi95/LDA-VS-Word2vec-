8axxI33rUyswfRk_v3vS0A Modern Italian restaurant that doesn't quite live up to the hype.


 The pizza is of generally good quality and they're able to cater for dietary requirements such as gluten free that would rule out many an Italian restaurant.


 That said, it wouldn't be my first choice as the prices are relatively steep and decor can make the place feel a bit clinical.


 Takeaway is expensive & many of the topping combinations don't travel well.
