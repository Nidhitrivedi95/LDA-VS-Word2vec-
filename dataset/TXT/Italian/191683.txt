pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ We have been going here for the last 12 years... Now today we are having lunch and my wife orders a Moscow mule .... We have to give up our drivers license to secure the copper cup?... Wtf... Seriously... So turned off I will never go there again... The restaurant must be having some real issues... Food is always good , but this policy is off the hook ridiculous ..... 
My guess is they are in real trouble ...... Watch for a new restaurant opening soon.....
