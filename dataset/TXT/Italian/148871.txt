kHWSO8fV0Mp-M3J-w1ma7A I had the worst pizza in the UK here. I have been travelling in UK for 2 months. If you "create your own pizza, the base is supposed to be the Margarita pizza plus 2 more ingredients. I got a burnt pizza with no tomatoes or basil and limited burnt red onions and sad olives. Don't eat here.
