56wd6Sc6cbQgE8J331acRQ Authentic Italian restaurant. Our party enjoyed the bruschetta- crispy toast with fresh tomato and garlic toppings. We also had wonderfully thin slices of beef carpaccio topped with thin shavings of Parmesan, and and antipasto platter. Veal Marsala was the best looking of the the four dinners, but the veal saltimbocca, cannelloni casalinga, and spaghetti carbonnara were also good. Tartuffo, espresso, creme caramel and cafe americano, all good to finish off with.
