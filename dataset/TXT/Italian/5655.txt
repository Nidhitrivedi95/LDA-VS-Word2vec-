_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw This to me is an overpriced pizza joint. The food was ok at best, although I will have to say that their Bruschetta (not sure if I'm spelling this right) was pretty good.  To me the sauce on the pizza wasn't even that good, and I've had it all over the country.  My friends talked this place up which is why we decided to try it,  ehh.  

The service could have been a little bit better, it seemed as if the waitress took our order and never came back to us until it was time to pay the bill.  We had to get our refills from other people, although she was walking around our general area.

I will have to say that the ambience was good, they had some nice mellow music going on in the background and just the right amount of  noise.
