N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ Came here after a basketball game with 10 little boys and families (here from California). They were more than pleased to accommodate us. Not only did we get the best pizza we received the best service.  The older gentleman came out and spoke with all of us to see if all was good. He was so sweet. He came out with zeppoles and a sugar pizza for dessert for the boys. We left full and satisfied. Great food accompanied by great service.  If your in town and close by, a definite place to check out..Thank you for a great experience
