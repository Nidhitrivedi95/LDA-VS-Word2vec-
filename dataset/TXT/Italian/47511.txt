8yiLVWzJyyTEhYE0fVNvlA Excellent food and service.  The salt crusted branzina was absolutely amazing.  Big enough for two to share and they filet it right in front of you.   Service was super fast and service staff was very friendly. Real team effort provided great service.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
