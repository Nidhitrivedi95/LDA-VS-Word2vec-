Gm---0O1y_4TAQAl5qKvqQ Had their pepperoni and sausage pizza and was quite pleased with the flavor. The size was good and we had leftovers which is unusual for my wife and I since we tend to take care of pizzas!  The setting was very nice and the staff was helpful and prompt. Another member had the spaghetti and said the meatballs were amazing. I noticed that they don't mess around their meatballs are huge!!  Overall good place give it a try.
