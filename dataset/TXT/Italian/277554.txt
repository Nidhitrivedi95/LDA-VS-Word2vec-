YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw I absolutely love this restaurant. They have an amazing bar area and a great patio. The food is always amazing. The octopus is one of my favorites in town. I have to order it every visit. The piccata is my normal order with spaghetti squash which is fantastic. The bread is great as well. I have tried most of the menu and I really enjoy the eggplant app as well.
