Youve been my staple for hang over food and none hang over food for a few years..When ever I return to the city - I make a bee line to you..your lovely gooey cheese panzerotti's makes my tummy sooo happy..with extra sauce..on top-- i drool in anticipation of devouring one of your Delicious heart attacks encased in cheese...

Damn I just made my self hungry....
