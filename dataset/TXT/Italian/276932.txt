yGg7O0ATbMzoxrLvByzp2g We did a quick lunch here and it was super-busy.  

I can tell you that all of the salads are HUGE - at least three people would be full from one of them.  The salmon salad was very good.  The Pad Thai was tasty but didn't really rock our world - there is better.

Everything was fresh and the place is clean.  The noise level was high, but it did not slow down the efficient service.  On the other tables I did spy a few handsome burgers that were being devoured - just not my choice for a lunch food.

They serve brunch, at least on the weekends, from what I gathered.
