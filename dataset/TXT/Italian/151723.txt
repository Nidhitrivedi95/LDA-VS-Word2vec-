kplbTXzOaUJqP2BwanoYjw Second time and a major improvement in our total dining experience.  Not only was the wait staff now knowledgeable, but they were genuinely warm and friendly.  But we are after all here to eat.  The salad which was pathetic on our first visit, was larger, lettuce crisp and dry, color provided by tomato, cucumber and pepprocini.  My soup was a tad salty but had great flavor and full of veggies and pasta. 
I almost always have linguini and clam sauce, but tonight ordered veal parm.  Excellent!  They accommodated my wife by mixing and matching her specific requests to bring her a new version of chicken Angelo.  
All in all we had a great meal and will definitely be back sooner than later
