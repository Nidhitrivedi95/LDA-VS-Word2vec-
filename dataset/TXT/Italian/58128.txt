ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg First of all, I am not a huge pizza fan.  Therefore, you are not likely to find me doing somersaults, and singing "Some Enchanted Evening" over a piece of pizza.

Nonetheless, I give Crust 4 stars.  I greatly enjoyed their Rustica.  This thin crust, personal sized pizza (I had the meat Rustica) was loaded with fresh ingredients, and most enjoyable.  

Another unexpected surprise was a fairly nice wine list to go along with your Sicilian fare.

The only thing that kept Crust from 5 stars was that the experience was lacking.  To go from good to great, you must learn to present your patrons with a wonderful experience.  The service was good, not great.   On the experience meter, I would give them a two.

Crust, work on delivering a world class, Disney type experience and I think you could really explode.  Your food was great!  My experience was mediocre.

Nonetheless, if someone ever asks me where to go for a nice slice of Sicily, I will happily recommend Crust Pizza & Wine Cafe.

PS - the videos you provided on your website sold me to come to your establishment.  Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have driven 22 miles for a piece of pizza.  Congrats on sharing your story in a memorable way.
