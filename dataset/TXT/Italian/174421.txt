nDfN1RkA40anfzjFGRO8qQ My family and I went here for dinner we are from New York and just moved to the area. Its hard to get my husband to eat out here because he always rather me cook! Good to know I will be getting a night off from cooking for now on! We couldn't stop eating! We had Calamari Fritti for our apps I had the *Shrimp Marsala* and if I could scream at you and tell you to eat this dish I would!! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water! My husband had the *Surf and Turf* special which is Filet and Shrimp with butternut squash ravoili in a  pesto rosa sauce and baked asparagus!! I tried a bite and the filet mignon was so tender and PERFECT! We ended our meal with the family Tiramisu which was so creamy and outstanding! We will be here once a week!! Go here you will fall in LOVVE! I promise!
