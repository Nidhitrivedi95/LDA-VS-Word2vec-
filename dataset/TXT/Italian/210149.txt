qvQ-i1HgSloSJLkGnXsfhw Let me tell you about my little friend the bruschetta.
The skinny 
I can't comment enough about the bruschetta it's a little slice of heaven. Not to gas you up so much I am not a big fan of bruschetta so I never order it, on a date night with my gf she ordered it and to my surprise they brought a good helping more than my gf could handle and wow! The bread was nice a toasted with a garlic cheese butter and they add fresh cold chopped tomato with fresh cut basil with a little olive oil. The pizza is great sauce taste as it should and they don't use the generic cheeses and ingredients, plus they always have great specials online and on social media. The wings are also great big and tasty with lots of sauce which I find it comparable to long wongs med sauce. 
The bad
Pretty common thing for me with parking but this is particularly a bad area to park and not the greatest of areas especially at night have seen some seedy people. 
Overall this place is a Phoenix staple and great for dates I would recommend it.
