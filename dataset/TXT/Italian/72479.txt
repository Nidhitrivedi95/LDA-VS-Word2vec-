CElwRv4CtK56NljAuCwepw Alright, my first confession is this. I've been here twice and the Surprise store once. I've ordered the same thing each time, I am THAT impressed with it! Lest you think it's but a shallow sampling of one dish, LOL, I have also tasted three different versions of their thin-crust pizza ordered by co-diners, and three or four of their appetizers. All simply delicious, w/o equivocation. 

So, what do I get? The menu choices are just shy of the Cheesecake Factory. Nearly overwhelming, LOL. Turn to the very back, they call it the 'chalkboard menu'. You pick either a chicken breast, or a portabello cap. Then you pick from a selection of about six different methods of preparation, and you pick a salad which will accompany it. I get mine with a melange of roasted beets, cauliflower, broccoli, etc. I believe the salad is 'misto' (for mixed). 
There is no pasta involved with any choice, here, which makes it easier on the belly. Plus, it allows me to splurge a bit on the 'breadsticks'. This is their pizza crust, with appropriate oil and spices for dipping. 

Give them a shot!
