GW2_gqOhKQ7sI4oem6yP9w To be clear, I ate at Pasta Brioni's To Go Café, not the main dining room. 

I just wanted to have a quick Caesar Salad with traditional Caesar dressing. I placed my order at the counter, paid, and then went to sit at a table. My salad was prepared and brought to me quickly. 

The Romaine was fresh and crisp, but the Caesar dressing was simply bland. I had to add grated parmesan cheese to get some flavor. I had anticipated better. 

I think the next time I'll take the time to be seated in Pasta Brioni's main dining room.
