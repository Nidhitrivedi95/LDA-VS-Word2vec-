LN0JGAl8Rr_r_5t_X8Kz6g I thought Fellini's was just okay. The shrimp royale was very good and wish that was the entree in itself. The service was okay, not bad on water refills. The entrees were just okay, I ordered veal and it was stuffed. It was too salty for me and the potatoes were overcooked. My friends wagyu beef was a little bit tough and chewy, and that alone is kind of disappointing.
