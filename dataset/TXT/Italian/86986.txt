DUuZjarJ7vOHJNEHNI0WUw Ate at Anthony Jr's tonite for a late dinner. Waitress sucked. Waited 10mins for drinks (water n beer) ordered wedding soup n cheesy bread sticks. Soup was ok, "cheesy bread sticks" was a "pizza without sauce"..greasy bottom crust. When we were done eating we sat for 15mins, then had to go to cash register to pay. Our waitress said she thought she gave us our check. WRONG!! Needless to say she didn't get a tip and we probably won't be going back!!
