JPmu9-2jd7nGIuTXEqT9zg Since moving to Auburn 2 years ago, CR has become our default restaurant of choice.  On the weekends, the check in process can be intimidating.  Tons of people in waiting area...many who seem to know each other and the hostess is a bit of a crab.  The restaurant has a bit of a worn feel to it, but we consider that part of the charm.  We generally visit during the week, less crowded and the staff is a bit more relaxed/friendly.  Wait staff is mostly decent.

I find the food to be very good, decent sized portions and fairly priced.  I prefer an a la carte menu.  Sometimes I want a salad or something...sometimes I don't... so the a la carte works for me.  

Have tried most menu items and for the most part the food is good to very good.  Can often be way over-salted would be my biggest complaint.  

Overall, solid neighborhood restaurant.  Kinda like going over your mother's, food is always good, but sometimes she is just a bit bitchy.
