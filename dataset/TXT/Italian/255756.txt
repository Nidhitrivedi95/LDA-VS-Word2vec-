vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA We loved this restaurant from the second we walked in. It's in Aria, close to Michael Jackson ONE show...we ate there right before the show. The ambiance is perfect for Italian/NYC style restaurant. Very enjoyable.
We enjoyed the bread, parmesan and pickled cauliflower that they bring to the table. They have a great wine selection. We ordered lobster lasagna and the meatballs and they were both PERFECT. 
I would LOVE to repeat this restaurant!!
