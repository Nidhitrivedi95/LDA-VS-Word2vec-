UmZl3K3RLZq_xFmBOK-Q4w The staff is very nice, answered all of the questions we had concisely and understandingly, and was very accommodating throughout the meal. The food was delicious and filling. 

The prices are a bit high, however, and I just can't shake the feeling that there are better places around the city to get more bang for your buck. If you have money to spend without remorse though, I suppose it would be worth a stop.
