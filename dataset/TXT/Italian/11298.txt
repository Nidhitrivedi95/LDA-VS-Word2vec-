0pWGYVBxkufNn8MDCcA7cA Went there on August 24th, 2012.  It was just my wife and I for dinner.  I ordered the quattro formaggi and to my surprise didn't contain any cheese. I don't know if they are pre-made however, it lacked to say the least.  My wife ordered a talapia with some angel hair pasta which was very nice and tasty.  

Our waiter and waitress disappeared for approximately 30-40 mins while there were another three tables out on the patio.  I Wasn't to impressed by this point as I wanted another drink and  my bill.  Upon his Highness' arrival (waiter), he inquired how our meal was as he was clearing our table. Had he been around during our meal to check in I would have sent it back, but seeing as we had a movie to catch, I thought I would let him know that it was the worst pizza I have ever had.  To which he responded with a very ``dumb and ignorant`` sounding ``OH was it and shrugged off my complaint.  

Since my visit to Alice Fazooli`s in Vaughan, I have sent in a formal complaint to their costumer service department who has assured me that the manager would be in contact with me.

Standby for further update!!
