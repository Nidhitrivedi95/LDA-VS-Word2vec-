BQqwIYQuo2W94smjrBjy5g Our first visit to this quaint little place was in December during the Holiday shopping madness on our way home from the Galleria. 1st,the Service was great. The owner came by to welcome us- very nice! 
They gave us garlic bread sticks, they were ok - possible they were not homemade?? 
We ordered a coke $4- ouch!
Linguini Carbonara $21 
Chicken Parmesan $24 
Honestly, the food was so hot, we had to let it cool down before we could eat. I had a few bites but burned my tongue and couldn't eat any more. We took it to go. 
The chicken reheated well,  a bit too much garlic but that's OK. 
The carbonara had way too much oil/butter & i didn't really enjoy it. 
I think we will try it one more time. There were some enticing dishes listed on the menu... 
Won't be bringing the kids with these prices though.
I hope they do well, it's a nice place. 
PS- they also had a man in the corner playing some music. He never smiled.  Cheesey old school touch but really pleasant to hear.
