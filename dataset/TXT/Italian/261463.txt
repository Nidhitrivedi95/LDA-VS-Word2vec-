WRkyYsX0h1_PJxyu3TS8ZA The food was good, and the atmosphere was high energy, but $60 for a pitcher of Sangria was nothing more than price gouging.  The price was printed in the smallest most imperceptible font on the menu, and anyway you look at it was a rip off.  For that reason I will not return to this establishment.  There are many more respectably priced restaurants in the area and I would recommend any one of those over this one.
