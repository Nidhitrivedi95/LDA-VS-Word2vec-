duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ Probably one of the reasons I will not stay in the four seasons Las Vegas again.
We have tried to have a nice Christmas dinner at this restaurant, but after we waited about 20 min to get seated (we had a reservation) we got informed that the first course of the only one dining option (4 course price fix menu) was not available.
We had to skip the first course and where only offered 7$ discount.
Moving on this restaurant also services the breakfast to the rooms at the four seasons. We stayed 2 nights and both nights out fruit plates where missing.

This Restaurant is absolutely not up to the expected four seasons standard.
