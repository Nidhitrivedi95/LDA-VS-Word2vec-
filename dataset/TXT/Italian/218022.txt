rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ My wife and I frequent this spot all of the time.

The first time we came was of course for the $10 unlimited mimosas or blood Mary's (10am -3pm). What a lot of ppl don't know is that you can order steak for breakfast even tho it's not on the menu. Trust me that filet is delicious and the breakfast potatoes are the perfect compliment.

Not in the mood for steak ? Try the bananas foster or the chicken and waffles! All choices are great here except the grilled cheese is made with Brie and that's just a no go for me.

Dinner is also great here especially the chicken parm-- we always, always make an order to go after brunch. Rigo is a great server along with his brother and Kev is the go to bartender! He makes the best Martinis :-)

Want a quick snack? Calamari is amazing too.

For the prices, nice decor, great atmosphere and amazing food, you can't go wrong!
