JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw Came up to Montreal for the weekend and found this place by accident. The waiter, Michael, was fantastic. Very attentive and good personality. The food was wonderful. Ordered the Vichyssoise soup, outstanding. Then had the mussels mariniere. Not all of the mussels had been debearded properly, but the broth was very good. Came back the next night, same soup and ordered the salmon tartare. Perfect 5 stars the second night. We were there on both a Friday and Saturday night. Did not have any of the problems with service or loud diners mentioned in other reviews. Next time I am in Montreal, I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant.
