l-Zjik0MbpabQPv-nNp9YQ How can you not be a fan of this venerable neighbourhood Italian food fest of a bakery. 
Places like this are what sets Toronto apart from other cities. Walk in and get in line for some great savoury specials like their veal or chicken cutlet sammies topped with delicious grilled peppers and sweet tomato sauce slathered over a fresh Italian bun. Solid value!
I haven't tried the sweets but they looked amazing, sitting there under glass just waiting for someone to devour them. And the coffee counter looked awesome too, with a sign asking for you to request some latte art, like a logo or similar for your Italian coffee drink.
The staff looked to be local family and were cheerful and seemed happy to be there; what a nice atmosphere that creates.
Easy parking in the area around the bakery, which seemed almost the size of a Shoppers Drug Mart with big windows facing a busy Royal York Road. Recommended if you are in the area and tired of Wendy's and the other fast food up on Queensway.
