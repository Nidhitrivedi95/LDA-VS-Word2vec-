6mnjYZM40r67smOXrg6R4g I've been to this place a few times, most recently at a dinner at the beginning of a bachelorette party. I think this is a very decent option for someplace on the north east side. 

For the party, they were very accommodating for a larger group and us adding our own decorations to the tables. The gals hosting the party had planned it with the restaurant and had a fixed menu with three options available for everyone. It worked out really nicely for our party and the food was pretty tasty. I don't remember exactly what I got but I do remember enjoying the boxed up leftovers when I was hungover the next morning. 

The service was very good considering we were a boisterous group of about 20 ladies. I was having an ice tea craving that day and think I went through about 8 glasses of the stuff while we were there. The two waitresses helping our table we spot on. They even allowed us to bring in our own cake and provided plates for serving it. 

Overall, I think it's decent basic Italian food, but really good at handling larger parties if you call ahead.
