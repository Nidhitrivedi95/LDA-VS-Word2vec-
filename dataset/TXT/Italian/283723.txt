z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ I'm a recent convert to going out downtown, and I'm hooked.  It is important to me to have access to fine dining when I go out since I'm old and that's what old people do.  When we walked into the restaurant, we were immediately impressed.  It's beautiful.  We were seated in a booth, which I usually don't like, but these booths are great.  They're circular with high backs, providing a lot of privacy and making conversation easy.
We were greated very quickly after being seated, and the delicious cocktails we ordered were served within minutes of our arrival.  This is a pet peeve of mine, so that got things off to a good start.
One of my guests ordered a steak, and the other ordered a bowl of lobster bisque and ceasar salad, and they were both very pleased.  I ordered the fish, which was fileted table side.  I was pleased, too, but I think it would be better if they moved on from butter and used olive oil.  It was a wonderful piece of fish, but butter sauce is too old school, even for a steakhouse.  Perhaps I should have requested the olive oil, but I didn't.
Tony served us, and did a great job.  He was attentive without being a pest.  He brought out a couple of small "compliments of the chef" dishes that were great, too.
We throughly enjoyed our evening at Andiamo's, and we will go back.  I hope you'll go, too, and support what's going on downtown!  It is on par with fine dining on the Strip.
