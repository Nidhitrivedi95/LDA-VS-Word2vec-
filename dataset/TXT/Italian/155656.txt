L2VXZ7_Ohzp7pr1otj7WoQ Stopped into Coco on a Saturday night just prior to 7PM.  There was certainly a diverse crowd of tourists, theater go-ers, locals etc.  We sat outside on the Hearst plaza and started our order with a delicious white wine.

Since we were going on to meet friends and we didn't want to walk left-overs home we opted for 3 starters.  The mozzarella in the caprese salad was some of the best we've ever had.  Completely fresh & the tomatoes they used were perfectly ripe.

Zucchini chips & chicken skewer with prosciutto followed.  Both delicious and the chicken was tender.  With the complimentary olive oil and bean served with billowy bread starter it was the perfect amount of food to start our evening.

No doubt we'll be back.  Their website lists 4 sister restaurants and says that they validate Hearst Tower parking for those who need to drive into Uptown.  For affordable, fresh food & that tastes great, this is on a short list in CLT.
