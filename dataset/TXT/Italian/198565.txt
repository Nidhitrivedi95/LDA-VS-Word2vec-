pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Best Pizza ever? Ha Ha Ha Ha. You poor things. Better than Walmart frozen for sure. Someday I'm going to have a pizza benefit. Pizza from around the U.S.. Midwest, east coast, west coast, southwest.. You're all invited. Nothing there like this mediocre stuff. If you taste great pizza, you will never come back here. And prices? For shits sake. This is pizza.
