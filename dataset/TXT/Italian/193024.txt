pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ By far the best Italian restaurant I've been to in a long time.  This place is great.  The service was perfect the food was amazing.  We loved the set up of the restaurant, ambiance and location.  It's conveniently located right off of Flamingo and Lindell with ample parking even for the busy Friday night that we went.   We were a little discouraged when we saw a lot of open seats and they said it may be 45-60 mins to be seated.  It only took 15 tho so no worries there.  They offer barside seating, huge dining rooms and a few private rooms.  Very cool.  As soon as your seated you'll receive some breadsticks (amazing).  Then we got our drinks (Stella, iced tea, water and wine with dinner).  We proceeded to get Pork loin, Salmon and some pasta.  Everything was great.  Everyone in our group enjoyed it thoroughly and we will definitely be back.
