UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Came to town square to shop and was hungry for a great big salad so figured I'd just eat here somewhere. I asked for a booth and was seated right away with my friend. The waitress was super friendly and really patient with me as I couldn't figure out what salad to order. I ended up just getting a side of cauliflower because after looking at the menu and their Instagram and realized none of these salads were going to fufill my expectations. My friend got flatbread. The cauliflower looks attractive and has all these toppings on it but it's really so bland and not cooked well (omg have you had cauliflower at Carson kitchen? Bomb!) his flatbread was nothing to write home about either. anyway yeah this is just a middle of the road mall restaurant. No reason to return. Like, ever.
