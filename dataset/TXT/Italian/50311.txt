9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw absolutely love this little gem tucked away in a converted brick home in downtown Phoenix.  Sat at the bar and ordered a salad and pizza and was blown away by both.  The pizza has a crust that reminds me of a crustier version of naan with a tasty sauce (not too much) and salami/mozzarella.  

Great patio when the weather is nice and cozy atmosphere inside.  Two thumbs enthusiastically up!
