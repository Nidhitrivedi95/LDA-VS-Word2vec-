Came for a friend's birthday and we ordered a bunch of things on the menu so we can try a little of everything.  

The dry aged strip was ridiculous! Not only was the meat amazing but the presentation and delivery was so fun to watch! They bring the meat on a cart,  bone in and they begin to filet tableside foe you.  It was amazing 

Beef ravioli was absolutely delicious.  They drizzle this aged balsamic on it that created this umami experience in your mouth.  I want to drink that balsamic glaze 

The gnocchi was good.  I think my friends enjoyed it more than I did.  For me,  it was a little dense but still pretty good.  

The mushrooms and brussel sprout sides were amazing.  I loved them 

The one thing that was a bit strange was that the music didn't quite match the restaurant but then we found out from the waiter that the music they play is Mario's personal playlist which was cute but I still don't know how I felt about some of the songs they played.  Sorry Mario! 

Definitely worth trying when in vegas
