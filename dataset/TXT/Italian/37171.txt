74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw After a show at The Mirage we decided to try Portofino, and so glad we did!!  We shared the meatball appetizer which was amazing.... And I am not a meatball fan! My husband had the chicken parm, very different, had an interesting stuffing inside, beautifully presented. I had the salmon which was excellent!! The food took a bit long to get to us and the waiter apologized and said the chef wanted to buy us two glasses of wine. We didn't feel like drinking more so thanked him, but said not necessary. When we got the bill they took 20% off instead. Classy move!!
