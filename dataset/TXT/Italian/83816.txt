DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q Whenever I'm departing from the D gate this is my go to coffee stop. My drink is the Havana Latte and by no meals is it healthy ...BUT...for a guilty pleasure drink that always does the trick you won't be disappointed! 

Not the biggest fan of the food but it's all made to order and tastes good...but it's just not my jam.
