wNXw53wmePcf_V3rF18LUg This restaurant is always busy! We came on a random week night and still had to wait a bit (20 min) for a table! 

I had a better experience with my food this time around though I feel our waiter was kind of new. He forgot my husband's wine and our waters a couple of times and seemed a bit frazzled at how busy it was. 

Whole reason why I bothered to write an update? The tiramisu! Sooo good. They're like 3 heavenly mounds of deliciousness! I want to go back for more ;P
