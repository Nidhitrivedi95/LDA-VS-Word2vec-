oJSa5HCiZXKLXxggQmecEQ Came here for a date on a friday evening with a reservation. We arrived 15 min early, unaware the restaurant didn't officially open till our reservation time at 6pm. Nevertheless, the host greeted us, politely explained the situation and gave us seats off to the side until our table was set up. And what a romantic scene it was, with candle lighting strewn across the rustic wooden tabletops. All the service staff were very pleasant---attentive without being disruptive/intrusively persistent, and very warm mannered. They checked on us on occasion, wordlessly and efficiently keeping our dining surface clean, utensils exchanged, and cups filled with water.

But the food--- man was I impressed. We ordered roasted bone marrow and the highly recommended spaghetti all'Amatriciana. Both were extremely delicious, but the roasted bone marrow with oxtail marmalade was deeply memorable. Sidebar: I had recently visited BlueBlood looking for their highly-raved-about bone marrow only to be secretly devastated that in their menu revisions, they decided to remove that actual marrow from the dish and only serve tartare in the otherwise empty hull of a marrow---an upset and travesty. Campagnolo's bone marrow offering filled my my stomach, heart, and soul and is a must-order. Each bite a moment's blissful of unctious, savoury, and crunchy. Deeply and decadently satisfying.

The spaghetti certainly lived up to its preceding reputation. Slightly spicy and very pleasant mouthfeel: slight chewy, perfectly al dente, and full of tomato flavour punctate with bits of lovely pork. Deceptively filling. 

Overall 5/5, I would 100% recommend this place to anyone. All the attention to detail made the entire evening very memorable.
