I891YJPgiL7lENaEz8sdqw My husband and I eat out often and it is rare to have a truly exceptional experience. Tonight at Little Italy we had an exceptional dinner and dining experience. There were 4 diners and each of us had a different meal each of which was excellent. The pasta was tender and tasty, the flavors were intense and interesting and the service was attentive and efficient. Our wait person, Denise, was delightful. If you are going to be in Inverness, don't miss this little gem. It is a very small, intimate and authentic Italian restaurant. Be sure to make reservations. The Colorado friends of Little Italy.
