g-nzfTvso3-4c4gkhkmGbQ It was my first time here. I went for the early bird special on a Tuesday. 

The food was ok. I rarely fill up on pizza at an AYCE but it was one of the better choices there. The fried fish was decent and the bolognese sauce and lasagna were pretty good as well. 

It was my son's birthday and the staff made him feel pretty special.

Just double check your bill. My kids were over charged.
