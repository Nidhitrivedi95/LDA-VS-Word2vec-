ydSiR7YyALkmmACVNtXzhg I can't think of any reason not to give this place five stars...it's never disappointed me. Since they seem to consistently serve fresh, flavourful and quality Italian entrées, pizza and sandwiches along with good and attentive service, I'd say that is the type of establishment that deserves five yelp stars. 

I would recommend visiting for low key quick lunches (take into consideration that weekdays are loud & busy), take out or catering. I was really impressed with the breakfast basket and grilled meat and veggie sandwiches that were prepared and brought to us in time for our clients to enjoy throughout meetings. The catering pricing was quite affordable and competitive and the ordering process was headache-free all the way through. Thank you, Di Manno ladies :)

Side notes: Cannolis are filled upon order so they stay fresh (I could watch that all day lol, mmm). As far as favourite meals, I would recommend the pizza or the grilled paninis.
