LkRSDF7gTNXg1OlNNBSVAA We stopped in Friday night around 8pm and there was a line with a 30 minute wait. Both Eduardo's and the place across the road had similar reviews, but Eduardo's felt cozy as though you were going to Grandma's place for dinner! (As opposed to a night club...and less expensive.) We were the only people in line without a bottle of wine! Next time we'll get it right. 

The wait ended up being about half the suggested time, so that was nice. We ordered a salad to share and carbonara. The carbonara was really, really tasty. The salad was nice, too. It came with a delicious bread to start. (Apparently I am writing this review in reverse-chronological order.) 

Overall seems like a wonderful place! I docked it a star because it was really loud (and I don't usually mind loud places), and it seemed like there were enough servers to keep up with the crowd. For the food, décor, and friendly service, though, it would earn 5 stars.
