As for the food, I came for summerlicious and it was satisfying. I liked how I had a lot of options. I originally ordered sea bass with risotto and unfortunately had to send it back because the risotto was uncooked. It also didn't taste good and was bland so I asked for the lobster ravioli replacement. This was good but the edges of the ravioli pasta was  a little tough. 

The service at times was a little too enthusiastic and almost felt like we were being rushed or pressed for an answer. The manager was really nice and gave us complimentary prosecco for our table in lieu of the poor risotto, which apparently was a common complaint. 

It's a nice restaurant with decent food and beautiful views.
