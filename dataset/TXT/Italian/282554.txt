Z072pEHdos2Gjj3nMdR6uA This is a solid choice for Italian...I'm even adding it to my list!  We sat on the patio for our 2nd visit & it's surrounded by potted plants, which gives a bit of a buffer, but still allowing for some people watching.  Our server was attentive and our food was (almost) as good as the 1st time.  I make the distinction because I had the "mare" both times.  It is a delicious dish, but a bit messy having to remove the lobster from the half shell (It's not the tail).  I asked this time if they could remove the shell for me, but felt that I didn't get even half as much meat as I would have if I had picked it myself.  Live & learn...still a delicious, fairly priced & convenient Italian experience in Uptown.
