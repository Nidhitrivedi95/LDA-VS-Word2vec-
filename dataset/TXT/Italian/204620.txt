QcV8KIPKbGRnWQPql55bKQ I love the pizza. But when I called to place a delivery the girl on the phone told me I couldn't. They were closing in 10 minutes. It's 8:22 and they close at 9. Who the hell runs this store. Because if the owner knew this, this staff should get replaced. I've been to many all around town and never get treated like this. Pizza great... service sucks. I'll make sure I drive to another location out of my way to eat this stuff again.
