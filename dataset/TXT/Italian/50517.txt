9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Dog friendly! Nice patio seating, inside seating feels a bit more cramped. The food was decent, I do not rememberable having anything that swept me off my feet with wow factor. The atmosphere is what sells here, the patio is nice in the evenings and light up with white outdoor Christmas lighting, or something along those lines.
