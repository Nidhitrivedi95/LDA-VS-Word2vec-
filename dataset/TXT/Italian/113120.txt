GfHBBCi6LJAPVFTcCwu9aQ At first thought I would have given this place 3 stars, then I actually thought about the service and dropped it down 1 star. The food is pretty good, nothing special though. The prosciutto and mozzarella was pretty good and I kind of liked the chicken parm panini, but I definitely thought the amount of chicken on the sandwich was stingy. The price isn't high so there are your 3 stars. 

Here is your review on service, SUCKED. I walked in and the waitress/hostess/bartender said hello and walked away. Then a couple minutes later she remembered that her job is to get people to a table so she told me to sit anywhere. She also was able to bring me chips instead of the side salad that was ordered and somehow I needed to turn my entire body around and stare at her to let her know I wanted to order something. She also brought my date the wrong drink, which was supposed to be cider, but instead my date took a big sip of an ale which she thought was gross. I am surprised looking back that I didn't give her a 10% tip. 

I wanted to like this place, it's in walking distance from where I live, but the brain dead waitress was able to convince me to never go back again.
