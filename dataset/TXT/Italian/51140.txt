9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg One of the mussels in my Capri was uncooked. It tasted so raw so I spit it out. 
The chef "explained" it was a lobster that accidentally fell into my dish..

I didn't even bother to argue with them if they could possibly come up with this excuse. 

I have been to this restaurant for several times since it was closely. 
And every time I visited, I regretted afterwards.
