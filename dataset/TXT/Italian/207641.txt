qkDlRkNfrXE_4t2vMrTo0A Visiting Madison from Chicago and arrived hungry. Had a great meal; started with a great salad with cheese and salami, ham and garbanzo beans. Cheese pizza was delicious and husband had the super hot pizza with pepperoni, banana peppers and jalapeños. He loved it. Also had stuffed spinach manicotti with tomato & mushroom sauce, spaghetti with meat sauce and shells with Alfredo sauce and broccoli. Everything was really good and we are a tough group. Pastas looked sort of basic, but flavors were really solid. It was a great choice.
