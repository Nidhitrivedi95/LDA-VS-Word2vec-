HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q Espresso is just average, not sure if it's their maching or whether the beans were old but it had a burnt flavor that I didn't care for and I went on 3 different occasions.  Because it's right next to the main floor, it gets very crowded and feels more like a cattle car at times.  Still on the lookout for a great place to get my espresso fix in the morning at The Venetian.
