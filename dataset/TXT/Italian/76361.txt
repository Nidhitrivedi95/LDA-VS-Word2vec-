cSSgeQQOz2modfT7zTHJHQ We have been to Pastizza 4 times now and every time we were impressed with the quality of food and the service. Our last visit was Saturday April 11th, 2015. 
Food: Their Bomba is a must. It's perfect for sharing. Our favourite is the one with prosciutto. They also always give you three oil: mild, medium hot and hot, for dipping. I personally prefer the mild oil. It gives your food a little extra flavour. For main course, I always like the Carbonara or the Uovo pizza.
Wine: Their wines are from California. I think the restaurant's owner imports the wine from his vineyard in California. Something like that. Their wine is very good. 
Service: Every staff we encountered there so far have been wonderful. They are pleasant. Manager Dimitri is always on the floor to help and talk with diners to make sure everyone is pleased with the service and the food. 
Main reason that we keep going back to Pastizza is that the food is good and the service is always top notch.
