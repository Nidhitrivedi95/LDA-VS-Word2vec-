ttCvYknuofQcSiDebuR4ZQ i used to like Roberto's, honestly. It was a friendly, casual dining spot my husband and I enjoyed on a regular basis. But I don't think we will be back, as their service is so spotty and has really gone downhill.

The waitress we had at our meal tonight was, frankly, unwelcoming, with a "whatever" attitude.  Did not smile once. Within seconds of seating us she was urging us to order... Give us a few frigging moments to read the menu, lady! We were rushed through our first course and had to fight to finish it, otherwise she would have whisked plates with food on them from us. Our mains arrived while we were still eating our appetizers and when we mildy remonstrated with the server, were told that the restaurant was busy so it was take 'em or leave them... Great choice. She then zoomed by for a food check and with food in our mouths, didn't wait for an answer but darted away. Why bother even asking, then?

And pet peeve of mine: please, Toronto servers, do not address a group of ladies of a certain age as "guys". I HATE this. I am not a guy. When and if you start addressing a group of men as "gals" (i.e., when hell freezes over), I may change my mind. Until then, I will express my non-appreciation of this habit come tip time.
