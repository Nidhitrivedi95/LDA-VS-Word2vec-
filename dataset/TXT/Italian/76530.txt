CV05rBOr5DdDGvxUZkRFmg My husband works in the building so we wanted to try it when they opened up. Hostess station has a lot to learn. I made a reservation a week ahead of time and when we were seated no one was in the restaurant so I asked for a booth and they said they were all taken. I then watched two of the booths sit empty while we ate our meal which took several hours. The service was slow for so few people to be in there as well. The portions left a lot to be desired for such a high price. The food was fair, I could have made better carbonara at home (and have).  You should visit Stagioni on Providence if you want good Italian food in Charlotte.
