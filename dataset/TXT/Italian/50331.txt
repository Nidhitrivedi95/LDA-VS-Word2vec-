good pizza
fancy , expensive but not outrageously expensive
clean interior
outside setting with heating lamps to add to setting. 
good drinks (got a green tea, the name of the tea, called "Infusion", lives up to it's name!!!)
the design of the outside, and inside, makes the place a 5/5 for the interior. the food is great! me and a friend shared pizza (toppings were meaty sausage and cheese). the bill didn't come out to a large amount. the wait was a tad excessive. there's a bar. friendly service.


cons:
none for me, been here only once and will never be here again because we were tourists
