Toux3q1WwY2vNV5AhbR6wQ My husband and I were regulars at the old Cibo, and were disappointed in its decline and closure.  I am happy to say that Cibo is back and better than ever!  We had an amazing dinner tonight with mussels, deer carpaccio, beef sugo with fresh pasta and linguine vongole.  Each of these dishes can be disappointing at best if not handled with care, but Cibo prepared each item to perfection.  Fresh whole food ingredients -- no extenders.  We were so impressed with our selections that we splurged and ordered dessert - blood orange cake with Campari sauce and juniper cream.  Absolutely unforgettable!  And a rich coffee French press to accompany the dessert.  The wait staff was friendly, knowledgable and accommodating.  Bravo!  We are so happy Cibo is back -- we will definitely be regulars once again!
