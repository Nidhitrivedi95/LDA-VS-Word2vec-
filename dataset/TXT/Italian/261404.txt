WRbBmXMHmdWOkeGp21OoeA Just noticed this week old gem; beautiful decor and excellent food and service. In this location you don't expect such a modern restaurant. The bar area is very nice and has many TVs to watch sports games.  Our waiter was very polite and had good conversation with the manager as well.
