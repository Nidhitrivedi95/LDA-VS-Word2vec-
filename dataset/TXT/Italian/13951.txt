1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ Being from Italy I usually avoid going to Italian places to eat unless someone else I know eulogizes it. My girlfriend tried this restaurant about a week ago and she loved it. So we had to go back for brunch. 

It's so lovely to find a brunch place that doesn't have the waiting list on a Sunday morning. And it's even better when their staff welcomes you with big smiles and enthusiasm. Ben was our waiter and he did great. Very attentive and personable. 

But the quality of the food is mostly why this restaurant deserves five stars. Everything was fresh: from the crab cakes Benedict (one of the best I ever tasted) to the yogurt parfait and crème brûlé French toast. 

The menu is not very extended as far as brunch, but I guess it's better have few fresh and delicious dishes rather than a list of thirty or forty items you can't choose with ingredients out of a can.

Prices are a bit higher comparing to other breakfast/brunch places ($20 for crab cake Benedict and $14 for creme brûlé French toast) but again, it's about QUALITY. My girlfriend and I were very pleased with the whole experience and we'll definitely go back for brunch or dinner. 

Keep in mind that they also deliver! Ask the delivery menu to your waiter! 
Buon appetito! :-)
