GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA Bone Marrow Ravioli- not good. Liquid in the middle that oozed in your mouth.

They forgot our wine and then pretended they didn't. They were nice about it but it was an empty restaurant and we waited over 15 minutes.

Calamari was good. Weird preparation- it was almost tempeh style, not consistent with an italian restaurant.

Overpriced... but this is Vegas.
