eQCYur0033RkZdh5VjbF8A After watching Master chef Canada and loving the judges, My husband and i decided to try restaurants owned by them.. 
We tried the salmon tartar maki , we weren't impressed at all. Salmon wasn't fresh and had a little fishy taste and the rice of the maki was really cold! I had the braised beef, it was okay and my husband tried the veal chops and loved it.. He also had the virgin caesar drink and loved it as well .. 
Overall i was a underwhelmed with the taste of food as i was expecting so much!
