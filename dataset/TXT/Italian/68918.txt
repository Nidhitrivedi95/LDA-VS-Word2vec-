bUnm0-YK5HicLzkvMWwqjQ I'm am updating this review!!! After posting my previous review the owners commented back wanting me to come back in and were extremely nice about the whole situation. I haven't had an owner be that nice after posting a semi bad review. I went back and met Nicholas. He was so nice and told be the whole background story of this place and how they make everything, along with letting me try the macaroons & gelato. The macaroons were DELICIOUS. I mean, SO good. I ended up going with the lemon gelato which tasted like a glass of lemonade, so refreshing. I'm still not overwhelmed with the price, but the customer service was excellent and I found something I loved. Thank you Nichols & Jeremy!
