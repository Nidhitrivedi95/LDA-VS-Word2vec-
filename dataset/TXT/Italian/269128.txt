XjAb0mxgCtq96pWWJjUBAg Have a great time visiting with family friends from out of town, however regarding Buca, this will be our last visit here. Probably arrived before 6pm and for a restaurant with very few tables seated, this was the longest meal I've ever experienced. Including the 16 yrs I worked in 2 different restaurants. Got salad, then at least 40 minutes for 1 chicken dinner and 1 pasta dinner. You seriously know when you rarely see the server, including drink refills only when you mainly get up and have to ask for them, not a great experience. I always love the part when the server tells you they are short cooks in the back, yet you never see her back for over 25+ minutes, multiple times even for drinks. Which tells me she has more than she can handle. For $140 check, really difficult to even leave her 10% tip. Typically 20%, however whenever you never hear back about food coming, have to ask for drink refills multiple times, you have to wonder IF they are even staffed properly. Also as a note, the spaghetti with marinara sauce literally had a slight bleach kind of taste to it.
