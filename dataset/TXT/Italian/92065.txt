eGTAC8EzcHiYnnZ52tijiQ Came here for the Sunday brunch menu as suggested by a friend. I had some high expectations after how much praise he gave it and I must say, I was not disappointed.

The portions were both large and tasty. We tried both the Key West Eggs and the Slow Roasted Lamb sandwich.

The Key West Eggs had a great hollandaise sauce with a good mix of prawns, avocado and tomato underneath. The eggs were poached perfectly and it all came together very well with the grilled focaccia. The salad of field greens and asiago that came with it filled up the rest of the plate and had a nice balance of dressing to salad ratio. A tasty dish for sure.

Being a fan of lamb, I enjoyed Slow Roasted Lamb sandwich. However, if you can't handle any of the gamey flavour of lamb, I wouldn't recommend this for you. The lamb was tender and flavourful and went well with the rosemary marmalade and mustard.

This is a well known place and it does get pretty packed, so try to get here early (especially on a Sunday).
