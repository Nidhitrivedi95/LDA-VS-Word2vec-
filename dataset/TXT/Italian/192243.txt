pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Poor service and very average food. 
Red sauce and is basically red water. I had the veal parmigiana (typically one of my favorites). Bland!! No flavor to the veal or red sauce. Even the pasta was bland. Smothered it all in parmigiana and red peppers. 
Did I mention the device? Horrible. I've had better service at outback. 
Here's the topper! My wife gives them about 800-$1000 a month in lunch banquet business. And the manger that know her by name couldn't even say hello. Just stand there watching his staff struggle and stare!!
