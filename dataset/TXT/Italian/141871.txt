JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A Went there 5 days ago for the first time at 2am.. Food was not bad at all for a 24 hour restaurant.. Servers are nice and the service was quick. But the servers could be more professional and wear like a united uniform rather than random clothes.. Washrooms are incredibly small and tight.. But overall would visit again if i was around the area  and there is not alot of options..
