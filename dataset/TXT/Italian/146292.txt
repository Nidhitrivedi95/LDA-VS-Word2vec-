K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ This was my very first Vegas club experience, and it was pretty good. Pretty pricey, but it's Vegas... so I guess I should've expected that. The view of the Bellagio fountains is EXCELLENT. 

We were supposed to be on the guest list... but we ended up not being on there so us two girls were able to get in free (+a free drink ticket). The boys however, had to pay (I think) $40 each (and no free drink ticket). A regular cran/vodka was $15.

It was a Tuesday night so it wasnt ridiculously crowded. I thought it was a pretty cool thing that when you buy bottle service, the waitresses come out with these flashing lights and make a big scene all the way to your table. There was a wedding party going on too, so along with all the waitresses and their flashy lights, they put one of the waitresses in a small (like 6ft) boat and the bouncers carried the boat as they walked to the table with a huge bottle of Dom. It was something different :]

Their dancers have very interesting outfits. Maybe it's because I'm from Hawaii, and we don't have that kind of over the top stuff, but it seemed very Lady Gaga-ish. I can't explain it.. The dancers later stopped dancing and walked around giving out free shots (just gotta tip them).

Music was great... Popular hip-hop, things you hear on the radio type of songs :]

I thought it was pretty funny that they handed out stacks of cocktail napkins, and they did a countdown, and everyone flew their napkins in the air. I've seen balloons and confetti... this was my first time seeing napkins!
