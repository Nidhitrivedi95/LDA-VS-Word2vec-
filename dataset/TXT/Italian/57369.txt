anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg From a suggestion from one of our fellow travelers who is in Vegas ALL the time this was a "must-dine-at" place off the Strip.

From the garbage salad to the off menu entrees, everything was great!

Old school Italian at it's pretty much best.

The experience was classic, the service was superb and we had everything we could have ever wanted including a bonus of baked creamed corn.  So wonderful.

Then the bill came.  WOW.  Since most everything was off the menu we have no idea what anything cost.  So, we went with it but next time I'd check because holy smokes!
