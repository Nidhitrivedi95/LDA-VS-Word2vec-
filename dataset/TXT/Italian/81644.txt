dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw My friends and I recently dined at Fiamma. To set the tone, we had eaten at Joel Robuchon on Friday and Olives on Saturday. Fiamma was by far the best food and service. Our waitress was Monica who attended to our needs including drinks; we wanted to share the food so when the items were only 3 pieces - she made sure there were 4. The manager and wine manager were very accomodating. The food was also timed perfectly.  We didn't wait 30 minutes from appetizer to entree to dessert.  They were so nice to put birthday/anniversary dessert.  I'd go back again and quite surprising for a Las Vegas restaurant.  It's a great place to take both adventurouspeople and no so.  They had the best spaghetti and kobe beef meatballs; great grilled octopus; delicious skirt steak.  I recommend sharing the plates with your party so you can try more things on the menu.
