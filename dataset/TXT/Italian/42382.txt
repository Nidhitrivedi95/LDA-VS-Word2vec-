Chef Dan practically lives there and is astonishingly talented especially if it's not too busy and he sends out a little something not on the menu just to try. Hope one of the mega resorts doesn't discover him and steal him away!  I've had diver scallops, Dover sole, great steaks, outstanding risottos, perfect pastas etc. Never a bad meal and way cheaper than similar places due to them serving the 55+ demo that lives at Siena. Don't miss jazz night or other events or when they do a buffet. Really fun. Romantic for me and the mrs with the city views and tablecloth service. Only thing is they close around 7pm again probably due to their customer demos but if you do get there early enough you'll catch the tapas menu. We go about at least once a month and now the staff knows us. Nice. Go to any other place in town and see if the chef comes out and welcomes you by name!
