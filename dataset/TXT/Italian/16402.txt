1WBVqmo7tgF0z0eGf4fPhQ Food portions are a 5-Star.

Food quality 3.5 Star

Restaurant is just a few tables so no way to give that more than 2 stars although it's clean it's just a sliver of tables and they are pretty full. 

Take out service 4 Star

I need to try more stuff in the future but here is what I've tried:
Baked rigatoni:  4.5 star   (Portion size 5 star)
Ravioli with chicken marsala sauce (3 star) 
Garlic Bread: 3 star 
Fetuccini alfredo: 3 star   (Portion size 5 star) 

The portion size is the big plus for this place and the food is pretty darn good!  I will be back.
Try it out!
