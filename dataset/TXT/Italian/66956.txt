bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg Stopped in for dinner with my Wife. We looked online to see the menu/prices. When we got the bill the prices we're off by $6.00 on one drink and $2.00 on the other. When we asked about it, and let the bartender know the web site information we saw, her reply was "yeah, they JUST changed the prices yesterday and they haven't updated our web site yet." I pressed it slightly to see what they would do and she just said "yeah, there not really anything I can do."  Didn't offer to talk to the manager or even a real apology about the mix up. A gentleman walked up to the bar and he appeared to either be a manager or shift supervisor to some degree. I mentioned it to him and he said the same thing about the recent change. I was fine paying it, but it was amazing to me that there was not even the slightest attempt to make it right. I'm not sure if web sites are considered "advertising" but, if they are, this was certainly misleading. The website should have been updated before the price change, not after. 

The food was not bad but not great. We ordered calamari and a pizza. The calamari was good, but the bread that came with it was burnt on the edge. I broke the burnt part off and write it off as not a huge deal. When they brought the pizza out there were three sections around the crust that were really burnt. The bottom had several burnt patches as well. 

Overall, not impressed at all. The second star was for the calamari being very good.
