bXbCGFk3ZjLcTdQQB-xPyQ Excellent service and food. We sat on the patio and it was very well shaded even with the summer heat. Server was knowledgeable of the menu and wine list. We had the scallop crudo and several different entrees. Everyone was pleased with their selection - did have to send back salmon as it was very undercooked. Bread pudding for dessert was a great finale to the dinner. I would go back and I recommend this restaurant. (Chose the exterior for seating because the inside was frigid).
