JlMYSLiLnpWiihmzZkQS-w OMG! Horrible! Ordered Shrimp Scampi and it looked like they used Top Ramen noddles. The pasta was very over cooked and the plate came out like a stir fry. This is my second trip to this place and both wee bad experiences. Forget the service it was what was expected for an Olive Garden but the food is just bad. Move on to somewhere else.  This place is consistently bad.
