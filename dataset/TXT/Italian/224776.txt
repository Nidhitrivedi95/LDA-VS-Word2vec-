sMzNLdhJZGzYirIWt-fMAg I love the decor in this restuarant ! I had the Rocket salad it was really good!  And I had a classic beef meatball on a bun with sunday gravy which is just a marinara sauce it was good!  I definetly want to go back and try some other dishes and appitizers that look really good, The front of the resturant opens up to the outside which is really nice!
