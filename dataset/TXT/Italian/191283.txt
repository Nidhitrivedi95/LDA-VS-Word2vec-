PebX-Sf_h4FJGgsRAA5Fng First time visit tonight. We moved to area about a year ago, been searching for our neighborhood Italian joint and finally found it! Great food (I had the Vongole in white sauce, he had the lasagna). Loved both. Very friendly service. Traditional ricotta cheesecake, made on the premises was absolutely the best. If you haven't been, you just must!
