llCxryWr8j1S39tusYCWxg This is our go to pizza place in Scottsdale.

The 24 inch pizza is massive!  

The staff is friendly and try to make your interactions fun.  

One thing especially that we like is that their pizza sauce is not overall salty.  The crust tastes good and the toppings are fresh and flavorful.  

Da Midtown Meltdown is our favorite Friday night dinner.
