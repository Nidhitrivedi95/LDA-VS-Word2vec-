hAPlM1MJzCqiCfHbQFXXJQ We placed an online order at 6:14 PM. It is now 9:01 PM and our order still has not arrived. We called to inquire twice. The first time, after waiting 2 hours, we were told that our order would be a further 30 min wait. We waited a further 35 minutes and called again. The phone representative apologized for the extremely long delivery time with our order, said that he did not work at the store that we called directly, and said that no one at the store would answer the phone. This sounds promising! Despite a 3 hour wait, he could not tell us when our order would be delivered, offered us a pathetic $10 credit for our next order (why, for any reason, would we order from Pizza Hut again?), and actually encouraged us to cancel our order. Ridiculous!

Before placing the order, we expected a longer than usual delivery time because of the current weather situation outside. However, having to wait almost 3 hours now with no communication from the store, and no indication of when the order might arrive, is just completely unacceptable. Pizza Hut will not receive my business again.
