a-Mo7Ipu_c5y21mmg0-F7g Lovely little restaurant. Don't judge a book by its cover believe me. I had the lobster risotto which was to die for. The chef will make you anything you want from scratch. Marino makes the pasta himself. My husband had a veal chop which was flavorful just needed to be a little more tender. An ambulance of comfort causal and family. I would definitely go back.
