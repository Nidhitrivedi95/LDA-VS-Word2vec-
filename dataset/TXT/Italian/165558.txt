m6rffQy85HUq82DjLq-YJg Twisted Italian was established in 2010 and Changed Ownership and Menu in late 2015. This is a small locally owned restaurant that serves traditional Italian favorites and some very NON TRADITIONAL Italian Food.

They started us off with complimentary bread and balsamic dotted extra virgin olive oil.

We started with a small order of Pierogi of the month (Corned Beef and Cabbage). The Pierogi were prepared "crispy" and were filled with a potato based mixture of flavorful corned beef and a little cabbage. We were pleasantly surprised on how how tasty the pierogi were! ($7.75)

For dinner I tried the European Sea Bass. I received a tasty slightly crusted meaty mild boneless white fish with crispy skin. My patter contained asparagus, grilled tomato and lemony angel hair pasta with capers. Everything was prepared reasonably well and was tasty. ($18.75)

My husband had the Italian RELLENO. It was a Poblano Pepper that was filled with house made sausage and cheese. The relleno was topped with a creamy tomato sauce and big cheese filled fried ravioli were served on the side. ($13.75)

Everything was tasty. Service was efficient. Prices were reasonable.

The food and menu have greatly improved from what this restaurant served years ago.
