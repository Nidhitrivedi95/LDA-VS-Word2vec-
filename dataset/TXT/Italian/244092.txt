USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg My medium grilled elm steak is well cooked but the bacon braised cabbage is just way too salty, the thinly sliced potato gratin is carefully prepared, but a simpler version of potato can be a winner than this. The foie gras is grilled right, but, nothing I especially like it. For this more than $90 dinner, I find the FREE rosemary olive oil and the creamy garlic spread for the FREE bread are way better than the expensive, very oily, salty offerings.  Guess I won't come back.
