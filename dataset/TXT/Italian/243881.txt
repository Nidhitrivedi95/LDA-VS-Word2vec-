usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA We had a wedding reception at Piccolo Forno about a month ago. We could not have picked a better venue for our intimate reception. Nealey, the restaurant manager, helped us plan the event across 8 months. She is very helpful and flexible. On the day of the reception, she and Charlie made sure all of our guests felt comfortable. Everyone LOVED the food and raved about their curry flavored rabbit pasta and tiramisu. Great food & great service!
