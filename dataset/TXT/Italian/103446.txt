Fn_IxcCtZl1EoS81sq_s9w We just ordered 2 extra large pizzas last week when we had friends visiting. The best that we've had since ordering here. Nice to support family owned businesses! Great food!

UPDATE: we have ordered from them twice since the new owners took over and sadly the food has gone downhill. Our latest order on Friday was for a 1/2 pepperoni and half marguerita pizza and I specifically asked the girl if it would be a problem since the pepperoni would have the red sauce. She said it wouldn't be a problem to do the marguerita pizza side with the oil and garlic sauce. I told her I would order two smaller pizzas if it was a problem. We get the pizza and the rest of our order which was wings and knots and sure enough the entire pizza had red sauce. The pizza used to be by far our favorite and now the flavor isn't as good either. So sad. The knots didn't taste the same either. Bummer as we like to frequent small businesses.
