cXgXRqB40CGHEMKQgxLDTg I dine often at different fired pie restaurants around the valley. I stopped at this location for lunch. I like the build it my way pizzas. Today when I asked for multiple meats on my pizza the very crabby girl running the register told me I could not get any more meat toppings. Apparently it isn't build it my way. It is build it her way. This will be the last time I ever use this location. If they want to limit toppings then they had better advertise that policy. Total disappointment in not getting the pizza I was wanting.
