zBsAx28cbiUgqWGjKOGucA I came here on a whim for dinner after looking at all the positive reviews on Yelp! The restaurant is pretty large, with two sections. One looks more like a sports bar while the other has tables and booths. The decor consists of televisions and posters advertising their eating contest.

The menu is helpfully posted on the table. They have many different pizzas, so it was difficult to choose. There were a few where the ingredients seemed like they just don't go well together. After some deliberation, I finally decided on the Fun Guy pizza (play on words on funghi) and the Chicken pizza. It took 20 minutes for the pizza to arrive after ordering. Both pizzas were very tasty. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients. I enjoyed the taste of the cheese mixed with the portabello mushrooms. The arugula was extremely fresh on the chicken pizza. I really enjoyed the goat cheese and the balsamic glaze. The pizzas come with a thin crust and only comes in 12 inch sizes.
