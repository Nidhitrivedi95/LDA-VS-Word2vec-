FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q There are two things that are hard to find in Las Vegas. 

Authentic and good Chinese and Italian Food. I'm not the only one that says that. I have an acquittance from Italy, and know many native Chinese people who live in 
Las Vegas, who say the same. 

Pasta Mia is NOT New York or San Francisco quality, but it is decent for Las Vegas.

My first suggestion is to get there early or make reservations. It fills up fast. 

They bring you out a loaf of house garlic bread, and it is excellent. They charge about $3 for a second loaf, but it is well worth it. 

The service is good, and they do seem to have a good selection of wines. 

The pasta and sauces are acceptable, but not worth "singing" over. 

This is a good place to take the family when you are craving pasta. 

If you are trying to impress someone with your knowledge of Italian food, go on line and see when Southwest has a sale to San Francisco, or Jet Blue is going to 
New York.  You just can't get great Italian food in Las Vegas.
