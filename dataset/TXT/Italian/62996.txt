B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw Came here based on the high rated reviews and I was not disappointed at all in service, food and ambience...

In the beginning, we asked for a bigger table but due to the party size, they refused to budge with that even though we mentioned we will order alot of food which was our intention since we were both very hungry...

So we ended up getting a small table with not alot of space to place our items and we could have barely ordered an entree each as I would have guessed that it wouldn't fit 2 dishes..so they asked if we would sit in the tall tables...we were ok with that thinking we'd get the full tall tables to ourselves but that was not the case...

We ordered the grilled octopus, pasta, pizza, paté and another item...I forgott the name...

The food was very delicious and we were being checked upon in a reasonable time frame...the ambience is more loud...not a fine dining place obviously..but you will not be disappointed in the foood and service which is more than 66% according to my personal standards...2/3 important items hit..!! 

It is slightly on the pricey side but I will come back!
