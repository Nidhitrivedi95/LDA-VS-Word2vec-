hP55G7ciHn30UeoZ72Japw Surprisingly good plain cheese pizza! And I say that as a New Yorker used to New York thin crust pies. Let me explain that. So initially I was disappointed as it's a thicker pizza and NOT a crispy crust. BUT then I tasted it! And I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised. I equate the texture to ur standard NY sicilian pie which is a fav of mine. Their sauce and cheese are super tasty. I also order cheese sticks w fries to give those a try. Again, wonderful flavor for both! Only got thru half of those and my slices so lunch for tomorrow is covered too!

Only 2 downsides. One. It took SO long to get the food. FOR 2 slices and some fried sides 30 mins is a bit too long in my book. Second, and I really hate to mention it cause I know this will freak some folks out but I did find a small piece of hair on my plate under one of the slices. Eww yes but not gonna make me sick eww (like being served and eating raw chicken like at another place I could mention). Would have been worse if it was actually IN the food. But the manager came over, apologized and offered to make good with replacements so that satisfied me. It's food service and things like that can happen. 

So all in all I'll definitely return  very delicious meal :-)
