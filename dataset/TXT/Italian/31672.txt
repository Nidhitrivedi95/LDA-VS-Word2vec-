5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ These people are shady. They say their delivery charge is 3.50 which I've never even been charged in the past. Myself and about 4 others usually order lunch here. We work right across the street. So what happened the last time we ordered? They hit each of us with about 9 dollars extra. I ordered a 9 dollar sandwich and was charged 16.50. How does that add up? And each of us? So your delivery guy got about 40 bucks for walking across the street? Screw you, I'll be talking to my bank. You not only lost about 50 bucks a day, but you're going to be losing out on the total. Idiots.
