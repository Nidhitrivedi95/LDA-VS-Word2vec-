pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Nora's is definitely an Italian spot you want to hit up if you're into Italian food and wanting to dine away from the strip. I got the Rigatoni special ($15) and my girlfriend got the Alla Nora ($12.50). Both prices and portions were perfect for what we paid. In fact, my dish was probably 60% meat if not more. The ratios for my dish was incredible and left me feeling beyond satisfied. Additionally, I might add that my girlfriend's dish had exquisitely fried and crispy mushrooms to compliment.
Pro tip: don't build your own pasta unless you're willing to spend a lot more. You will get more off the original dishes if you do substitutions. 3 pieces of shrimp (literally 3 pieces only) is a $5 charge and 5 pieces is an $8 charge. To me, that's absurd for an establishment that's not necessarily upscale.
To conclude, I would come back here and try another dish because I know I'd leave satisfied and pleased. However, I'd simply hope that the wait to be served isn't as long. There were probably 2 waiters in our section running around, while 5 other employees were cleaning tables together.
