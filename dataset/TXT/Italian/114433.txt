Gm---0O1y_4TAQAl5qKvqQ This is one of those rare places where the vegan and the carnivore are both happy. On my pizza, fig, goat cheese, grilled onion, and of course, bacon. Mr. vegan had it a little differently and he had cauliflower puree sauce on his personal pizza. Also, highly recommended, get one of the salads and split it. Again both the vegan and the carnivore can be happy this way. There are fresh seasonal ingredients in the salads like ground cherries! This is rare and special. Blow off the chains and check out this great spot. It is well worth a little Drive off of I-90 to get to Sun Prairie in Wisconsin. Gas up at Costco and go here to have dinner.
