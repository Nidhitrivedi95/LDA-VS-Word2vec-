sHnN3JliwVWvGX76Odmlbw Went here for an intimate dinner and had the chef's table tasting menu.  We had 4 apps to share, 2 pastas, 1 main and a dessert plate.  So worth it and everything was enjoyable, including the main entree - skirt steak.  The apple pannacotta was the stand-out dessert on the apple dessert plate and arguably, one of the best pannacottas I have ever had in this city.

The pastas were the main draw for us and I would have to agree that fresh pasta definitely tastes much more decadent.  The accompanying sauces were soooo good and I had to restrain myself from licking the plate.  I have tried a fair share of Massimo's italian restaurants and a smattering of other Italian restaurants in the city and I have to say I was ultra pleased with Local's Italian menu and I definitely felt that the meal was worth every dollar.

By the way, we picked up that most of the seasonal produce is straight from a family farm in King City - and you can definitely taste the freshness of the local produce.  It's still farm-to-fresh dining but not overpriced, stuffy and you don't feel ripped off at the end of the meal (Mark McEwen, I beg you to note this for future consideration).
