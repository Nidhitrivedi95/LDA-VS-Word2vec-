Im0hMcWaqWIzuBM8xILDsA We went without reservations on Mother's Day.  They still managed to find us a table for my wife and 2 kids.  We greatly appreciated that, as we were in the mood for some nicer fare.

The service was impeccable.  Exactly what I would expect from a higher end restaurant.  Bussers to take empty plates almost as soon as you have laid down your silverware.  Servers helping each other out and friendly to each other.  The owner came around often to check on everyone's dishes.

The food was fantastic.  The pasta is fresh, not dried, so it has an amazing texture to it.  Wife got Chicken Parm, and while it's not hard to screw up that dish, it was fantastic.  Fresh tasting sauce without too much punch.  I got the ribeye "Simply Seasoned".  It had a fantastic flavor, was tender, and cooked perfectly.  The potatoes with spinach and bacon were amazing, also.

For Mother's Day, they also gave my wife a $25 gift certificate, so I guess we will definitely be going back.

Excellent job TRIV!
