GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ A few weeks back I stayed at The Venetian and heard this new place opened up downstairs. We decided to give their casino bar a shot and were impressed by the beer selection. Levi (at the bar) gave us a good rundown of what they carried and suggested some tasty brews which to taste and I loved them. We decided to come back in the morning for breakfast and I ordered the "hangover burger" which was friggin' delicious! Just what I needed on a Vegas Sunday morning. I highly recommend eating outside for the view. Next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely come back for more.
