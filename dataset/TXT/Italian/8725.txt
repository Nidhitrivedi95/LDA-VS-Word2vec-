0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ This was our first time to novecentro, as a former customer of chef Marc's Parma I was expecting great thing as his food at that restaurant was good. 
First off the ordering process upon entering the restaurant is confusing. 
Second, the toppings an individual coat for each topping? Understood of the items are made on house but a small 10" pizza can get pretty expensive when adding 3 or more toppings. 
Third, salad size for a large and the cost is not comparable. 
Forth, the ambiance of the restaurant is confusing. It's like a restaurant that wants to be a sports bar that wants to be a pizzeria. I felt like it needed a make over from restaurant impossible on the food network. 
Overall I don't like to write reviews like this but it surely was disappointing when other restaurants such as pieology or blaze is offering fresh unlimited toppings for one price.
