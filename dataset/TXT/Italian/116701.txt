GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q Super nice people and outstanding food make this family owned non-pretentious sandwich shop a stand out.  I think it is a Mom and Pop with a few daughters running the place. They are all super sweet.  

The cheese steak is out of this world.  It is not your Philly style cheese steak. But it is a must have for me.  The meatball and Italian beef subs are a close 2nd choice.  And the cold Italian Combo sub, also delicious!  And I dig the yummy potato salad.  And definitely do not miss out on the amazing cookies ... off the hook!!  

They close at 6 PM, so hurry up and call in your order!
