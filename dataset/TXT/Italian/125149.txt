hr0vxeTzlHx6fTpSSmu2AA I was surprised to see nobody has written a review of this fine establishment yet, so I decided to write one, even though it has been quite a while since the last time I visited. 

If you may believe the website, this restaurant serves Italian and Creole soul food. A quick look on their menu tells that they split both cuisines, rather than fusing them. The menu has creole/cajun entrees as well as Italian dishes, which are mostly home made pastas. What I remember most vividly is an excellent New York Strip steak with a heavy, full-bodied red wine. My dining experience, quite honestly, does not require more than that.

But Russo's does offer more. The ambience is one of a buzzing, happening, and chattering place. People seemed happy to be there. There is the opportunity to take a booth or to sit at the bar, from where you can see the cooks at work. The same goes for the staff and service. Although it might've been the wine, the waitress' charm left me slightly in love with her at the end of my meal.
