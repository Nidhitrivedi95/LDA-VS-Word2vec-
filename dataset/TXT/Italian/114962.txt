GnODIDJz09LecpudDoynCg We have been here many times and the pizza is wonderful. The thin crust is awesome and all the ingredients are fresh. The atmosphere is quaint and unique and can be very crowded. It can be very loud which there is not much you can do anything about. 
The problem we encountered last week was one we have run into before. The owner who is usually seating people every night and some of the other staff are not friendly at all. The other rude person we have encountered is the bartender! Such a turn off as bartenders can really warm up a small place like this. He was out of his way RUDE! 
The night we were there last week was busy as usual but once we sat down we waited 55" for our pizza. We ordered 3 large pizzas all the same. They came out 1 at a time with about 6-8" between each! No explanation or apology and 1 of them had no tomatoes which was one of the main ingredients as we ordered the special of the night. The other problem was one of our party ordered a salad as her main course and it came when we were half way done eating. We reminded the waitress in the beginning of the meal she hadn't gotten her salad and the waitress said "yea I know". 
It is a shame this all happened as we took out of town friends there bragging of how wonderful this place was. We were actually embarrassed. I am thinking we will not go back there. There are many other places with the same feel as this restaurant with wonderful friendly staff (Lombordinos) and food is wonderful there as well. I even tried to contact Greenbush through email and on their web site there is no place for feedback...Mmmmm.
