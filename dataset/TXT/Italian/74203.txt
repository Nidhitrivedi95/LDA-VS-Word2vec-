cpkBJhBujpBFZ0rOItE-4g The food was amazing, we started with the Calamari & Ouster
Rockefeller all I can say is Oh my Gosh! Then my Daughter and I shared had the Duck Ravioli it was to die for. My Husband had Seafood Ruffino and my Son had the Fettuccini Ruffino.  The best part of our experience was the beautiful classic Jazz music of Dr. Jesse McGuire,  that set the tone of the evening. It was just the right volume we could have a nice conversation and his voice was like butter.  Can wait to go back again.
