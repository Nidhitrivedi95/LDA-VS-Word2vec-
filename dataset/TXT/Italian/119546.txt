H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g I really liked this place. I dined alone here on October 9th for lunch.  I was seated in the "bar" which was more of a prep area.  The waiter came and brought me my iced tea quickly.  He recommended the spaghetti and meatballs to me, which I ordered. Even though the restaurant was not busy, it did take quite a while for the food to arrive, however it was probably the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had.  The sauce was on the spicy side, which I like and the meatballs were pretty much bite size.  

I did not order desert and since this was lunch, I cannot speak to the wine menu but would recommend it for lunch if you have the time.
