And they referred to me as "Miss ___" when we walked up at our reservation time. This place was suggested by the concierge at the MGM, where we happened to be staying. 

I am also very fond of bread, and they give you lots of yummy bread, which I inhaled. Quite literally. 

I had the black cod, which I've never had before, so I don't have much to compare to, but I've had fish before, and this was a yummy piece of fish. It was served with potatoes, also very yummy, and olives, which I didn't really care for, but they looked yummy. My bf had a pasta dish with sausage, which was good too (I suppose yummy, if I had to describe with one word), but the pasta was a little too al dente for our tastes. 

5 starts for the food, but -1 star for the photographer lady who tried to sell us six pictures and wallets for $179.79.
