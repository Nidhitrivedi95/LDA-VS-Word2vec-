The recommender did mention issues with getting a table (perhaps of the sort the prior reviewer mentioned of not being able to sit at a six person table with four people) but said once you were seated everything was fine. The entrance is on Milton, although the sign is around the corner, so we walked right past initially. Among the four of us we tried lasagna, spaghetti with meatballs and a half cheese/ half mushroom pizza.  The restaurant is small, and clearly is a popular local / McGill hangout. We arrived at 11:30 for lunch, and by noon the restaurant was half full. The pizza was very cheesy, with the type of crust that I think of as Greek (rightly or wrongly). By that I mean less salted and buttery than pizza I am used to. We used forks and knives for our pizza, because the cheese overwhelmed the crust. Our servers were friendly, and we had a nice meal.
