Grr2wJ3nYD_7qUyespDglA We came here after a night out on Adelaide. The food here is great and the service is excellent. The owner gave us free pizza and let us try the corrado's salad he made for himself. The rice balls are amazing and the corrado's salad was even better. The pizza was good too. They seem to really take care of their customers. The people next to us got a free size upgrade on the pizza they ordered. Definitely a great late night food joint
