7JWWeXqil03Ua_wV9KN8ZQ Had the chicken parmigiana-- it was quite good. Wife had the lobster ravioli and it was equally as good. I would've given them five stars but the service was a bit off tonight. They were quite busy so I will cut them some slack. Server forgot a few things and it took some time for someone to recognize us when we walked in because the hostess was on the phone.
