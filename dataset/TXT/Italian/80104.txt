d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew Street of New York... food is unoriginal but tasty and traditionally comforting. The normal; pizza, pasta, salads and generic pizzeria appetizers. Great selection of drafts beers and reasonably priced glasses of wine. 

I would continue eating at the restaurant, although I would never actually dine inside at this location again. It is absolutely impossible to receive and simple smile or a thank you from ANY of the staff. Overall the service is mediocre and extremely un-friendly. You will have a better chance of receiving better service from the giant rat at Chuck E Cheese's.
