bXbCGFk3ZjLcTdQQB-xPyQ From what I was told, Luciano's had been open for only a week or two when I ate here in early May. The ambiance was somewhere between casual and upscale, with lighting that was dim enough for a comfortable dinner and nice ambient lighting around the ceiling. I was with a party with mixed attire -- some jeans, some shirts and ties, the women in skirts and blouses -- and no one seemed to have a problem with it. There's a lovely patio, but I don't care for eating outside so I'd be unlikely to sit there.

I would go to Luciano's just for the strawberry panna cotta alone. This was my first time ever eating panna cotta and it was a life-changing moment for a girl who loves her sweets. In all honesty, two of those stars are for the dessert, one and a half are for the meal, and one and a half are for the service and atmosphere.

As for the meal itself, I had a luscious black spaghetti with bay scallops, shrimp, and mussels; the menu online indicates that it's black linguine but I suppose they might have changed that since the menu was created. The peppery tomato sauce was gorgeous. My husband had salmon oreganata, which I got to taste and I enjoyed it. As a bread lover, I had to make myself stop eating the complimentary bread and sundried tomato spread that the server brought out before the meal. My friend ordered goat cheese pomodoro to share and I could gladly make a meal of that. The food was all tasty and worth the price. 

Service was attentive and welcoming, including a visit to our table from the manager. All of the staff did their jobs well and with pride.

On a small side note, I appreciated that the ladies' room had a bottle of mouthwash and little cups on a side table. We were going out after the meal and I didn't want my breath to smell of garlic. Maybe I just don't go to enough classy joints to have encountered this before, but I liked it.

Luciano's will definitely be on my list of good places to go for Italian food.
