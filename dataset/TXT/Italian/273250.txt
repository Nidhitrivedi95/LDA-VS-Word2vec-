xZeMt4Vg-P9PTyLgCe5phg Amazing Food, Amazing Atmosphere, Amazing Service!  We have eaten here 4 times in the past 3 weeks and it was spot on every time.  We have tried the Med. Pizza with the gyro meat and it is now my favorite go to pizza.  Also tried the Italian pizza, the Greek Salad, Chicken Parmesan, Philly Steak Sandwich, Calzone and Spaghetti.  They were very accommodating to customize the Calzone for us.  Most of the dinner entrees are big enough to share if you add a salad or soup.  I am a real soup foodie and have had 3 different ones here and each blew me away.  Oh, and love those fresh baked breadsticks!  We will be back.
