It's not cheap, but the quality of the food is supreme.  The antipasto was standout--several quality meats and cheeses and all the rest of the ingredients were unquestionably fresh.  My pizzas have always been perfection--a perfect medium-thin crust with tasty sauce and a compelling combo of cheeses I can't identify.  It's the kind of food you don't feel tempted to gorge on because each bite is savorable and satisfying.

Be sure to call before you show up--their hours are minimalist.  Be prepared to park in one of the neighboring lots as there's not much space.  Bring cash.
