YvrylyuWgbP90RgMqZQVnQ Best place to hangout for great food after a tour of Ripley's Aquarium and CN tower. I went there with my family and had the BEST homemade lasagna and pizza plus they serve alcohol. Everything is made from scratch and from basic ingredients. Ambiance is cool and staff are very friendly. MUST GO!
