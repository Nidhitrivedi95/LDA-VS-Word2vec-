dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg Ate here with 2 friends after reading the stellar reviews.  Overall, the food was very good, but the service was a little slow and it is a little pricey for what you get.  Basically, if you are fairly hungry you pretty much have to get an appetizer plus dinner because the entree sizes are kind of small.  I had the Bocatini, which is kind of a thick noodle, like a chow mein noodle, with like a pot roast type meat.  It was EXCELLENT.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and kind of chewy..it was awesome.  I also had a shrimp and white bean appetizer which was very good.  The house bread they gave us was tasty as well.  Everyone else enjoyed their food as well.  I also had the chocolate cake for dessert which was quite tasty, as it had a little layer of crunchy in it to go with the smooth cake.

Now, the food was excellent and we would definitely go back, but I can't give it 5 stars.  It took a fair amount of time for anyone to bring us menus, the food took quite a while to come out and overall the service was not bad, just really slow.  Also, $20 for a pretty small bowl of pasta is a little steep if you ask me.  As I said, the entrees are pretty small...I mean, without an appetizer you would definitely be hungry after just the pasta.  My little bowl of white beans and shrimp was $14, the pasta was $20 and the slice of cake was $7.  Not extreme by any means, but combined with the slow service and the relatively small portions, I take 1 star.  However, I would definitely return and would recommend it.
