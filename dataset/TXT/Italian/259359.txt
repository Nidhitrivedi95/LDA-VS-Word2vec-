WKlMFUCGI7dCysGkFLWvaQ I went to Stagioni (South Side location) with a group of eight people on a Wed night. My food was melt in your mouth, savor every bite, good. The house-made mozzarella and pasta were highlights. Everyone else at the table also raved about their meals. Nice drink selection. Good service. This may be my favorite restaurant in the city.
