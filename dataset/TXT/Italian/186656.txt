Orgm9nmcClxnAUva4nOKyA The Hot House is an overrated place that old people go to and the buffet was despicably disgusting. The food reminded of a school cafeteria and even a school lunch would've been better. The cakes were dry, the create your own pasta was bland and had no taste, and the lasagna looked like it had come out of a freezer. I would not recommend this establishment, avoid at all costs, and enter at your own risk.
