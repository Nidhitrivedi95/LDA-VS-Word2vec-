We tried the 3 pasta special & while the pastas were homemade, there was only one on the plate we actually finished.  One had sun-dried tomatoes, but the tomatoes were overwhelming.  Another had artichokes, but they were bits of the actual leaves rather than the meat or heart of the artichoke & so eatiing it was trying to chew through those fibrous leaves & it was abandoned.  

The 3rd was a butternut squash which, while tasty, was a smidge sweet, but it was the only one we finished.  

The caeser salad was fresh romaine & a delicious dressing.

We had to try the tiramisu.  I know that it's typically made with leftover ladyfingers but I've gotten used to having fairly fresh ones & these tasted stale.  They also weren't layered uniformly, so about half of it didn't even have any.

We ordered a bottle of wine, but they didn't have what was listed (which always perturbs me).

Overall, my take is that it could be a fantastic restaurant, but more for the tourist crowd.  I might try it again for lunch.
