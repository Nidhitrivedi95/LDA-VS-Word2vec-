wp5FAtCGMyU2RnQ-7kxKHQ This was our 4th time having dinner. Food was excellent but what made it so enjoyable was our server, Maurice. He us by far the best server I have ever had in over 45 years . He was exactly what s server should be. He was fantastic, very enjoyable. Use him to train your staff and I hope we can have him next time we visit.  4 stars for the restaurant and 5 stars++ for Maurice.  Please make sure you let him know .
