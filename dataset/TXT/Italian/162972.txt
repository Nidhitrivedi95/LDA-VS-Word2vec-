lvv9Vv_5i4IwvDdofO_rKg I'm pleased to say that I am upping my review to five stars. I come in here often for a drink after work and sit at the bar. The bartenders are always friendly and funny. last night I had dinner on the patio with my best friend and her little 3 year old daughter. Not having children myself and working in the service industry, dining with a kid is something new for me.Thankfully, the child is question is super duper cute and well behaved.

We ate on the patio and it was a great atmosphere. Tables aren't crammed in and the shrubbery and landscaping were lovely.

Our server was great with everything including bringing out a new pasta without cheese for the little lass. We had a bottle of wine and some olives, arancini, fried cauliflower, then a burrata salad and the mushroom truffle pizza. The crust was absolutely perfect-- crispy and light and the toppings were delicious. 

What a show with the birds in neighbouring trees when the sun went down! They all began calling to one another and chirping wildly until it got dark and they were settled in the branches. 

I'm satisfied that this location does a solid job of everything. I usually shy away from chain restaurants-- especially ones in the mall, but I'm consistently surprised by the level of service, quality of food and overall positive vibe of this restaurant. 

Well done and Thanks!
