XD0LjNuPPwJPsTAHecUh7A Oh Terroni... what happened to you?  Once upon a time you were a place to take a date for delicious, Italian food with some nice wine.  Or maybe a dinner party with a few couples where you could enjoy conversation over a nice meal in a wonderful ambiance... 

I had not been to this Terroni location before and had not been to a Terroni in almost a year so I was surprised at how crazy this place was.  It's a massive restaurant that was just brimming with children running around the restaurant. It felt like I was at a chucky cheese with kids running up and down the stairs. 

Maybe there was some birthday parties going on?  I don't know.  

I'm giving it 3 stars because the food was delicious...  and served surprisingly fast.  Here's a weird note: I asked for parmesan cheese on my pizza and the server refused to provide the cheese due to the instructions of the chef... I found that odd.  He tells the servers which food he feels should have parmesan and which shouldn't... If I want to put peanut butter on my pasta, who cares?  Why deny a guest of your restaurant parmesan cheese for their pizza?  I'm paying for it right?  

Would I visit here again?  Probably not... I might try the Adelaide or Queen Street location again.
