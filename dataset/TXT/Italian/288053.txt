zoYIwHGvnglmrZD0RqhRIA Ok the food here was pretty good. I had the Chicken Parmesan which was just as good as any other Italian restaurant. We also got a veal dish that my friend loved. We got ice cream, the chocolate, and pistachio were really good. We also got the liminochello cake thing which sucked major. 

Fact is i would have rated this restaurant like a four if the service did not suck big time. It was practically empty, and it took so long for us to get anything. Our meal ended up taking around 2 hours because how slow the service took. 
We also used a groupon we bought and since we had two groupons and 4 people they made us sit at two different tables. 
Overall the food was good but nothing you cant get elsewhere, and the service is not worth it. I suggest you find a different place to eat.
