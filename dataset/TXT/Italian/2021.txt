-L88B-PrtzwujhLuYc2k_g Hold on to your forks. It's going to be a bumpy service. After having been sat by a very nice woman, we had a different waiter come to our table and argue with her. He was fighting over our table, and apparently he won. Which is too bad because he was the worst waiter. After regaling us with tales of behind-the-scenes waiter and management intrigue, he tried to get us to change our appetizer order and then proceeded to disappear for the majority of the meal. Food was boring and rote Italian family fare. Finally got a glass of wine halfway through my meal. Other customers seemed to have the same problems we did. One couple showed up and sat for 15 minutes with menus. After no one came to take their order, they got up and left. Wish that had been us.
