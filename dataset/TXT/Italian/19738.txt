2XHQdSM_FvQ7-PUUKaNDCw NEVER AGAIN!

I ordered Cutlet Parmigiana: It was microwaved dry like a beef jerky with tomato sauce and nasty processed cheese on top. it tasted like a frozen HungryMan meal i even think the HungryMan FROZEN meal taste better. I only had two bits and i couldn't continue I told the waiter and he just told me that he can offer me a free coffee and desert lol i didn't even have a meal i REFUSED and i payed the full bill and left.

My wife ordered The Grilled Chicken Supeme
It was boiled not grilled (microwaved) and dumped in nasty sauce with no flavor 

Never going THERE again and i will never ever recommend it to anybody go buy a frozen dinner instead its cheaper and will taste better.

This is not Italian food.
