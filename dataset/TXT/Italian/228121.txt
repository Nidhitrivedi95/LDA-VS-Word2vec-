SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog Amazingly tasty!!! Long road trip & was still open at 9pm! We had a very good waitress! Not only was she professional, she did not hesitate when we asked her about items on the menu! So we ended up with very satisfying entrees! If you find yourself in Chandler , AZ. You gotta try this place. Huge salad and bread before dinner. The kids Pizza is fresh and not frozen! LOVE this place!
