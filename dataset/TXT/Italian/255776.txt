vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA Great spot, the ambience is old school Vegas with a modern twist. The food and service is excellent!
As a view people mentioned, before you eat, the server will come over with a few items. These include, bread, spicy pepperoni, pickled cauliflower and a fresh small block of parmigiana.
The octopus appetizer was good, not great but good. The baked clams appetizer was very good!
We also tried the meatballs which are great, the veal Parm which was fantastic and the spicy vodka rigatoni, which was awesome!
My favorite Italian place on the strip thus far
