tshN5rYRrzanHu4ZiwCVrA My beautiful family was trying to seat 25+ in our group at Olive Gardens (the number initially was 32+). We waited an hour and a half and still wasn't seated. After speaking to management and learning they weren't actually setting up our table, 11 of us left. Before we left management was fully aware of us knowing their v review was already bad and we were about to kill their ratings. My group that left has gone to Red Robin, already seated, and drinks and appetizers already ordered. Thankfully the manager is personally seating the remaining of he 14 in our family. Thank you cousin for trying to do this for the family. You definitely didn't have control of this. This was one of the worst customer services I've had in a very long time. I drank two glasses of wine. My grandson needed water and my sick mom needed bread and water while waiting. I would not recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy. The management was aware I and my family is about to leave a bad review.
