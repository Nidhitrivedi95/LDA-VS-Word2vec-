The reviews for the Italian Beef persuaded me to stray a little from my recent routine that includes as much fiber a possible during breakfast and lunch. Gladly, I indulged in said sandwich with no regret. Get the giardinara and cheese melted. This place will make you feel happy and glad you're a human being.
