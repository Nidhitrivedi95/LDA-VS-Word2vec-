jiVbuskwGD1uu46eAha0pQ Pioneer Pizza showed up recently on our Just Eat listings, and I had an offer code, so we figured it was worth trying.
We ordered the Pioneer Special Pizza, (Green peppers, green olives, onion, mushroom, pepperoni and bacon) with a pound of mild wings, Chicken Parmigiana Sandwich, and Breadsticks.

I was very impressed with the wings, very likely, the best and biggest wings we have ever had delivered, they were very well cooked and very tasty.
The pizza was very good as well, lots of toppings, and well cooked.
I was too full to try the chicken parm, I'll have it tomorrow, but it was huge.

The only kind of weak point was the bread sticks, when everything else was that good, they were a bit bland.
However the garlic dip that came with the pizza was very nice on the sticks.

Delivery was very friendly, will for sure order from them again.
