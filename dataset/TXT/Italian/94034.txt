eKWop65yuFRJtnevX7pTCw This Sat. night they were understaffed but polite. We had a Amazon Local deal, which always makes me a bit more patient (except when an otherwise amiable staffer intimates that some of these were "frauds" and has to verify that it's OK to use-this happened) My bad- should've mentioned at the beginning and not near the end of dinner.

Went online and did a reservation only 2 hrs in advance-they hadn't seen it, so we ended up having to wait about 25 mins for a table. The lady who seated us polite and professional, explaining the staffing situation-got the feeling the res wouldn't have helped much.

Baby lamb chops were terrific, balsamic reduction for dipping very tasty.  Grilled portobello on the side was excellent. Wifey liked her lobster ravioli. 29/21, respectively-would've felt better about 25/18-19 but I'm quibbling. And it's 11.50- but the blood orange martini is a must have.

Recommended-hopefully they can overcome the staffing issues everyone's having in the restaurant biz.
