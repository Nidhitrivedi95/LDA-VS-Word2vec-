nOykFBuMLOuw3ZB2WTk50g Service is terrible here! We had to wait over 10 minutes for a table when there are many plenty of tables available because they have to 'set up a table' which involves putting a stack of plates on the table. 

It takes another 15 minutes before a waitress even comes by. 

This was on an afternoon when the restaurant wasn't able vendors busy. I'd hate to think what a regular night is like here.
