f0EH8nEFjQomm7bkCcmCSQ What an outstanding place. A friend of ours recommended this place and I am glad they did. We started off with a calamari appetizer which was delicious. My wife and a friend had the salmon special, I had the Penne alla Pasquale's with shrimp and another had the Ravioli d;Aragosta. All were excellent. The chimichurri sauce they serve with bread is simply outstanding. This place is off the beaten path but certainly worth the trip. You won't be disappointed.
