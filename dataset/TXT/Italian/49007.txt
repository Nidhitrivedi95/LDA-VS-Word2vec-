9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw Pizza looks amazing and tastes ok. Not quite cooked enough. Crust is a bit doughy. The slice flops over. Soggy pizza isn't my thing nor do i like to eat my slice with a fork and knife. Fresh and large basil on top is a plus. Cheese is fresh and great tasting. Service is pretty mediocre. Hostesses and servers seem distracted and not very attentive. Wouldn't return. And the ABC PHX pizza ranking is dead wrong. This is not the #1 pizza in PHX. That's still Bianco for me.
