07HZ70wpawSANXKK4CkqpQ We have eaten here a half dozen times. The food is excellent and deserves 4 or 5 stars. But the service, while friendly, is excruciatingly slow. Today a family group of 12 - 5 adults and 7 kids -we went for a lunch of salads and pizza. Our order was not complicated. The meal took 1-3/4 hours!!  The residents would absolutely love this restaurant if it just had quicker service. The food is good and the environment nice and the service friendly but it is so slow that I had to subtract 4 stars because of it.
