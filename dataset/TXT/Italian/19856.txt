2Zd3yaOcmUTYhIcI2DNfDA Me and my family have been coming to this restaurant for the past five years and have noticed recently a major decline in customer service. Cashiers are young and rude and not informative about changes in the menu. We came in for dinner and noticed while paying that the bill was substantially higher than normal, even after ordering from  a set price off the menu, when we questioned the cashier she rudely responded there was a surcharge of $3.00 for traditional wings over boneless. There is no sign indicating a charge on the menu or the counter, there was no warning by the cashier either. I also checked the receipt and there was no separate charge but it was included in total (picture attached). It would of been nice to have the option to pay extra or not, bad service.
