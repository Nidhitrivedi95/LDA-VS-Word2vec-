fxZOOJtT6Zau7Asmppigkg Worst experience ever! Ordered on GrubHub and started out not a huge deal, I ordered extra ranch and marinara to go with breadsticks and boneless wings. When the order arrived the driver refused to even enter the hotel lobby. When i arrived back to my room, not only was the food cold, ALL of the sauces were missing. Unfortunately the hotel did not have marinara or ranch that I could purchase. I called the restaurant and asked if they could send the sauces. The man who answered the phone stated he would send them as soon as a driver arrived back. 20 minutes went by and it was my first meal of the day, so I just ate the food. I called the restaurant back to ask them to cancel the missing items as they were no longer needed. A different man answered the phone and rudely told me to wait. He handed the phone to yet another gentleman who the proceeded to call me a liar and began to scream at me stating they were never actually going to deliver the missing sauces as I had been lying about them not being in the box the entire time. I would never order here again. The boneless wings were way over cooked and spongy and the breadsticks were bland and tough. They also definitely need to work on customer support.
