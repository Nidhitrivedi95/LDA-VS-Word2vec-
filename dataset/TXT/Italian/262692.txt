wuHPirjfXUCpNL3XO_vHUg Food is terrible (my pizza tasted like frozen delisio from the grocery store). The pasta sauce was bland. It's definitely NOT Italian food. 
When we first moved to brooklin it was good. But it's been on a steady decline for a while now and our last visit solidified it . Won't go back. The manager didn't even seem to care our food was inedible 
Service was decent enough .but that doesn't make up for the quality of the food.
