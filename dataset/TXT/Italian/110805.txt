G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Been to Giada's a couple of times since it opened a year ago.  We have had some up and down experiences, but the experience we had last night was better then most.  We arrived early for our reservation and the hostess stated that they were running on time and we would not be able to be sat early.  She did explain we were more than welcome to sit in their lounge and someone would come and get us closer to our reservation time.  We did request a table by the window or a booth and we were gratefully accommodated with a booth.  We had the risotto, spaghetti, and the orzo meat balls.  The food was outstanding, but what truly made the meal was our service.  The waiter was very attentive and made us feel very welcome throughout the night.  Lastly I also did have an old fashion and it was one of the best I have had in my life.  Nicely done.
