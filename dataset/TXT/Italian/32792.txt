Our original plan was Romo, but the 1-1/2 hour wait deterred us and we found Il Bosco and what a find it was! The atmosphere was comfortable and casual. The owner was very attentive with a great sense of humor. All good, but nothing compared to the quality of the food. From the delicious olives and bread with seasoned olive oil that got us started, to the fresh salad and finally to four of the best pizzas! We tried white and red; all had perfectly thin crusts with the right amount of dough around the edge and each was topped with wonderfully fresh cheese or other inventive ingredients. Exquisite!  The party didn't end there - we finished off with lemon sorbetto which just perfect and the youngest members of our group had the stamina for the pumpkin brownie.  We all decided when we left dinner that this place was going to get a return visit on our next business trip.
