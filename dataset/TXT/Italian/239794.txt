u9R0_pvEkl7QGPJYH3j1sg One of my favorite breakfast spots.  I come here on weekends with my boyfriend.  They offer a full menu of breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  For breakfast they always have specials which tends to be pork chops and eggs, Chorizo scramble, or Eggs Benedict.  I usually get the letter D combo, which is eggs, bacon or sausage, and french toast.  I get my eggs scrambled with their homemade salsa!  It's the perfect amount of food for only $4.95.  Awesome deal!  

I've also had their Margherita pizza and Pasta Giovanni.  They are both scrumptious!  All their food looks good so I'll have to try some new dishes!
