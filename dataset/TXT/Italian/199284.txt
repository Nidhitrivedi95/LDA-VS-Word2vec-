pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I don't understand the hype...AT ALL. The ingredients are fresh but the pizza sauce is bland....no flavor! The bread they served before the meal was cold and just nothing special. The salad we ordered was spring greens with vinaigrette dressing....I could make it at home. Service was great BUT other than that I can't understand why so many people were waiting in line to spend $20 on a blasé pizza and salad. I don't see myself ever going back. Save your time and money... go to Spinatos for far better pizza or Nellos for better salad.
