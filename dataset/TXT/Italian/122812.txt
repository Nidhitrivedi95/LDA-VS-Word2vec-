hHgSUnDB9yIrxUEMSmsdoQ I stopped by here recently with my wife for dinner.  We were in Oakland looking for somewhere to eat whenever Piadas came up on Yelp.  Since my wife is Italian and it said Italian Street Food I figured that I would ask her what it was.  She had no clue but we decided on heading over anyways.  Upon entering the restaurant we were at first a little confused as there was a giant menu in front of us with a limited number of entrees. However after watching a few people order we realized that it was sort of like Chipotle only with Piadas or Pasta.  The inside of Piadas is actually nice and feels really clean.  There is the aforementioned line where you order and then a large dining section with lots of wooden tables and a giant illuminated  "Piada Italian Street Food" sign in the back.

On this day I decided to go with the summer avocado Piada which consisted of the Hand-rolled Piada filled with roasted sweet corn & tomatoes, fresh avocado, arugula, mozzarella, pancetta, basil aioli.  If you didn't look it up already a Piada is an Italian Flatbread and here they then roll the ingredients in and it looks like a burrito, hence my earlier reference to Chipotle.  In any case I rather enjoyed my Piada as it tasted good and felt like I was eating healthy.  My favorite parts were probably the pancetta which was crisped nicely and gave some salt to the dish and also the basil aioli which made the Piada less dry and gave some good flavor to it.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I enjoyed my meal and now that I've got the hang of what this place is about I think that I could probably make my Piada a little tastier.
