MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg The service and food at Chicago Joe's are solid. The menu is traditional Italian. The one thing that makes Chicago Joe's interesting is the fact that it is located in an old house in downtown Las Vegas - and a small one to boot. When you walk into the restaurant, it is very obvious you are walking into the living room, which is lined with tables on each side. This makes for a very cozy atmosphere. As you proceed to the center of the restaurant, it is very obvious you are walking into the kitchen. This isn't a converted Victorian, it's more like a bungalow. The lighting is dim and there isn't anything fancy. The tables are plain and the wait staff are direct. The result of this is an ambience that I could only describe as a cross between a cozy B&B and a somewhat seedy local tavern - with it leaning toward the seedy local tavern. I don't mean for that to be negative because the food is solid, the staff efficient and friendly in their wise-guy way, and the dining experience will be interesting.
