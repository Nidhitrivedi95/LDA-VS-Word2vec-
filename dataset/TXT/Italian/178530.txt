NrjzI_RhWLJBqWVustL2sQ Let me explain my experience here. I walked into this restaurant, where there were about 10 tables open inside, and was asked if we had a reservation... Then we asked to sit outside where no one else was sitting. We asked to sit at a table closer to the street but apparently al of the 12 tables were reserved. Once we were seated, my boyfriend and I watched three waiters stand and talk to each other for ten minutes without ever coming over. Needless to say we left.
