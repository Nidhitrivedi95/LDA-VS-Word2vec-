0TgBr7wAMQOij6_JP9q3ag The pizza here is absolutley amazing! You can make your own pizza with almost any topping on it. The meatball crumble and fresh motzerella are just a few of their best toppings. Their salads are very tasty as well. They have a very good selection of drinks to chose from as well, but not as many as some other places do. The sugar cane sodas do make up for that however. Unfortunately the desserts are not up to par. We tried the cookie dessert and it was hard as a rock and about two chocolate chips within the entire "cookie". We tapped it against the pan and it didnt even put a dent in it, completley unedible!
