nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Second time here for another visit to vegas, and I absolutely love this place!  The portions are huge (the first time there was just too much leftovers), so order an entree per person if you really want to stuff yourselves.  Be sure to save room for dessert.  The tiramisu is very unique and not too sweet -- perfect for me, maybe for you?
