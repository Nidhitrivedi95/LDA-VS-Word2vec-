iJpTpE9A8WDWvUlvUcFZuA I arrived a little wet from the effect of Tropical storm Hermine. I was looking for a place close to he hotel but with good food This restaurant had good ratings on Yelp. I started with the lobster bisque. Hot and delicious. I ordered the combo meal with pork chop and caramelized Brussels sprouts. The pork chop was cooked perfectly. It was hot, juicy and cooked through and had a great flavor. The Brussel sprouts  had a great flavor but we're only warmed. Although served in a small cast iron skillet they must have sat while waiting on the pork. I told the waitress so she could notify the kitchen. Tiffany was my waitress and was excellent. She notified the kitchen and they wanted to make it right  I told her I ate them just wanted the staff to know for the next guest. They did give me a slice of cheesecake. I will definitely be back when in the Chatlotte area again
