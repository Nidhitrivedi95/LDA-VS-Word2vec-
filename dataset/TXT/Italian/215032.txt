RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ Thank you To our Server Steven and Table assistant. Service was fabulous. In addition, Steven offered to have the Chef come out to meet us. It was my Husbands 70th and he ordered the Veal Cop! The best ever hands down. Ken the Chef was so kind. We have been there a couple of times. Will be back for sure!  Thank you. Loyal and happy well fed Customers
