On our second visit we decided to try the  sandwiches. I had the  Caprese and my husband had the Porcellino both with the truffle fries. My sandwich was good. I really enjoyed the "bread". My husband also felt the same about his meal. We were both disappointed with the truffle fries. We have had good truffle fries at other restaurants and these were not even close. We ended our meal with a delicious crepe with fruit, yummy. Service was good.
