I get that it's a fusion restaurant but it's a bit of a surreal experience to feel like you're eating sushi in a Mimi's Diner. Poking fun at the decor aside, CherryBlossom without a doubt knows it's Japanese cuisine. I forgot what types of sushi rolls I ordered but they certainly hit the spot as did the bowl of udon. It's not glamorous, and it's definitely not the best Japanese food, but if you're looking to dish out on the leaner side for lunch this is the place to swing by.
