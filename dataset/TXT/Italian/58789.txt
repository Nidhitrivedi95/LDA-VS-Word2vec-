This is the original location, the best location food wise and also one of the more difficult ones to park at without prior knowledge of the location.

For the past decade I have been meeting m family here for weekday lunches when our schedule permit. The key is to get there either before 11:30 to beat the rush to at 12:30 for when they leave.

Our usual meal starts with the Boom Dip, it is a artichoke dip dish but unlike the now popular clone it is artichoke heavy, lighter on the cream and has a nice browned cheese crust on top. It is now served with strips of pizza crust with cheese on it.  I like to eat the dip straight and put chili oil (yes this is a standard table condiment) red pepper and parmagean cheese on the bread.

For the main course, we split a Large Thin Pesto Pizza. The crust is thin and crispy. In lieu of tomato sauce there is their great pesto sauce, large tomato slices and mozzarella cheese finish up the package.  It is cut into square, with the four corner triangles being the best pieces.

The staff is fun friendly and will to accommodate. The patio has many mechanisms in place to make it bearable on hot dry summer days, inside has high top tables and blast loud swing music.  

I also enjoy the penne pesto bake, which is now in a bread bowl, pasta, cheese pesto diced tomato more cheese and a bread bowl. It is worth a try.

The Artichoke lasagna is great if you are willing to wait. 

For lunch, the pasta dishes include a salad and for dinner, they do not. I do not get it but that is the way it is.
