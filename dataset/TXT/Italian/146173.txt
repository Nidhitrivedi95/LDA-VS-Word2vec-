K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ 2600 stars. By far one of the best clubs in Vegas! The staff was over the top amazing. The music perfect. The bottle service was over the mountains and through the woods right past grandmothers house and straight to the dance floor! Amazing amazing experience. I've had the "VIP" treatment before but never on a level like Hyde provided. Our own personal bartender I thought was better than sliced bread. And the view of the fountains had me in a daze. Have to thank my friends Jen and Christina for taking us there. On a Tuesday night the place was packed! Also the security team there did a great job helping my sister get to and from the bathroom with out the trouble of fighting a crowd of people lol. Probably will be back in Vegas in February with a few friends. We already know one of our stops during the trip. It will be to come back to Hyde for a jaw dropping instantly fun night to remember!
