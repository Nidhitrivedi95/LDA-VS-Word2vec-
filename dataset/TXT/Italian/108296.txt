FZpyIiCAsr7Twkw4tQeqPA I am typically a fan of the calamari , cheese fonduta, and mussels and their tirimisu, but, I think this is the last time I am ever going to this Olive Garden.  The server did not bring out our appetizer (though we were not charged for it).  She definitely heard us, because she repeated it.  We didn't want to say anything because she was training someone and we didn't want her to lose face.  Our server WAS nice though. 

Definitely not a place to go for authentic Italian. I can't stand their lasagna.  It's a block of salt and marina. Whole Foods hot foods section has better lasagna.  Tuscan steak always comes overcooked (as in overly well done).

SECONDLY and MOST IMPORTANTLY, when I was in a bathroom stall, another staff comes in and uses the stall next to me.  She takes off her apron, and throws it on the bathroom floor, as opposed to hanging it on the bathroom door.  And after I saw that, I couldn't even finish my meal.  I wrapped it up and just broiled the life out of it.  I am not saying it was my server, but it was somebody who worked there.

I would have given it three stars, but that apron/hygiene fiasco really freaked me out.
