jP7zIbDXor7fQ8phrU6LQQ Well now reading all the reviews I would've never placed an order with them to begin with. I work at an office and 3 of us decided to order a pizza and wings. It was going to arrive 7 mins prior to our lunch break (12:53). We placed the order at 12:15. For an hour our pizza said it was still in the"oven" on the website for tracking our pizza. I finally called and express how upset we were due to having 30 min lunch break and our food should've been here well over 20 mins ago. The manager Malik said he only had one driver and he didn't know where he was, and that they had a ton of orders....not being a bitch but that's not my fault. He then told us we could pick the pizza up. He told us he could give us a Pizza Hut credit, but the pizza would still be a while..... WHAT?! Finally after bickering back and forth we decided to cancel our pizza now that it's been over an hour and we're all starving and have to go back to work. NEVER. AGAIN. I wouldn't even give them a star.

Manager Malik didn't want to give us his last name, and wouldn't give us the corporate number either. He said we can find it online.
