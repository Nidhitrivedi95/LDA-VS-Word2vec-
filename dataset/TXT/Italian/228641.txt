SX5NA-yKCGR234vV1eaxZA I called this in for pick up. They said 20 minutes. 

It was ready in twenty minutes.

BUTTTTTTT!!!

Who the cuts pizza into small bite size pieces?  

It's a "pizza PIE"!!!  I want pie shaped slices!!!  

Who would think that you'd have to say that. Or ask or that?  

I mean. I get it for jumbo slices I guess. Like a 30" pizza from San Diego giant pizza...  

But this is a 12". 

Cutting pizza this way disrupts the balance of flavors you get toward the crust. Now I have 4 pieces of pizza with no crust. And 4 pieces of crust that have no pizza. 

Otherwise, it tastes pretty good for a traditional American pizza.  I'll be back.  I wish I could give a half a star. It's not really 4 star but it's not 3 star either. But considering the local options, this is better than most.
