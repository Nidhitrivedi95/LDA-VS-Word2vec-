D6RDpCS1lfgZdPuLHlpsHA Absolutely worst customer service I have ever experienced.  I called and spoke with Dennis who identified himself as a manager.  I brought in a group of people and specifically said I wanted a $20 per person all inclusive lunch with a presenter.  I was told that would not be a problem.  When I get the check, they include a $100 "setup fee".  There were 6 tables in a row, that was it.  I asked Dennis if we had a failure to communicate and he puts "Tony" on the phone, his boss and the manager.  Tony tells me he usually charges $500 for that room.  Says we had a presentation and they have to reset the room (all 6 tables) so he's giving me a discount.  I simply said that if they had divulged the $100 fee we would not have come in.  So he told me not to come back.  I won't, and I'll warn anyone else willing to read this post to never visit this den of thieves.
