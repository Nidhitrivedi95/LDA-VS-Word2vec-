bVwFqYiz9acU1W24ZmYofQ Due to unfortunate circumstances we were staying at a hotel close to this Pizza Hut. Being in hotel a month we ordered pizza regularly. I would say at least 2-3 times a week we ordered from here. Each and every time our order was delivered with a smiling face, food was always hot, delicious and fast. I never asked for plates forgetting that I had none at hotel. The delivery drivers still made sure they added plates, peppers and cheese. I think they are all amazing.
