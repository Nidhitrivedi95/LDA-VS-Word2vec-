Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw Nice homey spot in the Venitian located away from the main drag Grand Canal Shoppes. Our server was helpful and honest -- he warned us that the portions were large and recommended that for the two of us, we split an appetizer and entree rather than each ordering an entree. Always appreciate a honest server because it makes the experience so much more enjoyable rather than feeling bloated and overly stuffed after a meal. We ordered the burrata and arugula appetizer and the Linguine Mare Nostrum. The burrata was good, but the Linguine was definitely the star. They were very generous with the seafood, which tasted fresh. The sauce had the right amount of spiciness with a slight kick.
