53BSdnhzcCBfBH_6TgX63Q I'd like to think that I caught this restaurant on a bad night.  I live around the corner from this Rosati's location and have been looking forward to trying their pizza.  

On January 18th we ordered a large thin crust pizza but what was delivered had all the wrong toppings and a "crust" that can only be compared to a cardboard box.  We called to complain but the woman who answered the phone apparently couldn't hear us and hung up.  We drove with the nearly untouched pizza to the restaurant to exchange it for something else.  When we arrived we were greeted by a manager who was less than sympathetic.  We were expecting an apology but instead he questioned whether we ordered the pizza from the Rosati's website or Grub Hub.  We showed him that half of the pizza we ordered had none of the toppings we ordered and described the unpleasant crust. He agreed to make us a "double dough" pizza which he described as a "regular pizza" and refund the complete cost of our order.  The "double dough" crust was a thicker version of the thin crust; tasteless, overcooked and stale.  The toppings were correct but there just weren't enough of them.  The pizza looked more like a homemade pizza than one made by a restaurant that's been specializing in Chicago style pizza since 1964.  What's worse, it's been over two weeks and we have yet to receive the refund. 

I was also turned off by the employee area being in full view of both the dine in and carry out areas.  Several employees were enjoying food, drinks and taking their break in full view of the paying customers.  I have no objection to these activities but I think it should be hidden from paying customers.

I would not recommend Rosati's to anyone and I won't be back myself, there are several better options around town.
