Ehy00JWQixgoXzisVKhvag Came to the bar and ordered a carafe of their red wine sangria and a margarita pizza.  Bartender was cool, I had a question about a particular beer they had on tap and he provided me a sample.  Service was very good, pizza was very good and so was the sangria.  No complaints from me.
