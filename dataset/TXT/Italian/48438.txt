95Efv0xKoUsP5lvTnaeK5w Worst dining experience I've had in years. Not only was the $12 boxed pasta as bland as the interior design but we also had the worst server I've ever seen. Jesse literally screamed at my grandfather after he mispronounced his name. Completely unprofessional. Avoid at all costs. Mcdonalds is a better option.
