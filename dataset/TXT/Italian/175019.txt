ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw My review is for the service. The food is delicious here. We came on a Wednesday (party of 4 with 2 young kids) and were told it would be 20 mins to wait. We figured that was fine b/c we could keep the kids entertained for that long. It wasn't 20. It was 40. As we were shown to our table, I slipped on the floor (it was COVERED in dirt, oil, old food) as I'm carrying my 5 month old and almost fell. Thankfully my husband was there for me to hold onto! It took a while before we got our food which again, would have been fine if we didn't have a 2.5 year old and 5 month old. The long wait ruined it for me and the leftover pizza was gross the next day. I might try it again without our kids but with little ones, this is definitely not a place to go.
