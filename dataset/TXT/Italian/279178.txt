yNp0ybYo07JQWlmdz1K4Cw Living in Lakewood I have been told that this a must visit and I was not steered wrong. My boyfriend and I went for his birthday and were surprised to find that they had all evening happy hour on Sunday's. We took advantage of the $5 glasses of wine and $6 appetizers and started off our evening with the Margarita pizzette and steamed mussels.  Even more surprising was the  intimate patio hidden behind the neon Players sign. We enjoyed the enclosed patio and had a hard time deciding what to order because it all sounded absolutely delectable. 

We both settled one items from their specials menu. I ordered the Espresso black pepper strip steak with balsamic glaze and could not have been happier with my decision.  My guy ordered the swordfish which was also top notch.

With their generous happy hour and delicious selection I will defiantly be back. Don't let the name and visage fool you this is a must visit.
