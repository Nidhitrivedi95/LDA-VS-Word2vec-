iqntlaqSCB4hkzTzlPlEmQ Came here to check out the new restaurant at the Galleria. We had heard that the food was good, and we wanted a new Italian spot, so we decided to go on a Thursday night (so it wasn't too busy).

The wait staff and hostesses were all very attentive and polite. The decor was up to date, and we were seated promptly. 

My husband ordered some pizza, my kids had several items off of the children's menu, and I had pasta with fire roasted peppers and cream sauce. The dish I chose was pretty bland, and the macaroni and cheese the kids had looked like Kraft straight out of the box. The pizza was ok, but the crust was soggy in the middle. 

I really wanted this place to be good, but I probably won't return. 3 stars for service - 0 for food. I'll stick with Maggiano's.
