Mq1_dvcg5mbeplEmCEoUtQ Ate dinner here tonight with my husband and friends. We like to try new places and have driven by before so thought we would give it a try. Don't let the neighborhood fool you this is actually a good restaurant. The prices were higher than we expected for the area(average about $18-20 a plate) and not having ever heard of the place before our visit, but we stayed to give it a try. Our server Howard was quite the character which made our experience extra enjoyable. He was very funny and friendly. The dining area and bathroom were very clean. Our cups never went empty. I ordered the Rigatoni Amatriciana per the suggestion of Howard and the fact I couldn't make up my mind. Everybody in our party enjoyed their food with no complaints. We ordered tiramisu and a cannoli to share. Although the cannoli was good the tiramisu was much more enjoyable. I would say if your not into the super upscale must be fancy kind of restaurant but still want good Italian food, great service and an enjoyable experience then give this place a try. It's a family (family-friend) ran business which is great in my eyes.
