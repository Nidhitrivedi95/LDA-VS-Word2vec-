MtvN8vMiKcLkkz_tCvBx3g I have been to Aria several times, mostly for drinks and appetizers.  Most recently I met a friend for lunch.  After arriving we were seated upstairs and brought water, bread and their cannellini beans spread.  I have had the spread before and unfortunately this time it was very dry, missing some of the freshness of the beans, but the bread was on point.

After browsing the menu I decided to try the Pepperoni Pizza and my friend ordered the Tomato Basil Soup and a kids grilled cheese, since she was craving a grilled cheese with her soup and they did not offer that on the main lunch menu.
The Pepperoni Pizza is described with crushed tomatoes, bacon, onion and ricotta. Let me first say the dough was cooked perfectly, a thin dough with a light and fluffy crust.  However, it should have been described as an onion pizza. Maybe it was the order I received but I picked forks full of onions off the pizza as it took away from the flavor of the pepperoni and cheese, which is what I really wanted to enjoy.
Service overall wasn't on point and I definitely didn't think the lunch menu lived up to what I expected.  I will definitely go back for drinks and think about giving them another shot for lunch and/or dinner.
