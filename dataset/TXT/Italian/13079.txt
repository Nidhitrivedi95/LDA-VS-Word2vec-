111d13yLgIdqvpZekgVnbQ What a gem!!  My husband and I LOVE Pallucci.

If you're lucky enough to get Chris (and most are) service is a 5+!  He knows his stuff, is happy to recommend, and sets a great pace for your meal.  

Ambiance is cozy and comfortable - never too loud.  

Food is excellent!  So much to recommend.  The sweet potato fries with balsamic glaze are a must.  The funghi salad is sooooo good, and my husband swears by the caprese with bocconcini.  Last time we went I had the tuna spacial and it was delicious!!  Everything is fresh and prepared to your liking.

This is a great neighborhood spot......give it a try!
