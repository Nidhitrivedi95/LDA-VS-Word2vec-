The service was horrible from start to finish. A snotty kid, who could barely string together words to form a sentence. 

Everything we ate was over seasoned. Very very salty. The pasta dishes that claims to be a half order is barely a children's order. Just about everything but the meat was bad. We had the porterhouse and the ribeye, they were carved at the table. Both were good not outrageously good, but ok. There were 5 of us, only 2 had wine and we spent 850 including tip and most of us were hungry when we walked out. 

Everything would have sat better with us if the service was at all good. I asked about the sorbets, and the waiter said, "ewww, i personally hate sorbets, i'd eat the gellato." I said "gellato makes my stomach hurt, can you tell me which sorbet is the best." he said " sour apple sorbet tastes like sour apple, basil tastes like basil, chocolate tastes like chocolate." what a smartass, i dont need that when im paying 800 bucks for dinner.

I wont go back ever and i have already written a personal note to mario battali.
