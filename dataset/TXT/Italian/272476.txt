xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA We eat here about once per month. The food is always good. I had halibut the other night and it was delicious. The service has always been spot on. I give them 5 stars. The only negative that I can say is the little sides of penne pasta are usually watery. That's an easy fix.
