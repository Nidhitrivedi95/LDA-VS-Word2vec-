qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA After walking by this restaurant many times over the years, we stopped in for a late lunch. We opted for a booth to avoid the traffic flow outside the place and people fresh off their highs from the oxygen bar around the corner.

Food was excellent (we both had the carbonara), portions were generous, and service was amicable and sincere - from the host to the server to the multiple staff members that thanked us on our way out. Definitely an experience we'd repeat.
