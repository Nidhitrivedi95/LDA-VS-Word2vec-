GtHu9uGXpn7Jg_Z7vFKZKw great food, questionable service, one employee had her young daughter at work and she kept attending to her in the kitchen area, since this is located in  The Miracle Mile shops it is very busy around lunchtime and I don't think children in the kitchen is acceptable, I also believe it is a Health Dept. violation
