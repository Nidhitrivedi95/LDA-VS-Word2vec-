N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg Surprisingly authentic pizza. The service was fairly slow and awful.  Our waitress made it quite clear that she was displeased that two of us were sharing one pizza and was MIA after we ordered and she realized we would not have a large bill.  Originally gave this place 4 stars until it took forever to pay our bill in an early empty restaurant.
