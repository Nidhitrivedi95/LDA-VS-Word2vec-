yxQsedCcjJEfqhC7u8Rl0A My husband and I finally visited this restaurant last week after months of putting it off. Good thing we finally dined here because this place has the best Grilled Squid appetizer! On the menu, it is listed as "Calamari Alla Griglia". The squid is succulent and perfectly tender. It came on a bed of chopped tomatoes, capers, and mixed greens. My dear husband and I both loved it and I highly recommend it to anyone especially seafood lovers.

For the main course, I had Linguine Pasta with Rapini (Linguine con Rapini) since I wasn't up for a meat dish. The fresh pasta was pretty good and I like that the sauce wasn't too heavy. I'd love to try their meat dish particularly the Osso Buco the next time we visit. As expected, my husband who is a risotto fan, had Risotto al Prosecco. The dish had mushrooms, shrimps, and artichokes in a lobster bisque. He was pretty satisfied with his meal, too.

For dessert, we shared a Tiramisu. My husband paired it with a cup of espresso while I had tea. It was the perfect way to end the meal. The tiramisu was just right. It had a good balance of  mascarpone cheese, espresso and cookies. 

We will definitely go back!
