But the service doesn't match the food - we waited for a table (which we expected) then waited at the table for a server to acknowledge we were there. How long is too long? I think a server should stop by in the first 3-5 minutes after you sit down, even just to acknowledge that they see you and will be right back. Fifteen minutes after sitting down, we placed our order; the meatball appetizer came right away and was frankly, great.  The pizza? Also terrific, even if the waitress mixed up our pies and called them by the incorrect names - one piece in, we figured it out, and happily swapped.

So why am I being so picky? Cucina Bella has the prices of a high-end restaurant - for a few dollars more, I could have gone to Cure, where they not only feed you well, they treat you with care. No one was rude at Cucina, but I felt like the service lacked the attention - and attention to detail - I expect at these prices. I might go back, but pizza is a Pittsburgh staple, so Cucina Bella has a lot of competition in high and low places.
