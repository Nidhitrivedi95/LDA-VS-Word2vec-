U3O8l_wmzdeckbhHpuRWCg Our go to OG in Paradise Valley.  We usually hit this place up for lunch once a week and the service is typically friendly and fast.
Food is standard Olive Garden fare which I am sure is a matter of taste, I personally enjoyed the Tuscan menu.
The mini-deserts are really good!
