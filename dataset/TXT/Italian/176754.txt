nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow i ordered 3 things.
1) garden salad: nothing special. same salad  you would get at a diner. it was the best thing i had. 2) calamari: not good at all. i've had better pretty much anywhere. 3: linguini with clam sauce and mussels. overcooked linguini, mussels were a little off.
