v6n7iPus9739N0VHR_v2rQ This place is downright awful. We had a reservation at 830 and they made us wait half an hour for our table - we did get a complimentary drink which was nice though.  Once we did get seated we got a rude waitress that looked like she just rolled out of bed and was not dressed the part. And from 8:30 - 11PM all we got served was our appetizer !! Not acceptable. And of course during that time they were turning the place into a "club" and cranking up the music so we couldn't even hear eachother. Plus the place is so dark so if you have poor vision you're out of luck. We said we just wanted to leave and to forget about our entree but she said it would be ready within 10 minutes. 30 minutes later we had it and it was cold and not very good at all. And the poor couple beside us was there for their 2 year wedding anniversary and they were just told to leave because they were converting the place to a club! Bottom line don't waste your time - this place will be closed down within no time.
