B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw Very nice patio to go to on a summer afternoon .. Italian food almost always a good choice . 

It was odd , I went to Nervosa at Yorkville recently & when i came here I realized it was the exact same menu and everything.  Turns out its the same owner, but why different name for the restaurant, i dont know. 

Anyhow,  food is pretty good.
I ordered pretty much the exact same thing at both places because Im not familiar with the rest of the italian described food on the menu 


The bruschetta is a total win for mushroom lovers , soooo good. But small portion, 3 pieces. 
The carpaccio was not amazing, but very good. 

The mafalde ai funghi pasta , I love the sauce and mushrooms. The pasta feels a bit undercooked but I think thats how its supposed to be maybe .. 
& we got the diavolo pizza and the prociutto, 
Not too bad. 

This is def a pricey place for the portions 
But very tasty nonetheless.

Enjoy :)
