I love the maccheroni alla butteria with its amazing tomato cream sauce. They have a variety of pasta and meat dishes. I've always had good, attentive service there. 

Coco Osteria is one of my favorite places to go for dinner in uptown. Although it's small, I've also never had to wait for a table. Still, you should probably make reservations ahead of time.
