ZVtjS8Hvq2a6SxHxlehPGg We went to L'Amore on April 6 about 7PM.  We had not been there for years. The place was packed.  It took a very long time for anyone to seat us as they do not have a host at the front.  After being seated the service was great.  We ordered the special which was short ribs and cannelloni.  Unfortunately there is only one choice of salad dressing which is oil and way, way too much vinegar.  Even my partner who likes vinaigrette could not eat it.  The bread served was warm and scrumptious.  The main course was served with a sautéed spinach and tomato which also had way, way too much vinegar. The short ribs were cooked to death, as they should be, and the sauce was great.  The cannelloni was excellent.  If L'Amore could only figure out their salad dressing and maybe offer another option like feta cheese it would really improve  the dining experience.  Especially considering we spent almost $100 on dinner with no desert and only 2 glasses of wine and 1 beer.   But it has been this way for years and so I guess it will always stay this way.   If they would improve the salad and the sautéed vegetables I could improve my rating.
