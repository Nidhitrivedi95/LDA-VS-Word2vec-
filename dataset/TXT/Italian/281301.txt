YstdDnNa6h_ms3Ys7Pz4uQ We live near this restaurant, so frequent it a lot. Each time we've been there, the service has been excellent! The mood is always friendly, upbeat, & if you have a b-day, the singing superb! Only one complaint - and it's a biggee - the food is always too salty! they need to cut back on the salt on their soups, entrees, everything!
