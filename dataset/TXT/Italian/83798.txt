DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q LGO at the airport? Yes please!

I'd heard that LGO had an airport location, but due to the fact that I typically fly US Airways, I never had an opportunity to visit... that is - until yesterday!  I flew Southwest back from New Orleans and to my pleasant surprise, LGO was located right next to the gate that I exited from.

I was so excited to see it, and so impressed with the appearance, that I ended up grabbing a bite and sitting down to eat and do some work rather than rushing home like I usually do!

They did a great job duplicating LGO in it's airport location.  The menu surprisingly offers *almost* everything that the original location at 40th Street and Campbell offers.  (I believe they are just missing the sushi.)  The airport has an LGO Bakeshop... don't miss the butterscotch oatmeal and chocolate chip with sea salt cookies!  And they have a Grateful Spoon gelato area too...  friendly service to boot!

After eating my way through Nola, I passed on dessert this time around, but I went for the Thai Chicken Salad and it tasted just as great as it usually does; I guess they didn't compromise on quality at all!

Now that I know this location exists, I may have to head to the airport a little earlier from now on... cheers to great local options at PHX for travelers!
