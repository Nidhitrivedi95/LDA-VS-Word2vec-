X3-ZauIT8o2tcoBHjYUKFw Good food, but...  

My husband and I ordered for the first time here tonight and although the food is good it took over an hour for delivery.  From what we gather, the food is good, but was cold by the time we received it.  The shop called right after we ordered stating it was out of aomething which was no big deal.  

The only complaint about the food, other then it being cold, is the marinara for the breadsticks was not flavorful.  

I dont know if we will order again because it took so long for delivery.  An hour and 15 minutes for a monday night is just rediculous.
