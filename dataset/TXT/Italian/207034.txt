qgAZPDQStZP_Y5XTiQ6UqA Came here before flying out of town.  Made it in time for the happy hour (before 5pm).  Got a pitcher of beer for $5.  Have not had that since college. There is great outdoor seating of which we took advantage.

We ordered the bruschetta board.  This was enough for two people and I would recommend. Bread was nice and fresh and the toppings great.

Also had the brussels sprout salad which was Ok.  Probably would not order again.
