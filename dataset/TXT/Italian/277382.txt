YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw We were so excited to try out this new spot at Green Valley Ranch.  The photos of food and interior looked amazing.  We went on a weeknight a bit late and sat at the bar.  The room is really pretty and the bartenders were nice.  The food was a bit of a let down.  It was good, but nothing special.  It basically tasted like it was typical hotel restaurant quality.  We were hoping for some really interesting flavors or creativity.  We split a chicken picatta which was swimming in butter and a caesar salad, done nice in a big wooden bowl, but not real flavorful.  I'll give it another shot, maybe next time try their pastas.
