1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ Great Italian Food, get a large group of 4 or more and do the family style dinner and you will feast like you are in Italy. If you eat by ordering a smaller portion I would recommend the classic dinner where they give you an equal dinner to take home. I recommend the mom's lasagna and the baked ziti or spaghetti with meatballs. The flatbread pizza is great and the best pound cake you will ever have. We always get the lemon cookies to go in a tin container. Don't waste your money at Olive Garden
