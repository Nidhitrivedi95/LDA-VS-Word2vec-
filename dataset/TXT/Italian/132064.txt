ijNQXC2cBhbkf6iB6D8OJw Haven't gotten to spend that much time downtown, but, this will be my go-to pizza place from now on! Good prices, friendly staff and delicious food make it an obvious pick. I ordered cheese pizza and cheesy garlic bread and I was very very happy with what I received. Perfect sauce to cheese ratio on the pizza, and the garlic bread was out of this world (drooling just thinking about it). 10/10
