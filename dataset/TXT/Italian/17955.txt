2IHmggMLM-hDq4dFmwgzDw This was our second attempt here. We tried a few days before, and the dining room was completely full, and we didn't feel like freezing out on the patio (BTW, they did have heat lamps going). 
Being from NJ, I'm terribly critical of any Italian place, whether it be a chain or "authentic" (which I havn't found any chicken francaise in this state). 
We stopped here on a Monday night-The interior was small, and actually felt like a real pizza joint. So right away, they got some points from me.
There were 2 other occupied tables.
They gave us some garlic knots while we waited which was a very nice treat.
I had a meatball sandwich which was really good-and my husband has a chicken parm sandwich..also good, and i liked that you had a choice of white or wheat sub bread.
I havn't tried the pizza yet, but as far as hot sandwiches go, we'll be back.
Server was really friendly and attentive.
