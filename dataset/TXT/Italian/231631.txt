tgZU8QAowa7V4Af6DV9UUg Where do I begin?! This place was awesome!!

Quiet because its summer and the locals like to eat outside (its in a busy downtown area) but didn't bother me any... It was my birthday dinner.

4course Italian dinner... They set the bar for any other place I go. The waiter is down to earth and very conversational- I love that! The place has a very welcoming feel, not stuck up.

The chef gets 6 stars!!! Tender chicken full of flavor and the bolognese sauce.. Amazing! 

I wish we lived closer!!!
