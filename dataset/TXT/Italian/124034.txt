HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q Really cute place!  Its a bit overpriced, but its nice to treat yourself to  scoop of gelato after losing some money at the Palazzo.. or win..whatever.  

The worker recommended the mango or grape fruit gelato.  Its expensive, but the single scoop goes a long way.  The chocolate croissant was yummy too!
