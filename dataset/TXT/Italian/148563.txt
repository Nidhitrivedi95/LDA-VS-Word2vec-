kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg My family and I enjoyed a great wine tasting and dinner at Grape Vine Cafe. The service is most professional and attentive. The ambiance is cozy and rustic with a huge bar and open faced brick face. Happy hour is also a must!! The wine list is extensive. We enjoyed delicious pasta dishes, such as linguini clam sauce and bow tie pasta. The baked Brie and ahi tuna poke are special. Also, the salmon sliders were exceptional!! For a delicious dining experience- The Grape Vine Cafe is a must stop! Enjoy!!
