zFnPRtP7LGvr3sfxvy_dfg Went here tonight, and left very happy! I am somehwat lactose intolerant, and can't really eat alot of pizza. I agreed to meet some friends here, and was at first a little bummed because I thought I wouldn't really be able to find something to eat. menu had alot more than just pizza, and holy crap, alot of beer choices! I had the Lamb Burger, which was awesome! Patty wasn't huge, but very tasty toppings, and I believe some feta or goat cheese sprinkled on top. My friends split two pizzas, and I had a slice of one- Neese's Sausage (are you kidding me!?), caramelized onions, and mushrooms, with the butter parmesan finishing drizzle- OMFG, it was as good as it sounds...
Def will go back. Great food in a great area...
