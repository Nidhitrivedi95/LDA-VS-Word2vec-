9WIn1fMJoDPqkc5HOQdybw We enjoyed "Antica" again this week and tried some new things from the menu... as usual the pasta and sauces are as we recall southern Italy.  simple and excellent.  We also tried the Antispasto appetizer.  It was absolutely fantastic.  a well kept secret I think.  Yes, saw another being delivered and had to  have it.
Thursday also happened to be 1/2 price bottle of wine nite.  That was a bonus of course we ordered a more expensive wine had it not been on promo.  Server John make excellent suggestions on the wine style and taste.
