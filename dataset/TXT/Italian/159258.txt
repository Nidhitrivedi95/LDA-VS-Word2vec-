LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA It may have been due to high volume of large parties today but the quality of food was mediocre. The sauces for the pasta dishes were more liquid than creamy or rich. It was a disappointment to have ordered the more rich white sauces and receive a quality more like soup. Our server seemed rushed and in the need to go other places than stay attentive to us. He barely checked on us or cared for us. However this may be due to the fact we sat in the bar area. But I still think we should've received more than just a "check in" once and nothing else.
