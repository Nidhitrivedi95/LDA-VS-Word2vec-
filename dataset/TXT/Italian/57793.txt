AOEHe6uKrnC_Aje3kT8-7w We just moved to the area and wasn't sure where we could get amazing pizza and wings from. Angelo's Pizza Kitchen not only left a menu on our door, but when we did some digging we found that they offer a 10% discount when you order through mypizza.com, so we decided to try it out.

Now, to be fair, the wait was a little long, we waited about an hour and ten minutes for our food, but when I called to ask about it the girl who answered was very nice and apologized and informed me that they were running behind but that our driver had already left with our food. He arrived within five minutes so I believed her.

However, the wait was DEFINITELY worth it! We ordered the Angelina's Special pizza (basically a supreme), a dozen traditional buffalo wings, and a cheeseburger for our picky five year old. To start, the cheeseburger was delicious! Our daughter is extremely picky with her food and she ate the entire thing, and this was no small burger, it was one that would keep either my husband or me full! The pizza was so so good and reminded me of better quality Costco pizza. Not too saucy, fresh tasting ingredients, and a beautiful crispy crust. The wings were actually traditional buffalo! They were deep fried and came with a butter/home-made hot sauce mix that was amazing! The food was all so well made and delicious that we will definitely be ordering again. Not to mention the price was great! And they have awesome family meal deals so we know who we will be ordering from when it's football season!!!
