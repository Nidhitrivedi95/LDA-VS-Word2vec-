0VOh4VIq13oFburRU9gddw I normally don't go out of my way to write reviews unless they are positive.  Let me begin by saying the wine pour my wife had was generous and the beer I had was good.  On the other hand, we decided to try the pizza and it was the worst excuse for a pie I have seen in years.  They should be embarrassed to send something like that out of the kitchen.  Either management is apathetic or the kitchen staff is ignorant to what a good pizza looks and tastes like.  Very substandard.  Also the bar staff were spending more time eating their dinner, at the back bar, than attending to patrons.  Very tacky.  Won't go back.
