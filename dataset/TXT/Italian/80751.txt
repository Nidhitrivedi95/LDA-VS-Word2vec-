Da0c8BkSx0gxk5HwoZJiYQ The ambience is lovely and warm! The food wasn't too great! The house Italian salad and bread was our best from whatever we had ordered! A little bit of seasoning I believe would have gone a long way. We had ordered the chicken piccata which came drenched in butter with a hint of lemon in it (I would have preferred a more lemony taste to it). My husband ordered the meatball linguini marinara which was decent except it was missing a good amount of seasoning to it! Overall it's an "okay" place!
