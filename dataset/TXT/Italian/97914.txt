EUQoB_ph7_xIyj7JZGI3bg Ok I'm from the east coast. You can't beat our Italian.

But if I were to live here. I would come here. Ive had better in the east coast but this was good for AZ.

We ordered the Osso and the Bolognese.
Pasta was very good. 4 stars!
OSSO wasn't tender enough. 

Very humble eatery. But packs.a punch.

Wish I had another stomach to try the squid ink pasta they had.

Prices were good.
