PFt0wew2GqfPpesuUC9-cg Sauce does great burgers. Good, I got that out of the way! My sweetie and I each have family that lives in Bridgeville, so we run erands in this area a lot. You can count on good food at fair prices here. I've tried almont every burger on their menu at least once. They also make the best "restuant mac and cheese I've ever had. Yeah, I know. That's not so exciting, but it really is good. The service is usually just a bit better than average, sometimes excellent, but never bad. My only complaint is that mid-day the music is sometimes loud even for me. (And I'm a drummer...)  I do agree with some other posters that they slipped a bit from how good it was five years ago, but they seem to have it figured out and are back in the game again. Try them out the next time that you hit Bridgeville.
