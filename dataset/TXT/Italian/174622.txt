nDKcQkh8vZkY_u1kyww44g LOVED THIS PLACE!.  The service was awesome and the food was great.  For a precourse I had the tuna tartare which was terrific and one of my friends chose the pasta with black truffles and that was outstanding.  My main course was halibut and that was perfectly cooked.  My other friend ordered the lamb and it was awesome...and I don't even eat lamb.  Wine list was a little on the expensive side but a definite must.  I'd go back again.

*I love the Venetian and with Valentinos in it, I love it even more!
