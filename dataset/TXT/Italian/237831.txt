u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg Postino is a great restaurant, all locations have superb service and food/drinks. 

Postino Arcadia is right down the street from where I live, I frequent here and have never had a bad experience.

One thing to keep in mind though is during happy hour, the wait can be a little long, but that is a good thing though, people enjoy going to Postino.
