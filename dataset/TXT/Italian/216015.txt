RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ Went to Different Point of View for our 13th wedding anniversary (11th anniversary as well!).  
When it comes to dining three things matter...Food, space, and service.  Yes, price matters too, but that's not going to keep me from going.  DPOV hits every point!  Pun intended!  The food is impeccable.  The view is the best in AZ.  The service, provided by Nash, was top notch!  His recommendations were spot on, his style was informative, but not pushy.  Knows when to jump in and when to lay back.  Either way...if you are looking for a romantic dining experience, no need to look further.  This one is the one you are looking for!  Stop looking, put down the phone and go to A Different Point of View...oh, and ask for Nash!
