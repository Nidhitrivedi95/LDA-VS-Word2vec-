G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q Wife and I stopped by after a show for a quick bite. We didn't order wine, we didn't order a complete meal with four courses or whatever. We felt like our server, Nancie, treated us like second-class guests. This was a VERY different experience from a year ago when we were here and felt like we were at someplace special. This place isn't special anymore. Now it's just another overpriced place on the strip.
