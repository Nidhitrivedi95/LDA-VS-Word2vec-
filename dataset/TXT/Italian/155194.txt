Curiosity drove me in, but you could tell the place was well known as it was bustling.
It's a deli but it does soups, sandwiches and more.
I was a little dismayed at the prices of some of the bottled/packaged products, but seeing as it is a specialty store it really isn't out of the ordinary. I thought the deli selection was very well priced though.
The staff was also very friendly and efficient.
I hope to still frequent this shop even though I'm moving to the other side of town!
