KkgnBZj3jRVjCY2H49JRaw Where do I begin? The temperature of the food was just warm. I asked for no bacon on the potato skins, they came with plenty of bacon. The chips to the nachos tasted stale. They give you plenty of chips in your nachos. The calamari was blah. The burger was the best thing I ordered. I wasn't pleased at all.
