93FVxoipAIYG07gisMOQhw Great food, I had the chianti braised pasta, generous amount of braised beef with gravy over pasta, small bits of veggies throughout.  My mom had the penne al vodka.  I think I liked that dish even better.  Great light & tasty house salad.  I read reviews before going,  somebody said they didn't get the 4 or 5 star reviews.  Well, I didn't get your two star review.  I can't wait to try other menu items.  Salted caramel Gelato....the bomb
