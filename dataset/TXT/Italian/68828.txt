BtLDbNfpwdwHSmyBJF2-RQ Very good Italian restaurant, a bit on a pricey side. I really liked their wild mushroom and goat cheese crostino. My husband had octopus carpaccio, he loved it. As a main dish we both had lamb chops, they were good but not great. And there was nice creme brulee to finish the meal. The service was a bit slow, but the restaurant was full on Sat night. The waiter was very apologetic for the delays with food and had a good sense of humor. I would recommend this place for birthday or anniversary celebrations.
