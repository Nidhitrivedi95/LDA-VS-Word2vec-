7NucoWCjPzZyRPjsVR28xQ Want comfort food and greasy pizza well stop here. Pizza was okay, but I have had way better regardless if it was new york or los angeles pizza.

Ordered two large slices, meat lovers and pepperoni. Each slice was about $6.50 plus a small drink was $3

$18 dollars after I was enjoying decent pizza and a drink before attending fights at the MGM Grand.

Well I come back again I doubt it.
