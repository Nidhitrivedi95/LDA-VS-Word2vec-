Unfortunately they miss a lot of important steps that would make me want to come back on my own.  Their fried zucchini is the heaviest version of this appetizer I've ever had.  I could hardly eat another bite of anything after it and it wasn't that enjoyable - dense and no seasoning, not even salt.  

The bread they serve is just tiny little rolls.  Now I know why...  Everything else is so dense you don't need them.

I liked the meat sauce on their spaghetti but the meatball was stone cold on the inside.  So that was the end of that.  I didn't even bother sending it back.   There are too many other options nearby that are better and not that much more expensive.
