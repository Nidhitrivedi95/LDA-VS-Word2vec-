UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ I went here on 4th of July on their $4 pizza muffins deal.

We were seated within 15 min on 4th of July, granted it was 2 PM. I was pleased with the wait time. we ordered the pepperoni and combo pizza muffins for $4 per dozen along with a large antipasto salad to share.

The salad was very wet and drenched in sauce, but it was very tasty and tangy, and the pizza muffins were soft and doughy. I enjoyed all the items and the price of the items bumped them from 3 to 4 stars. I would come back again for good and inexpensive Italian food.
