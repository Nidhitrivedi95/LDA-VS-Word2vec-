JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A Went to 7 West, hadn't been there is years. Last time I was there was a little (lot) tipsy and remember little except it was good times :).

Ordered the Chicken Carbonera it was nice and hot and yummy. My friend ordered the Cheesy Burger, it was a little bit small and I felt bad because he couldn't share my food due to milk intolerance.

We ate on the 3rd floor at around 6pm and it was empty but slowly filled. No one was next to us so we had privacy to chat which was nice.

Overall food was yummy and it bought back fond memories, cause the first time though I don't remember what we ate was soooo much fun.

Service was good, food was good. Read the reviews and wanted desert but didn't have enough space. We'll go back again for desert.
