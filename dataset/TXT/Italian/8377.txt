Our server was attentive and she tried hard admitting many mistakes she made. I order my pizza without a topping listed in the description. My first pizza came with the topping I didn't want. No big deal......at first. They made the pizza again without question. However, it took twice as long and came out burnt! I couldn't enjoy it because I was now running late for my plane. So two pieces down of the 15.00 personal pizza and I had to run. It wasn't good enough to take with me and if I wanted a pizza to go I wouldn't have sat down at Humble Pie. So as I pay my bill I see it is full price...... Oh well, maybe I hit them on a bad day. That's why the ratings are on an average basis.
