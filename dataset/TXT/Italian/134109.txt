IqH-J1D0HIP9wyJs2q_uGQ Third and last time there. Went in for a quick lunch. The kids pizza was decent- a good portion and average on the taste scale. The BLT with avocado was horrible. They skimped out on the avocado and the bacon was broken into many pieces. The roll was small and very meh If you can't do something right, don't do it.
