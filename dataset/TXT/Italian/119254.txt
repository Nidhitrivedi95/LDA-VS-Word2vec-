H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g My husband and I have been fans for a long time, but were sadly disappointed by our dining experience here. Our food was sub par, our server completely forgot about our table after only one stop to say hello. We were done with our food for 20 minutes before we had to actually get up and ask for our check. We found our server in the back playing drums with his hands on the counter without a care in the world. Save your money, don't eat here.
