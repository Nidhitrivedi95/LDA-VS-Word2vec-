oUvqwPJkorOnYZFKRt0oEg We've been there twice, i had the tortellini paisano both times.  Now keep in mind i was stationed in Italy for 6 months, this is one of the best dishes I've ever had, PERIOD!!!  You must have desert!   The house Cab is great too.

Infact everything was top notch!!  The owner (i think) was friendly like you were a guest at his house.   Steve (if i recall correctly) was out waiter and he was great also.   Its a bit of a drive for us but well worth it.  

I only have one small, minuscule complaint, why is there a TV?  The atmosphere is great but a tv is more dinner vs fine dining.   

A five star among 5 stars,  just dump the tv.
