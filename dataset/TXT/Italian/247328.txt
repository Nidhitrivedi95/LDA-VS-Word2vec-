VA95qAV2PRH9gtTi2Vfv4Q Love the food here! The dishes are reliable to satisfy so we keep going back when we don't feel like taking a chance to try a new restaurant. I always go back to the risotto every other time I am there. No complaints there. Their drinks are a little on the pricier side and the quality does not always deliver. The spacing is tight so a small table for two can be very right if you get the wrongness spot. Service is hit and miss, sometimes they adore you other times you feel like uncool kid being ignored.
