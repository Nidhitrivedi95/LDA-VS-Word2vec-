esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA First off, this place is pretty dead for a restaurant in a bustling casino. Just seat yourself and the waiter will eventually come up to you to serve you. 

came here with my boyfriend because i thought this was the other oyster bar and ordered the pan roast. i honestly didn't realize i was at the wrong oyster bar until i got my food LOL

we both ordered the pan roast because my sister in law raved about it. the pan roast initially didn't look filling to me, even though it was filled to the brim with seafood and a scoop or rice. it comes with this creamy tomato based sauce with a little kick of spice at the end. comes with a bunch of shrimp, mussels, clams, and half a lobster tail. even though the bowl of food didn't seem too filling, i honestly could not handle the monstrosity that is this dish. the dish itself was 30 something dollars, so only order it if you're hungry!

we also ordered a side of fries, which costs around $10 - $12. although it was a big portion, the fries were way too salty for both of our tastes. ended up not even finishing half of it. might have to ask for unsalted and then salt the fries yourself, if that's possible.

one thing i didn't like about oyster bar was the fact that there was only one waiter. it sucked to see one man running around taking care of almost 20 tables by himself. so don't forget to be patient!
