1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag We've made this our MUST STOP every time we stay in Vegas. The food blows our mind. Breakfast is always perfect & they pour the BEST cup of coffee in the world. Dinner is incredible! We always enjoy our meals with lots of "Can you believe how good this is?" The owners are delightful & the waiters are the BEST! In fact we are going there again this weekend which will make this our 25th visit! Can't go wrong here! Best food and price in Vegas if not the world!!!!
