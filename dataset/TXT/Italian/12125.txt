0uwQIGlKICIYuRtayVnh7g While I love Piadas food , especially the Lobster bisque, and recommend their food every chance I get, I must say this visit was disappointing in the customer service area! I understand the need to be quick and efficient , but sliding bowls down, yelling directives to other staff and limited sincere engagement with customers was a first!!
Also the bathroom was a filthy mess!!
I know it can be better!! We need this establishment to remain!
