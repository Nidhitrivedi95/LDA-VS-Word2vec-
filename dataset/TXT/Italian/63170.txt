B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw Ended up there on a double date last night.  Didn't have a reservation but was able to get a table after about 15
minutes  as we were sipping our wine by the oz near the bar. Ended up sitting upstairs which was just as beautiful as their main level. It was quite busy, the table that we were situated was at a high traffic lane way near the back beside the bar and I guess kitchen. So we had people constantly bumping into us as they passed. We ended up eventually moving, however it seemed like a big ask.  

Kale salad was ok, similar to what I had before there but nothing to note or  highlight. My friend  and I  ordered the burger. However, we both ended up sending it back, as my first bite was like taking a mouthful of salt. As someone who  normally loves salty and savoury, even I deemed the burger as drowning in salt. I ended up ordering a pizza instead, which was mediocre at best and we decided to continue the night somewhere else for dessert


The vibe and atmosphere here is always amazing and really can't be replicated elsewhere.
