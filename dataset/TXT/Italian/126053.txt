HrR_2-HUE6cqnoz1zMN9AQ Had an early Dinner with a friend. The place is very quaint. Nice size with a open kitchen that you can see the pizzas being formed and topped. We tried 2 appetizers one with the bruschetta and one with eggplant and mozzarella. The bread was very crisp with olive oil and seasoned diced tomatoes. The fresh mozzarella was Great and eggplant was well seasoned. I tried to Tutto Carne and my friend had the Abrazzo. Toppings were very fresh, only complaint was the crust was a bit bland and not seasoned. Reasonable prices for personal pizza around $12-15; wine was $8-9 a glass. Overall would return.
