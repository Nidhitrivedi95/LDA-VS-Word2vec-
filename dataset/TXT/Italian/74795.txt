Cr5CLpmVrmzFyz_RfQ6rmA Worst service in Greater Toronto! I booked a reservation for 4 people. We walked in and I literally stood in front of the hostess for 10 minutes before being greeted... I provided my name and reservation and was told we'll be looked after soon and then the hostess pulls a Houdini. They were probably overbooked but didn't care to inform us of the situation, hence making us feel ignored. 15 minutes later, we were seated. The server came and we inquired about bottled wines. He provided a couple tasters but we didn't like them so we asked for a recommendation. 20 minutes passed and we flagged him down while serving another table. He looked at us, then looked away. So we're 45 minutes in, and have yet to even be served water, we did what any logical patrons did... Get up and leave. You have been warned
