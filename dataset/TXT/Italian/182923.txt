OBG1j517k7aZRNC1HAL0TA So it's not just hype! 

This year's BFF birthday dinner brought us to Fabbrica at the Shops on Don Mills. 
I came totally prepared for okish food and service at outrageous prices. (I read most of the reviews)
However, I must say it was not what I expected in the least. 

We started with the fritti. A medley of battered seafood served with a cream aoli dip. This was probably the course with the least wow factor, but paired with a great wine recommendation turned out just swell. 
For mains, I had to try the fettuccine that everyone was talking about while my date had the pappardelle. Yelpers did not disappoint!
The fettuccine with crab, guanicale and cream sauce topped with a perfect soft poached egg was amazing! Creamy and covered in sauce, but not to much that it masked the taste of the crab and amazing cured meat. 
The pappardelle was smothered with a succulent braised short rib, basil and tomatoes. Again enough meat but not over kill. 
After another glass of wine, we ventured on to dessert. 
Boy o boy was this the highlight of my night or perhaps it was the wine! ;)
We ordered the gelati and sticky toffee pudding. 
The house prepared gelati was a trio of chocolate, pistachio and espresso. The pistachio was one of the best I have had since Italy! 
When the pudding arrived we assumed it would be crazy sweet. Thinking we may have made a mistake, we dug in. 
Were we ever wrong!! Doused in a coffee liqueur, covered in a salted toffee sauce and topped with a scoop of coffee gelati, it was soooooo...orgasmic! 

The prices are reasonable. I mean it's not fast food, so I don't expect fast food prices, but at the same time it wasn't outlandish. 

The staff were really nice. Knew their products and made some really great recommendations. 

I will definitely have to go back!
Chef McEwen, kudos to you sir!
