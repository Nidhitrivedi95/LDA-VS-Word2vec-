pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ Delicious! We got comped a dinner and show tickets. There's a separate menu for this. You get bread, salad, and an entree. I had the fettuccine Alfredo. It was amazing. My husband had rigatoni bolognese and that was delicious too. The service was great. We sat "outside" and got to see the fountain show. I would come here again and pay for a meal.
