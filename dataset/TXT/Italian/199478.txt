pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw We absolutely love this place! We go at least once a month to savor these wonderful, mouth watering pizzas! We also go to the new one on camelback that serves pasta and sandwich dishes (both absolutely amazing, and made fresh in house.) We really like that they make their breads and noodles from scratch. The ingredients used are locally grown, which is awesome. They also feature Arizona ingredients and beverages on each menu.  

My favorite pizza is the bianco verde with prosciutto, and my husband gets the margherita pizza with sopressata, or even just plain! These are our go to's, but the wiseguy and rosa are amazing too! I adore the speidini... procuitto wrapped around fontina cheese on a bed of arugula, drizzled with olive oil! Mmmm, I want this all right now! Also, we typically get a bottle of wine, which seems to be the best way to go. They have a good selection of local and Italian wines at a reasonable price. 

Make sure you go before your starving though, because you are likely to wait at the original location. We have waited anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours. Luckily, Bar Bianco is right next door, so you can hop in for a cocktail... or three, and an appetizer while you wait. Both spots are quaint with timeless charm, so perfect for a date night or place to bring visitors. The pizza never disappoints! We will continue to come at least once a month!
