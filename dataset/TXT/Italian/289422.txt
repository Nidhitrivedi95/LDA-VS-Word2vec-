ZtJ6sTq7-5rL9ORUtQJHAQ Went as a party of four. We had a coupon for midweek:  buy one entree, get one half price. We ordered appetizers and drinks, then 3 entrees. I just had soup. The half off was applied to the soup only. When I questioned the calculation I was ignored by the waiter and treated rudely by the owner. "If you need $5 so badly I will pay you out of the tip jar". I will never return.
