Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A Very typical buffet but the shortened version of it.  I mean, this is very small for a Vegas buffet and charges about $22 for dinner.  So that means the options were small as well, but at least it had a carving station of prime rib only.  There was fried rice, but no orange chicken!!!

I wasn't that hungry, so I wasn't too mad that there weren't too many options there.  I only got salmon and prime rib as my protein and potatoes and rice as my starch.  Can't remember anything else there that was too spectacular.  For less than $10 more, go to a bigger buffet if you're hungry.
