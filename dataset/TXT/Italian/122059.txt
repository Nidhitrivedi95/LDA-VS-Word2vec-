HfOQdfvijWVWMFgMIhVuBA From Chicago this was the farthest thing from it.  The beef was just shredded in juice. Had no real taste. Bread was blah and giardinera was super week. Pittsburghers don't know the difference unless they have gotten real beef in Chicago before. This was not it. Won't be going back. Should be called shredded roast beef sandwich. Guy that served it was nice though.
