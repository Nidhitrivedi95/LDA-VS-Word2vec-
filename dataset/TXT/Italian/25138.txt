4HEF6BuO_BBsTmvcMCbhhg Every experience I have had a Sorso Room has surpassed my expectations! The bruschetta is phenomenal, extremely fresh, and the portions are huge! The first time I was there, we ordered a bottle of wine and not only did the waiter recommend another wine he thought we would like better, which we ended up loving and order everytime we go now, but it was also cheaper! The service is outstanding and they allowed us to purchase the centerpiece at the table! Very excited to now be apart of the wine club - which is a great concept, where you are able to try an assortment of wines at different serving sizes!
