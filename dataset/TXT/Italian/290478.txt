ZvtELJTUOh0yRrPxyyiakQ We ordered a carry out from the Elliot Rd location due to Yelp-we aren't from the area and do not have Oregano's in our area- and it was completely awesome!!  The girl at the carry out desk couldn't have been more helpful.  She thought of everything, giving us plates and napkins due to her inquiring and finding out we were staying in a hotel not far away.  We were so impressed with everything overall I called in and spoke to the manager and let him know how great everything was.  Every business should treat its customers the way this one does!!!!!!!
