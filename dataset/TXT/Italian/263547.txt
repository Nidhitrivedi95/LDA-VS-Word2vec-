wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q Food was very tasty, and our waiter, Chris, was very attentive.
Informed Chris, we didn't get our appetizer within minutes the head waiter came to our table and stated that he was sorry this happened, it should be out shortly and it was on the house. This is what I call good service. Thank you.
