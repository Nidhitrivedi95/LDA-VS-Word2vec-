hsDkxhc-_YYsVqAeQBJJjg Saw it featured on DDD Food Network with Joe Fiery.  So while in town to a visit to MCU, I decided to check it out..  Went early Sunday afternoon with two friends. They didn't know where we were going. So, our Uber driver took us there to a non description brick building next to railroad tracks and under a rusting bridge.... We where a little nervous, but soon as we were stumbling out of our UberCar, a heavyset lady, runs out of the place and starts yelling at her husband to put on his big boy pants..  "It's not a biker bar and... No bikers don't like to ride at 20 degrees when it's snowing.. I saw a DDD sticker on the door and knew we were in the right place.
Not too many people in the joint, people checked us out more than us checking them out... Us because we actually dressed in dressy casual and the were dressed casual dressy.
Sit wherever you wasn't fellows... CE waiter comes gets us some Big Jim Brew.... And it was pretty good beer.... Big Jim is starting to grow on me. My two friends still didn't know what this place is..
I ordered three Big Jim Ales, and we all start enjoying. I ordered the Reuben Sandwich... It came with toasted pumpernickel bread a hefty portion of meat and the same for the sauerkraut. Best I've ever tasted, even comparing with Manhattan Delis.....

Great food, very friendly, clean, ...

If you are in Pittsburgh, stop by this place. You will not regret it.
