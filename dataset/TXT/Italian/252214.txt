VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Business meeting here. Glad we had a reservation. Packed place. We had a party of 5 and our bill was $622! But vendor paid. We had calamari appetizer and baked clams. VERY tasty. Server was extremely friendly & knowledgable but also a great salesman. Lots of up-selling and wine glasses where never empty. My bosses had streaks but I only had a dry salad and then the scallop appetizer for dinner. Amazing scallops!!!! My friend had Sea bass- also great! Strawberry shortcake was 'ok' but terimasu was wonderful!! If I can afford it, I'd be back!!
