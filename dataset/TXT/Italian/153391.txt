KY8J9dIOKD2vL0jdzUiuhg Had a really nice dinner at this intimate restaurant. Food is very good and not rushed. Portions are large and a good variety of options. Bread with oil and cheese is on the table to start. Dinners come with salad or soup. Entrees are delicious. Byob. Some seats outside but they have an open garage type door to make dining very nice. Servers are great. Make sure to call ahead to make reservations. It is small but worth visiting.
