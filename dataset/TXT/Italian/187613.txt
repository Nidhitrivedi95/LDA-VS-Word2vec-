Wanting to try a number of dishes, I convinced one of them to order multiple dishes and go share-sies.  We settled on chicken Parmesan (my favorite "staple" Italian dish), a meatball sub and I also decided to try their pizza (available by the slice).

Our server took our drink orders and quickly brought out an order of their garlic rolls with an oil and red wine vinegar dip.  The garlic rolls were warm and delicious.

By ordering the chicken parm we also got a side salad.  It was a standard salad (iceberg lettuce, tomato, carrot, shredded cheese) with their house dressing (Italian, which was light but flavorful) and was pretty filling.  Then out came the main dishes.

The single pizza slice had an unusual pepperoni arrangement and the crust was on the doughy side for my taste.

The chicken Parmesan had a rich sauce and nice cheese ratio to go along with the pasta.  Their sauce is hard to explain...not really sweet and not overly vinegary either, more like "rich" (maybe made with veal stock or something?).  It was not my favorite style of sauce...not really bad per se, just not a taste I care for.

The meatball sub bread was crispy and the meat seemed more like ground chunks than actual meatballs, with the same sauce described above in the chicken parm dish.

We were well taken care of and had a nice chat with the owner as well ( a very personable guy!).  Reasonable priced for lunch, a good choice for the area.
