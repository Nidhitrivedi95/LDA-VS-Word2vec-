gsGxpk5uhy1XvaUSOrWTug It has been about a year since my last visit to this particular OG location. It just doesn't fit in with my lifestyle change and if I can't eat the ravioli portobello, what's the point? But I came here recently with a friend for Soup-Salad-Breadsticks for lunch. I skipped the breadsticks because I can't really have them but the soup and salad were the way they always are. I had the minestrone and the low fat dressing on the side so I can control the calories. Unfortunately, my friend couldn't say the same. She had the grilled chicken caesar salad and asked specifically if the chicken had any breading on it or coating at all and asked for no croutons as she watches her gluten intake. She was told no breading or coating at all on the grilled chicken and no problem about no croutons. What comes out? A piece of breaded chicken with grill marks on it. Fortunately, we got no croutons. The other problem is that our server disappeared after serving us so it was quite a while before she could ask about getting her grilled chicken fixed. Naturally this comes with it's apologies and then a visit from the manager. When the new salad came out, not only was the chicken plainly grilled, but now there were no croutons, no parmesan cheese, and no dressing. :( If I wanted to have another bowl of soup, it wasn't going to be forthcoming. This was a disappointing visit because the manager, Lynn, is super nice and has been here forever. I think it was just a fluke with our server. Either way...a basic visit to have basic food that was less than basic service.
