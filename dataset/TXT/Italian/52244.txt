9S7RUjzkdpU4MDxUxkvLvg Fridays has gone down. The food used to be good. This place was extra crowed and hot. Everybody looked hot and mad when you walked in. The host/greeter was over it. He didn't smile nor was enthused to be there. Nobody said hello or appeared friendly luckily I'm an aggressive and demanding type of person and don't wait around. Although it was busy and extra crowded does not excuse lack of customer service I think when it's busy your and take the time to care is when service counts the most. Don't just treat people anyway because you're busy learn how to work under pressure. This place was packed like every table was taken people were waiting inside and outside. The food was nasty. The chicken was dry, the broccoli was stale and they forgot what I asked for and paid for. I won't be returning to this location due to bad service and I don't like the food. I had to throw it away. I don't know who they have cooking in there but they need new cooks
