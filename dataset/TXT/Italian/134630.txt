IS5tQNVzyVYbI2zl8yEaKA When I want classic Italian, and not some funky reinterpretation of what Italian might be like after an "in-Fusion" (can I patent a word?) of something else, this is the place. I don't WANT the decor to change: it evokes old paesano. Never had a bad meal here, and most were stellar. Over the years, had veal (many times), pasta (hard to pass, and I can't think of better than their lasagna), and a few wanderings into other areas (fish, and steak once, but I always feel odd having steak in an Italian restaurant).

Read other reviews. One mentioned an absence of chicken. Might have been a random occurrence (a group ate it all?) but they have two chicken dishes on the menu, and that has not budged in quite a few years.

It IS getting pricier, but they have to live with the times (municipal taxes, power, heating, and the ingredients themselves ever on the rise).
