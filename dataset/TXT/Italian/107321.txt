FXiPQQGr_2bwlJ4wOrW2eA Absolutely wonderful.  The service was great, the food was amazing.  I can't wait to go back!  I had the Veal Romano, the veal was cooked perfectly as was the sauce, a perfect blend of butter, lemon juice, capers and artichoke hearts.  My husband had the lasagna, his barometer when we try new Italian places, he was impressed.  Looking forward to taking friends next time and sitting out on the patio!!  You don't have to walk thru the casino to get to it, drive to the hotel entrance and valet your car.  A perfect non-casino date night!
