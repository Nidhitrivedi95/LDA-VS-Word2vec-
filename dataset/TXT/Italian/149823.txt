KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ I had a fabulous dinning experience. Everything was perfect from the greeting all the way to desert. I started with a glass of red wine and shared the fried mozzarella, meat balls, and mixed fried sea food. Everything was prepared perfectly. For the main course I had the night special of salmon served on green beans. Again it was delicious. I ended the evening with an espresso and Tiramisu. 
If you are in the strip, and wanting a fine dining experience, come to Rao's.
