(My first Gelato was delicious!)

My family and I were walking through the Venetian mall and spotted this little dessert shop!  

QUE BELLA!

So, as we walked in just to look around (YEAH RIGHT!), the lady behind the gelato counter had us try a sample!  Too be honest, I have eaten a ton of food but have never had gelato!  UNTIL NOW!

So, I tried cream flavored and (QUE HEAVEN SOUNDER!), WOW!  I instantly fell in love!  We sat down with our gelato and just enjoyed the day.  The only problem with this place was the tables were all very sticky but overall I didn't care cause I was too much into my gelato!
