SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ I absolutely love Italian food, and even though it s pretty simple to make, somehow some places manage to mess it up...I could it pasta/bread everyday....( not so good for my weight, but you only live once)...I love sitting in this place and eat next to the fountain ( which by the way is totally NOT a replica of the Trevi Fountain in Italy) But oh well, I guess Poseidon is more in tune with Caesars...
