c5x6HWB8MTZvlTgabihaSw Wife and I had lunch there today and the overall experience was tremendous!  The veal scaloppine and the pasta with meatballs were absolutely delicious and the homemade bread with the pesto dipping sauce completed a great meal. Will definitely return for another meal and we highly recommend this restaurant.  Plus, excellent service!  You can't go wrong here.
