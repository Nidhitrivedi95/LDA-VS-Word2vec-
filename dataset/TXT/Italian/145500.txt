k3fn9JFiNLNy2q5p0cE1kg Finally made reservations to this adorable place Saturday night. Pulled up and it's such a cute exterior, however, different than expected on the inside - darker but nice and any place that has a huge bottle of Veuve on display is okay with me!

The service is pretty fantastic here, staff coming out of every corner to help make your experience enjoyable. 

We had a Malbec reserve that was delish - a great recommend by our server. I thought the bread that comes out was okay, a little hard and saturate with oil. However, the tuna tartare was nice and the pappardelle was maybe one of the best I've ever had. The sauce was incredible and the noodles cooked perfectly. In fact, it was so good that I really wish I had another serving of it now. :)
