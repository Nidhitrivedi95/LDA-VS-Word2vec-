_4n7K_UdRSEMw4vJdsU9jQ Typically great wings.  Just ordered crispy, came out gross and fatty, undercooked.  Customer service terrible, I told and showed cashier who did not fix order and responded poorly.  Sadly as a regular customer, I will not be eating at this location anymore and would recommend that you not eat here either.
