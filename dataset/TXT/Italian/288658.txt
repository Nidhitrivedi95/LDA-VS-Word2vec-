ZrsDrRhx3rnR55dXbiQSzw All I can say is #13! I don't even know what it is called but it is my favorite! Everything on the menu is great but #13 is my favorite. I have a hard time not getting it when I go there. My family has been going since it opened and now they know us by name--woops! The staff is great. Best part is I always have a little to take home for leftovers!

Take out is just as delicious! 

Now that I have moved from Cleveland I crave it when I come back home. They have recently started bottling some of their sauces that I was not leaving home without. You can buy it at Heinens. It is great! 

Always busy so make sure to call ahead!
