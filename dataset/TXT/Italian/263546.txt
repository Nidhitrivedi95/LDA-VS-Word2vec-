wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q Ughh so much regret when we went here I have high hopes with there food but is so disappointing my food is $19 ordered shrimp scampi but just end up eating the shrimp out of it they had my son's order mixed up with someone else's food my husband got steak and he usually eat that all when we leave restaurant but this time he didn't he just didn't like it. The only reason why I give two star is because my daughter like her food which is macaroni and cheese atleast that one didn't go to waste but rather than that didn't like the food our first time it will probably the last unless other locations would have better food..taste wise.
