ewEDv_q-K0fV0FepkHB8sA We celebrated our 25th anniversary at Tornado and it was worth every penny we spent. We ordered the 8 oz. TBone and 8 oz tenderloin. The portion sizes were much bigger than listed and they were done perfect at medium rare. The taste was exquisite and flavorful. The French onion soup was terrific and the wedge salad substantial. We visited on a Tuesday and it was surprisingly busy. I would recommend the Tornado and we will return.
