oCULDH0GWWLM4GdLSt0Huw Took a college group as a treat, and was so disappointed. One girl had to ask twice for her drink; another's meal was served 20 minutes before everyone else, and had to be returned. Another had her meal served 15 minutes after the rest of us. Our water glasses were hardly refilled, and we couldn't see a waiter to get help. Food was so-so. Cannot recommend coming here again.
