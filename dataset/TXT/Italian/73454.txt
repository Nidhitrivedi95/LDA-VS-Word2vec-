clL0-uy-DH0bJgBFEfoxFA I had arrived for a dinner with family on a Saturday night to eat at Alice Fazooli's for the first time ever. The decor is extremely nice and the menu is well described. Each dish on the menu. Is worded to make a person who is hungry want to try everything. 

Our waiter was extremely nice and helpful with eveything from asking how the meal was to refilling drinks and packing meals at the end.

I had ordered the Baked Carbonara, and I must say, beware this dish. The dish is extremely salty and the bacon in the carbonara pasta doesn't help the salty taste. It was difficult finishing the second half of the dish. Good service but very disappointing food.
