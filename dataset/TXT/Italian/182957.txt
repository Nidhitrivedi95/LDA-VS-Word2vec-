OBG1j517k7aZRNC1HAL0TA Okay, so clearly I cheat on my gluten free 'lifestyle' now and again.  I'm not Celiac and I feel for those who are; thankfully I can just throw back the digestive enzymes and let the fun begin, and on these rare occasions it's usually worth it ;)

Let's start with the best part, and quite frankly the only thing to bother reviewing when you hold yourself to the standards of the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana; the pizza, we shared two...

First the Margherita with tomatoes that tasted like they were plucked straight from the vines in Roma Italy, fresh aromatic whole leaf basil, oozy mozzarella and olive oil.  Second the Funghi; mushrooms, that lovely mozzarella, and truffle crema, although a little light on the truffle Marky Mark.  Both with excellent crispy, bubbly and ever so slightly charred thin crust.  This is true Italian style pizza served molto rapidamente!

The tiramisu is deconstructed, delicious and just the right portion size.  It is served with a shot glass of espresso granita, not bad, but I could have done without it.

Our bill was $85 before tax and tip, so for a couple 'zaas, one desert and two glasses of wine it's not exactly budget friendly if you're so inclined.  The pizza was quite good and we may go back, however we've yet to try Queen Margherita.

We sat in the casual front bar section on a lovely night with the windows open and I have to say those white chairs are extremely comfortable!  If the scenery were better (not at Don Mills Rd) I could sit out on this patio just sharing a bottle of wine and lounge very Italian style for hours.

I give 3 stars because I think the location really leaves much to be desired, the prices are fairly steep (I abhor when restaurants charge as much for a glass of wine as the entire bottle costs), and when there are only three ingredients on a pizza, one being truffle crema I should bloody well taste it!
