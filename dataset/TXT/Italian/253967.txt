vUDqNV3RhI3FmZRwS7039g My friend wanted to have her birthday dinner somewhere special, and unfortunately we were very disappointed with Bobby's.

Herein lies a list of grievances:

* Unorganized hostess and manager. We only knew the birthday girl, so we didn't know what the other guests would look like. We thought it wouldn't be an issue, but even with us providing the manager with the name on the reservation, she couldn't tell us where we were seated or if anyone from our party had arrived.

* Misrepresentation. The birthday girl called to make sure there would be live jazz, but the whole night featured a bad Latin fusion group instead.

* Crowded. There were too many tables and chairs crammed into the main downstairs room. Guests could not freely leave the table on one side without bumping into other patrons.

* Awkward. The chairs are too short for the table height; both men and women at our table had to uncomfortably perch at the edge of their seats to reach their food. The menus are also too large in dimension (or again there are too many seats crammed together) as we couldn't even hold our menus open without smacking each other.

* Rude. Our waitress was short with us and pushy about getting our orders. Also, she seemed angry when we asked if we could get a photo of our group celebrating a birthday. While we posed for our group photo, a couple waiters didn't just clear our plates -- they actually had the gall to clear all of our coats, jackets and phones by throwing them into a pile at one end of the table. That was really weird! Why are the waiters touching our purses and cell phones?

The one good thing:
* The pistachio crusted lamb chop was delicious; it's the only reason this rating has one star.
