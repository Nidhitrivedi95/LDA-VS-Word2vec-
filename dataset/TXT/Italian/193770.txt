pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg Came to Carmines for a business dinner. We had a large group and the hostess was really great about changing our table as our party size increased. We sat near the back and could watch as the staff brought out the dishes for other diners and man just like the reveiws say - portions are huge! 

I've been to other family style italian restaurants (bucca or maggianos) and I think Carmines is way better than both of those. We ordered the Carmines salad and anti pasta dishes to start. Then our mains were meatballs with pasta in red sauce, veal parm, and broccoli and sausage rigatoni in white sauce. They were all really tasty- i especially liked the veal parm. For dessert we had the titanic and choc bread pudding. 

All in all a great meal - had wine flowing and good fun.  

I do have to mention they have a waiter there that sings italian opera -- AMAZING.  He was singing happy birthday to a few folks and came over and sang our group a different song. He was super nice and he's really good! Go see him for yourself!!!
