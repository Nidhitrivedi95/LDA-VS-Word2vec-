BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA 1st time trying this place and wished we tried it sooner. Much more authentic than the places we have been going at Scottsdale quarter & kierland. Service was excellent & our server Rodrigo was super attentive. Great wine selection to fit our different tastes. We could eat the grilled octopus & burrata with smoked salmon almost everyday. The homemade pappardelle was cooked to perfection. Only desired more of it than the accompanied meat sauce. Wish we had the appetite to try their pizzas & desserts but definitely next time.
