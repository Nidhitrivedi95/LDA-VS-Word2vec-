9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg the Pizza was very delicious with fresh Mozzarella and basilicum! penne arrabiata was also pretty good. i must mention the bruschetta, they tasted like Heaven! The Patio is small but very nice, the restaurant itself is quite noisy and dark. thats why i give 4 out of 5 Stars. i would definitely eat and drink there again! the mango peach bellini was very sweet but it tasted so good !
