4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg Food and Service was excellent!  Highly recommend.  I stopped in alone while my fiance was at a conference early evening Nov 29, 2016. Bartender KeAo was Genuinely welcoming and friendly-- unlike the typical  script of empty half pleasantries, she created an inviting and friendly atmosphere -KeAo was truly refreshing as were the lovely ladies from Wynn/ Encore  Marketing beside me at the bar (Jessica and sorry forgot other name).  I also enjoyed meeting the chef   and was delighted to hear the chef will be coming to Boston next year to open another Allegro in Everett MA.  I'm looking forward to it! Hope to see KeAo there too!  PS the eggplant parmesan is fabulous!
