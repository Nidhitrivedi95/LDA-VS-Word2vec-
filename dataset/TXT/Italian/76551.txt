cvLS5XdoeNluAiwBBm6opA I really hate to give this place a mediocre review. 

I went as part of an 8-person group, which could be part of the issue. Service was so slow. We were there for 3 hours. They appeared to be understaffed on a Saturday night, and the waiter apologized multiple times, but the slow service interrupted our post-dinner plans. We finished the appetizer arrived before we even placed an order - meaning that everyone ate it while holding the (large) menu in their lap. Also, the server was so distracted that he took my neighbor's mussels from her before she was done...

On the plus side, the food is amazing. I think they may have the best fried zucchini I've ever eaten. It was sliced so thinly and covered in the most delicate fried coating - likely just flour without breadcrumbs. Not greasy, and simply scrumptious. 

For dinner, I had the vegetable ravioli. They were delicious and had a nice mix of veggies inside. Also, it was a meal that wasn't oversized. No leftovers for me (in a good way)!

Also, while they have a great bar and a god wine selection, you can also bring your own wine. Good to know if you're budgeting or just looking to have a particular wine. 

Make a reservation. You'll likely have a better experience than me, and I'll be going back to hopefully bump this up a star or two!
