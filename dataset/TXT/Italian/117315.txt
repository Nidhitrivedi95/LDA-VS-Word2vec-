GXDRFAunLh0aRao6ERnM4A We stopped by Francesco's for lunch on our way out of town and due to carrying our baggage we wanted to stop somewhere close and we happened to be staying at TI.

We ordered the calamari as an appetizer.  It was by-far the absolute worst calamari that I have ever had in my life.  I explained this to a fellow foodie and they said, "was it like chewing on rubber bands?"  I said "no, it was like chewing on rubber tires"  

The waitress was very smart in that she immediately took it off the bill and consequently got tipped at 25% as if we paid for the calamari as well.  Astute service should always be well treated.

We got a pizza to share after the rubber course and I'm not sure why someone would grill onions and *then* put them on the pizza but that is what they do there.  The pizza was substandard at best.  Cheese was mediocre and the toppings were as well.

With all the money in Vegas couldn't they send their chef to NY or Chicago and research how to make a pizza that isn't trash?

Perhaps they are better for dinner but I'd still steer clear.
