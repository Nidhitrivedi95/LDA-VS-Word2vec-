2i0dDzxLuQQAwzxDZVR-1g Really expensive food for what you actually get. Food is tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary and portions are extremely small. 
What we found the most problematic was the service. The server was extremely rude. She had a huge "I don't want to serve you" sign written all over her face. Honestly. No smile, and zero courtesy. When she was taking away our plates, she didn't even wait for one of my friends to finish. As my friend was grabbing the last bite of her plate, the server was urging her to finish because "she had to take the plates away". 
When we ordered desserts, it took them over half an hr to bring them to the table. And when they finally did, one of the orders was wrong. 
The manager approached us after we complained, but he only offered to make our experience better next time. There would definitely not be a next time. 
Only good thing, the decor. The place is beautifully designed and decorated. It is very pleasant. Would have been nice to see food and service at that same level.
