W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg "Ubriaco Depravazione" stop 3.

After stepping back out onto neon and fall leaves spattered Mayfield road, we all marched into La Dolce Vita( which is Italian for "the suite life of Zack and Cody"). It was empty and i assume the kitchen was closed. Although....the most gorgeous woman i've ever seen in Little Italy was nursing a plate of something at the end of the bar. Myself and yelper #@!! were awestruck by this Mediterranean marvel. Vorrei punzonare tutti qui al viso, qualora lo desiderasse, mia bella melanzana fiorire. That's Italian for "i would punch everyone in here in the face, if you so wished, my beautiful eggplant blossom." Sorry, i've been hooked on the Italian translator website ever since. 

Anyhow, i only had a Bass ale, others kept downing the vino, and some sobered up with shirley temples. The view of Mayfield is incredible at night from their bar. Very metro and hip, as was the SATC-esque music they were bumping. I think i might have eaten here like five years ago, but can't be sure. I give it four stars(or stirs if you will, hehe) just as a cool place for a drink.
