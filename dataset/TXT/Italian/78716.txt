D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA I give this place a solid 3 stars. And here's why...

We had purchased Paint Nite Groupons and it just so happened that the picture we chose was at Evo. We arrived around 1:30 pm (painting started at 2 pm) and grabbed a few seats at the bar. While the ambiance was nice the female bartender was not. She brought two of the ladies in my party their drinks and when asking what I wanted, she walked off while I commenced to responding. No bueno.

Because it was Restaurant Week, many of the items on the HH menu were not available. Suggestion: If you're participating in a special promotion perhaps you should not offer guests the regular HH menu. Creating a menu for the promotion may better suit both the customer and the venue. No one wants to be disappointed when they ask for something and get shot down with, "thats not on the menu this week" or "neither is that, it's Restaurant Week".

The female bartender was extremely slow...this was waaaay before the Paint Nite guests started to arrive. Them showing up made her slower. Tony, the male server, tended to the PN crowd. He too was slow. But, in his defense, he appeared to be the only one serving 20+ ppl. Said female bartender was still slow and appeared to be of no assistance.

We ordered a pizza at 3:10 pm. By the time PN was over at 4, the pizza still hadn't arrived. The intention was to eat, drink and paint. We ended up canceling the order. 

With two functions occurring simultaneously (PN and Restaurant Week) there should've been adequate staff to accommodate the crowd. Upon walking into Evo I really wanted to like this place and try it another time. But, with how things turned out today. I doubt it.
