wV6Nle04jS8I40tUHPUiiQ This place has it all!  We came on a Thursday night, August 13, 2015.  We ordered the date night deal. It was great since we got our own salads and an app and a pizza. All the food was exceptional but the fried ravioli was my favorite. They also had a live musician that night and she was fantastic.  We planned on leaving much earlier but we ended up staying the entire time. The vibe of the restaurant was a fun place to enjoy wine for the night.
