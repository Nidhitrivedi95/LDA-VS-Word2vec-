We also had the pasta which was perfectly al dente and the sugo perfectly seasoned.  This is the kind of place one goes to when you want real, wholesome, authentic Italian food.  You have to have time to savour and not rush through the meal.  The waiter who served us was nice, low-key and provided impeccable, professional service.  A place I would definitely go back to.
