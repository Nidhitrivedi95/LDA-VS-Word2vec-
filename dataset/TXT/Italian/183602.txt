If you like it saucayyy make sure you order a side of dipping sauce because there isn't too much sauce inside of the panzo.

I've had both the baked and fried, both are delicious but I prefer the baked panzos because the fried ones are a tad oily for my liking. I have yet to try the pizza so I'll be going back to get some soon!
