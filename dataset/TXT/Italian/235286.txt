TVKenh65WwJX3zEr36zKCA So good, I had a dream about it!

LOL

We were expecting a long wait, but we came around 730pm and sat ourselves right at the bar!

We ordered a dozen oysters, Crab Pan Roast, and a Shrimp & Lobster Fra Diavolo.
Paired it with Arrogant Bastard Ale & a glass of moscato!

They were generous with the crab meat in my Pan Roast and it was just a bowl of creamy, tomato-y, crabby goodness! 
I also loved their moscato, which completed my dinner!

We've definitely been missing out!

I can't wait to come back and try a Pan Roast with shrimp, crab AND lobster! Mmm..
