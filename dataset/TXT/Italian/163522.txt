lwpQQflP1CGJPV7QLybzOg We live close by and tried this place out now 2 times. The food is not good but I convinced my fiance this second time just to go for a simple glass of wine on the patio since its so close. For a wine bar they have a poor selection of wine. We were never noticed walking in, even stood there to let someone know we would be outside. We walked and sat outside with our 6 year old and about 5 minutes later we were told at 8:45pm that we could not sit outside with him, only on the restaurant side. That is a first for me. Needless to say we left.
