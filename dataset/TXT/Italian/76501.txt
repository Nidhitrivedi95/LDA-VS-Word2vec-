CUGswyxGdkcd4IE1oHc80A My SO and I stopped in for lunch yesterday at Bar Vespa.  My first visit was during the Yelp event a few months earlier and I was impressed by the service and food.  They did not disappoint the second time around!

The food was great, there were on peculiar things to comment on.  I love their calamari but I did not understand the fried polenta that accompanied the dish.  I would have preferred more calamari than partly fried/soggy polenta.  I also did not understand the uncut romaine lettuce that came with the ceaser salad, it felt like the dish was unfinished.

Aside from that, I loved loved the risotto balls!!!  The bread with the herb and olive oil mix was lovely!

Service was fabulous as usual, the right amount of attentiveness without being annoying.

They have drink specials from 4-7pm!  I will definitely be back.
