NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ My sister and I went here on August 9th. As two Italian girls from Philadelphia we found a place that cooks like our mom does! We used open table to place our reservations we walked in and got seated before our actual reservation time. Which is really hard to do in Las Vegas. Yuri was our waiter and I can't say enough about how wonderful he was!! We ordered the fried calamari to start which was amazing! I ordered the special which was the Sunday gravy with ravioli which are two of my favorite things! Initially I was just going to do the Sunday gravy with rigatoni but then Yuri came over and told us about the ravioli special. There was no doubt about it I had to try it! My sister got the lasagna which was great it was such a huge portion that she couldn't finish it. And the bread was so crusty and fresh which is great for dipping! I can't say how much we felt welcome here. All the staff were extremely courteous and welcoming!!! We will definitely be back!!!
