fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I went here with some friends a couple weeks ago at about 830 pm. It was great. I asked the server what he would recommend to me and he said the Pad Thai with chicken. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was delicious. The server was very friendly and helpful.

We came back a few days ago at about 430 pm and I was not as impressed. I ordered the Pad Thai again, but I was not happy with the server we had. She took forever to get our drinks and was not the friendliest. She also took my husbands soda while we were eating to refill it and took forever to bring it back. It was not even empty yet. I like the Pad Thai, but there is nothing else very appetizing on the menu for me. I would come back for the Pad Thai.
