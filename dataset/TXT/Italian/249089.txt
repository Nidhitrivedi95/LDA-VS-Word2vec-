VgfqjXetLMxn5X5_uomBkg The food at Alexi's is good.  Lunch time chicken pitas were my favorite, and at night for the occasional dinner I'd get one of the fish entrees.

The atmosphere is a bit odd, but the servers are good natured and quick.

The only reservation I'd have is the odd treatment I sometimes got by the host(ess) when I did not have a reservation.  I was a regular at this place for a long time.  Occasionally though I'd forget to call ahead to reserve a table.  Even if the place was completely empty, without a reservation the host(ess) many times will become visibly annoyed and act as if it is a big deal to find you a table and then put you in a corner somewhere.

I don't know if everyone feels that way, or if it was only a way to try to condition me to call ahead next time since they knew my face.

Overall however, other than that, it is a decent place to go for the occasional grub.
