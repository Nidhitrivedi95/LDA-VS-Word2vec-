q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ The best italian food I've had in a long time. Service was excellent. great ambiance and  fantastic live entertainment with Bobby! He croons just like Sinatra. Wife and i shared a wonderful evening with friends and could not have picked a better place! Loved everything about Capos! Would highly recommend to anyone! 5+stars in my book! Will definitely be back soon!!
