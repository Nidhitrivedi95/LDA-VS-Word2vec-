N_cCvYUP0dQeLKflgoUrXQ What a terrible experience. Today was my first time eating at Boka Pizza as this is my first day working downtown. Darius took my order and was nice and inviting being a first time customer. When I opened my order once I got back to work I realized it was all wrong. I ordered the cheese steak and asked for no mushrooms on it. It was mainly loaded with veggies with a lot of mushrooms. I figured well at least I have onion ring I get to enjoy only to find out that they gave me fries which were mostly soggy and uncooked. I also got to the bottom of my root beer to find little hard black plastic like specks. I only noticed them after feeling them in my mouth and in my throat. I have no idea what they were and I generally would not gripe so much but the fact I paid $15.19 for a drink half sandwich and onions rings is outrageously stupid. Needless to say I will never go back there nor will I ever promote this place of business since they cannot read a receipt, listen to customers and have no level of cleanliness with the crap I found down in my drink. I think I will also be giving the health dept. a call since I don't know what I ingested.
