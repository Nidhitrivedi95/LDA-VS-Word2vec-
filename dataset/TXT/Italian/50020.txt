The fresh burrata is so light and creamy, the fresh savory zeppole OMG, lets just say I could just eat those and burrata and be happy.  The homemade pasta and pizza are very tasty with great sauces and toppings.  

Make sure you are prepared for on street metered parking or using the complimentary valet as long as its not full.
