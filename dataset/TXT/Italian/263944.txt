WX8cx6tfFcEn0cK4cIbWag My husband and I recently spent a weekend in Las Vegas and chose to dine here for lunch one afternoon. We each ordered an entree and shared the Snapper Ceviche as an appetizer. Hours later we both fell ill with food poisoning, with the only shared food all day being the appetizer at this restaurant. Needless to say, when I am in Las Vegas again I will not be dining at this establishment with poor controls around food quality. Thank you for ruining our weekend away.
