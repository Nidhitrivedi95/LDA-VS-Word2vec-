eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA I was always a fan of brio since there is one closer to me that's located at town square.  I think i like this one better though.  It is close to valet and it seems bigger.  I order the calamari and caprese salad with fresh mozzarella cheese and basil with balsamic glaze drizzled around the plate.  These were Pretty easy and typical dishes that u go wrong with at brio.
