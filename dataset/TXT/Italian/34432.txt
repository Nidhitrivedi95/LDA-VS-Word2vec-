6D4L8YpkhAh_YwaLmhoMNg Wife and I enjoyed our Sunday lunch. Food was excellent, and service outstanding, but there were few patrons as we arrived shortly after noon. I had not eaten in a Macaroni Grill in over 20 years and was pleasantly surprised. The facility is a step above Carrabba's and 2 above Olive Garden. But the woodwork could definitely use a good dusting.
