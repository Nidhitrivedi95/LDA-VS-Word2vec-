g9iIBuh-g4ld3w3kUWLMqw This pizza was awful! I dont even know where to start, the tasteless cheese, the crust which was either stale or just cooked so much that you couldn't even bite it unless you wanted to break a tooth....

The service was bad. Sat at the bar which was empty, and watched the bartender keep changing channels on the television. He was apparently too busy to see we had drank all of our drink and offer us a new one and either decided to ignore us or forgot when we asked for extra napkins.

This place is lame.
