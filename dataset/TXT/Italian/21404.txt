38-sjGYYVcQEKrZe5Nu47A This is a hole in the wall place in the Smith's shopping center, I stumbled on this place shortly after moving back to the area and was staying at mom's up the street....really needed a break!  Found this place with COLD beer and great food.  

The lasagna is very good, as is the meatball sandwich- their fries are crispy and fresh.  

Have had the Panini and that was also tasty.  

It gets really busy here during sporting events and on the weekend, normally I haven't waited very long but it does get very crowded and can be a bit noisy. 

The parking can get a bit hairy but its fairly close no matter where you have to park.  

All in all, I really like this place, good drink and good food.  I'll go back!!
