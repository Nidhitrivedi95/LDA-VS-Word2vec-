mDiFWhywAziq9SKnj6am_Q We were looking for a nice Italian Restaurant close to home. I googled and read the reviews then I realized this was right down the road. The atmosphere was awesome! Patio seating so romantic. The the food came and what a taste for the senses. The food and the service was great. We loved it so much that we ordered pizza and wings to go the very next night. This is a gem of a restaurant we loved it!!!!
