Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg Ive only had one favorite pizza place, and that's in my hometown that is too far away. But I found metro pizza, thanks to yelp. The sauce they use is so good and different. They're sesame bread is awesome and the seeds give it an unusual but tasty twist. Just don't call the number they have listed on google, it's wrong. 

I'm really picky about my pizza, but this is the best so far. I always get Hawaiian, and it's always fresh and yummy. :)
