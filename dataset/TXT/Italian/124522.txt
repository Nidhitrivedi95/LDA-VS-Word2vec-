Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ Ok, well, clearly I should have tried the chicken. If I was still in the area, I definitely would, it sounds scrumptious and that's even without the reviews here, just looking at the piks.  But, for whatever reason, I didn't, I ordered a "small" pizza with meatballs, $14.05.  Gotta say, it was not very appetizing.  The crust was burnt, and the "meatballs" were uh, interesting--are they suppose to be flat and a thickness of a half dollar (and just looking at them, the texture doesn't exactly start the juices running)?  Neither the pizza itself, nor the meatballs, were very tasty.  Wouldn't order the pizza again, but if I happened to be back up in that area, would definitely try the chicken.  Just wish I had done so, instead of that pizza.  Suddenly Papa John's (I know, I know) is beginning to sound good.  Sigh.  I miss that $14.05. Sniff.
