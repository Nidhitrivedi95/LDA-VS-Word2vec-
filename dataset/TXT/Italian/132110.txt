iJpmIt-i9-VeChouLcPXbA After hearing rave reviews my family and I decided to give it a try...all I can say is the bread was the best part of the meal. The calamari was very tough my son and I both ordered marsala wich tasted like it was poured straight from the marsala wine bottle onto our chicken, the fettuchini had no flavor and the salad was nothing to rave about. For the prices we were charged now that I sit and think about it I should have sent the food back but needless to say we left very dissatisfied and wont be going back!
