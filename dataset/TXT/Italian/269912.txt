xko9a0myoKffQMzz96O2jA Little Chicago Pizza is the best thin-crust pizza I think I've ever had. The restaurant is small, as they probably do most of their business carry-out or delivery.  We did eat in one time, and someone came right out from the kitchen to serve us, even filling our water cups from the soda fountain that was perfectly accessible for us to do ourselves.  Anywhere else I'd have expected a snotty "the water is right there" rather than real service.  Everybody is very friendly, even when on the phone taking orders.  Price is comparable to any other pizza spot around, but the pizza itself, if you like thin-crust, is just awesome.  Add in the great service and you have a solid pizza place for the south Scottsdale area.
