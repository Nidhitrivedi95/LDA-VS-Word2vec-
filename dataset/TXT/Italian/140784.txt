JlMTixvNQ5bUGSxF12TLdw This barros is terrible compared to 40th st and greenway, and the 51st ave and union locations. There was pretty much nobody there and my pizza wasn't ready until 10 later than the quoted pick up time. Also, my pizza had no sauce. Ok, there was enough sauce to give the dough under the cheese a slight orange tint. You couldn't taste it though. Dry pizza. And I actually hate sauce, and tomatoes, and end up scraping off a little sauce when I eat regular pizzas. So that says a lot coming from me. Also, the crust was not typical barros  wonderful and fluffy. It tasted and looked like  Digorno frozen pizza crust. Dissapointing all around. I will drive to a different location next time
