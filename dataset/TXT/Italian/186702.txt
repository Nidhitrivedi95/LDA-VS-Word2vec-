Orgm9nmcClxnAUva4nOKyA I like Hot House. It gives me the option of stuffing my face with embarrassing quantities of good food rather than mediocre food. The "award-winning" Sunday brunch buffet is what I came for and I must say, the food quality justifies the price. Both are pretty damn high! (~$25)

Onto the food itself, I didn't find there to be that much variety but this is brunch after all. What it does have, it does very well. Omelette bar with fancy ingredients? Uhh...yes please! Cake cutting station with 10 different cakes? Pile it on! Not only did the food taste fresh, you can SEE some of it being freshly made (like waffles). Gotta love the mussels in white wine, the crab salad, and the mixed berry white chocolate cake. 

I also have to give shout-outs to the waitstaff, who are some of the most attentive and professional around. Within 2 minutes of us noticing our table was wobbly, a polite man came up and said "Here sir (to my dad), let me fix that for you!" without us even asking. I saw someone ask a random person carrying dishes away whether or not a certain dish was vegan and not only were they responsive, they were actually very helpful! Major props to the amazing training at Hot House. 

Was it worth the trip downtown? Yes, just this once, but I probably wouldn't do it again. Definitely wouldn't mind coming back if I'm in the area though. Highly recommended for those who are in the mood to eat until your pants protest.
