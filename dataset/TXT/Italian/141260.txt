jNQnscvgn_dMTS954qW_9Q Groupon led me in and I was real anxious to try it. I'd driven by it for years on the way to Charlotte and the curiosity led me to buy a Groupon for half off. I was very pleased. The food had a lot of flavor. I had the egg plant dish and it was the best I'd had. There spaghetti sauce was liken to an old family recipe. Their cheese bread complimented the meal beautifully. The atmosphere made it much better, it was a homey place with artsy designs and the staff were very welcoming and helpful. I'd love to go back soon, I'd say the food was very authentic just like the owners.
