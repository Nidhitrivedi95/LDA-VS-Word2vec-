0aw3HbxkZ4G7pkPYt10fhA Olive Garden oh how I love you Olive Garden! I came to this particular location last week during my lunch break and they were extremely packed! My company was holding training on the side of town hence them being out of control busy but I have to applaud them for getting my table of 4 sat within 5 minutes! The server we had was extremely professional and courteous to the time frame we were working with! The lunch specials of $11.99 are the best bet because that unlimited soup salad and breadsticks is unbeatable! I really hate going back to work full off heavy food and this place sure enough did the trick! I think it was awesome to see the restaurant manager going from table to table asking how everyone's dining experience was going! That goes such a long way in my book! I will actually be dining here a few more times while I'm in training on this side of town!
