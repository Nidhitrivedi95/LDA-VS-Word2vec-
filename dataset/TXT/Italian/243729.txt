usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA Dinner was fabulous!! We went early on a Saturday night around 5, which was the perfect time! They were busy, but there wasn't a wait for a party of 4.  The menu was unique.  The pizza oven is upstairs so you can watch them being prepared.  The kitchen is in the basement so they bring the meals up with a dumbwaiter.  We started with pizza as an appetizer which I recommend for sure!.  We had the featured pizza of provolone, mascarpone, prosciutto and sweet corn--delish.  We also tried the Capricciosa, which was also very good.  Next we had the house salad which had mixed greens, gorgonzola, red onion and tomato with homemade balsamic vinaigrette.  Nothing that out of the ordinary, but good and a nice light course.

I ordered the braised wild boar over fettuccini and it was awesome. It was wild boar braised in a thin red-wine tomato sauce with some carrots, celery and onion then tossed with homemade fettuccini noodles.  I did detect a slight hint of cinnamon or anise maybe?  Something a little different but not off-putting. It was so good, I'd order it again for sure. It was pretty big too.  I took more than half home and had enough for lunch today. My boyfriend had the lasagna he said it was just alright.  It had a lot of layers and he said the pasta was overcooked and a little mushy. 
     
The service was also great, I felt like our server was prompt and professional...but we felt a little rushed...we we were still finishing one course and they were already bringing the next which is an issue only because the tables are so small.  

I can't wait to go back!!   I'd definitely recommend.  It would be great for a date night or a girls night out.
