UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ Brio's food is just okay. I've had heir lamb chop appetizer, and a few of their pasta dishes. The lamb wasn't the best quality but it wasn't horrible. The pastas on the other hand were so overly seasoned, greasy, and so salty that they were gross. That kind of scared me off from trying their food again. NOW! Their bar is another story. Love it. They have an absolutely gorgeous patio with canvas curtains, string lights, and comfy chairs. They have this raspberry mojito that is so delicious that I get one every time I go there. It's romantic and intimate. The staff are excellent, I have never had anything less than perfect service when i've gone there. It's a more mature crowd and probably one of my favorite places to go on a date. I would try the food again, because it is possible I just had a few bad experiences. But the ambiance, the drinks, the service, and the location is what keeps making me come back for more.
