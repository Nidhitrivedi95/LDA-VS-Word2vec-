First of all a few things that might have skewed my experience.  
1) There's no decent Italian in Hawaii
2) I just spent the rest of the weekend in Vegas spending triple digits on food that wasn't astonishing.

THIS PLACE IS AMAZING

It's open super late, the staff is incredibly accomodating and the food is out of this world.  

we got pasta, pasta and pastas and destroyed their large enough to share portions individually.

NOTE:  Their Fra Diavolo is not joking around, i spent a week eating sichuan hot pot and this bowl had my mouth on fire.

Super thankful we ran into some friends that live in the area, otherwise we would have never found this place.

SO GOOD.
