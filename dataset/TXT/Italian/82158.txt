DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw Never had a bad meal at Il Fornaio and that success continues. 
Started with the hostess being so nice. 
Great table. 
Service outstanding  along either the food. 
Wasn't rushed. 
Linguine Mare outstanding. Came out hot and fresh parmesan cheese offered on top. 
Cappuccino after dinner outstanding. 
Really enjoyable food and service.
