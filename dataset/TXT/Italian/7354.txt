0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw We were excited about trying this place out but we have to say that we were pretty underwhelmed.  It's a neat place to visit but the food was nothing special.  The fontina burger was ok, but it could have been seasoned a little better...the flavor just wasn't there.  The garlic fries were extremely salty.  The date shake was actually pretty tasty, but all and all we'd say it wasn't worth the wait.
