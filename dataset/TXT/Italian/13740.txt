1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ Maggianos in multiple cities has long been a family favorite. I just couldn't understand the negative reviews here....until we went to this location last night. My how far it's fallen. We watched every table around us have some significant issues: one table got their main course but never received their salads. They had to tell their waiter, he never noticed. Another table had to send one person's meal back, and it took so long to get the replacement they just said forget it, everyone else was long finished and they had kids in the party. Our service was ok, but my son's cheese raviolis were cold.....ice cold. And the marinara tasted like tomato sauce out of a can. We've been to Maggiano's so many times in 15 years that I'm quite sure either something is done differently at this location, or corporate has changed the food. My Rigatoni D was ok but not the great taste from previous....bland. It took the waiter so long to check on us that my son just ate his dinner, he was hungry and we'd started late. I can't believe I'm saying this, but not going back. May re try one in Chevy Chase, Denver, or Chicago to determine if Scottsdale is just an anomaly. Note the place was packed. Even at 830, long lines. You can do better for basic Italian classics.
