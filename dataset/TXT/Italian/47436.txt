8yiLVWzJyyTEhYE0fVNvlA This was my first visit here and well, what a nice experience! we showed up rather early and they were still able to seat us even though the place appeared to be rather busy. 

They start by serving you a huge chunk of Parmesan cheese. They also bring out a few small apps. We then had the escargot and the gnocchi with diablo sauce. Both were great. 

No one in out party of 4 was particularly hungry so we only ordered two entrees. They halved the portions and plated them for all four of us. 

The food was good but the service was impeccable and that's really what the 5 stars were for. We'll be back!
