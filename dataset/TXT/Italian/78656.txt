D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA i sat at the bar and decided to have 4 or 5 of their appetizers. I like trying out new places this way because you can get a real variety from their menu. the food is incredible, there wasn't 1 item that wasn't fantastic from their signature raviolo to the meatballs and the bone marrow was in my top 3. my only negative would be their limited Italian wine selection. Other than that i have no complaints and will most definitely be back when i visit again.
