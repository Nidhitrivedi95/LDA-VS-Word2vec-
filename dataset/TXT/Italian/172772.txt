n8fGqb4CCheGyWtr9KM6qw What can I say.  I had no expectations from this strip mall restaurant, so I was not disappointed, but what a disaster.  Nice server but it ended there.  Terrible, industrial food.   I've had better canned tomato sauce.  They need to find their salt shaker, cuz everything was tasteless.  Overcooked pasta.  Tinny tomato sauce.  No flavor.  And who serves a side of pasta with lasagna?  Pasta with pasta.  Really!!  Nothing Italian about this place, just commercial, low quality food with Italian names.  I agree with Jim C.   Once you've been to Andreoli's, it's hard to eat Italian anywhere else.  It's like night and day.  Sorry guys, but looks like enough people like it, so I don't feel too bad.  Best of luck.
