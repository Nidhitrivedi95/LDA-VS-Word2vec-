xCFdXTSHEMA-8VMrUrQUiw Its a family owned Pizza joint in a strip mall

Busy with take out pizza and slices

However, people actually enjoy the spaghetti and meatballs here as a sit down and thats a good sign

Tuck in and have some real home cooked italian food and enjoy a new york style pizza

No Marhgherita wood fired pizza here

I saw some stupid big Panzerottos there which i must try out. It looks like they took a whole dough ball to make it

Its dark, not fancy, smells like mommy's kitchen and thats what I want when i eat italiano

Nonna was off that day while the younger staff cooked away under sharp supervision by the owner so you know there will be no shortcuts taken

enjoy and recommended
