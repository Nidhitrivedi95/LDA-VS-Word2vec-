Z072pEHdos2Gjj3nMdR6uA Service was a little less than I would expect for this caliber of restaurant. Overall dinner was good. We went with a large group of girls, and all of our orders came out eight. The food was quite good, with a notable exception of the Caesar salad a few girls ordered.  The handmade pasta was very good, although I will mention beware that there are some made in house, and some that are imported.  It's easy to mix up the two based on menu format.  Overall it was a solid Italian meal, and I would recommend it to a friend.
