d9FdI_dQkJ6uiwpr524JcQ Came here for lunch, stuck in mt holly for a bit, and it was delicious! They bring out breadsticks with the most amazing marinara sauce! Better that any I have had in forever, the waitress said it is home made.  I had a Greek salad with chicken and my friend had the chicken souvlaki pita with fried okra as a side. The salad was fresh and full of my favorite yummy veggies, red onions and peppers.  Th fried okra was hot fresh and sooooo good. Table near is had pizza and it looked tasty as well. Service was very courteous and efficient, nice strawberry blond waitress and very helpful. I would def go back!
