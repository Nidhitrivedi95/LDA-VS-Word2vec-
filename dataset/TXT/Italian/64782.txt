BHE5NJPrYy7Nr0cjki-4sw Absolutely horrible.  The staff were friendly, the wait was ridiculous.  Waited 10 minutes to be seated, ordered lasagna, the feast, escargot &, a caeser salad.  The salad and escargot took about 20 minutes.  We had to wait an hour and 25 mins for the lasagna and the feast. I understand pasta takes time to cook. But an hour and 25 mins was absolutely unacceptable!!!!!!!!!!! The food was also not very good.  The feast was way too salty &, I could only taste cheese for the lasagna.. Would not recommend.
