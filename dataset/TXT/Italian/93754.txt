eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ We decided to visit our old stomping grounds for a cocktail this evening.  We were surprised to see the name change, but we continued on!  We were greeted by the bartender, Michelle.  She was wonderful.  She filled us in on the name change.  There are new owners.  We were able to meet and speak with them.  They were so welcoming.  After our recent experience at the New Grape Street in Summerlin Mall, we were happy to see that the new owners kept the old charm and knowledge where it came to food and wine.  We encourage anyone who is an OLD Grape Street fan, to get out to Grape Vine for the experience you are not getting at the NEW Grape Street.
