Here is what we three had: Portabello Mushroom crepe with extra (and generous) spinach, South Omelette, Fig and Brie French Toast. Coffee was great. (We are still debating whose choice was best.) Service was outstanding - very attentive and kind. Hint: Check out the back patio with fanciful umbrellas to provide a bit of shade as you eat outside.
