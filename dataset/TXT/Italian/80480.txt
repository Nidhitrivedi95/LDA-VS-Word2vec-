D6RDpCS1lfgZdPuLHlpsHA Went for dinner with some friends last night (Saturday)...ok it was an ASU football night but the place was a ghost town.  Greeted by the owner behind the bar - nice guy.  Offered my wife a taste of his strawberry vodka; offered me 100 proof  Belvedere at the same price as regular Belvedere - he was obviously trying to make us feel welcome - and succeeded.  I liked the guy.

Good food, but the place is a bit 'off'...I hope he can save it.

Service was ok, not great.  We 'lost' our waitress for a while and would love to have been served some bread as we reviewed the menu - but ended up waiting and then had to ask her for some bread (bread was not that good).

Decent menu, some interesting specials but in the end, the food was was not bad and I would like to try more dishes.  Presentation is not high on their list - they kind of slap a mass of food on a plate, bury it in marinara.  My wife asked for only marinara on her pasta instead of the aglio-olio but ended up getting both.  Presentation was just a bit sloppy.

Our waitress did not and could not open a bottle of wine.  We had to help and eventually another waiter came over to finish the task.

The place does need a bit of an update and could be much, much better with a little effort. 

Why do the waiters/waitresses wear black??? Try white jackets, much more inviting...

I think the owner better go check out Miele's in Tempe and some of his other local competition, or at least reads Yelp for some direct feedback.

If you are a regular maybe you want to tell the owner about Yelp!
