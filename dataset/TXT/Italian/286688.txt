zINKP9rtvo2IUKTZoYJUvQ My friends and I had a wonderful dinner tonight. We tried the below dishes:
Appetizer:
1.Grilled octopus  kind of special but a little too sour 
2.Bacon-wrapped dates: good  (recommend) I love this combination 
3. Steamed mussels kind of similar to the seafood stew but with spicy Italian sausage 
Entrees:
1.Jumbo prawns: the polenta is good 
2. Lamb Ossobuco: really yummy and juicy the saffron risotto is soft and a little milky taste (recommend)
3. Tuscan seafood stew: contains cute Squid and swordfish 
Wines:
All summer 17 
Living in a bubble (beautiful wine glass)

The environment is nice 
The services are good as well. It is better if the waiter could check us more frequently!
