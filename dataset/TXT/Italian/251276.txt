vQWVP7MtpgXFwUMvxCj9Tw Maybe it was hunger from walking the strip all day, or maybe all the beer we bought from 7-11 complimented it more, but this was GOOD pizza! If you're in a group it's more economical to get a large pizza than to buy single slices. Best thing to do is get one (or two) to take it up to your hotel room. The pizza is worth it and probably cheaper than other places on the strip.
