8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA I went here with my wife and kid and have been eating to try it for quite some time. I've been in before with a friend and the smell was divine. We came in and were seated promptly. They had a booster seat for our daughter and were prompted with our order. The service there was very good. The food however was a different story. I ordered the chicken Marsala and my wife got the ravioli's. The ravioli's were good but the presentation was abut tricky. It was on this massive plate covered in marinara and looked like more than it actually was. We ordered a side of the garlic bread which, while it tasted decent, could've been so much better. The cheese on it was a bit bland and it just looked so much better than it actually was. My chicken Marsala which came with spaghetti was not to my liking. Way too much Marsala in the sauce and way to runny. You take a chance with anyones chicken Marsala and this time I lost. All in all it just didn't live up to what I would expect good Chicago pasta to be like. But then again we are in Vegas.
