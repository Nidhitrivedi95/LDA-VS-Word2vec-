JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A Very decent. 

Cool downtown atmosphere. Nice and friendly staff. 

Food tasted
fresh. We both had breakfast style sandwiches.  The bagel one was way too cheesy but some may love that. 

Going to be a short review since we were in and out but I'd come back for sure. 

Menu seemed nice and items were all fresh.
