epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ Was in the area and haven't been to little Italy in a while. So many choices to pick from and chose Mia's for the outdoor dining and friendly people. The food was just as good. I had the gnocchi and it was superb.  So many flavors in one dish. Also the sauce that comes with the shrimp appetizer is to die for. Make sure you ask for bread for dipping.
