9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw It pains me to write this review because I have loved this place for so long. Now myself and about 40 of my friends will never be back.  We had thrown a rehearsal dinner here and were all very excited but by the time we left we were disappointed, my friend wrote in with her feedback and instead, Michelle, blamed her!!  It was our fault it was hot, it was our fault the guests had to serve themselves, it was our fault dinner and dessert came out late. 

I get it things happen but how the company handled this is just ridiculous and inappropriate.  I am warning you, beware of this restaurant and it's lack of customer service. I am sure they will be receiving a few more reviews from our party as soon as they recover from the heat and all the work they had to do that night. Ps- one server for 40 people is NEVER enough.
