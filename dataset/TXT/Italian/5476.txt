_qA2HPqgLiBc-M4wRyml0g Love love love this place and the wonderful food, people, and close vicinity to my apartment! From the minute we arrived, we felt welcome. We made reservations, super easy to do, for the earliest my second half could make it from work, at 2015. Late dinner, I know, but this is Arizona and doesn't everyone eat late and go out late to beat the heat? Anyhow. We found there were plenty of tables available, though I'm not sad I made the reservation (100 points on open table!), I would have been very sad had they been too busy and I hadn't had a reservation. 

So, the food. The bottle of local beer was ice cold and tasty and on special, so you can't beat that. The Cesar salad was scrumptious and fresh. But the pizza, the pizza! Yummy! Having just eaten the last of it, the taste is fresh on my palate. We got one bianca (white) and one rossa (red) sauced pizza, the Sicilian and the Triple P. Both were equal in taste, it's the chewy wood oven baked crust!, but I'd have to say the bianca was my fave. The meatballs on the rossa I'd say could be better, which is why it doesn't beat out the flavors in the bianca. The sweet fig jam, the salty savory goat cheese, the peppery arugula, and all pulls together with the earthiness of the shrooms. DELISH! Then to top it all off, they gave us a taste of the tiramisu! The proverbial icing on the cake. So perfect was the evening. 

Thank you Bella Gusto!
