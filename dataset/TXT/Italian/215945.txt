RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ I came with my wife for an anniversary dinner. The service was truly exceptional!!!Recommendations were on point and balanced two slightly different palates. The food itself was good, in pairings and in the overall taste though as some other reviewers noted... not the best meal I've ever had.

Overall, great experience and we'll definitely come again.
