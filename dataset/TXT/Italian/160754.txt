lJbxQFXqbgKBdHPKKxROMQ Wings are good, sandwiches are respectable, but the pizza is way to greasy. I have been to cinci's numerous times because it's local and they do a decent job but on the occasions I've gotten pizza it's been overly greasy. Even drunk I have to bust out the paper towel to dab the excessive grease. I recommend it just not the pizzas.
