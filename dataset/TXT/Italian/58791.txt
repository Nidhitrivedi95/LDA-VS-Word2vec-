aqONNC5onqX6EqHHUO1CJA Our time in Phoenix was limited, or we would have returned. Their menu is quite extensive. We shared a lunch special of deep dish pizza, and added a Caesar salad (to share). A beer, and an iced tea, and we were stuffed! Huge lunch for two at $19. including tax... nice! Oh, by the way... the pizza is very good.
