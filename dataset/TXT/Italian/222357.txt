sH9aI3xg-POBMp8R-kSQZg Let me start off by saying I normally love Portofinos. When I first moved to Charlotte, I would always go the Eastway location. As I moved around the Queen City we would always hit the location on Park Road or in Ayrsley. 

We live right by the Arboreteum so we decided to give it shot. Our waiter (Al) was great and the food very good, but we were extremely disappointed in our table. There is a little nook by the door to the kitchen where they sat us. Everytime anyone came in or out, the lights would blind half the table. The servers congregate by the door and it was quite a lousy location.

After being sat, I was told nothing they could do and that we would have to wait another 30 minutes when there were several tables available. I do not understand why they would even have that as a seating option. I will not go again to that location and highly recommend you go to the Park Road or Ayrsely location instead.
