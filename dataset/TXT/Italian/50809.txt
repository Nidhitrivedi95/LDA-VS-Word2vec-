9DHE9JieR80pYkpyr19iZQ Friday evening 6 pm dinner with family, full greeting, front door by one of the Fratelli Owners, calm gentle approach, greeted and for a table of 4 a wait of 30 mins, place is cozy. Smells like smokey pizza house. 5 chairs for waiting area 2 main entrance rustic raw brick visible. Bar is as cozy as the tables close as it would be 1000 sf. We were seated, by frosted window, table bread olive oil/balsamic vinegar. We ordered shrimp parpadelle/chicken pesto penne(Fratelli) spaghetti bolanese child portion and mozzarella cheese pizza pictures included: service very prompt and owner asks how we are during mid meal. Server very aware of our table. And love food and their service. Just space is very tight, loud music and washroom very back of the restaurant you must squeeze through tables.
