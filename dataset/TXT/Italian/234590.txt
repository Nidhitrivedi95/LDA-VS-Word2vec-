tshN5rYRrzanHu4ZiwCVrA So so disappointed. Took my extended family, and my Dad there last night. We had just had my mothers funeral, and wanted to celebrate her memory by going to one of her favorite restaurants, Olive Garden. We had a party of 13, and were told it would be a 30 minute wait. It took them over an hour to seat us. When we finally were seated it took the servers 15 minutes before coming to the table. We ordered wine. They brought out the water, and other drinks, then the one server brought wine bottles, but no wine glasses. We had to flag another server who told us that the restaurant was currently out of wine glasses, and had to wait until a load went through the washer. The salads were delivered to our table with no salad bowls, and when those who had soup were served some had no spoons. The period between the salad and main course was too long. When our main courses arrived two weren't served, and my wife was told her order had been given away! This was overall just a bad experience. I'm in the process of contacting their corporate offices, because the service at this particular Olive Garden was way, way below the standards that made It one of my Mom's favorite restaurants.
