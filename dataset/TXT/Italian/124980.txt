Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ Wow, couldn't decide where to eat and we yelped this place. WELL worth the stop. They're not kidding about having "monster slices" of pizza. We had ours cut in half and shared. Garlic knots...if Rosemary is your thing than these are AMAZING! And we topped it off with some of their cannolis...never had one but good lord was it yummy!!!
