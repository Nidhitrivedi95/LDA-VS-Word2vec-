IXUwuNjy707wJNW2U4sRVg My wife and I decided to celebrate our 47th anniversary last night at Alessia's and we were not disappointed with our selection. The food was excellent, the team concept of waiting a table was great and their attentiveness was outstanding.  It was a memory making night so thank you and keep up the excellent work!!
