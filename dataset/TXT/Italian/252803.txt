VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Lavo was definitely a cool place to go at midnight.

My pharmacy friends and I wanted to really dance the night away, so after receiving free VIP passes earlier on in the day for Lavo, we decided on it. Looking into the restaurant, the decor was great, so we went to the club inside. Being girls, we of course, did not even have to stand in line, and was escorted straight in with free cover and free drinks. How great is that! The sinks along the stairway are really cool as well, as they actually have running water along them. 

The music was GREAT. Not a bad song at all, the whole night. My only gripe was the SIZE of the place. The dance floor was really small... being small asian girls, we got pushed around until we made our way onto the stage.. where we found our other pharm people. The crowd itself was a little strange as well.. I couldn't really determine the make-up: it was a mix of mid twenties with mid thirties mixed into it. As Vegas is a place of vacation-ing, everyone we met was there for some conference or on business. 

I don't think I would ever go here to meet people, but if you're looking for a place to dance the night away with some friends, this place is definitely a fun place to go!
