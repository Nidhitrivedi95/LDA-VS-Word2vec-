5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA We had a reservation on July 4 and we came few minutes early to check in.  Noticed a lot of people waiting and tables empty. We had to wait over  20 minutes to be seated.  Asked hostess what was the hold up she explained they were still seating people that had reservations 20 minutes before ours and the computer tells them who is next.  Got to outside table 108 out there and finally got water 10 minutes while other people seated after us got drinks and bread.  Dinner was ok my husband had seafood and some of the clams were not open sign of bad clam no pasta with dinner they should of not served the non-opened clams daughter's pasta was fine sauce was good, I had lemon chicken and chicken was fatty. Asked for bread sticks never got them.  Also outside there were steamers and they were so overpowering we couldn't see and my daughter got really wet.
