JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw This place is pretty much my dream. Its BYOB and they have cheap specials on pasta and mussels from Sunday - Wednesday (or Thursday?) not including holidays. The staff are cheery and their desserts are well portioned. Its a great place for a one on a first date or for a group dinner to celebrate a birthday (I do both). Only downside is that BYOB doesn't cover hard liquor or else my friends and I would be there WAY too often. It tries to look classy but it's a student and middle class place to eat.
