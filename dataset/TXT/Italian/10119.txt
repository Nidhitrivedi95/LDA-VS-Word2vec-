Excellent service
On our last night in LV we wanted a good meal before heading to the airport
Since we have not seen the cosmopolitan hotel yet we decided to go there 
Then we checked the restaurant ratings of course on yelp
The restaurant was rated 4 stars as supposed to the lower 3 star ratings of the other restaurants
So we proceeded
We informed the maitre'd we were in a rush and we had to get out at a certain time
They went into action
Sat us...took our order...we had 2 waiting staff and 1 food runner... got our breads and drinks...took our order...made sure our drinks are always filled...food came out perfect...
The staff was so efficient that we did not feel we were being rushed... no feeling of stress at all from us or the staff...pure efficiency
We even had enough time for dessert
Btw dessert was excellent
Keep in mind that this is a very nice restaurant where you have a fancy meal and take your time to eat
We ate well and got out of the restaurant 2 minutes earlier than our deadline
Next time we are in LV, I'll definitely come back to this fine establishment and on top of that I will recommend it to everyone I know
Thank you Scarpetta and their excellent staff !
Highly-highly recommended
