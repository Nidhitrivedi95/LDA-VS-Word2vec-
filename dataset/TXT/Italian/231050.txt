TFftsYkRIUtdo6ZhRwJ2lQ The best Italian restaurant in Toronto. Pizzas are great but the appetizers, pastas and other entrees are sensational. When you sit you get great bread and olive oil to munch away. Good beer and wine selection and to finish outstanding tiramisu or other desserts. Well worth the high price.
