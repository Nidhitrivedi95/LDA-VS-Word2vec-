N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ I guess Las Vegas Natives must have some low standards for Pizza based on the ratings. I ordered a Pepperoni Pizza and Garlic Knots...some people mentioned these being the best they ever had, these were actually the worst I ever had, very dough and bland. The Pizza may have been even worse though, I like some grease on my Pizza, key word some...this pizza was drenched in it, making the Pizza very soggy. The cheese taste was pretty good and I can't complain about the Pepperoni, but the crust was totally uninspiring, very tasteless. I recently moved here so I can't compare it to other local Pizza places, but hoping this is not the par for the course here in Las Vegas.
