9HdEvvISPbzbL1u0wGJHrg My husband and I had lunch there as we've purchased a Groupon in November 2011. It is located in the mid of a very nice neighbourhood. First we thought the place was closed as it looked really dark. But it was open. The atmosphere is more like in a pub where you want to hang out in the evenings. And there was a workshop held in the same room that day and there were guests at another table and that was all. Many dishes in the menu card were crossed out (this didn't make a good impression to me). We've ordered burgers well done as we were asked how we'd like them to be cooked. Unfortunately they came medium and I ate it anyway but my husband just cannot eat burgers that are not cooked well done. We should have said something but we didn't. The waiter saw the plate that was almost untouched but he didn't even ask a word, which is disappointing. I think you should try to satisfy the guests if you want them to come back and try to correct things if something went wrong. Also the portion of the side which were potatoe chips was really small and with the price of over 9 Dollars for one burger and some chips I think it was totally overpriced. For me the burger was only ok. I don't know if it is more attractive to go there in the evenings and listen to live music. Unfortunately we are disappointed enough of this place to not go back and find out.
