x4aHNNo1osWNCB75q_PijQ So far my favorite Italian joint in town for a number of reasons. 1) Authentic and fresh, yet American-friendly enough for the masses 2) Great presentation and service 3) Family friendly enough to take my small children
Their pasta is freshly made in house along with many other ingredients that are locally harvested. 
I nice date spot as well as informal enough for the family. 
Their salads are perfectly balanced, their pizza dough outstanding and their pasta as fresh as can be.
