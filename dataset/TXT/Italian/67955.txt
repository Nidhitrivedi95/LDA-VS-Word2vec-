bRR4gsjHv0F_RnRGjQBqlg WOW! This place is delicious! The atmosphere is great, nice colors and music is playing. Also anyone can use their dry erase markers and write a review or just draw for fun on the walls! 
The custard is so creamy, beats out any of these frozen yogurt joints. Also the Italian Ice is made at the store. I know this because I asked the owner Jon who is super friendly and very interested in making his customers happy! 
They have many flavors of ice, and your standard custard flavors chocolate and vanilla but they also have a flavor system where you can mix in over 20 flavors! They rave about the blueberry cheese cake concrete. Yea they have malts, milkshakes and super thick "concretes".  
I won't go anywhere else! And very reasonably priced.
