fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg Don't let the weird Japanese + Italian thing throw you off because this place was awesome. Delicious food and excellent service. The waitress and super friendly and helpful with deciding what to order. We asked her how spicy the Spicy Potsticker Soup was and her words exactly were "if Jalepenos don't make you whine and cry, you be fine." This was coming for a middle aged Asian lady. She also helped choose my entree because I wanted something that wasn't really on the menu. The spicy potsticker soup was excellent, great pad Thai and lots of other noodle dishes. They serve bread with the meal too (that Italian thing popping in) which is nice if you dine with picky children like I do. 
They serve cocktails, but for once we didn't partake. Really great spot and very affordable too. I would definitely return next time I'm in Phoenix.
