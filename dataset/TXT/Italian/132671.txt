IkLAUX7lZIWqE9_YC66SRw The hubs and I came here before a movie. We unlocked a free garlic knots by checking in - score! They were soft and covered with garlic butter. Like, really garlicky which is perfect for me. We split the Italian sausage pizza and a salad - can't remember which- but it was very good. The oven is one of those big 900 degree heat ovens with the tiny tiles all around it. I have seen one just like it at another pizza parlor and they had flown it in from Italy, and wonder if they did the same here; shoulda asked. That being said, every pizza gets a different "doneness", with some more crispy and brown than others. Ours turned out good. The server was wonderful and attentive and very friendly.
