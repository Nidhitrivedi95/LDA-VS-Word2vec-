k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ I have been putting off eating here for quite some time, and let me tell you, that was a mistake. The food and prices (happy hour) are exceptional, the service is...okay. 

My wife and I ordered the happy hour 8 inch pizza for $7. They also had $3 dollar draft beers. Really $10 for a pizza and a beer? Just way to good! The Autunnale pizza was delicious, sweet potato ricotta? Perfect! 

The only downside was that our server was a little cold at first, maybe a little stand offish. He did warm up a little towards the end. But if it was possible to knock off a half star, I probably would. 

This place has great food, and even better happy hour pricing. I just hope the next time I visit the waiter might smile a bit more.
