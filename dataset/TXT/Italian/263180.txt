WW_oh8NfnHH32L_H5Kn1Ig This was my favourite spot. I ate here weekly. New owners took over Andy first experience was terrible! Waited years to try again. Went a few months ago had an amazing experience. The bread with oil and spices served warm was delicious! My Greek salad with chicken was beautiful vegetables where crisp! It was amazing!! Went a few days ago and ordered the same thing. Again they changed their menu constantly so when you love something you go back and can't get it aka the bread. Then I get my Greek salad and the lettuce is wilted and it just looks soggy and was. Total disappointment again!! Then the Cesar salad dressing was changed to crappy Kraft instead of Renee's and you don't even get a lemon wedge!!
