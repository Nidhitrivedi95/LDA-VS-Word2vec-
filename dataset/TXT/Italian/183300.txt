OdHYF4rxY94qMz4AUaDxXA This is a solid eatery in Montreal's village district. The service starts you off very friendly, prompt and accurate as well. The decor is nice, standard for restaurants in the area, though that means it's a little unsure of its own visual identity, club or restaurant. The food is amazing. Every part from salad and entree to main course is delicious. The minestrone I had was uniquely spicy, a real treat. The chicken alfredo was some of the best I've ever had, uniquely light sauce with really good chicken. Next time I visit Montréal, I have to sample some of the rest of what's on the menu.
