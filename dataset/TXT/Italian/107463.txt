fxZOOJtT6Zau7Asmppigkg To say anything else but delicious about the food here would be a lie.

I ordered a smoked turkey wrap and could not have been happier.  Instead of using a tortilla like most places do, they used a pita...a nice fresh pita, yum!  The turkey was moist, bacon was salty, tomatoes were nice sized slices and lettuce was crisp.  What pulled it all together was the honey mustard dressing (packaged, but still good).  

Only downside I had with it was that it was to come with a side of cole slaw and a pickle spear.  Pickle spear was lacking and tiny.  Cole slaw was nonexistent.  Maybe next time they will get it right.
