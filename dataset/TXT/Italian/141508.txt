jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg Here's a update. The corporate manager contacted me and send me a $50 gift certificate. I took my wife and mother and father in law (there Italian). Service was good and the waiter was on point. The food was great and the whole experience was excellent. Feeling good about the dinner and would recommend the restaurant to my friends. This second chase was great food and service. Thank you we will be returning to try the other menu items.
