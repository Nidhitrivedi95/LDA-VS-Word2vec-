mOFCSkPUPKjISMDhvz02HQ Service here was fine, ordered for pick up got to try a little of everything the pizza,pasta,fries,wings, & chocolate cake. the food was just not good as simple as that,for the price of there food I was expecting a lot more & this was just way below average. Would not recommend wasting your money here.
