VfxlkvZQkLr9tu_w1SU_iw I walked in for the first time and was greeted immediately. Very friendly.  I got a spaghetti with meatballs which comes with garlic bread and a salad. The food was really good, liked the spicy sauce, however I only got two meatballs. That made me sad, because I love meat alot and my favorite number is four. So there you go. I am going again.
