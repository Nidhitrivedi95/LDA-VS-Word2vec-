nDKcQkh8vZkY_u1kyww44g Located in the Venetian, Valentino is an upscale Italian restaurant where I had my birthday dinner at. It's definitely geared more towards fine dining, so I wouldn't recommend coming here with a group of college-aged people like I did. The atmosphere is very quiet, dim, and minimalistic. The service was okay and the food was good as well. Expect to shell out $.
