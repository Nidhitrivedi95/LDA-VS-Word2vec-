WaTXG26xbOGffSscvyr-wQ There are a lot of mixed reviews, but I was happy with my visit. Went for dinner with some friends and we split the mozzarella and tomato salad and the grilled calamari appetizer. The mozzarella/tomato I could have put together just as well at home, but the calamari was superb. Great flavor and grilling it was a great twist over fried. Every Italian restaurant has fried calamari but I've never seen grilled before. We were going to split pizza, but they ran out. I will give them that we were there late (got there at 8) after the dinner crowd, but still seemed odd. I ended up ordering the penne bolognese which was delicious. Again...they put their twist on it. The meat sauce was made with veal. So good! The restaurant itself is not big at all, but you don't feel cramped. Tables are just far enough and the tall ceiling makes it feel open. I would definitely go back (with the hope that they're not out of pizza). The food overall was great and the staff could not have been more friendly. It felt like we were friends with our server and this was a first visit for all of us. If you're on the fence, definitely give this place a try!!
