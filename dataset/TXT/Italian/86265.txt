dSnQTUJC0tCHadU1AGzvrw Isabella's does NOT feature a happy hour. 
What they do have in its absence is ambiance and unparalleled scenery from the patio seating overlooking Grayhawk's Talon course.

The appetizers were tasty and plentiful.
We had a meat and cheese plate and some olives. With two glasses of wine, a cocktail and a beer, the bill was sixty bucks.
It would be at least half that anywhere else featuring a happy hour.

A decent buzz was was going to cost a fortune, so we called it an early night, went home and watched some really fucked-up chick movie. 

Not going back anytime soon.
I left Isabella's hungry and pissed-off.
I don't know which was worse. Isabella's or Amanda Seyfried's bad acting.
Jury's still out.
