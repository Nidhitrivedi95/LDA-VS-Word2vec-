SXgVJz5aIvbeCXWvg0ZuNg Unfortunately, I cannot rate Pizza Peel-Central on the food. My wife and I live uptown and are regulars at Hawthornes. One of her friends recommended Pizza Peel, so we gave it a shot tonight. The hostesses were absolutely gracious and very welcoming. This was our very first time even setting foot in this place. After giving our name for a table, we decided to head to the bar for a drink. The place was crowded. The female bartender came over to me and looked right at me. No smile, no welcome, she just stared at me, waiting for me to initiate the greeting. I said "How are you tonight?" She continued to stare at me, no smile, no "great thanks, what can I get you"? So I thought maybe she didn't hear me, so I said again, "How are you tonight?" Still nothing? She wanted no part of being welcoming or nice. She was absolutely rude & obnoxious. Made me feel so unwelcome. We go out to dinner often and always "talk up" great places to friends, co workers, etc.....This female bartender absolutely blew it! We left, kindly asked the hostesses to take our names off the wait list and shared our experience with them. The hostesses were apologetic and very professional. Sad part is, they were probably in their late teens and they were so much more professional, kind, courteous and customer service oriented than the female bartender. I will not be going back. I have the choice to spend my dining, drinking money at so many places near where we live. Charlotte has so many opportunities. It is too bad that one grumpy, disrespectful and obnoxious bartender can ruin an experience not just for one couple, but all the other people we will be sharing our experience with.
