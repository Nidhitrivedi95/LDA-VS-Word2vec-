svFq2-4Yv5bIXtB2EK24Ow I met a friend at this restaurant and it was great! It was easy to find and I got a spot right at bar with no wait at all. I tried the bruschetta and it was pretty tasty. I don't know if I would want to order it as a meal like my friend did, but they did have a plethora of different types of bruschetta. I never knew there were so many different kinds.  My girl friend loved it and enjoyed the cheap wine. They sound like they have the best wine and beer deals in the area! I don't think their cheap deal could be beat anywhere else. She said this place is the best. For me, I wasn't blown away, but I was also driving so I wasn't drinking. It ma be a favorite for someone that's just looking for a great happy hour place then this place could be a four or five if you're just intending to get drinks.
