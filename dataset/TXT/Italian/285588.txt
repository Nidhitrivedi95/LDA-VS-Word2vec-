zFnPRtP7LGvr3sfxvy_dfg Amended review, I should have calmed down before I wrote and published the first one.

Food is ok,  great beer selection. management needs a lesson in customer service though.     If I call in an order using the menu I find online and when I get there it is double what I thought it was going to be based on the numbers I saw online,    Do you freaking think there is a problem there?????

The managements excuse?   "Thats an old menu, our online prices are subject to change.  We are not Revolution Pizza anymore, we are Revolution Ale House"

Imo I just think the old menu online should not be online anymore to avoid any and all confusion.  Seems like that could be an easy fix.

Oh yeah, and no he did not offer to give me a discount on the food based on the companies complete error in advertising.      

So even though the food is so so, and I do love the marinara, and even though the beer selection is fantastic, since the managements idea of keeping the customer happy is so pathetically twisted,  I wont be going back.

Visit was on July 30th 4pm.

update-   I went back. 8pm on weds  I had to use my living social coupon before it expired.   Calamari was the same as I remembered,   freaking awesome.  I personally prefer the breading here than at Crazy Fish, but a good bud of mine will say I dont know what I am talking about.     Crazy Fish breading is southern in nature but Revolution adds a bit more black pepper to theirs which to me makes it all the more better.      

I still stand by my opinion that something needs to be done about the discrepancy on the web, or management should be more apt to making things right when the mistake is pointed out.   

I am the first to admit my shortcomings and this time around I flew off the handle and bitched and cussed and should not have.   Instead I should have chilled and waited a bit before I shot off a review.

That is all,   back to your normally scheduled programming.
