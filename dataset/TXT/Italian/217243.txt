rxWQz4Tlk7nTy049qGCxcg I will just start by saying I really like this place. I have no reservations going here for lunch or taking my family out to eat. I have been here by myself and with extended family on several occasions and the quality of food and the staff is consistent.

Barro's pizza is second to none. At least for me that is. It isn't my wife's favorite but she knows I like it so much that she takes one for the team for my sake. All of the pizzas I have had from pepperoni to the works type are very good. Fresh, good ingredients, a little more sauce than other pizza joints make for an awesome pie. Please don't go here and buy a salad. That would completely negate the awesome which is waiting to be made for you.

The other options are also rather good as well. The wings are not my favorite but they are still very good. They are bigger than most wings in the area and the sauce is thicker and stickier than comparable wings as well. They aren't the style I usually prefer but they are big and meaty nonetheless. The flavor is good and the heat is predictable depending on the grade you select. The salad bar always has fresh ingredients if that is your persuasion. I have had one before and they have some good dressings as well. Thankfully, my wife really likes to eat the salad while I devour the pizza she doesn't care for very much.

It's a great little pizza place. Good service, good food, good location and ambiance. Booths and large tables for lots of people or little tables for a quick lunch. I would definitely recommend.
