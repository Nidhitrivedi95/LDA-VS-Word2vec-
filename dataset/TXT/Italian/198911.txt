pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw I can honestly say this is one of the best pizzas I have ever had. 

My husband and I went in, after a coworker of his told us about how amazing the pizza was at Biancos. So we decided to give it a try. Unlike many of the other people reviewing, we did not have to wait for a table since we went on a Tuesday afternoon.

Not knowing what to expect at first we ordered one pizza to share. Half wiseguy and half margarita with mushrooms. Both were very good even though I preferred the margarita pizza. Just not a fan of the whole onions and what not. Everything just felt really fresh. I really liked their black tea as well even without sugar it tasted just fine.

We're planning another trip to Biancos soon, but this time we might take a couple of friends to enjoy it with us.
