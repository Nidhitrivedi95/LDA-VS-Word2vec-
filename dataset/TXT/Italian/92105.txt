eGTAC8EzcHiYnnZ52tijiQ We were on our way back home to Toronto and came for Saturday brunch after seeing this resto on the list of "You Gotta Eat Here" spots in Burlington.

What I wish I knew: it's self-serve quick service restaurant. Go to the back of the house; grab your own drinks/make your own coffee; wait for a minute to be told where you'll sit. They will bring your food to you but you will need to grab your own condiments and refills.

The servings are large. Unless you're famished you will likely not finish your meal! My husband enjoyed his stoney sandwich. I was...meh! I liked the garlic aioli. I only ate half of my sandwich and took the reminder to go. It would've been nice to have a side salad with my sandwich. It as a massive egg sandwich. The balsamic and olive oil decorative design on my plate so I can spread over it my bread was nice too.  The coffee tasted good. Again I had to take it in their to go container. I feel like the flow of the restaurant service would've been better. I read a yelper describe it like Marche....I guess....but not really!
