Service from Dave was not great.   

Then they put tip on the bill automatically, which is not legal.   Even if the menu stares that they do it for large groups, if you ask them not to, they can't!!  I was shocked.   Like they thought people using a groupon wouldn't tip well, so they did it for us.   Never again.   

And someone should tell the owners that it's illegal to apply tip to a bill, especially without informing the customer in advance.
