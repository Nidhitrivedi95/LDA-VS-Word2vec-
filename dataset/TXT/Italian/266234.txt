x3QeZrO_zEzuYzkj2YqBAQ How could i have stayed away from this place for so long?  I just returned to Basilico after a couple years while I was working in a different part of town.  The place is nothing fancy to look at but who cares when the food tastes this good and prices are so reasonable.  As soon as you walk in the smell of fresh simmering tomato sauce and other Italian favourites hits you instantly transports your mind to that warm and fuzzy place in your heart.  I personally love the sandwiches, especially the Veal, but all of them are good.  The tomato sauce is just perfect.  I just had a Veal Sandwich with Onions, Tomato Sauce and Mushrooms for like $6 incl. tax.  Perfect for take-out lunch.  You can dine-in if you want but don't be expecting 5 star amenities.  It's just not that kind of joint and it doesn't aspire or pretend to be that.  Great food with that home-cooked taste and served fast at a decent price!  I'll be back soon!!
