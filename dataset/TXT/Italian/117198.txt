GxbUl5s9IOS01-bV0yT7qQ Loved, loved, LOVED. Did you read my previous review of Milanos? (*shudder*) Well, Lily's in downtown G-town is the absolute opposite. This place is a foodie's wet dream. They have amazing pastas and authentic dishes that are a joy to look at and eat. Housemade gelato? Tiramisu? Ohhh yeahhhhh... the service is funny, friendly and attentive. If you love great Italian food, you can't lose at Lily's.
