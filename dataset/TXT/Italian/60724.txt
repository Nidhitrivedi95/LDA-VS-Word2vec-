AWJhMTYsIYzCIYAIUA-waA Not sure why all the reviews are so negative on this place. I haven't eaten in a Macaroni Grill in years, but it is still good. Not the best food in the world, but tasty and a nice atmosphere. I had the blackened chicken Parmesan and it was very good. 
We went for lunch, and it wasn't terribly busy (maybe all of the negative reviews on here are affecting it?). But the service was great. Mikey was our server--he was really nice and plenty attentive. No complaints at all.
