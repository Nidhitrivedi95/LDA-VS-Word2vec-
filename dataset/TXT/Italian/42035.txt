7PRse3yCQbEprAj1DWrEQQ I really have no new information to report, because much of what I've said in February remains the same today, except it's better now because the restaurant is non-smoking.  The main reason for this update is to try and refute some of the hateration from Lauren B. from Phily on Liz.  I don't recall reading a review that was so malicious towards one individual in a restaurant.  I've had Liz as a bartender for a long time now and used to go to Dish a couple times a month.  Michele and Andres are great (owners and chef) and the rest of the staff is superb, especially Liz.  I don't really understand the venom of Lauren B..  I mean she never really gives much in the way of specifics of why she hates Liz.  I've seen Liz wait on hundreds of folks through the years of all different types and she has always treated them with respect if not outright wit and charm.  It's not just the regulars like me.  Sure, the place gets busy and often it can take a few minutes to get a drink.  But, what worthwhile place doesn't occassionally get busy.  Anyways, just needed to voice a different viewpoint.  Lauren, I  can't imagine that Liz did something to justify such a mean spirited review.  In fact, I'm pretty sure this review is much more  a reflection of you than her or the restaurant.  Good luck with that.
