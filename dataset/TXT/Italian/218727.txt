s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q Since Carla Pellegrino left, it's obviously gone downhill. A groupon lured me back and I still felt cheated at the end of the meal. The pork chop sounded enticing with grits and an arugula walnut salad on top. But there was no vinaigrette and it was literally just arugula with chunks of salt and walnut sitting on top. Cohesive, it was not. Plus, the first pork chop was way overcooked. They took it back and started fresh but by the time I received my meal, my dinner mates had finished.  

The meatball soup was tasty enough, but you could see the oil floating on top. The chopped salad came out brown with way too much balsamic. We split it between 3 of us and left over half. 

Even with ordering a bottle of wine plus an extra glass of wine, I guess they didn't feel compelled to offer any compensation for the problem pork and salad as we had a groupon. Not forward thinking as I would definitely never return.
