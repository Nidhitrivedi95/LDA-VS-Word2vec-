klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw Everything in the Encore/Wynn is overpriced but at least the $15 french toast they served me at Society was pretty darn good. I loved the caramelized bananas. The problem here was the service and the fact that they ran out of apple juice and sticky buns by 11AM. Our waiter also kept messing up our orders and was forgetful about refills, etc.  Not only did they run out of apple juice they ended up stlil charging us 10 bucks for it.  The experience was a bit painful.
