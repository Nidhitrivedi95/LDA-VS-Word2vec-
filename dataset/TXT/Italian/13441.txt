My first hint that things might not be as good as I thought was that when I called at 6pm on Sat. night they still had space for an 8:30 reservation. Don't get me wrong- I was grateful to get a reservation. The second clue was that the last good review on their website was published in 2006. 

With that said I thought the service was good the ambiance was great but the food was really not great and was overprice for mediocre meal. Especially at the price they charge. My scallops were good and beefy and well cooked and my friends figs were good- but they should have been $5.00 cheaper. My Squid linguine was was a mess of messy noodles in an over thick sauce. My DH described his Arctic Char as rancid. Not what you expect at this price. What a shame and disappointment.

PS- no mention of the micro winery by the server. We missed that aspect all together.
