Zja7ykq3icDzkN20XX6j1w The pepperoni rolls are to die for. Absolutely delicious and the garlic butter was fantastic! We also got the Giuseppe's Margherita, and my goodness...everything about this was wonderful. The cheese was buttery and creamy and the crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and was wonderfully fluffy inside. Highly recommend this and would definitely say this is the best pizza in all of Pittsburgh.
