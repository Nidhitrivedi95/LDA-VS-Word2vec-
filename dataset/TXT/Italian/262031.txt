Dinner was a joy with a large group of people. I enjoyed the spinach pasta. Absolutely no feeling of guilt as it was so heavenly. I *did* regret missing Happy Hour. (It runs until 6pm. Wine is $4 a glass! Sangria and beer too!) I loved the ambiance and the incredible space. It was perfectly loud for new friends to have a good time. With gusto!

Fast forward to breakfast and I fell in love with the "Short Rib Hash". Eggs are involved. (Mom was doing it wrong all these years.) I forked my way through a gluttonous serving. Then I hoover'd down my neighbor's french toast. (The joys of communal eating.) The Red Rooster drink had just the kick of spice. I might have had two. (Shhh!)

Tonight I enjoyed a true Happy Hour. Vanessa at the bar is just *wonderful*. Full of energy she worked the bar. By that I mean she sprinkled her magic fairy dust and created smiles. (I didn't want to leave! Neither did any of my bar stool neighbors:) Hearing how much I enjoyed dark beers Vanessa offered  a Moretti by La Rossa. 

Vanessa is amazing at what she does. North Italia provides excellent fare. Be sure to sample the pizzas! I had the special of the day. The crust is right up there with New York style crisp. Heaven. (And a steal at $8!)

Save me a bar stool during HH. (Two can share a bottle of wine *and* pizza for $20!) I can't wait to go again!
