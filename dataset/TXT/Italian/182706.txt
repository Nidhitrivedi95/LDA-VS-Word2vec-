oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw You can't really go wrong with a Wolfgang Puck restaurant.  The caprese salad was so fresh and perfectly delicious.  I'd like to have that salad every night!  We ordered a fish dish and risotto to share, and the waiter was kind enough to split the dishes so we could have an equal portion of each. The prices weren't too expensive considering the high quality of the food and unique dishes.
