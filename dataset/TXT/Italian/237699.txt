What a mission statement!  And how wildly Postino succeeds!  I LOVE this place. lovelovelove.

Arrived in the afternoon prior to flying home to take advantage of the generous 11-7 happy hour with 5 dollar glasses of wine and pitchers of beer.  Was greeted by a lovely gentleman who asked if we wanted a "proper table," but since we did not, he escorted us to a loungey area and seated us at two super comfy chairs with a nice table in between.

The place itself is a former historic post office; the space itself is funky and fun, with lots of natural light coming in and wonderful music!  We jammed to Bloc Party, Passion Pit, and so many other great songs.  As we sampled their libations, here were some highlights:
-Bellini: so fresh and tasty and only 5 bucks!
-Pinot Noir: can go so wrong, but was so right, especially for 5 bucks!
-Pitcher of beer: a yummy, citrusy wheat beer; about 2 and a half glasses to these pitchers, but again, only 5 bucks!
-Pub Board: yummy, warm, salted pretzel bites, excellent cheese, chorizo, and corn nuts. Great with beer.
-Bruschetta: OMG so good!  One order gets you four large bruschettas (cut in half for sharing). We loved the goat cheese with roasted red peppers, brie and apple with fig spread (swoon!), white bean with tomatoes, and salami with pesto. Oh so yummy.

The service was amazing, the vibe was oh so cool, and the food and drinks were priced well and yummy.  To me, this place is like what many LA places try to be, but they actually succeed without being pretentious or overpriced. Seriously, do I need to move to Phoenix?
