3cbsPfoUUrysf-M8FI_0IA I admit, I was hesitant to go to E2. I thought it would be pretentious and overpriced. I was wrong. So wrong.

It's not a dive, obviously, but you get what you pay for. For a very reasonable price you are treated to some of the highest quality food in the city, prepared by peopel who are incredibly dedicated to their craft. And unlike some hip, contemporary restaurants, you won't leave hungry.

The service I've received at E2 has been very good to absolutely stellar. My server on the last visit was one of the best I've ever encountered. It's impressive how a true professional can enhance your dining experience, even at a high-quality restaurant such as E2.

And the food... I've found myself at a loss for words on several occasions. I don't recall ever leaving a morsel on the plate. I've been exposed to new things, and been impressed by the preparation and presentation of familiar dishes.
