YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ The place looks clean and well organized. It is fast food mac and cheese that you can see them creating the dish. They have some really exciting choices on the menu, but unfortunately the execution is poor. Let's just say that three of us ate there and the food went down easily and came out easily, less than 2 hours later and had us curled up in a little ball until the next morning. I won't be going back to Mac Shack, ever.
