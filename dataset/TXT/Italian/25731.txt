4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg Martini was the highlight. Shoulda moved on. Food was pretty unimpressive. Our group had a pork dish and a pasta dish. Just ok. Cesar salad was not good. Prices weren't crazy but no value here. Wish we would have found a better spot. You know you are in a Vegas hotel restaurant. Skip this place.
