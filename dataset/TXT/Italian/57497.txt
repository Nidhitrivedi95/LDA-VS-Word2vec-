A whole loaf of hot bread and sweet butter.  And it only gets better from there.  Everything I ate was wonderful.  All of the food on the other tables looked and smelled wonderful. The staff was so warm and welcoming.  I dined alone so their attention made all the difference.  This is a wonderful restaurant--well worth the cab drive from the strip.  You won't be disappointed.
