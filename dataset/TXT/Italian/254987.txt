VxgjMl8tQrT4idJW_z8daA Tonight was my husband's birthday and we went to Carraba's.  We were taken in quickly and our server, Ryan took excellent care of us.  We have a habit of asking advise from our servers and Ryan did his job well and advised us on the right things to order.  Years ago Carrabba's was good at giving a drink or dessert (or something) for special events and unfortunately they don't do that any more.  I don't know if that is going to effect us in the future, but they haven't done anything special for some time.  But on the other hand, our dinner was served quickly and both of our meals were really good.  Our server was the one that really made the night special by treating us like WE were special.
