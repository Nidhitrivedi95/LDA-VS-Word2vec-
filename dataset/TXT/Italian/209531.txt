qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA We did not like this joint.  The pizza dough did not taste like it was made from pizza flower. it actually tasted as it was a biscuit dough.  this is not authentic italian as they stated and the ingredient was not fresh or tasty.  however the food was plentiful and the service was good. The dough at Five 50 in the Aria tasted much better and you can actually taste the dough.  i confronted the manager but she said she did not know what Yelp is and she stated that the fresh dough was made downstairs meaning not on the premises. if this was authentic italian then why the dough for the pizza is not made from scratch. i rather eat in a fast food rather then waste my time or money on this place. avoid it.
