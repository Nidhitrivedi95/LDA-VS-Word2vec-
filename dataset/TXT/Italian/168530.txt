MM5Fdfqf87QpTkHIKZNVdg Things I love about the place: 
- Massive variety, which is very impressive for an AYCE place. I usually go for lunch and there's plenty of options on the menu. As you've likely heard, you can get Japanese, Thai, and Italian food here. Every time I visit I try new things, so my list of favourite dishes at this place is constantly expanding.
- Food quality. The quality and presentation of food here is one or two notches higher than what you'd expect at an average AYCE place. Each dish looks like it was prepared with some degree of care and effort. For example, the escargots come with garlic bread and the vegetable tempura come in a basket with sauce on the side. Most of the stuff here is really tasty, don't be afraid to try random stuff.

Things that are inconsistent:
- Wait staff. The first time I visited the waitress who served us was very polite and prompt. I returned a several months later and while the service was decent, it was never as good as the first time. Many other reviewers mention the declining quality, and unfortunately this is something I have to agree with. The service is the only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars.

Other random tips:
- I went to the other location in Oakville once, would not recommend. The service was atrocious and the menu was smaller.
- Don't get the vegetables, even if you're trying to be healthy or whatever, since they are soaked in a thick brown sauce thing that makes them taste horrible and unhealthy. I'm not talking about the salads, those are good, but there's a section on the menu labelled "vegetables" and that's what you should avoid.
- The appetizers are SO GOOD! And the sashimi, and the flatbreads...
- The value is quite good if you think about it, although this place costs $20 a person (for lunch) it's super worth it since you get a massive amount of a wide variety of foods. The price seems much more reasonable once you compare it to how much you would pay for a finite amount of food at another restaurant.
