pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ In a city with endless options.... it's surprisingly hard to find something REAL to eat. What is it with this city's obsession with burgers?

Glad we found this gem. The freshest meal we had our entire trip. My friend wanted breakfast, I wanted lunch so this was a great compromise. I found the selections  to be diverse. I got caprese, the mozzarella was incredibly great quality with delicious EVO and light seasoning. The Greek salad was awesome as well, there is only so much greasy food I can handle and vegas doesn't make it easy. My friends breakfast looked good, fresh hand cut potato hash.

$7 mimosas and then  $1 refills after that. AWESOME! They do by default serve aqua pan bottles of water, which was fine! But if you don't want to pay $3.50 for water specify tap. 

Service was extremely prompt and personal. And the management even made multiple stops by to talk to us. How refreshing!

Great "outdoor" seating on the walkway across from the fountain made for relaxing lunch and great people watching. Located inside planet Hollywood directly across from their "V theatre".
