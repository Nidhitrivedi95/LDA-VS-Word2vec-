DUuZjarJ7vOHJNEHNI0WUw Got takeout from here utilizing their online coupons. June monthly special was XL cheese pizza, 1 wings, steak hoagie and breadsticks for $24.99....CANNOT beat that! Pizza is good, crust is nice & doughy, wings had great flavor & weren't soggy. Inside could use some updating, but doesn't bother me.
