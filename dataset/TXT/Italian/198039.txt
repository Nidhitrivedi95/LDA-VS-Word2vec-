pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw Ok. Ok. Chris Bianco is one of the most humble people I have met in a long time, and his food is orgasmic...but my *only* gripe about the restuarant is that I often feel like my table is on top of someone else's table. However, the food and wine (You MUST hit up Bar Bianco during your 1hr+ wait) makes up for the lack of intimacy. I would say that I could recommend it for a first date, because you will spend at least an hour waiting for a table, so grab a bottle of wine and chat, however once seated in the restuarant, the lazy romantic atmoshere diminishes. 

Great food, and the service is even better. It's is totally worth the wait.
