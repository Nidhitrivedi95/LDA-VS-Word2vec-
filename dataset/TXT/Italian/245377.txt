UYh1N1xQhOh-a7nX92xPzQ I can't get over their HH deal. It is too good to be true. The best part is that even though it's only Monday-Friday, they honor it on national holidays.

I love their sausage ricotta flatbread and their beef carpaccio. The other stuff I can pass on, but their Tuscan tots are good as well.

it's in a great location so that you can go shopping afterwards with the money you saved from HH. LMAO
