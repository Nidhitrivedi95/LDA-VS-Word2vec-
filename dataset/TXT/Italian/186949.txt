oRRU93M-gYqcnes16GuZTw I don't know what Donna R.'s problem is, but her review is 100% unfair and vindictive. I eat at Nick's # 1 every day for three reasons: 1. The food is excellent, 2. The prices can't be beat, and 3. Because Theresa works there! Far from being "rude" or "burned out", she has a loyal following of customers...all of whom she treats with respect and a great sense of humor. Regulars or newcomers..they are all welcomed...and the size of your tip has nothing to do with it.
