rBTlmcEEQka-7cdU6ByrYg pretty terrible. ordered delivery through grub hub for a chicken kabab meal with two sides and penne bolognese with garlic bread. the pasta was not bad but they forgot the ranch side salad with it and had to come back to deliver it. the garlic bread was dry and had burned corners. 

the chicken kabab meal was pretty gross. the chicken itself was okay once microwaved but the pita bread was soggy due to being placed right next to the chicken. the tabouli and Greek salad were like something out of a bad comedy movie. the tabouli was not tabouli, see picture. I'm still trying to figure out what the orange pieces on it were. I tried some and it just tasted like slightly pickled cucumbers and tomatoes. the Greek salad had no dressing but did have melted cheese on top. 

if you can, (I'm aware of the limited amount of decent delivery food places in tempe) avoid this place. or at least don't order the salads or tabouli. you've been warned.
