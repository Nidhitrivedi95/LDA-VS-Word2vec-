7o4SWZDKYHYfv6X0U21ErQ Placed an online order for catering on 12/28 for pickup at 8 PM on 12/31.  When I called the restaurant on 12/28 I was told there was a deal that if I bought $100 worth of gift cards I would receive $20 of free gift cards. Since we were placing a large order, we figured it was a no brainer to save $20 on our offer and ordered the gift certificates online.

On 12/31 I called the store and asked if I could move up my pickup time from 8 PM to 730 PM.  I was put on hold for 8 minutes and then a friendly voice came back and said no problem.  I then received a call back from a panicked associate saying she had the manager who wanted to speak to me.  I spoke to the manager and it appeared that they did NOT have my order.  I was told on the phone that this happens sometimes (I was also told at the restaurant that this happens all the time) and at 5 PM, this didn't give me a warm and fuzzy feeling.  Nevertheless I'm told that the 730 PM pickup time could be accommodated.

I showed up to the restaurant at 7:30 PM and everything was almost ready.  When trying to pay for my order I was told I couldn't use my $20 gift card and that it wasn't able to be used until after the first of the year.  This was not disclosed to me at any point in the process online or when I called the store on 12/28.  I was definitely not please to hear this but oh well.

I got the food home and it looked fabulous.  We ordered chicken marsala with mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables and an appetizer of the tomato and mozzarella caprese.  The portions also appeared to be in line for the price paid.  

Then, we TASTED the food.  The tomato and mozzarella caprese were soggy and somewhat flavorless.  If it wasn't for the balsamic drizzle, it would have been inedible.  The grilled chicken had nice grill marks but was cold and extremely well done.  I literally had to cut the chicken up into little pieces (like you would do for a little kid) and dip the chicken into the sauce so that I could chew it.  The mashed potatoes were completely inedible and went into the trash after a few guests tried to "cut" the potatoes in order to scoop them onto their plate.  The sauteed vegetables were good, no complaints.

Overall, we paid $110 for food that was soggy, flavorless and difficult to eat due to the consistency/texture.  The restaurant didn't have my order and had I not called in to bump my pickup time, I would have showed up to the restaurant with no food for my guests.  I wasn't even able to use the "free" $20 gift card.  Myself and our guest were not satisfied whatsoever with this meal and having never ate at this restaurant prior, we're confident that we will never go back.  Does anyone want a $20 gift card?  We certainly will not be using it.

Restaurant reached out to us and made things right.  They did NOT ask that I change my review but I feel it's only fair to let other diners know how quick Bravo was to reach out and make this right.  I left my negative review on New Year's Day.  Someone reached out to me 7 minutes after my review was left.  The general manager of the Mentor location reached out to me and seemed deeply concerned that my experience was not favorable.  She looked to understand why I felt the way I did and was concerned with the situation. After all was said and done we feel that the restaurant not only made things right but they exceeded our expectations.  We're very happy with our experience and will be going back to this location for years to come.
