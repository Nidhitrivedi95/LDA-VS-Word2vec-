XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q This OG is okay.  It's consistent with all the others in town.  We mainly go there cause our kids LOVE the OG.  My kids go crazy with the stickers, bread sticks and the Zupa Toscana.  One thing I will give this location a lot of credit for is problem resolution.  The two times I've encountered issues (which the employees brought to attention) and the manager always does a superb job with the follow up.  I have found this location to own up to their mistakes, but make a true conscious effort to ensure their patron is happy.  This is one reason I go back and the other is they take good care of my kids. That attention always holds a special place within me.
