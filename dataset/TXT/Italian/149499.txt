kJdIaFnq9lcMOBjhjDtgFg Pizza is very good.  Not as good as Mama Santa in Little Italy or Edison's in Tremont, but good.  Chicken parm is good and extra cheesy .  Agree with other Yelpers... Get carryout and don't dine in.  If you do not like black olives tell them to 86 them if you order a salad.  The salad is loaded with them.  The red wine vinaigrette salad dressing is super.  The disappointing thing?  No grilled chicken.  All chicken is breaded.  All pasta is made fresh and in- house.  Gluten-free pasta is not offered.
