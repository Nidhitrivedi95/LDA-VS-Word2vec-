_T2Aa3Vf5t68PqqxvzoX0Q We order from this location quite often for game day take out and have always enjoyed the quality and value of their meals. 

Today, we ordered our regular game day meal of family spaghetti and meat balls and hoagies. We got home and opened the family spaghetti aluminum pan to find that the spaghetti pasta portion was 1/2 of what we normally receive. The meatballs were fine but the rolls were also cut down to 4 rolls from six. 

We could understand cutting back on the meatball size or number but cutting the pasta portion in half doesn't make sense. 

The quality and flavor are still great but having the pasta portion cut in half makes this "family pasta meal" a terrible value.
