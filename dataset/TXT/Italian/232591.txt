Tl7V8AztDY8s6Jr8yJNKcw We discovered the breakfast special during our morning stroll to our usual spot and decided to check it out. The special included 2 eggs, toast, country potatoes and a small coffee for $2.75. The breakfast was very home-style, reminded me of breakfast your mom would make while on a camping trip. We sat, caught up on the latest corporate buzz and watched a little Good Morning America on the flat screen television. Kelly Clarkson was about to perform her new smash single "Stronger". It's a nice catchy tune.  I've never been a fan but this song makes me like her just a little more. 

Aside from the breakfast special, they serve additional items like egg sandwiches, breakfast burritos, pizza, Philly cheese steak and other random food items.
