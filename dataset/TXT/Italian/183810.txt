OGeEto9kyOojrR-52Lim9w We have lived a mile from this place for a year and just discovered it last night. A true hidden gem in Twinsburg! The Greco salad was amazing and the pizza couldn't have been better. I highly recommend caramelized onions on the pizza. A family owned place with the friendliest owners. We will become frequent customers now that we know how tasty everything is!
