There is not a single thing here that I was impressed with except the meatball salad. It is enough for two people to share and has great taste! Had the chicken parmesan and was definitely not impressed. They brought out the wrong order at first and they made it right but by the time they came back I was so full on bread it did not matter that they brought me new food period was not able to eat it anyways. Had a few bites and it was okay period then packed it and gave it away to the homeless. Martorano's you guys really need to step it up. The appetizers came out at the same time as the entrees. They sat us very quickly but the waiter took 20 minutes to come say hello. Once we started eating we realized something was not right and it took them an additional 20 minutes to come but that was only because we waved them down. I think you guys have a great place on your hands, a few tweaks would bake it so fantastic
