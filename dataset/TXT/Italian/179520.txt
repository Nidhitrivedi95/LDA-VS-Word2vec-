nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Had heard good things and wanted to stop by before seeing a show however the hostess was on a major power trip and wouldn't even FATHOM letting us sit at the completely empty bar in the completely empty restaurant (no joke this was 5pm and there were maybe 3 people in the entire thing). All we wanted were some appetizers and drinks and they wouldn't even let us in because they were "completely booked" that night and people were coming "at any second". Since when do restaurants book spots at the bar?? We were completely incredulous and the hostess could not have been ruder. She definitely gets off on shooing people away, but honey this isn't an exclusive club it's the Cake Boss's restaurant...
