PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ Saturday night about 6, my wife and I were greeted right away and allowed to choose our own seat. The water and menus reached table quickly. The staff were very friendly and on top of there game. While we were waiting, we saw Floyd Mayweather come in with his crew. They sat at the bar and there was no ruckus. 
My wife ordered chicken parmesan and I ordered the meatloaf. Each came with a salad. We also ordered calamari as an appetizer. While we ate our salads, bread was brought to the table it was warm and crusty but lacked flavor. 
The calamari was among the best I have ever eaten in my life. The texture was perfect. The batter was flavorful and it came out nice and hot. The dipping sauce complimented the calamari without overpowering it. 
My wife's chicken dish was HUGE! A huge chicken breast fried to perfection covered in cheese on top of a bed of angel hair pasta. The sauce hot hot and full of flavor. 
The meatloaf was very tender and had different layers of flavor. I was a little disappointed with the mashed potatoes. They were instant potatoes. The same type I make at home. I like them, I just have higher expectation from a restaurant that serves amazing calamari. The gravy over the meatloaf tasted like it was from a package as well. It was ok, but again, I have higher expectations from a restaurant like this. 
We took some rice pudding home and were very pleased with it. 
Our meal came to, just over $56. There are several other thing on the menu I would like to try. I just hope things are a little more homemade and fresh.
