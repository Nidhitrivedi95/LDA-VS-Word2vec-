N8ArHOgRDI8wOJIOZaEHyg We tried out this place in spite of our earlier decision never to go back...
Service : just ok.
Food : free salad was ok. The fondue appetiser had a disgusting taste. The brushetta was fresh and light. The other meals were not special. 
Deserts were good.
Our waitress was friendly but too pushy for a tip.
Hate to say that this will be our last time to eat in an Olive Garden. Their good period is over.
