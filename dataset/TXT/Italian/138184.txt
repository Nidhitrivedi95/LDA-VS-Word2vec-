JBrBsKpw0bbXK5nlrXVOYQ We went out to Anzios for a night to celebrate. The food was excellent and well priced we enjoyed a nice glass of red wine with our meal. I had the veal parm and my wife had the sampler. The spicy meatballs were also very tasty. Our server was personable and we had a cannoli and tiramisu for desert both were excellent. We will be coming back for sure.
