2p_xWNAGm_5sVvr_Vs6mlw Since Girasole was closed, we decided to try an Italian restaurant on walnut we haven't visited. The meal started off great with calamari and bruschetta and went downhill after that. The service kept getting slower and slower and the martinis were subpar. The food is good but not good enough to stay for two hours.
