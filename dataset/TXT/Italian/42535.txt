7Uti5EeAwm3drG14KVrE3Q A bunch of friends got together to celebrate a very dear friend of mine. She has recently gotten married and moved from the the uk to toronto. Her husband threw her birthday bash here! Very posh restaurant that had very disrespectful people!! We were all surprised at the service we got at the end of the night! Before being seated we all were reminded of the time frame we have to eat!! Which kind of restaurant says that!! Anyways the night went well! The food was amazing!! Closer to the end of our dinner a server came with the bill and we all got out our payment method! 

Now as we all waited for our payment cards to return some dude comes out of no where reminding us about the time and how there's another party waiting. My friend who booked the reservations politely said we are just waiting for our cards. So the server left. Then I guess the manager came and told us of how a there's an 85th birthday reservations waiting to be seated and that we should have finished eating and bills should have been taken care of before 9:30pm!!! EXCUSE ME!!! We all were like ummm what the hell!!! We were just waiting for our cards!! Anyways we all got our cards and made our way out!!! We will never eat at this place again!! Talk about a posh place and customer service!! To top it all he told my friend to take a card and he will take care of something the next time him and his wife have dinner there again!!! It was a pretty shitty way to end a birthday dinner!! 

P.s the server brought out a cake piece with a candle and we all thought it was nice of them to do that... Little did we knew it was added to the bill!! LOL!!
