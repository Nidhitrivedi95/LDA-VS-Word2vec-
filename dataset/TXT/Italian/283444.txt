z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ Believe the majority of the the reviews. The service (Raul was fantastic) and food is fantastic. The decor is ok. If you like privacy ask for one of the booths. The rest has only been open a year, but has atmosphere is old school. The Caponata served as accompaniment to the bread brings me back to my childhood. I'll be back.
