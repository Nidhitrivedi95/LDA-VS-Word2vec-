grf5Gmn_GAh8ImHTi3HLPg When you come in Pizza Hut at 11:44 am here at southern Highlands to order food , you can't disturb the cashier on the phone talking to his bank about personal stuff , it rude. So after 10 min of waiting till he finish his business on the phone , I ordered  a med cheese pizza that will be done in 15 min. If he rang my pizza First and talk to phone for 10 min, that would be ok, but of course this guys are so educated and loving there job, a can't disturb them. Amen.
