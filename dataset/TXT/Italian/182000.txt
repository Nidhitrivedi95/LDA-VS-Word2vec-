o86OGfW63bVqWkIrvxcEQQ Met up with a friend for dinner but the wait was 45 minutes long...why the 5 star? Well let me explain, we went to the bar to wait...while there we were able to get a bottle of wine and appetizers. Service was quick and the bartender was always alert to anyone ordering though house was full. The atmosphere is lively in a good way. By the time our table was ready, we're were full with appetizers and the wine. So we skipped it...a meal by that time would have been too much.
Really enjoyed the evening.
