However, I came inside to check in on the knots and saw the gentalmen that was doing the finishing touches on them using his bare hands to put the parmesan on the top. Now I am kind of picky about stuff like that, so that's why one star was taken away. Other than that, their pizza was pretty amazing, the dough was a little thin, but overall great quality.
