7PRse3yCQbEprAj1DWrEQQ Great intimate atmosphere followed by a great food and wine selection, topped off with 5 star service. I was there last night an stick with some of the specials. Started with the grilled calamari and I have zero complaints. Great for dates or intimate conversation. I highly recommend Dish.
