Tgc2dTcE1xOey2OUt_PvXA Fabulous food and extremely generous portions. The menu is somewhat limited but still hard to make a choice. I knocked it down 2 stars because it's so unexplainable slow. You'll wait an hour to be seated and it'll be another hour before you're done. You'll go out the door very full and a lot later than you planned.
