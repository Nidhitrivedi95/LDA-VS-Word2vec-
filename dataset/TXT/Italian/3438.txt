_7tBGb6yVoiSiHq9NfQk8A The food is fun and the atmosphere can be nice but the service is disappointing. I was there a few days ago and I saw a young family get treated very poorly. The restaurant had a problem with how much space the newborn was taking on the benches where they were sitting. They told the father that he was taking up too much space and that customers may want to sit there. I looked around and the place was almost empty. I have to chalk this up to the immaturity of the host. He seemed very young and probably completely ignorant of how hard it is to take a newborn out for a meal. The worst part about this is that, after the family left, the host and a waitress started making fun of the family "He didn't understand that he was taking up so much space, what's wrong with them? Look, they forgot their takeout containers. I mean, they asked for them and then they forgot them. What's their problem?".  I talked to the host afterwards but realized I was going nowhere. I talked to the family and they were disappointed and attributed the host's age to his lack of empathy. It's not the firs time ignorant stuff like this happens at this restaurant. This place is definitely not for families.
