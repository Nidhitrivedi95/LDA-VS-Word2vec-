zcfmbmOEX83YL04f9_Y0BA Juliana's is not the most glamorous place in the area, but they've got good food. I met some friends here last Monday night for a late dinner, and it wasn't crowded. The staff was accommodating even though I arrived about 15 minutes before they closed the place down. 

I'm a fan of their Veggie sandwich. It's awfully cheesy and melty. Other folks with me had pasta dishes, which looked (and smelled) divine.

The best thing about Juliana's is that the price is right. Most menu items were cheaper than $10.

So if you're near the Sardis Crossing shopping center and feeling like getting something to eat that's not from a soul-less chain store, as they abound in this area, check out Juliana's.
