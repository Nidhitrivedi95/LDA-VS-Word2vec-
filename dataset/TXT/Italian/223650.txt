sKy8HkP6X-8dCKq_SzeIpw ABSOLUTELY HORRRRRRRRIBLE.

Service was CRAP - literally took more than an hour to get our food. Do NOT come in during a rush or when there are big parties sitting around and to be honest, don't even come when it's slow. Service seems to be about the same either way.

Food was CRAP - 12" pastrami pizza: IT HAD NO PASTRAMI and it didn't taste like honey and wasn't sweet because it was masked with an excessive amount of onion. Wings: BARELY had any sauce which it DESPERATELY needed it because the wings were over-fried. I felt like I was eating twigs off a tree.

Employees - one of the girls was very apologetic about everything but the rest act like you don't even exist. Maybe because they were embarrassed to see that we were still sitting there after an hour with nothing. And omg, the manager was walking around with a pizza box under his armpit then walked around ate pizza around the starving customers. What a douche.

STAY AWAY.
