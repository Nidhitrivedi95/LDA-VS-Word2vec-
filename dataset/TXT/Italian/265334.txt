wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw One of my favorite restaurants around! Great wine atmosphere, service and food! There is not much more you can ask for in a restaurant! Also, the wine deals on Tuesday nights are fantastic the only problem is you have to get there early or you end up waiting forever because the place is so dang popular. A must visit if you are in the downtown gilbert area!
