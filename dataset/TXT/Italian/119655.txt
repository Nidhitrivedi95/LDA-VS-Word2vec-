H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g One of the best lunches we had in Vegas. Go Batali! We shared a Sausage and pepper pizza which was very delicious. But my favorite was his Capress salad! It was so addicting I kept thinking about it! The mix of pine nuts with the fresh juicy cherry tomatoes and pesto sauce blended with cheese (not mozzarella sorry forget what he used) was out of this world refreshing especially in Hot Hot Vegas! The we had a blend of Olive oil, almond milk, vanilla bean gelato. Can we say YUMMY, and yes maybe the Olive oil kind of sound weird but it was a light salty flavor which only just enhanced the other 2 flavors we selected. The servers were attentive, it seemed like we had two with a main one, but not overly friendly. Service was good until we got to dessert because I think the girl forgot to put our order in (oops). But nothing could deter our experience because the food was just that superb!
