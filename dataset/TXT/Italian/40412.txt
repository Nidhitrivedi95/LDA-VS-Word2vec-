7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ We have been here twice in our visits to the Palazzo hotel.  This second trip to Carnevino was only "so-so."  We ordered the bone in dry aged rib eye, which is their signature dish, and it looked huge on the plate for sure.  The waiters cut the meat and served us, however I was expecting a much softer, tastier meat than what we received.  The steak was a bit tough and although good, not great considering it cost 70 bucks.  I guess I was expecting something special being that it was the signature dish, and the waiter hyped it up quite a bit.  On a side note, we ordered one of every appetizer on the menu and also one of every desert.  The ravioli was pretty good, but everything else was again "so-so."  The couple next to us ordered the same dish, and their meat was actually a bit bloody, so I have a feeling that they did not enjoy it much either.  In any case, I will most likely not return to this restaurant again.
