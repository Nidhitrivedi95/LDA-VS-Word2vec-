Ojw5eTqzbv6k27_Df3q0-A My sister and I were trying to get a seat at Eno Vino on a Thursday night at 8 pm, but they were packed. We were starving, and decided to give Biaggi's a try.  We shared two pasta dishes: Butternut Squash Ravioli and Lobster Fettuccine--the two most popular pasta dishes, we were helpfully informed by our waiter.  

Oh boy.

Let's start with the fettuccine.  The dish was described as "Black fettuccine tossed with lobster, wild mushrooms and a homemade lobster-cream sauce." Sounds delightful. So imagine our surprise when the dish arrived after apparently having been assaulted by a madman with a pepper flake shaker.  The sauce was not merely spicy, but HOT.  As in revisiting-in-the-middle-of-the-night hot.  It also had a ton of scallions--in all, the flavoring was way too aggressive for the mild lobster, and not at all what I thought I was ordering.

If I were to describe the ravioli in one word, it would be NUTMEG.  I'm a big fan of squash ravioli, but not when it tastes more like pumpkin pie.  WAY too sweet for human consumption.

Our waiter seemed perplexed that we did not want to-go boxes for our half-unfinished meal, or the horrendously under-salted bread.

Overall, the service was friendly and impeccable, and the ambiance was nice--but I would not recommend this place for anything resembling authentic Italian food.
