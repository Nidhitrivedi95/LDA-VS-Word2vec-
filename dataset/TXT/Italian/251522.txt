VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w Tiny, almost no parking ... HUGE pizzas for the price! I knocked off a star for canned black olives. Seriously, why would you sully a good wood fired pizza with nasty Thanksgiving nightmare canned black olives? That's heresy. Kalamata. Please.  The staff and owner are so nice that I wanted to love this place but unfortunately the pizza just isn't that good.
