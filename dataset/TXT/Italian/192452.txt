pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ My husband and I are frequent Vegas visitors and were looking for some authentic Italian off the strip.  Look no further!  We had a fantastic experience, all the way from customer service to our delicious meals.  Our server was Don, who was so pleasant that we couldn't help but smile when he came to our table.  Also, the whole staff was very accommodating when we showed up early for our reservation and were more than willing to call us a cab when our dinner was through.  Definitely a go-to restaurant for us when we visit Las Vegas again.
