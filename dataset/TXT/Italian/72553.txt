CElwRv4CtK56NljAuCwepw My husband and I order takeout from Babbo regularly. Their online ordering system is easy to use, and includes their whole menu. We typically order Babbo on a weekend night, and food is usually ready within 30 minutes.
The menu features many different pastas, hearty sandwiches, pizzas, and salads. The portions sizes are very large. Whenever my husband and I order food, we always have leftovers for the next day--part of the reason we love ordering from there. Plus, all meals come with warm bread...which tastes amazing! 
We have never eaten in, but the staff is always very friendly when we go to pick up our food. I imagine wait staff is just as friendly.
