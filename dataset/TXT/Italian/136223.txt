IXUwuNjy707wJNW2U4sRVg For those of you that are reading the reviews. I first want to say that there is a website. Read the menu before you go.  Second,  I have been going here for years and enjoy hearing John share stories about his children. So. If you ask them Shari would be more than happy to make you a kid friendly meal!  They are that accommodating.  Love this place. Food is always spectacular.   Make sure you sign up for their newsletter
