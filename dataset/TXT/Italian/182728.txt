OASX1Yrgq_7R1PsYpixRcw Well, I gave them a second try.  12:00 on a weekday and they were practically empty.  Uh-oh.  I had a slice of pepperoni and an Italian Beef.  When I ordered it "wet", I got this weird look.  It took them about 15 minutes to put this together.

The pizza was dry and tasteless.  A New Yorker buddy insists that good New York pizza should have grease running out of the corner when you fold the slice.  This one was dry.  Oh, I said that :-)  Crusty too.  a couple slices of pepperoni stuck to the dry sauce.

The Italian Beef was so-so.  Completely dry, but there was a little cup of jus to dip it in. Covered in giardineira, it was hot, but small for the price.  I cannot imagine anyone serving Italian Beef and not knowing how it is served.
