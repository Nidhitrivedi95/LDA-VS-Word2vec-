4qQVf2lt-47VcQ4v54PEXQ Dinner this evening was superb. Although I ate alone due to a cancelled date, the service was impeccable. 
I ordered a side salad to begin with. Full of so many different fresh vegetables. Along with the homemade baguettes it started what was to be an unforgettable dinner.
The entree I ordered was Chicken Florentine with a side of Rigatoni. Two big chicken breasts grilled in a wonderful buttered garlic sauce topped with provolone and fresh sauteed spinach. It was DELICIOUS. This was not on the menu as an entree, but I had this previously as a sandwich, so Claudio (the owner and head chef) made it up for me. I barely had room to finish this scrumptious meal . . . but I did.
Wonderful experience. Highly recommend this off the wall Italian Bistro. Try it
