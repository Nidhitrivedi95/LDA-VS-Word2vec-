SO5H4j7qgWBuZ-53ziXu4A So we have been coming here for over 6 years and usually it's not too bad of a wait. But tonight, with maybe 5 tables of customers, we waited. We made our food selections and then waited, for about 10 minutes, then another customer came, sat down and was promptly waited on, then another a few minutes later. Even with a busboy cleaning tables all around us we still waited, invisibly. 

I will never come here again. 

Don't put out a sign asking people to seat themselves if you can't hire people to do the job you hired them for. Neglecting the customer doesn't make the company money or make the customer happy. I'm a business owner and cannot imagine doing this to my customers.
