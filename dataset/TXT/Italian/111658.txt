g6AFW-zY0wDvBl9U82g4zg 2nd visit just as great as the first. This time also tried their desserts. 

Chocolate caramel brownie topped with a chunk of score and pecan caramel brownie. I personally liked the pecan brownie better. The chocolate brownie had a slight dark chocolate bitter taste and the pecan brownie had a sweeter vanilla type of taste.

The Japanese barista  is very talented when creating the artistic designs on the cappuccino's. She is very friendly and has a strong Japanese accent which I find cute :)
