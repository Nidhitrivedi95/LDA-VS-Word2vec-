p1ohbPwI1QfjHQ2zRup5OA Wow, I was so pleasantly surprised when I stopped by Portici for dinner earlier this week! Their special that night was $10 for any of their pizzas and it was so worth it! I had the Nepoletana pizza and it was magnificent. The tomato sauce was creamy and the crust was the perfect density- on the thinner side, just the way I l like it. It was also a decent enough size to fill you up, ~12 inches. The servers were also very pleasant and did a great job attending to us. The space is a little small since it is a cafe, but they have a nice little patio which is perfect for the summer. I definitely recommend this spot for a delicious Italian bite near Yorkville that wont dent your wallet :)
