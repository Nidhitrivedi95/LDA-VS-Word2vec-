FvJtjO5nuIy5erGbkJpJXw We took my grandmother there along with our daughter.  "Gram" goes there occasionally and my SIL goes there as well, both had good things to say so there was a small expectation.  We were seated in the main dining room near the water fountain.  Its big but doesn't fell big, which is good.  Both gram and my wife got salads which they enjoyed very much.  The waitress made sure that their orders came out correct.  I had the steak & cheese hoagie which was very good.  It's a very good spot for a nice longer type of lunch.  We'll be back to checkout the dinner scene.  Oh and its an excellent spot for families.  My daughter was very happy with all the bread.
