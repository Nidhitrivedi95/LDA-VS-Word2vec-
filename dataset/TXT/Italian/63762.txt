BaVtTt9pBoI8rrN35tsj_g we went to celebrate my sons "15" birthday we told them as soon as we walked in . the server took a super long time to come get our order . Then forgot my daughters drink . It took forever to get our meal. we told this waitress twice that it was my sons birthday and that we were here to celebrate and still nothing. After twenty minutes passed , We asked if he could get some ice cream or something to celebrate. She brought a small ice cream and stated she couldn't sing if we could help which we did we understand maybe she was shy.   Not the place to go to celebrate your party . :(
