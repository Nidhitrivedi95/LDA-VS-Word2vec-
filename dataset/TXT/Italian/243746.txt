usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA As a native New Yorker, I don't think I'm a pizza snob, but I am pretty knowledgeable; and Piccolo Forno's pizzas are among the best I've ever had anywhere. Very thin crusts, imaginative toppings, especially the excellent eggplant.

I notice some of the other Yelpers have complained about long waits on popular nights. Well, if a small restaurant has tremendous food, long waits on Friday or Saturday nights are inevitable. We went at 5 pm on Tuesday night...were going to a Pirates game at 7 pm...and were seated and served quickly. 

In a way, Piccolo Forno patrons have the same problem as Pirates fans: Used to be you could walk up to the ticket window 10 minutes before game time and get great seats twenty rows behind home plate. Now you're lucky to get seats a hundred feet above the left fielder.  Produce a great product and more customers show up.
