wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw The first time we had gone here wasn't the best experience. We had a couple sitting next to us arguing the whole time quite loudly, and that made the whole experience really uncomfortable and we couldn't really enjoy our food, because we just wanted to get out of there!
I went back with a girlfriend, and it was very enjoyable!! Love the blinis! and I can't get enough of their bruschetta!! 
I really like that they also offer a half sandwich, have salad or soup deal!!! Its nice to get a little bit of everything with the half deal!
Over all, this is my go to place for when I have friends/family in town who really enjoy wine, and yummy food!
