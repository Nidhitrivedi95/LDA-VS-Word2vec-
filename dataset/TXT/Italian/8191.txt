0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw I enjoyed Joe's Farm. Went there because Diners Drive-ins and Dives like alot of people. The Ahi sandwhich they featured on the show was amazing!!!!!!! I didn't care for the onion rings so much. It was a little expensive but I guess if you take into account I ordred Ahi it was not so bad.
