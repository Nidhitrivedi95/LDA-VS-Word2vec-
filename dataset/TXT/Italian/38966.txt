The best part is they have both Vegan and Gluten Free options.  This makes it great for when we want to gather with our closest friends who run fall all over the food spectrum.  

The pizza is good.  I'm from Chicago so I'm picky about my pizza as nothing is ever as good as my home town staple.  But I enjoy this place.  The crust is good, not too dry and airy.  The only thing I don't like is that their thin crust is not a true thin crust in my eyes.  I like crispy thin crust but it is still a good crust.  The pizza was not oily or greasy at all.  We've had pepperoni,  sausage, and ham and pineapple on our pizza.  My boyfriend has had the wings and they smelled good to me and appeared to taste good as he polished them off.

We've had their pizza dine in and carry out and really have no complaints.  My only other dislike is that the pizza is not as good the next morning.  Yes I judge pizza based on it's taste as cold leftovers.  But, I love cold pizza so this is a huge scoring point for me.

It's a great little neighborhood spot that we will continue to visit.
