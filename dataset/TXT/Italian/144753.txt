k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ Another great review! We went last Friday night and were seated pretty quickly. I was instantly impressed with the beer selection and prices, very nice. We were a party of three and shared a charcuterie to start, the farmers cheese is a highlight as well as the tomato jam spread they serve with it, very good. We shared the Calabrian and Salsiccia pizzas, they were both delicious and very different. The spicy salumi on the Calabrian was complemented well with the creaminess of the burrata, and it was all set off by the freshness of the watercress. The Salsiccia has a nice earthiness from the sage and sausage blend, all brought together by a balsamic drizzle. The highlight was the stone fruit crostada for dessert,I want one right now. A perfect combination of flavors and textures, really phenomenal!

I can't end the review without mentioning how great the service was. Friendly, knowledgable and willing to offer great suggestions.
