A7waf6G3cvnLfAqKeLL8DA Excellent service, extensive wine selection, good ambience and delicious food. Finally a restaurant in King West that I would go back for. Not only it's famous, their food are extraordinary and fantastic. Reasonably priced and portions are good as well. There are many things to order suitable for everyone.  If you are more adventurous you could try their lamb brain deep fried, or their knotted bread, olives etc are simply delicious as well. Their pasta dishes are divine.  Must also order their desserts to finish off an awesome meal!  Would recommend everything on the menu!
