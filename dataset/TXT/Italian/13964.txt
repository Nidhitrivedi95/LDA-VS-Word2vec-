1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ What's not to like about Maggiano's! The food is excellent and the service is always on point. My Dad and I enjoy sitting at the bar and having lunch on occasion and we always leave extremely satisfied. All of the bartenders and wait staff are very personable and fun to talk to while we are eating our meal. Calvin and all of the other bartenders always provide great service and are very knowledgable of the menu and wine selection. I'm a big sports fan so I enjoy talking to Calvin about all the latest sporting events. Calvin and others always make our trip to Maggiano's a 5 star experience. The menu has something for everybody and has great lunch specials, a great happy hour and the Marco's meal for dinner is a definite go-to for anyone that loves delicious pasta. I can honestly say that I always look forward to a trip to Maggiano's. It's one of my top 5 favorite places to eat in all of Phoenix!
