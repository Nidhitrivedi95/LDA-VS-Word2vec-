PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ After searching on Yelp on where to eat tonight, we chose this Off the Strip because of the chicken wing reviews.
We arrived there and I ordered the Sea Bass and my husband, the pork chops.  Both entrees came with a green salad with balsamic vinaigrette or Caesar salad - both salad dressings were home made.
Both the entrees and salads were delicious.  The pork chops were crusted after marinated in papaya and cherry wine which made then very tender.  Pan fried peppers and mushrooms covered the chops. The sea bass was in a white wine sauce with sauteed cabbage/peppers/carrots which was an odd combination but very tasty!  The potatoes on both entrees were seasoned, crusted and not overbearing.
The very creamy cheesecake was a great ending!  I also loved the crusty bread.
We were very satisfied and will be going there again.
Atmosphere was very relaxing with TV's showing the NBA Final.
