The walls are decked out in hundreds of Caricatures of celebrities over the past fifty years.  The restaurant is generally pretty crowded so waits can be a while.  But consider that you're inside an amazing shopping mall so just take your 45 min wait and get some shopping done.

Lobster - I've tried the lobster on two different occasions.  They are monsters!  The first one was 5 1/2 lbs and the second was 6 lbs!!!  Both times, it was $23 per lb so do the math and it gets pretty steep.  If you get some sides (highly recommend the hashed browns), then you can split the lobster and be pretty stuffed.  Typically lobsters of this size are tough, chewy, with little flavor (the ideal size for texture anf flavor should be 1 1/2), but it was still great.  It's definitely more about the novelty of eating a lobster claw the size of your hand than it is about fine-dining.  

The way the Lobster is cooked and served is split down the middle and broiled.  It's sprinkled lightly with parsley and served with drawn butter and lemon wedges.  Its not the best Lobster I've had, but its definitely the biggest and most satisfying serving of lobster I've ever had.  Either way, its definitely something to try.

Filet Mignon - What a disappointment.  The first time around, it was bland, dry, and tough.  I specifically ordered Medium Rare and it was served medium to medium-well.  The second time I ordered it, again, it was bland, tough, and even MORE dry.  Granted the Filets are about 2 1/2 - 3 inches thick so its a little difficult to cook the steaks properly without charring the surface to hell.  Nevertheless, I was horribly disappointed on both occasions.  

*Note - I tried the Bone-In Rib-Eye at the Los Angeles Location and it was a great steak.  Juicy, flavorful, and seared to perfection.  Perhaps the Filet Mignon is just the Achilles Heal of The Palm.
