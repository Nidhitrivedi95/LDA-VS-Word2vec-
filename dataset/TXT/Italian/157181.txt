lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ This place is a complete waste of time and money. The service was poor, the food was sub par, and the ambiance was terrible. The seats in our booth were in desperate need of repair, the waiter completely forgot we had mentioned it was my birthday, and the bathroom was disgusting. The bread was served cold and wasn't very flavorful, and both entrees we ordered were incredibly bland. I've been to other locations and was really pleased, but I'd advise fellow yelpers to avoid this location.
