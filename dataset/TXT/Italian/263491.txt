wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q Dreadful!!  Spaghetti and meatballs, yuck, cold pasta, packaged frozen meatballs, just terrible.  Hubby had a combo dish with "lasagna", chicken parmigiana, and cannoli.  Dreadful.  Cold, no sauce, cannoli was kinda like a nasty pasta burrito, chicken tough and cold, lasagna just layers of ricotta and noodles--obviously fresh from the freezer.  Yuck.  Both "meals" straight from freezer to microwave to table.  We will not be back.
