P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw I love this place. Every time I come up to Vegas I have to stop here and have a Native and some suicide fries. It never gets old. The last time I was here I had their poutine for the first time. I will make sure I always order it again. I love that this place is in a locals bar. The food is amazing. You won't order a bad a thing on the menu I promise.
