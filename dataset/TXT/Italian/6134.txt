_WeKQLCZ_oWlJ6Tcql0n-Q This place has been around forever for a reason 
It's a very nice Italian restaurant/bar where you can grab a drink or share a meal. 
My go to item on the menu is the chicken salad so I can't speak for the rest but my friends seemed really please with their meals. However I tried their beer-battered fries and they are BOMB
The cocktails are really good 
N.B: it can get very loud later in the evening.
