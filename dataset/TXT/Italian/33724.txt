60uVlCUiLJvq3xNo_3bhQQ I walked in here on a whim when I stopped at the dollar store. Was greeted right away and placed my order. The linguine a la bolognese is AMAZING. So much flavor and the noodles were perfectly al dente! The bread it comes with is delicious as well dipped into the bolognese sauce. Definitely coming back here! Very friendly staff!
