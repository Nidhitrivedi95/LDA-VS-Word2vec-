H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g Met a friend here who was at a conference in the Palazzo. Lovely seating... feels like you are in a cafe is a square in Europe, especially when the lights went low and a great place to talk. We started out with an appetizer of french bread spread with goat cheese and topped with roasted beets and herbs and was really, really tasty. Wine choices by glass were a bit on the expensive side... but they did give you a small carafe. 

Had the grilled chicken topped with eggplant parm, sun-dried tomato and buffalo mozzarella, which was good, We split an order of gelati and biscotti, which were both ok... definitely had better. I thought the consistency was off, and when you are paying top dollar for the ambiance and Chef Mario Batali's name, I expected a full above average experience and the food just did not have the pop it should have had.
