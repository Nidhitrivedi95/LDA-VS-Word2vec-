Grr2wJ3nYD_7qUyespDglA I ordered: Rice ball with meat sauce and cheese + veal sandwich + pop = 20$ for 2 people

Recommendation: Comfort food that makes you full, not a place for foodie that's looking for something special

+(1/2) Price vs Portion: we were very full but 20$ is little pricey for what you get

-1 Taste: 
Rice ball 
- literally a bowl of rice + cheese layer + basic tomato sauce top
- bland, nothing special
- bigger than you expect, about the size of cup of milk (240 ml)

Veal sandwhich
- thin cut meats + cheese + mushrooms + tomato sauce
- buns and meats were not flavourful so most of the taste is tomato sauce
- double the size of a big mac

+1 Comfortable place to eat and you get served
