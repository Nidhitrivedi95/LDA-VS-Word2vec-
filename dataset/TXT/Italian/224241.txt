SMTMAaGjUfsefp9RIIfQmA Wow....loving this place. Simple, rustic Italian dishes that are executed very well with quality ingredients. A simple concept, but restaurants like this are hard to come by in the west end. Service was on-point (we were a group of 8) and although I didn't see many kids there, the atmosphere was very much family-friendly. As a vegetarian, I was also thrilled at all the vegetarian options on the menu. I will most definitely be back to try them all! The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wine list. Selection is small and much of it is very expensive. Of the reds, only 3 bottles were in the $40 - $60 range.
