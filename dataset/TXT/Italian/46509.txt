8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg Absolutely perfect dinner! Italian Fondue, had to special request it since we were not in the bar, was so so delicious. 
Chicken Saltimbocca Cannelloni and Veal Ravioli we fabulous. This proves you don't have to go to a  ridiculously expensive celebrity chef restaurant to enjoy an amazing meal on the strip.
