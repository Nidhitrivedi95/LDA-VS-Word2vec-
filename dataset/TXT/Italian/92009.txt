eGTAC8EzcHiYnnZ52tijiQ I have been to this place twice now and both times I have been served well. I have tried the lamb sandwich and the open faced new York steak burger now. Both were just delicious. The meat was soft and the cheese and bread in the right proportion. The caramelised onions and mushrooms on the steak burger added the required sweetness to the burger. Having said that, there are more sandwiches/burger on the menu that need my attention. Needless to say, I will be visiting again.
