eQNApV0-OpYJec3y1OoBvg My wife and I used to go out a lot to try new places but now with our 7 month old it's kind of difficult. This was our first time trying Magic Oven so we ordered in. They offer a wide assortment of sandwiches, pasta, and pizza so we went for the pizza. It was delivered right on time and was piping hot.

After looking over the variety of pizzas, we ultimately decided on the charcuterie pizza since my wife and I are both meat lovers. The meat was very tasty and thickly sliced with good portions that covered the entire pizza pretty much to the edge. Depending on how you like your dough, you may or may not like Magic Oven. It's not traditional pizza dough. It's a thin crust that kind of reminds me of naan. Because it's thin it gets nice and crispy on the edges but as I said before, the toppings go to the edge so you don't really have a crust. It's a decent enough pizza with quality toppings but it's not really a traditional pizza and may not be for everyone.
