ddlnpDxGDDxGGoG_dVXwiw Hats off to the chefs. Absolutely amazing food. Service is probably the worst I've seen in Cleveland. We had a large party, but that's no excuse to be taking our plates after one bite of food (I was distracted by conversation and saw my plate was gone). Multiple people in our party weren't finished before the server took our plates. Our server seemed frustrated that we were a large party. Probably better to go with only a few people here.
