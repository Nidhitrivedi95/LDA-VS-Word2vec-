_myTPlWa8QRN5eavs-hNPg Went to the soft opening on June 1st, and loved it!  I was very glad to have an Italian restaurant opening up nearby, and was looking forward to getting in there and trying the food.

First off, the appetizers made the meal for me.  I got the meatball sliders, which were topped with pecorino cheese and arugula--delicious!  My boyfriend got the seafood plate (the name of which was in Italian of course, so you will forgive me for not remembering it), and it was even better.  The squid especially was cooked to perfection, and was probably the best I have ever had.  The sauce on the side paired with it perfectly, and the breading was superb.  

The main dishes didn't disappoint--I got the funghi pizza and was blown away by how great it was.  The crust was perfection.  We had a slight hitch when the server brought my boyfriend the wrong dish (Pomodoro instead of Vognole), but it was quickly remedied.  He ended up eating most of the Pomodoro, and really liked it--the sauce was light and fresh.  When he got the Vognole, he said it was exceptionally good.

Dessert for me was only so-so.  They ran out of gelato (understandable given how busy they were), and we ended up with Panna Cotta, which I am not really a fan of.  Boyfriend ate it and loved it.

I also have to say that their bar prices are really reasonable.  Two beers and two amaretto and sours came to just over $15 with tax.

Overall, a great experience, and we can't wait to go again!
