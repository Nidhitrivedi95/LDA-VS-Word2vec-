w2b0ve7xpuCQkwYICFIUOg It is a readily known fact that I can never turn down an Italian meal, so when the opportunity presented itself to try the Pasta Shop, I agreed with pleasure.

The setting is intimate, location is close to home (good or bad thing, I haven't decided yet), and the decor..um..well.. I can appreciate the fact this venue is supporting local art.  I'm not sure if the decor consists of several local artists or just one in particular, but the walls are covered in very eccentric art pieces.

Lets get to the good stuff.. the FOOD! A table of (7) and I for the most part decided to take advantage of the Restaurant Week set menu which consisted of a delicious caprise salad, Cesar salad, main course (spinach fettuccine in a garlic sun-dried tomato sauce with chicken), and for dessert..one of the BEST homemade cannoli's I've ever had!

Our server was attentive and our drinks rarely were empty and overall I would most certainly make the Pasta Shop a regular venue to feed my Italian food craving.

The price is a little high for standard pasta, but we are not talking past out of a box people, we are talking freshly made pasta daily!

Fresh pasta, delicious ingrediants and the best cannoli in town.. Pasta Shop is your place.
