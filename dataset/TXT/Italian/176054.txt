NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ My wife and I loved this place and went there for years before they closed due to health issues of a principal.
However, mitigating this loss a new and superb Italian restaurant has taken over and remodeled the space. New menu - great food. While Montesano's can't be replaced - they have been followed by excellence.
