lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg Giordanos pizza is originally from Chicago and people were excited about it coming to Las Vegas.  I live in Utah, so was happy to test it out on a recent visit to town.  After a long fun day of shopping on the Las Vegas strip, we decided to get a Giordanos pie on the way out of town. We decided to get the thin crust pesto chicken pizza, as well as the stuffed deep dish pizza. The overall favorite of the group had to be the thin crust pesto chicken pizza, what flavor! The stuffed deep dish pizza was great as well, but for me it was just a bit too much, but that's just personal preference. Overall Giordanos pizza is an excellent pizza experience on the Las Vegas strip.
