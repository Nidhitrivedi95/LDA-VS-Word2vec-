nDKcQkh8vZkY_u1kyww44g Yummm, went to Valentino Saturday night with a group of 5 and boy was it tasty! We ordered a few bottles or red, they have a great wine selection either by the bottle or by the glass. One of us ordered the chicken and said it was dry so he switched it out for the spaghetti and meatballs. We all did Italian. I had the special - a seafood spicy spaghetti. 

The following dishes are A OK in my book ;) and if you like spicy ask for the chili flakes, sooooo good! 

FRIED CALAMARI WITH SPICY MARINARA
SAN DANIELE PROSCIUTTO, MOZZARELLA AND OLIVES WITH GRILLED PIADINA
SPAGHETTI WITH (THREE MEATS) MEAT BALLS AND MARINARA
LASAGNA ALLA BOLOGNESE

Nice comfortable atmosphere. I'll certainly return if I'm looking for Italian again. Prices are great!
