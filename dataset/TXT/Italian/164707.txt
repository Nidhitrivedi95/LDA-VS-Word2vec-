LZSyWy4IHgXg6QhW2jrBlw The food was good, but if you want to eat in a caferia this place is for you! Big bright gleaming lights, just like a cafeteria or bingo hall.   No atmosphere, I sat down in the overly bright blinding booth and touched the booth seating with my arm and it was hollow and I fell through about one foot. The waitress lauged and said she would take note of it.   Food 4 stars, but atmosphere about 1 if I could give a negative I would.
