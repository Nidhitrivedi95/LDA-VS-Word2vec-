FRIIEcW64yA_bW6sCBqBIA My sister and I wanted to have lunch at La Capeninna around 2:20pm before they closed and when we went in we found out their servers had left for the afternoon so the chef/owner actually came out, seated us and served us himself. He was so hospitable and accommodating from beginning to end. The food is good, not overcooked and their pasta sauce is delicious!
