h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ The food is delicious, but the service was poor. We waited a good 10 minutes before our waiter greeted us. They brought our entrees before even clearing our appetizer plates so we had to awkwardly make room and clear our own settings. The served asked if we would like pepper, but then forgot to bring it to our table. Also, the live music on a Friday night was way too loud to enjoy a romantic conversation. Disappointed in the service since the change of ownership.
