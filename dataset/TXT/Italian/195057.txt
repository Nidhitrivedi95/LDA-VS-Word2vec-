pjpUOlJLlkIxBZ5BquA2PA Amazing food, dine in, but WATCH OUT when you get food to go. Six of us recently dined at Pomo and  it was instantly obvious the food was handcrafted, the pasta was one of a kind, and the meat lasagna was the best I have ever had. It hurts me to give it four stars, but there is one oddity. Order the same meal to go and you will be charged unreasonably for items which were previously brought to your table for free. Bread - $$$. Shaved Parmesan cheese - $$$. Sometimes it's the little things that can impact your dining experience, but I would not want this review to keep you from eating there - delicious, fresh, and fantastic.
