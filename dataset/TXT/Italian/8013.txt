If you go when it's busy, leave a few people to save a table. You wait in line to place your order and then wait for your name to be called. A friend of mine who lives in Gilbert raved about this place and I always love going to places that appeared on Diners, Drive-in and Dives.

Scariest part about eating here: There are signs under the trees that warn about FALLING SCORPIONS! Yikes!
