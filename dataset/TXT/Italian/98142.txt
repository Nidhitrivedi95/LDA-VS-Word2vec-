We tend to order the antipasta salad with their house dressing. This dressing you could drink straight out of the bottle it's THAT good! The mozzarella is always fresh and they place large slices of it around the plate.

The calzones are little pockets of heaven. You can create your own unique combo of ingredients or stick to one off the menu. Whatever your decision, it's sure not to disappoint! 

The pizzas are AMAZING! The dough is pillow-like but able to support a plethora of sauce and toppings. There are plenty of pizzas to choose from and again, you can't go wrong because all the ingredients are fresh!

There's always a special posted on the chalkboard sign out front...and it's usually named after a regular customer.
