pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ Honestly the best dinner I had in Vegas considering all the great restaurants in town.  I was in town for business and tired of eating on the strip, so 3 of my colleagues and I got this recommendation from a cocktail waitress at Aria... thanks Thea!

Local spot off the strip, great atmosphere, great service, and even better food.  We had to wait about 45 for a table, but definitely worth it and drinks helped kill the time.  

I had the Chicken Marsala... excellent.  Someone else got "Crazy" Alfredo... super good and very popular dish.  Seriously, anything you order there would be good.  I would recommend this place to anyone and can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
Excellent job Nora's... keep it up!
