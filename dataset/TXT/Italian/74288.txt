cpkBJhBujpBFZ0rOItE-4g My wife & I went on a Monday, and Ruffino was not very busy. The service was excellent from the minute we walked up to the door. Our server Tina was friendly, and we had frequent visits from the receptionist and the sommelier, which fit our mood. My wife had the salmon special with caper sauce, and I had the veal piccata; both were delicious. The dinners came with garlic bread, tossed green salad, rigatoni, and vegetables, all very tasty. If you sign up with them, you will receive a card which offers the second entree for half off, or second dinner free on your birthday. We left the restaurant very happy and satisfied.
