sKy8HkP6X-8dCKq_SzeIpw My past two experiences at Queens have been disappointing. I love the atmosphere and the service is ok. However I feel like the food quality has suffered perhaps as a result of the ownership change. The calzone I had was large, but flavorless. The pizza seemed unbalanced as well, too much seasoning, slightly undercooked. There are better choices.
