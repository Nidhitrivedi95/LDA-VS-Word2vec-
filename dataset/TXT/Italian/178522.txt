NrjzI_RhWLJBqWVustL2sQ Place looked cool from the outside so thought we'd check it out. We were seated in the lounge section which was empty. 

So we were waiting for 20 minutes until I decided to actually go and call a waiter to take our order.

It's a lounge so it's supposed to be lively right? Nope. The place had no music playing and again, after becoming sick of the dead atmosphere I asked for them to turn the music on.

The waiter came with our order and it's a 5 star restaurant so your expect a little hospitality or good service. Waiter might as well have thrown the drinks at us. No napkins, didn't even pour the bottle for us.

Lastly, the sound system (AFTER we asked for the music to be turned on) kept popping and making these loud exploding noises which was unnerving.

The only good part of this place is that they have pretty girls serving you but they're too busy looking at themselves in the mirror rather than taking your order.
