xSIkiqB2tuiyJwFmPyNR5Q I don't think I've ever eaten at Macaroni Grill before, and if I have, it's been a really long time...but we had a great meal, great service and I would recommend this location for sure!  Probably would give 3.5 stars if I could, but decided to round up based on attentive service and the fact that overall the dining expereince at this Macaroni Grill in the Ballantyne area was very good!  Not a higher score solely based on that my experience didn't wow me, but for a chain restaurant it was a solid experience and a great place to eat a casual meal!

We started with tomato bruschetta which was very good - tomatoes tasted freshly prepared and bread was grilled just right!  I selected Pollo Limone Rustica which was chicken in a lemon basil sauce with penne pasta and was baked to achieve a crusty top with creamy pasta and spinach underneath - very good and a large portion with plenty of leftovers for lunch! He had Chicken Marsala and very much enjoyed it as well - the sauce looked just right!

I would definitely return to sample some of the other dishes offered and maybe try one of the desserts that looked really good!
