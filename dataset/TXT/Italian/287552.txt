zluk4cL7Ch-uRlRply42ZQ I am sure the food is great in this place. It came very highly recommended. We even dressed up to enjoy a "fancy night out."  We ordered to calamari and mussels for appetizer...then waited over an hour and a half for our entrees. The waitress came by twice and said our food was coming and it was being plated. Our reservation was at 7:15....at 9:00 we tried to talk to our waitress to ask if some of our meal could be boxed and if we could cancel the ribs (I didn't want to eat leftover ribs). Eating ribs after 9:00 isn't good for anyone. 

She barely gave us 3 seconds. Finally she came by with the bill for our appetizers! She thought we said we didn't want anything when in fact she didn't even give us a chance to ask about our options. 

For the first time in over 15 years we had to talk to the manager...but he didn't come to our table...we had to go find him. In the end he simply said "what do you want?!"

I didn't want a free meal...I didn't want a hand out. We were ready to spend our $150 at this place for a great meal. 

In the end they comped the appetizers. Now we are in the parking lot of another restaurant getting take out since the kids are still starving and I told them not to eat too much bread so it wouldn't ruin their appetite. 

I cannot say how disappointed I am. The restaurant wasn't full. Hmmm...what were the motivations? Why treat us this way? It's times like this that make me wonder. I don't want to pull the race card...but why did everyone else get treated differently?
