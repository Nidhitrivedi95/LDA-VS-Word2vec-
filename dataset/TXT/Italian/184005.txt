oH6QAuoTLFaX97oqqpLTMg I don't usually leave reviews but this place was so awful I felt inclined to leave a review to save other patrons from making the mistake of ordering pizza from this place. Thus was the worst pizza I have ever tasted. The crust was like hard like cardboard without any flavor and there was hardly any sauce or toppings. Whatever you do, do not order a pizza with spinach on it. They used frozen spinach that tasted like straw so my pizza was inedible. I asked for a refund but they only offered me a store credit that I will never use because the pizza was so horrible
