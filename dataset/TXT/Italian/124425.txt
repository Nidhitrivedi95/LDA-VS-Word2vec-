Our table of 3 arrived on an early Saturday evening and were seated immediately. There was a large party of 25 that evening so the waitress gave us a more private spot in the corner, which was a nice gesture.

Big hits for the table included:

- Eggplant caviar:  smooth and flavourful served with warm, fresh ciabatta
- Warm goat cheese salad:  we enjoyed the nice thick layer of cheese, walnuts on the crostini

Not so much in love with the:

- Spicy calamari salad: the calamari was extremely chewy and only flavouring was from the over dosed chili flakes
- Bruschetta:  bread was too crispy for our liking.

Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks refilled. We sat and nibbled slowly, almost 3 hours and did not feel rushed to leave. We were hoping for dessert, but it turned out there was only one option - banana toffee, so we passed.

There are many places to choose from in Port Credit but we would definitely return to Napoca.
