u9R0_pvEkl7QGPJYH3j1sg When it comes to authentic Italian in Phoenix, not many places come to mind. Times Square is one of those few places though. I've had the Chicken Piccata, Penne all vodka with meatballs and the Rigatoni all Laura. All were excellent and big portions. You really can't go wrong with anything you order here....pasta, chicken, pizza, subs, desserts. I am a huge sucker for cannoli as well and they have the best I've had in Phoenix! If you want great Italian food, come to Times Square!
