Een2yret0IwJUpHLwcxtRg They have Saturday hours!!

Had read about this place a couple of times and really wanted to try it, but their hours just didn't work for me.  So, I was psyched to see their hours had changed (thanks, yelp)!  

Stopped by around 11:30 on a Saturday.  Joe, who I assumed was one of the owners, was super-friendly.  He explained their options and told us about some of their plans.  

It's a cute little space on the terrace level (read: basement) near across from the Saloon and up the block on Washington from La Pomponee (etc).  Lots of seating.

Had the broccolini arancini (fried risotto ball), eggplant parm roll and a san pellegrino.  The texture of the arancini was quite nice.  Soft on the inside and lightly crisp on the outside.  The roll had a nice mix of ingredients to give it flavor without being soggy.  It came with a side of sauce.  I thought the sauce was quite good - definitely made the roll.  DH had a sausage and pepper roll and a slice of pizza.  He found the pizza (a new addition to the menu) to be a tad greasy (they use whole milk moz), but solved that with a napkin.

Our total was just over $20 - so comparable to what we'd spend at a take out place (Chipotle, etc).

All in all, a really great addition to the neighborhood!  We'll be back.
