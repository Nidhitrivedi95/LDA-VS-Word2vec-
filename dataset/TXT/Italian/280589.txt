YOD9dXrnpu8HTRILpF0onw This is a family oriented pasta place. At first it looks like it lacks potential due to the location in between a Goodwill and a terrible gym in a strip mall, BUT, the food is superb and the portions are stifling. The service can have it's hiccups, but is still great overall. It is definitely a fork wrapped in a napkin with band around it type of place, but the laid back family nature of it along with the food make it all a great time. I keep repeating family because it's the type of place folks schedule a post season soccer team gathering or a school function.

All in all nothing bad to say about this place. It has a loyal following which to me speaks volume. Give it a try and enjoy!
