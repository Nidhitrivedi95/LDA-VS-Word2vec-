wJYFQrlx-uRmujWM_IDFtw This is one of my favorite pizza places in the Scottsdale area. My parents discovered this place since it's in a shopping center pretty close to where I live. I'm pretty picky when it comes to great pizza being from both NY and Chicago. To me, pizza is either edible or it's so good I have to go back for more. I always get the personal pizza with goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes. There's only one other place that I know of where I can do this combination and that's in West Lafayette, IN where I went to college. The amount of sauce to cheese ratio is perfect and the crust is really good too. The salads come with homemade croutons which are delicious. I always steal them off of my Mom's plate. The service is always quick and friendly whether you dine-in or carry-out. Love the Chicago themed decorations too, even if they are Cubs related.
