klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw The vegan burger happy hour special is an amazing value, darn cute and pretty tasty. Sitting in a high class spot like Encore and enjoying a meatless hamburger served up in a paper box with a chocolate milkshake and fries for $9 has a certain charm,. If you're vegetarian/vegan, I think it is an experience you should add to your "must do" while in Vegas. 

The patty is by Gardein, and it is a-ok. Perhaps not the best meatless patty I have had, but not bad. Perhaps the burger could have a bit more cheese and a few more fresh toppings, lettuce, onions. I like a salad on my burger, but hey, it's $9 and comes with fries and a shake in a swanky spot. The fries are great, and the vegan chocolate milkshake is delicious, especially if you enjoy coconut.  

Another standout are the vegan desserts. Did you know that every chocolate chip cookie on Wynn properties is vegan...and delicious? Vegan sweet lovers will have no problem enjoying dessert here!

I have also had the turkey burger at Society, and it wasn't my favorite. It was a little dry, and based on that dish, I wasn't itching to get back. 

However, I love the atmosphere, and I think the happy hour special is a notable treat. I will definitely bring my vegan/vegetarian friends here when they visit!
