DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw This is the best italian place I have been to in Vegas. And I don't say this lightly, my wife and I fancy ourselves as Italian food connoisseurs. We have been to several restaurants in the area and this one is the tops. The food is fantastic and so is the service. My wife and I both had the lasagna, because our first time at a new Italian restaurant we always go for the staple. It was perfect, the taste was amazing. I cannot wait to try the other fantastic dishes on the menu. It was my wife's birthday so they gave us a complimentary slice of red velvet cake, which was freaking great. Pasquale was our server and he was fantastic, knowledgeable, and we will definitely ask for him when we return. This was our first of undoubtedly many trips to Siena.
