FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA Postino, I love you.  I love absolutely everything about you.  My biggest concern is the anxiety I get when it comes time to order.  There are SO many things on the menu that I love, and I'm trying to maintain a girlish figure, so I can't order everything.  My absolute favorite lunch is the prosciutto/fig/brie sandwich on ciabatta with the mixed greens salad.  The fried shallots, pear, candied nuts, and grapes make it an unforgettable dish, and the salty-sweet combo in the sandwich is perfection.  Their lemonade is the best in town, and it is a steal when you factor in the free refills.  Of course, their wine list is extensive and amazing... but I just can't seem to give up my lemonade! 

The service is always good.  Unobtrusive, knowledgeable, and friendly... plus a little hipster (but not TOO much).  It is always on my most-recommended list to friends and visitors.  Their consistency and quality are always spot-on.  If you haven't been, then get yourself there pronto!
