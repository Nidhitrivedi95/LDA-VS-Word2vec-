SD3ZyFR5ZjFneWpYhT6tLg This is a brilliant cafe and probably my favourite eatery in Edinburgh. The service is always excellent - fast and friendly - and the food is great. The Vesuvio Pizza (with no chilli) is my personal favourite and probably the best pizza in Edinburgh. The pasta is also great and they do a fantastic Carbonara. I recently took my Italian friend from Napoli who has lived in Scotland for 7 years and he said it was the best pizza he has ate in Scotland - so that is saying something. The staff are lovely, non pretentious and it's fast and cheap, so a no brainer 5 star review in my opinion. If you haven't been you must go!
