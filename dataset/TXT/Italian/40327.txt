7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Always the first place I go in Vegas.  Tonight no exception.  Got in late tonight.  Sat at bar.  

Normally the bartenders are great.  Not engaged tonight.  Maybe just overworked.

Ordered the NY.  $70.  Medium Rare.  May have been the worst steak I ever had.   Arrived burnt.  Could not even cut through it.  Raw on inside.  

May not come back.
