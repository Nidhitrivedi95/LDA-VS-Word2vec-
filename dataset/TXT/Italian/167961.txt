mJ_ucQ2_3hfTsmCcKb-hgw We ate here before a concert. The inside is dimly lit (mood lighting that is very atmospheric, but the party next to us was using their cell phones to read the menu). Speaking of which, the menu is limited yet somehow also diverse. More options appealed to us than we could eat at once, so we resolved to come back to order the other ones. This time we shared the arugula salad (which gave off a beguiling aroma like summer BBQ?) and a glass of rose. The wine was delicious, and I do not know why I continue to be surprised at how small the pour is at fancy restaurants. Hubby liked his flank steak with sweet potatoes two ways, while I found my charred scallops with cauliflower three ways to be an odd, monochromatic mixture of textures. Next time we can afford $50+ per person, I would like to try the beets and risotto.
