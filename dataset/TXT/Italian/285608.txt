And then you will, because it's the best damn beer selection in the city, and you'll gamble, getting an egg on your mushroom pie, and hell if it doesn't come out perfectly - just solid enough to keep it together while you grab a slice, glossy yolk still runny, making an otherwise OK pie stellar.  

Pizza roulette. I'll keep playing.
