Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw Update:  I was back in town and stopped by Cugino's.  I was only here a couple days so was limited on my meals but had one of my meals at Cugino's.  I had the pastrami sandwich on marble rye again and was not disappointed!  It was as good if not better than I remembered.  Can't wait to go back there again!
