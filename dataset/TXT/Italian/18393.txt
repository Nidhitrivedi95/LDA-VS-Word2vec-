2NiBvT5zL272IRcxru_x9A Love this place!  Sat outside with misters. The service was perfect.  The orange blossom martini was amazing; fresh squeezed orange juice!  We had the brushetta plank and it was delicious.  The chicken caeser salad was perfect.  The two pizzas were delicious - definitely can tell the house made crust and high quality ingredients. The cookie/ice cream dessert was yummy too.  Will definitely be back.
