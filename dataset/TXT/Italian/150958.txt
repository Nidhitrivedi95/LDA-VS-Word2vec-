klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw The beautiful Wynn and an acceptable spot to grab dinner before Le Reve. Cost versus value ... so-so. The gluten free bread was exceptional and the chef's attention to food allergens was great. The food itself was bland, the bar (with regards to bourbon) was boring and the staff lacked training. Not a bad place but not a "must go" either.
