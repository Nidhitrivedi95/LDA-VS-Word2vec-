53BSdnhzcCBfBH_6TgX63Q I wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, I have to give it a thumbs down. I first ordered from them a couple of months ago.. White pizza...on pan crust.. What arrived was thin crust that tasted like extra dry and crispy cardboard. I called them the next day to tell them it was overcooked and dry and didnt get as much as an apology. I decided to give them another try a couple of nights ago. Tried a veggie pizza, again asked for pan crust. The pizza did have thick crust this time, but it tasted like pillsbury pizza crust out of the tube, like you buy in the grocery store refrigerated section.. The toppings were good, but the crust ruined it. I also ordered a side salad with herb vinaigrette dressing, but got bleu cheese dressing... For a 12 inch pizza, 6 wings and a side salad, i spent over 25$ and was sorely disappointed.. No more Rosati's for me. I will stick with Frank's Pizza.....
