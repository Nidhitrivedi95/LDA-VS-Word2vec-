Food
Pros- flavorful, food presented in simple yet appealing style
Cons- nothing really stood out

First course-
1) meatballs with polenta - meatballs were moist and polenta had good flavoring and consistency
2) prawns with beans- prawns good grill flavor, seasoned well, beans were also creamy and well cooked
3) cheese artisinal board- good quality cheese with some fruit compote

Second Course
1) cioppino- good seafod flavor, seafood- clams, prawns, and octopus were fresh and the tomato broth well seasoned ( I add lime and chilli powder to give it a kick)
2) Wagu brisket- well cooked and seasoned, favorite is the grilled cauliflower (according to hubby)

Third course (dessert)
1) ricotta fritters- dry and boring after 1st bite, average tasting, 
2) chocolate flan- nice presentation inside little jam jar. flavor- more of a pot de creme and had more complex flavor with the salted caramel topping

We drove far (Northeast Mesa) to come to NOCA.  Although food was good, not worth the long distance drive.
