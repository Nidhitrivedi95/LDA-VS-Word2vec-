PSRZaGGxXmOmabL2si8pKw We keep coming back here for the excellent customer service, quality meals in each course and nice atmosphere in Summerlin.  This Carraba's is always the homeship restaurant my Mom selects for our night out.  First off, the homemade sweet Italian bread slices servced with Italian spices drenched in olive oil gets the palata going.  Then, the next step, the delicious house salad with house dressing is always tasty and has a taste of anchovy and olives in in it -- very tasty.  The soup option, the minnestrone, our choice with the cabbage and fresh vegetables. The entrees are amazing.  I've been hooked on the balsamic tiliapia with fresh basil and grilled cherry tomotoes and request a side of angel hair with pomodoro sauce (red veggie).  My mom loves the salmon with delicious butter and garlic sauce and her angel hair with a similiar sauce.  The decor reminds me of a Napa vineyard, and the service is always great.

Tthank you Carraba's for many family filled memories and years of delicious food!
