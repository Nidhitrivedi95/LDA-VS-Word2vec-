3qTSOuJ-ZyU1L7o62KHSIg I've yet to find a restaurant in Toronto that has a better all-around dining experience. From the incredible food, great service, trendy design, fantastic music and fun atmosphere, the Nose is by far in a way my favourite restaurant to go to. Whenever I need a place to bring out-of-towners, or a cool date-spot, this is always my go-to. Everyone I bring seems to love this place by the time they leave, and you can always count on it to be hustling and bustling with activity - even on a Tuesday in the dead of winter. My menu must-haves are the giant meatball, the crespelle, the fried calamari, the beef ribs and the osobucco. Delicious!
