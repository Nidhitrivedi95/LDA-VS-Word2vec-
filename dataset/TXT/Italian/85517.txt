The other night I ordered the Insalada Caprese . My boyfriend ordered the chicken fingers with fries. The salad was delicious! The right size and had great flavor. The fries were amazing! They were fresh cut and not frozen. He got the chicken fingers mild I prefer spicy but it was still just as good and juicy.
Tonight my boyfriend ordered the California club breakfast burrito and won't stop raving about how good it is. 
This will be our new late hang out. Love the great specials and deals they offer.
