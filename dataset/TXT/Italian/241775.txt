ukAUNyzUcBA4Su8UKjaJKg My Family from Winnipeg asked for Italian and something different - with a vibe and energy that they don\t get at home.  Well we were perplexed and put out some feelers and found 7numbers.  

This will be my new go-to restaurant as long as i have a reservation as the lineups scared me.  Knowing that "mama" changes the menu daily is very exciting!!

There were 7 of us and we nervously ordered the family meal.  The calamari was so fresh and beautifully done.....it said fried but there was only a light dusting of breading and just perfectly done.  the 3 salads were all great.

the 3 pastas that night were lovely, simple sauce-- tomato based - perfect. The Veal Lasagna stood out from the pack we asked for a second plate.  

We were not rushed through our meal we had time between courses to drink and talk.  Although it was very loud in the restaurant it felt right and we could still all hear each other and enjoy the atmosphere.

The mains - thank god we had room because they were no complaints.  My lamb shank fell off the bone and tasted fantastic.

I could go on.....but i think I want to go for dinner now........
