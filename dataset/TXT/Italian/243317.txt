Uqs18_AgDYsByvtSSOMzkw Aaaaaah I'm so confused....very glad I didn't look up these reviews before I went!

Walked by looking for a place that was open, and stumbled upon this place downtown.  Menu seemed fine.  At first, the hostess put us at terrible seats near two really little kids, but we asked to be moved and we were, to a much better choice.  We wanted to watch football and the waiter changed the screens without any fuss.

Had the minestrone soup - good portion, nice and hot.  A little spice to it.  Then had the "quattro" pizza - usually that means one quarter is just mushrooms, one is peppers, etc.  But this was actually four separate real pizza-types -- one quarter had goat cheese and proscutto!  My mojito was WAY overpriced ($10? not worth it) and the bathrooms are really far and really gross, but otherwise I thought everything was pretty decent.
