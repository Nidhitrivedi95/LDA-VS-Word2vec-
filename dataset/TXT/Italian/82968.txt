dGuRCJV66l-K7flfrwEgaA This simple looking grocery/restaurant is run by the same person who worked the yummy wood-fired pizza oven at Norman Hardie Estate out in Prince Edward County. We have been to his restaurant twice on the recommendation of the winery itself, and both times it was pizza and Norman Hardie wines. This pizza is my favourite in the city, and is the same style as Libretto - thin, scorched crust and simple, delicious toppings. The crust recipe is very important to this style of pie, and it is excellent here. Do not let the basic layout of the space fool you. This is excellent food!
