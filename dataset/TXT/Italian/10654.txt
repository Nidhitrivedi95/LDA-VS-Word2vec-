0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg I had a really great experience here. We went here for our birthday dinner and had amazing service from start to finish. Jason was our server and did an outstanding job making our birthday dinner special. We had the best seat in the house with a direct view of the strip. We took advantage of the opportunity by taking lots of pictures, obvi. We started out with some kushi oysters. I love oysters so it was a must, very fresh and sweet. The lobster pici was absolutely delicious, tasty, complex, flavorful, and very unique. For dessert we had the bomboloni with Nutella and the chocolate soufflé. We also got a cute little sampler of tea cookies and biscotti for our joint birthday. Overall, would definitely come back again for the food and service.
