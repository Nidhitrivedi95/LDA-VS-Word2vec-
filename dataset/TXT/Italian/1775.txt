-httBl6DSZiUtDX4SQWtag I love this place! The bakery is in the front. But walk down the aisle on the side of the bakery and you will discover a restaurant. A trattoria. Sit down. Relax. Order a pizza. A dish of pasta. Or a cup of coffee to dip your biscotti in. Everything mixes and matches in the back. Ask for Larry- the owner!
