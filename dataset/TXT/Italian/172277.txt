N6MzDoao6s68nAIW8vS9dQ Biaggio's is delicious!! This our 2nd visit and we love it! We ordered the supreme Stromboli and a large pepperoni and sausage pizza. My kids ate it all up and loved it! Mr. Biaggio takes such great care of his customers, he is so friendly and always goes above and beyond. He gave all 4 of my kids ice cream and one of my boys wanted meat lovers pizza so he made 2 of the slices on the pizza meat lovers just for him! We will be back over and over again!!
