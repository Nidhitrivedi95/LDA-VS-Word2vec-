99j5vhhtFJIefXDLsmA29Q Soggy Pizza.  They only have one size (16 inch) starting at $18.  Refused to make a pizza half cheese only.  Sucks when you have a 3 year old who doesn't eat any toppings.  I wasn't going to buy him his own $18 pizza and end up spending $40 for the 3 of us.  We wound up having to pick stuff off of his slices.

I worked at a pizza place before as a server.  I wasn't being crazy.  Just wanted one of their specialty pies with one half cheese only.

So they refuse to do half and half but apparently you can't even remove a topping from the whole pie either.  Weird rules for apparently no reason.
