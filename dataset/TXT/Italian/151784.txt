kpZ2vPjkHfee4pCLC05tfg I love Italian food, love risotto, love homemade pasta, and therefore I love this restaurant.  

My husband likes the lasagna which is made with a white sauce. 

The place has a warm atmosphere and I vaguely recall someone playing an accordian.  Just call ahead to make sure they are open because I've shown up a few times to find that they aren't open during certain hours and certain days.
