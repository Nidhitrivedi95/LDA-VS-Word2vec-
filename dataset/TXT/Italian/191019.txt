pCWg4B0R5gauQR4SJ9VDmw After reading the reviews I decided to give this hole in the wall  place a try on 12/10/16 and boy I'm glad I did. This may be the BEST Italian grinder I ever had. I ordered the classic Italian cold, no onions and the Italian dressing on the side, one word  DELICIOUS 
The bread is so fresh and the Italian dressing has that tangy kick to it! The service was prompt and friendly! 

EVERYONE should give this place a try, especially if you are from the East Coast and miss Italian grinders. I know they call it "classic" and I'm not sure what the original recipe for Italian grinders is, but I know back home they use different deli meat. It's similar but BETTER!!!
