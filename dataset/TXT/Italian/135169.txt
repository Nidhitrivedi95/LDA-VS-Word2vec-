Valenti's was amazing while it lasted. 

I can't believe anyone would rate Valenti's anything less than a 5. I love Valenties, a diamond in the rough. 
All of the menu items I've tried have been just fantastic. They have a brick oven to and make fantastic authentic Italian pizzas. Add salmon to whatever salad you order, they are always cooked to a perfected medium, crispy on the outside. 
Last but not least the oil and bread served with every meal. Oh the oil! I despise green olives I always have, this oil has minced green olives and it's amazing. 
The prices are reasonable. 
Table for 2 will run you about $30-$40 depending on your add-ons (appetizers, wine, etc).
