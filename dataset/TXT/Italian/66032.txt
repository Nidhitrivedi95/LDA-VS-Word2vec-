bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw After realizing that we were on a business trip on Valentine's Day, and finding a table for a nice dinner was virtually impossible, I finally came across Vivace. Now, don't get me wrong, they also were completely booked for Valentine's Day evening, however I was told the bar area that had high tops was a first-come-first-serve basis, so my mom, my boyfriend, and I decided to give it a shot. 

When we arrived, we were seated immediately in the bar area at a nice and cozy high top. Our server came over and got our drink order, as well as explained their special 4-course Valentine's Day menu for the night. My boyfriend and I decided to go with the special menu, since we agreed to pick different items so we could try multiple dishes. 

Course 1: Lamb Chops & Scallops
Course 2: Beet Ravioli & Lobster Bisque
Course 3: Roasted Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Pesto Sauce
                Grilled Salmon with Risotto and Pomegranate 
Course 4: Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse & Tiramisu

I was extremely happy, as was my tummy after this delicious meal! The food just exploded with flavor, and each bite was a party in your mouth. So glad I found Vivace and was able to experience such an amazing Valentine's Day dinner on such short notice.
