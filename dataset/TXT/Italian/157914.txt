lBNPDcSvmUbq7W69HvmRTA Do not order here.  Twice in 4 months I ordered a pizza online.  The delivery time came and went.  I called, and both times they said they had no record of the order.  Annoyed, I prepared another meal.  Then the delivery guy shows up with a cold pizza.  I called the manager the first time it happened, and he was very professional and tried to make it right.  The guy who answered the phone this time told me that he tells people not to order online OR TO ORDER BY PHONE!?!   How can you possibly run a business this way?  I'm disappointed, because my kids and I really like pizza hut.  It's just a crap shoot as to what you are going to get here.  My guess is if you order when the manager is there, things will be fine.  If not, have a backup plan.
