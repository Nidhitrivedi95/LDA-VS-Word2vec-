LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Looove this place! Came here with my coworkers and bestie for the Baker to Vegas annual run in 2011.  We sat on the balcony and the weather was perfect. I ordered a seafood pasta dish, i think it's called Linguine di Mare and tiramisu for dessert. Boy, everything was delicious especially the tiramisu!!! Service was great and it's located at the Fashion Show Mall (my other favorite place to visit while in Vegas).  

I also came back here this year, 2012, for lunch but the wait was too long and I was too hungry so I went downstairs to this Mexican spot.  I'll probably try the one in Orlando, Florida this week and the one on Santana Row in San Jose soon. I'll keep ya posted on each visit. Toddles, Yelpers! Try this spot and sit outside!!!!
