q3uuXi_U-Jqxsk5Nx1Iomw We had been meaning to try this place for a awhile and finally got around to it while we had a few friends over one night. The pizza here is legit! We had the Bomba pizza which was sweet and spicy in the best way possible! The pizza is very authentic and is right up there with my favourite place in the city, Pizzeria Libretto. The prices are high but still worth it. We loved the pizza so much that a couple hours later when our friends left we ordered another, will definitely try this place again!
