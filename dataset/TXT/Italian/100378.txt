fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w We had dinner here last night.  Close to our hotel and had good reviews. Dinner was nothing to write home about: beef stroganoff and turkey club.  It didn't break the bank, which was the shining star of our dinner. 

Maybe we ordered wrong, but it was basically a fancy Applebee's.  Meh.
