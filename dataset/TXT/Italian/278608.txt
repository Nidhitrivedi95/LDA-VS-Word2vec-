YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg When it comes to Italian dining, I'm usually cursed with strange happenings.  Well the curse strikes again.  We walked in with reservations so getting seated quickly wasn't an issue.  When the hostess asked if we wanted a table to booth, I said booth and we were sat at a table.  Ok.  No big deal.  I assume maybe she didn't hear me.  Then after our water was poured she asked if we could move to a booth since a 'regular' was coming in and wanted that table.  Again, no big deal since we wanted a booth to begin with.  We were there for a while and no one sat at the table we were moved from.  I think these things only happen to me.  Moving on...

I had ordered the Chicken and Asparagus Risotto.  I love risotto.  Their dinner portion is quite small comparatively.  I think they could have made this a bit more flavorful as well but it was ok.   My husband ordered the Lasagna  Bolognese.  It was delicious and put my meal to shame.  The flavor from the Italian Sausage was bursting.  I only had one bite but would be sure to order that next time.  

We had good and attentive service.  The dining area is dimly lit for dinner making a great ambiance.   Im hoping the curse will be broken for my next visit.
