Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA The seating was horrible, I was seated right next to large blocky column on the left and the walkway on the right at a very tiny table.  I felt like I had no room to move, the food was subpar. The fish was like sushi rolled in pepper and the calamari was cold it's like they pulled it out of a refrigerator. The sauce was just spicy and still tasted like black pepper. To top it off they added a tip to the bill that was overly generous. I actually wrote on the receipt how bad their service is. They have actually managed to trump Olive Garden for bad food and service they just charged more for it.
