lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ This place is straight up garbage... The pizzas are just ok. Honestly I would rather eat dominos that this place. My friend ordered the meatballs and wow is was like frozen meatballs overcooked and dump in sauce. Would not recommend this flavorless meal. Also we ordered both soups and they were both really disgusting. The Tuscan had wayyy too much Tabasco added into it, and I love Tabasco... The other soup was just flavorless. It was like drinking water. Honestly a waste of money. Go to the food court a little farther down and get something cheaper.
