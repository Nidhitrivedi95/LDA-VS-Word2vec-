exz9aZqMqjpqzUOFBAl9Gg Went for a group dinner with a pre set menu.
I chose the chicken florentine soup and the Bavette steak and fries.
Portovino's antipasto dish is always excellent, especially the calamari.
The soup was horrible, I left half in the bowl.
The Bavette was well cooked (medium) and the fries were decent.
As for dessert, the good chocolate cake came wayyyy before the (horrible tasting) coffee - big no no.
The service suffered due to their being other large groups.
