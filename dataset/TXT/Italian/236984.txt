tYbK94fl50os3h_RjpY4gw Being from the east coast I am very picky about my pizza. Sorry to say went here and had a slice. First of all the crust broke into four pieces. Then trying to eat it grease was dipping down my hand. I really wanted to like this place as it is so close to my house. Needless to say after two bites I threw it away.
