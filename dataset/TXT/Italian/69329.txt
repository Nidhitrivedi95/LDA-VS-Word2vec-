bVTWcZWhtJc4IjWy_74CYQ I ordered a lunch deal and asked the waitress if I could get a side of fruit. She said it wasn't available. My friend and her four year son were dining with me and when it was time to order the four year old's meal, the waitress asked if he wanted grapes. Are grapes not a fruit? Wth?!
