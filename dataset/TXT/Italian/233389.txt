TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q WOW! This IS the best pizza in Phoenix.
I personally am not a fan of thin crust BUT this place changed My mind.
We were going to get the thick crust until we noticed EVERY table had ordered the thin crust.
The sauce is AMAZING! We even bought some to take home.
The service was quite attentive as well.
The night we came they had beer specials. Hooray for specials!
I travel nationwide ALOT and have been on the quest for the best pizza in Phoenix for about 2 years now. THIS IS IT!
I just wish they delivered to My house. They did mention that several people order delivery outside the coverage area and meet them at a gas station (QT and circle K) to pick up pizza. 
Talk about going above and beyond for customer service.
WE WILL BE BACK and bringing more friends next time.
Like that it was LGBTQ friendly.
Thanks Spinato's!
