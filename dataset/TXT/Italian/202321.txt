q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ I love this place!
Me and my boyfriend came here because he loves Italian food, and he's very picky.
First impression, I didn't know what to expect. I'll leave it at that, because it's honestly better to experience it first hand. Inside the decor was nice, dim lit but romantic. 

The ambience was like old-school Vegas, like what you would see in those old gangsta mob movies. I really enjoyed it. There was a guy who sang old school Vegas songs. I was in love, with the ambience, food, and my partner. It was pure magic. I would like to come here again. Hint, hint to my boyfriend. lol ;)
