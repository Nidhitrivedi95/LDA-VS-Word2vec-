Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw Went in because my girlfriend was next door getting her nails done next door and wanted to snack on something so happy I  did.  Definitely one of the top 5 Pizza places I've been to on the west with a lot of East coast flavor . A pizzeria is always defined by the basic pies Margherita and  pepperoni they definitely hit the nail on the head with these I was blown away. Definitely reminded me of living on the east coast and NY. So glad I walked in . Also lady behind was great chat . Service was quick and prompt .
