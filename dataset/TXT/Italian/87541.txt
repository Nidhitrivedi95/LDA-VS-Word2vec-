dWliPaP9k43hSKGSujNFXg I'm really sad to write this. I have been to this restaurant SO many times and every time before this it has been great food and great service. But tonight was terrible. Chris M., a young blonde kid with an attitude and no manners was our server.  He was very short, rude and forgot that he is in the business of customer service. I ordered the Italian Cobb salad. I assumed this was a dinner salad and that it would be brought out with the rest of my friend's dinners...but no. I was brought my giant dinner salad (without the chicken) when everyone else was getting their side salads. Then 10 minutes later I was handed a plate of chicken. And guess what? It was cold and salty! I told my waiter and he gave a confused look and did not apologize. I then asked for salmon instead and 20 minutes later after everyone was don't eating I got a small burnt piece of salmon.  Icing on the cake? They didn't take anything off the bill, no apology and when I told the female manager about what happened she proceeded to argue with me and ask me to hand her the box of my food that I barely touched. Not sure what has happened to Picollos but it went to being one of my favorite Italian restaurants to being one of the worst.
