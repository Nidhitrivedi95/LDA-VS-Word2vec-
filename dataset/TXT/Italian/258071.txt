w3qgHBMr-71i8icNonTEyQ I will never order delivery from here again! Called and they put me on hold without a "hello"! Called back and they couldn't even find my order & when they finally did they said it was on the way. No it was not! It took over an hour to get my pizza and they are just down the street! I am immobilized at home after right foot surgery. I hate ordering food for delivery for this reason!
