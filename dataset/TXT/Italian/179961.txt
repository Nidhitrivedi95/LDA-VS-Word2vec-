nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A We had a very nice family dinner with my parents at Buddy V's restaurant. We shared the appetizers family style - Cesar salad with yummy polenta croutons, calamari fritti and scrumptioius Grandma's meatballs.  

We had the following entrees:
1) Linguine with clams
2) Mediterranean sea bass
3) Grilled salmon
4) Chicken Parm
5) Classic cheese pizza

For dessert, we had the butterscotch creme brulee with vanilla mascarpone cream, pecan nib shortbread and the apple pie with caramel cinnamon apples, oatmeal & raisin crubmle and vanilla ice cream. The dessert menu was in a mini photo album with shared memories of Buddy growing up and his family. Overall it was delicious authentic Italian food, fresh pasta and flavorful meatballs, chicken and seafood. The service was excellent.
