Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA Mediocre at best.. went there since it was in NY/NY and we were staying there.  Hungry and in the mood for Italian we went in... Service was good, the bread was awesome..

Vegetable pizza dry, and without much flavor...  The swordfish was pretty good but again not much flavor.. keep in mind we had just arrived in Vegas and were hungry and tired and excited and didn't have any alcohol in our system... to me this is the time I would eat and enjoy just about anything!!... it was still mediocre at best..  

Wouldn't recommend it and definitely not going to eat there again.
