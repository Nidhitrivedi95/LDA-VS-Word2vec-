p_22wrx3GmAzlbrGA6LyYg I've been here a few times and its not a bad place. The only issue I have with them, is that the customer service could be better. They didn't greet us when we walked in, and they stood there looking at us. All of them. Didn't ask us what we wanted to order,just stood there. it was pretty rude. 

The pizza (while greasy) was great. Highly recommend the margherita pizza, with pepperoni and sausage added (extra 3 bucks).
