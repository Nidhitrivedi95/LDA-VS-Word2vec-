0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw Joe's has been hit and miss over the last year for me. Some days they knock it out of the park with some of the food. Then the next time its average and there is a problem. So it gets 3 stars instead of a solid 4.  It does get crowded at the typical feeding hours, especially weekends. Plan ahead as the wait for food can be over 45 minutes.  Problems I've had, filled wrong order for to go, got home and found it was wrong and overcharged for what I did get. It was resolved by manager on the phone but still frustrating.  Another time my food sat for 20 minutes before they got around to paging me. Very frustrating. The flies have returned, I eat inside and am still constantly brushing them away from my food, I just cover food with a napkin until I get to it.  Some staff are wearing shirts with anti fly logos, but they don't seem to be doing much fly eradicating.  Address the fly issue. I worked on a horse farm and there are ways to discreetly address fly issues.  
Good things: the fried zucchini and onion rings are great.  The Chicken Farm salad is great when they get it right. However I've noticed the chicken serving seems to have gotten smaller. The beets are a good addition to the other veggies in the salad.  Milk shakes are good too, they do offer special flavors often.
