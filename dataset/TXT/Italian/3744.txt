_d76h17SjTnEq20u42Wwwg I had the Breakfast Burger and I loved it. You get so much food and a really small bill. The fish fry during lent is phenomenal and will explode off your plate it's so big. New kitchen staff is much more friendly and consistent that past regimes. Hope they stay for a long time!! Great local hangout.
