w3h2_nxxqnmxZZaaQi2Pag We were certainly happy to have found a nice place like Saras not too far from us until we experienced service the other day.
First of all service is not consistent. You are either lucky and have a friendly and good server or you end up with one who does not seem to care at all or on top charges you food and drinks you never had! We called them to correct that ( please understand it is not about the amount it is only about the fact that this should not happen and we don't have the time to check the bill)
but they had all kinds of explanations. For what? Listen, I did not have the salad or the wine you charged me! 
Nobody had the courtesy to correct that. Well this way I do not feel appreciated and certainly will make different choices for lunch and for dinner next time as you guys obviously don't need any additional business!
