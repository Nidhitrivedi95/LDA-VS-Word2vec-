hVzRXGGhRJfTXIasO3bq1w I used to work on State and went to Zas a handful of times, maybe 4, tops. The first time my food took forever to come, but I figured I would cut them some slack because they seemed busy.

The last time? I ordered a salad with sprouts as one of the ingredients. When I got the salad, the sprouts were literally wilted and brown. Obviously spoiled. I was like uh... this doesn't look fresh at all. I mean who back there went "Yes, these look fine. I will serve these to.someone." When I pointed this out, the guy behind the counter asked "Did you want sprouts?"

...???

No. That's why I ordered them.

Then what did he do? Picked the wilted sprouts off my salad and put fresh ones on. I walked out without eating. You didn't just seriously try to serve me a dish that had been topped with potentially spoiled food, did you?

Its bad enough they served me the original salad in the first place, but their fix? Just... wow.
