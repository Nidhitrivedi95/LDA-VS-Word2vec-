i53HvxUdQEMllZ1XmpjjyA I ordered one large pizza,chicken wings and coke. I paid with credit card already But the deliever man forgot to bring my chicken wings. So I called them you goys miss the chicken wings. And they said they will gonna keep it for me for next order.cause i already paid. However,when I try to order pizza later,they was like what the hell you talking about?. They acts like WE DON'T KNOW YOU&your chicken wings. I wasted my $10
