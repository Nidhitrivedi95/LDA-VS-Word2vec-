8RxwEbhxRResGQUwsZujAw this is one of my favorite breakfast spots in all of madison. it looks like it's right out of new york, but has such a great european flavor. their almond french toast (i can't remember the exact name, and surprisingly, it's not listed on their menu online) is INCREDIBLE. everytime i'm in madison on a saturday or sunday morning, i want to be here. 

the hostess on those mornings is phenomenol. and the waitstaff is incredibly friendly and helpful. i LOVE it.
