9XLH_grfIYKR7d5ZT9ZX_A Melanie's has a simple, delicious menu.  The service is consistently on target.   The daily soup specials are interesting and perfectly crafted.  The garden salad changes slightly from day to day to reflect available veggies...also delicious.  And always fresh. We have been here several times for lunch or brunch and everything hits the spot.   We will be back for dinner. 

"Melanie" (or the owner) is gracious, professional and always checks in with patrons to ensure they are satisfied.  

Our go to favourite lunch is the curry chicken wrap ... One of my favourite lunches anywhere in the city.  

The restaurant is comfortable and casual and if the venue had a more unique character this would be a five star review all the way.  

One of the best on the danforth for sure.


So shortly after posting this review, we went here for dinner.   OMG    Dinner is ten times as good as lunch.   The food is fresh and delicious and the plates are perfectly paired.  Flawlessly presented.  And clearly prepared with great skill. 

I had the shrimp linguine - an instant new favourite for me.  My wife had the salmon.   Both of us raved about our experience.  I truly would have licked the plate if I were alone.   

Unbelievably good food.  Friendly.  Simple.   Honest.   Tasty.  And dessert??? Prepared in house.   Off the charts.   

Decor still needs an overhaul.   A 10k face lift would totally change the experience.   But I'm upping my rating to five stars despite this.   The food and service are just that good.
