VXKIx4WUGw3jNad0BOcFYQ Years ago I ordered from this place and did not like anything I received.  The store was re-branded and possibly under new management or ownership so I thought I would give it another try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only do their hoagies have great value, the pizza was good as well.  Their rolls appear to be bought but their pizza dough appears to be made in-house.  I will definitely be ordering from here again.

I am not sure why other reviewers say they are over-priced.  A 13" $8 Italian hoagie?  I just checked 5 nearby Italian joints that I order from and their Italian costs:  16" 9.99, 15" 11.99, 16" 9.99, 13" 9.99, 16" 10.54.  And 75 cents for toppings on a large?  That's a good deal when the guy right down the street charges $1.50...

Good job, you got a new customer!
