4gXdyihRiytmXEAfqLNMBw We are currently here now. Reservations were for 6:00. It's my daughters 13th birthday. We didn't get seated until 6:25. Didn't get to order until 6:45. My father in law ordered lasagna. He was told it would take 35-40 minutes. It's now 7:35. My sister in law asked for her salad right away. It's nowhere in site. Service is just atrocious.

Update. It's 8:00 and we're still here. Our server has been nothing but rude. My father in law was actually told "one question at a time". I asked him about our appetizer and he told me it would "come out when it's ready" and proceeded to explain how their oven worked. I spoke with the manager and all she could tell me was that it's backed up in the kitchen and sorry for the server. Then she disappeared and never even bothered to check back on us. Sad thing is the food is actually pretty decent. It's a shame the service ruined this experience for my daughter.
