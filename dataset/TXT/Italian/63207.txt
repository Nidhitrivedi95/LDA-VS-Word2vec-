B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw This is a perfect place to WOW a friend from out of town! The wine on tap and tantalizing menu will keep impress and satisfy everyone.
We started with hefty portions of wine by the ounce because, well, why not? The mushroom fungi bruschetta was our app of choice and with absolutely no regrets. She ordered the pumpkin ravioli and absolutely LOVED IT and I (and every other diner beside me) opted for the Friday night special. So good. I'm still thinking about that braised beef...
Finishing off with more wine and an Americano was the perfect way to end the meal. 
The restaurant was bumping and service was superb. I definitely recommend a visit and will most likely be back soon.
