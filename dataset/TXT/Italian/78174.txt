CZY3743GpOOhdDJu6UmPBA Came here Saturday lunch hoping to have summerlicious but was told they don't have it on weekends during a nch (dinner only). It would be nice if this info is indicated somewhere...So people would know ahead of time. We waited for about 20 -30min. However, the 2 items we got were tasty, especially liked the flat bread with tomato and cheese in the middle. This place is on the pricy side for the amount of food it provides.
