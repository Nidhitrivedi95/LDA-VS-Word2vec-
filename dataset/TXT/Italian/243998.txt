USGPIHHLH-5Q8CvSEvLXYA First of all, I am very skeptical about caffé lucano's cake (for more information on Edinburgh's mysterious homogenous cake, please check out my review of the elephant house). Aside from this, it's quite expensive, and the price only becomes reasonable after 3pm when all cakes become half price.

I have only ever tried the pizza here, which my non-Italian and Italian friends and I concluded was more like a biscuit than pizza. It was kind of nice, if you didn't think of it as pizza, though for the price it was very small, and the topping was too sparse. I have heard hit and miss reviews of the food here, some people have said it's a great place to get breakfast whilst others have said the pasta is cooked to death and they could make better food at home. For the same price I would rather go to Victoria across the road where you can get homemade pasta.

The staff are usually attentive, though this is very hit and miss. I have had very pleasant and very poor experiences here, though I have decided to disregard the latter in this review as I haven't seen the people involved working here since.

The coffee is this place's saviour. As well as decent Italian espresso, cappuccinos etc, Caffe Lucano is one of the only coffee shops in town to provide us with affogato (which literally means drowned, and consists of a scoop of vanilla ice cream immersed in an espresso coffee). I have this in Italy when it's hot and I need an energy boost... Try it! The coffees come with a little caramel biscuit, which is really quite a nice touch.

To sum up, this has a great location, right near the royal mile and the University of Edinburgh. I really like the coffee, the food not so much. I think this place could improve by making its own cakes, and offering locals and Italian expats with some Italian foods that you just don't find in the UK, like cornetti alla crema, polenta, piadine and thick Italian hot chocolate.
