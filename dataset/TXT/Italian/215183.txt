I don't know why all these reviewers complain about the price. I think it was pretty reasonable for a nice Italian restaurant - and not bad compared to Vegas strip prices. Wine selection was fairly good. Appetizers and desserts were really good. Coconut cake was amazing! I had the signature pasta. It's fun to order, but I probably won't get it again. It's kind of a simple, kids dish. My husband had the veal Marsala and loved it.
