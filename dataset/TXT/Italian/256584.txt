w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q I love coming to this restaurant. I make sure I come every time I come to Las Vegas. I also go to the location in Charlotte a few times a year, but I absolutely love the Palm in Vegas. 

It's so nice to sit in one of the seats on the outside area to watch all the people walking by in the Forum. They have great food here. 

This trip I got the 9 oz Filet Mignon and the Whipped Potatoes. The steak was cooked just right and the whipped potatoes were awesome. 

I was also on a big time crunch, so my server made sure I got my food quickly and he got me out in plenty of time. 

Definitely a good place to come when you're in Vegas!
