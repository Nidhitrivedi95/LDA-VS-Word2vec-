skQ-HIR664Ivp2-A4kOfnA Decided to try them the other night since they are around the corner from the house.  Delicious food, quick service, an overall good experience.  We sampled the sausage lasagna, the veal parmesan, and fettuccine alfredo. I thought the food was quite good.  A decent if not small wine list.

I noticed another Yelper made a comment about "Pedestrian at best" and that his son who has "restaurant experience and is now attending a premier culinary school, pronounced the sauce as something from a can".  My father in law is Italian and makes his own sauces from scratch, so I am pretty sure that is not the case.  No offense to them, however if "that garden place" was Olive Garden then that says it all. Of course everyone is entitle to their opinion.  Personally I will go back the next time I am looking for Italian food.
