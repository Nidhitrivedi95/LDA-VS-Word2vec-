oCULDH0GWWLM4GdLSt0Huw First of all, best dang tiramisu I've ever had. Went after I had gotten off work so it was close to closing but they still graciously sat us and received great service. We shared the mussels as an app and I literally had to ask the waitress to take them away because I was eating the sauce with a fork. I had the veal and it was literally perfect. Nice and juicy and tender. The sauce was perfect with it and the prosciutto balanced it amazingly. I could also eat those potatoes every day. My boyfriend had the chicken and he says the same thing about his.  Will we be back? You can most certainly count on it. It's delicious and a fantastic date night. Can't wait to try something new soon!
