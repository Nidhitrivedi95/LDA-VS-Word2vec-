klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw Absolutely wonderful. Went in with a group of friends and were amazed with the food and service. I can be a tough critic, considering I am a fine dining restaurant manager, and could not find a single thing wrong! Bartenders were some of the funniest I have had the opportunity to sit with. General Manager was very gracious and helpful. Would recommend to anyone!
