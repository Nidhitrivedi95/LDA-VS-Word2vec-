KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ Amazing food and service. This will be a pricey meal if you go, but save up your money and give it a shot. Definitely one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. We dressed "casual" (I had a button up shirt, shorts and dirty sneakers on) and dined in with no problems in regards to dress code.

I recommend:

Antipasto
Meatballs
Fusilli w/ Sausage & Cabbage (my favorite)
Orecchiette w/ Broccoli Rappe & Sausage
