PJVjfGtVc71M0XlUr83teQ It seems like there are a growing number of these ready to make pizza restaurants recently which is definitely not a bad thing! Although the pizza was quite good, the garlic knots were the real winner in my opinion and the marinara sauce included really complimented the garlic knots. The service was friendly especially the guy who was making my pizza at the time had a great attitude, forgot his name though.

If I didn't live so far from the location I would stop by more often, though I may have to try out the Tempe location sometime. They do have some deals going on every now and then so I'll probably come back at some point in time.
