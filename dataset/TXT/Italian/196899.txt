POJL-N7Smw1UZMP_xldFwg A Perfect 3 star all around! The service was OK, pretty cold but not to the extreme. The two Pastas we ordered were OK not more not less, just if you'll prepare them at home when you don't really have the time to invest in our food.
In different circumstances I would give them a second chance but as they are neighbors with Mr. Laffa, it's hard for me to see myself going... ummmm lets eat some OK pasta and not a BOMB of a Shawarma!
