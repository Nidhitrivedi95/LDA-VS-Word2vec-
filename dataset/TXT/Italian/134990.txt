IT0IODInyhKbG4a_ka71MQ The owners of Oregano's should be consultants in how to run a pizza+ place.  As soon as a new location is opened it instantly is busy.  While most businesses fail in the first couple years,  they have to be profitable very quickly.

So, what's the secret?   The design of each restaurant is somewhat eclectic.   Most other pizza  places are some version of  a  cookie  cutter. Not so with Oregano's.  That is great, but that is not THE secret.

The elusive secret is the great food, prepared correctly every time in a reasonable time by people who really look like they like their jobs.   

Sad to say this seems to be unusual these days.  It ain't rocket science folks,  although it appears to be the exception rather than the rule.

Follow their formula and you might have success like they have earned. 

BTW.  Unless you are lucky, you will have a wait.  It's well worth it, however.
