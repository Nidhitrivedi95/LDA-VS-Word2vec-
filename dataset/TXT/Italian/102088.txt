FfF8XGFf8_BSlWSjIgqeQg I don't get the hype of this place. Food is subpar- tastes like my mom's cooking, and she's neither Italian nor a great cook lol. 

So it was four of us. We ordered a main of spaghetti and meatballs, a Tuscan salad, a margarita pizza, and dessert if a chocolate toffee jar cake. We were ridiculously underwhelmed, especially by the pizza, which was bland, and the spaghetti and meatballs, which wasn't exceptional. The Tuscan salad was ok. The chocolate toffee jar cake was the biggest waste of money ever. Tasted like box cake. Will not be returning.
