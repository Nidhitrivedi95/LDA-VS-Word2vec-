iqntlaqSCB4hkzTzlPlEmQ Meh... Nothing spectacular. Me and my husband came here for our anniversary, we ordered their Pasta Fra Diavolo and it was alright. Nothing to write home about. The waitress we had gave me attitude when I showed her the Yelp check-in free appetizer and that soured my mood instantaneously. Our daughter came with us on our anniversary dinner (lack of a babysitter) and ordered a salad and spaghetti. They brought her the wrong salad and when they finally brought out the right one, it came out with main dish so it was wasted.. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the dessert trio was on FLEEK! My favorite part of the entire experience. But all in all, if we want Italian we are better off just going to Olive Garden.
