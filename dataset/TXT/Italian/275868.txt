YbfLTLKM7EGKBGNKhL8azQ I went here for my friend's bachelorette dinner and was so pleased! Staff was very accommodating for our large party. Service was outstanding! Our wait staff was so personable and hilarious! We had had a wonderful time. Our party of 12 ordered various dishes. Perfect portions and there's something for everyone. There's a vast selection of wine. I don't think you can go wrong if you're looking for great food and quiet setting to catch up. Great for both small and big groups. Overall, ambience is fantastic and the service was outstanding!
