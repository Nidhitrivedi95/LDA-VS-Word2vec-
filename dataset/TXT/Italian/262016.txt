wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg It seems North Italia gets rather busy and you generally won't be able to find a place to park, forcing you to use valet. 

The inside of North is an open concept environment. You can see each and every person sitting at their table as well as at the bar. Due to the atmosphere, I wouldn't recommend North for a romantic date simply because it's noisy and there's no privacy. However, this would make a decent setting for a fun and social get together.

After ordering our entrees, it took quite some time for them to come out. Unfortunately, the wait was not worth our food being undercooked and my date getting sick from her meal.

I'll give North one more shot to redeem my initial experience.
