ataRn8s6owt3SObGajp4KQ Brooklyn South has become a Cornelius mainstay for pizza.  Then again, any place in Cornelius older than 1yr is a mainstay.

Atmosphere- Open.  Kind of like a skilodge, due to the fireplace in the center of the restaurant.  The place also has a nice, tree lined, outdoor eating area w/ enough trees to have you forget that you are near a busy road.

Service - I have been here a few times but last night I realized how odd the order setup process is to me.  I guess maybe it is normal to go to a counter, order, take your street sign (g/f did the carrying...I am not carrying a street sign) to your table and wait for the server to bring your food.  I do not know but for how nice the inside is you think it would be a little more wait staff oriented.

Food - Great!  I think they have the tastiest pizza south of the Mason Dixon line.  We ordered the NY Style, big thin slices, we had topped w/mushrooms, pepperoni and black olives.  We also got side salads w/ romaine lettuce, tomato, carrot and onion.  I normally get the Sicilian Style because I think it is even better than the NY Style (I like the thick, bread like crust).  The sauce on both styles has a pleasant mild spicy flavor that is slightly salty w/sections of tomatoes giving the sauce a nice texture. 

Overall - I really enjoy Brooklyn South as it is the most Northern style pizza place that I have found in the New South.
