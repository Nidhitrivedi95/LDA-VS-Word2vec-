knyRhFaM4Bwa8AldEbOiqw I have never had anything less than a great experience with Barro's! The location closest to my current home has always been perfect; there is nothing I could complain about! Food, service, and delivery drivers are exceptional and I recommend this place to everyone! My most recent experience was 10 minutes prior to closing and 'Lauren' took my order at the Scottsdale/Greyhawk location and she was friendly, knowledgeable, and kind. I appreciate good, friendly service and places like my Barro's deserve more positive reviews! Yelp reviewers who use foul language and choose to personally attack employees should not ever be listened to.
Thank you again for the prompt and exceptional service!
