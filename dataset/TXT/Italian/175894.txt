NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ This is the best kept secret in Las Vegas.  Quite literally the best Italian food I have eaten outside of Italy.  Great Flavors, family friendly and family oriented, and absolutely fantastic wait staff.  I live 45 minutes away and make the journey across town at least once a month for delicious dishes and delectable desserts.  Have never had anything from this restaurant that didn't exceed my expectations.
