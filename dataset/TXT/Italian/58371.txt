I called on a Sunday night and was told it would be 90 minutes before I could come pick it up. I arrived right on time, and my pizza & garlic bread were pulled from an under-the-counter heater and handed over. 

Clearly, I'm starving having had to wait so long until dinner so I'm pretty excited to pull the pizza out of the box and get it on to the plate once I make it back home. Though when I lifted the lid, the excitement fizzled. The pizza did not look fresh, and when I pulled out the first thin crust slice it fell limp and nearly slid itself back into the box. That was worrisome so I carefully transfered a few more squares over, then opened the foil for the garlic bread. More sogginess, and by the looks of the bread it may have been placed under my pizza box inside the pizza-kryptonite heater. Adding insult to injury, the pizza was cool! I actually had to put it in the microwave less than 10 minutes after picking it up. Seriously?!

The first bite of both were equally disappointing. It was hard to handle the pizza squares because they were so limp/soggy, and when I folded it in half the topping separated from the crust as if it had been placed there as a late afterthought. Thin crust pizza should be CRISPY! It doesn't qualify as "thin crust" just because the crust is thin! And I've had better garlic bread come with a frozen dinner.

Very disappointed. 1 - If my pizza had been ready earlier than they told me to arrive, they should have called me. They took my number when I placed the order. 2 - The phrase "Chicago-Style Pizza" should be regulated like organic and kosher. It's clearly being abused by this establishment. Next time I'll satisfy my craving in the frozen section of the grocer.
