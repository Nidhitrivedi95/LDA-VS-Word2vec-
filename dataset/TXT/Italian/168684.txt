MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg I was with norton around looking for some food and found that. Did hesitate to enter as this really look weirdly small from outside and wasn't sure what is inside. What is? Well a small really comfy place to eat with really nice service. Waiter was really nice and had a quite a chat though lasagne didn't taste that good (I mean I didn't like SF burgers, so you have picture how do I find American food). Definitely service and mood inside this place are great.
