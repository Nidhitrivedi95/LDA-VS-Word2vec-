The husband and I went here on a whim, we were looking for a patio, we were looking for something a step up from Utopia/Cafe Diplomatico and we stopped here.

Inside, it's very swanky, outside, there is a great patio where you can watch the goings ons on College or at the patio of Cafe Diplomatico.

The service was great, the guy was friendly, funny and quick (it probably didn't hurt that we were one of two tables in the place at 6:30pm). 

We started with Crispy Shrimp appetizer, which was 5 large pieces of shrimp, panko breaded and served with a horseradish aioli. I LOVED it. Nathan had a lamb burger, which he thoroughly enjoyed, with fries that I thoroughly enjoyed. I had lamb chops, which were a little bland, but came with a fantastic grape tomato/olive/red onion salad. The salad was probably my favourite thing on the place.

Altogether, a nice dining experience. I liked the fact that they had a small menu, it makes me think that they might actually put some thought and seasonality into what they make. A little pricier than what we were hoping for, but worth it.
