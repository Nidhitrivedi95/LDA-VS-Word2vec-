YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg I had been looking forward to eating here for almost a year. I'm a vegetarian and the vegetarian menu enticed me. Let me tell you I was let down from the service to the food. The dishes were bland and uneventful. Every one seemed to have the same plain red sauce on various dishes. The sauce tasted as if it came out of a jar. The service was slow, our waiter forgot cocktails and did not explain specials to us. He did not offer cracked pepper for our salads and I had to ask the busser for it. I would expect this caliber of service at IHOP or Fridays, not a fine dining restaurant. I had family in town and they were disappointed as well. In fact nobody at our table enjoyed dinner. We brought this up to the manager who did offer us free food which we declined because by now we were ready to leave. They did not take anything off of our bill. We had a plethora of food left over at the end that we were going to take home to the dogs but decided just to throw in the garbage. More than anything I was disappointed because I was looking forward to eating here for so long.
