PmwKGY3HLpcnC_-g0NCIvQ Came here for dinner with 5 people this time, so hoping the experience was better.  The food was good for me but on the pricey side for the amount of food I got.  I got the baked pasta (Alfredo with chicken) and a piece of un-toasted bread.  Two people from our group wanted the gyro meat well-well done.  They said they could do it.  When the gyro dinner plates came out, they looked like they were shaved off and served.  We return 1 of the plates to make sure the meat was well done.  It came back barely touching any heat.  So the person in our group didn't eat all at.  =(  The service was friendly but lacking.  Not sure if the server was not doing her job or was new at it?
