WLixYfXWO1Q0b_L4PsQ-5w Best Italian comfort food buffet in Pittsburgh. The real deal. Looks like a location for a Martin Scorsese movie.  They have regular menu-order items but I only go for lunch to have the buffet with its somewhat revolving dishes . The meat-balls are amazing. Chicken parm/marsala pure oral delight .
  Try it, if you haven't .  *note - they raised the lunch buffet price to $11 as of January, 2016 .*
