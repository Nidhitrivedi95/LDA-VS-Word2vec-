D6RDpCS1lfgZdPuLHlpsHA Went here for lunch.  I had one of the specials of the day, the seafood cannelloni.  My husband had the baked ziti.  We started out our meals with a nice cheesy foccacia-like bread with olive oil + parmesan cheese dipping mixture.  Our entrees were quickly made and came minutes after being ordered, which was nice since we only had a limited amount of time for lunch.  The seafood cannelloni was just one large tube of pasta, filled with crab, scallops, and shrimp.  The sauce was decent, a creamy tomato mixture.  However, the pasta tasted rubbery, and the shrimp was overcooked and tough.  My husband's ziti was pretty good though.  It was a large amount of pasta, with a nicely browned mozzarella topping.  The sauce itself had a nice smokey flavor to it, and the pasta was perfectly al-dente.  Service was good.  Drinks were refilled promptly as needed.

So, a mixed experience here.  I'd definitely come here again for some fresh pasta dishes, but I'll pass on the cannelloni.
