tkQyffM9YCGBTnyl7Rxo5A I really wanted to love this place, but sadly, I didn't.

First, the good:
1) Service - prompt and friendly
2) Awesome music - they played classic rock the day we visited
3) Great outdoor patio
4) Prices are very reasonable
5) Plentiful parking

Now, the not-so-good:
1) Pizza...the most important reason for going - I ordered the margherita pizza, while my hubby ordered the supreme-style Italian pie combination. My margherita pizza was too wet (from the fresh Roma tomatoes, NOT oil), and covered in far too many dried herbs. Usually, this type of pizza is made from crushed tomatoes, and the addition of the herbs was the final straw that ruined it for me. My hubby did, however, like his pizza, but it was also covered in these herbs. 
2) It's freezing cold indoors, hence our move to the much more comfortable patio outside.

So, this place is off my list for pizza. If my hubby decides he wants to give them another try, I'll definitely go the pasta route the next time.
