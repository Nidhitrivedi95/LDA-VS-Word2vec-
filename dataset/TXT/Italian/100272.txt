fAlKTsfsUF6A5iujEI2Z1w Off the strip has great service, an unbelievable bar, and a 24 hour kitchen that would stand up against any strip location. Honestly this is one of the hidden gems of the LINQ project. The food is good, the people are great, and the atmosphere is perfect!

The bar at Off The Strip couldn't be better and Clint the bartender will take care of any customer coming in as good or better than anyone on the strip.
