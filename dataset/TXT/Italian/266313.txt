x4aHNNo1osWNCB75q_PijQ After seeing SOI 4 (Thai place in the same complex) was nearly empty at 8pm on a Friday night (never a good sign), my boyfriend and I stumbled upon Pomo Pizzeria. This was the best "stumble upon" I've had in a long time! 

We sat outside at the bar, which made for great people watching. The three bartenders were all very friendly, but Shelly really stood out, taking the time to learn and remember our names. She offered her recommendations and since we'd never been there before, we took them! We started with the meatball appetizer. The flavor of the meatballs and sauce were great, although the meatballs weren't very hot. Another minute or two on the heat would have been great. 

For our entrees, we decided to split a pizza and a pasta. Great decision! For the pizza we selected the Principe: prosciutto, arugula, and parmesan. EXCELLENT.  I can't recall the name of the pasta dish we had, but it was homemade pasta with sausage and rosemary in a tomato cream sauce. SO GOOD. A bit on the salty side (and I love salt) but not offensive. I imagine if some one isn't big on salt they wouldn't like it, though. The pasta was perfectly cooked and had a great bite to it. 

Shelly, knowing it was our first time there, surprised us with dessert: the most amazing panna cotta I have ever had. Creamy, not overly sweet, and the perfect amount of vanilla. YUM. 

We love trying new restaurants and with so many in Scottsdale it's easy not to go to the same place twice. However, we had such a great meal here that will will absolutely put this into regular rotation!
