FclR3tCyp3wPCZoxHXn_jQ I have to confess, I've only been once. Generally, I try to go to a place at least twice before I write a review, but I still think about that Italian beef and that must mean something. I stopped by and got carry out one afternoon. The place is very open, bright and clean. The girl at the counter was really helpful as I hadn't been before so I asked for a recommendation. You can always tell if the employees like the food because when you ask what they like best, there's a hesitation. Without any hesitation she said, "Breaded steak or chicken sandwich." I decided to go with the Italian beef because 1) I've had good Italian beef and 2) I love Italian beef. The wait wasn't long and when I got the bag with my sandwich in it, it was like a pile of bricks. I was salivating all the way home. I'm not sure if it was meant to be dipped or it was just the delicious juices dripping from the sandwich and soaking into the roll, but yowza did it look and smell delicious when I unwrapped it. Biting in was about what I anticipated, it was tender and juicy and everything meat should be. The only complaint, and I use the word loosely because it could easily be an artistic decision, is that the giardiniera veggies were in huge pieces. I like a really small cut giardiniera so that it blends like a proper accoutrement. However, I'm not from Chicago, maybe that's how some people do it there. Other than that the sandwich was fantastic and far too big to eat in one meal. That's most of the reason I haven't been back, I know I need to go on a free day when I'm really hungry. So, if big sandwiches are your thing, this is a good place to go.
