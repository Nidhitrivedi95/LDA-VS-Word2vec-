hgQOESYp7CF4LnNI90XEiw Disclaimer: service and restaurant as a whole get 5 stars, but the food gets 4. 

Premium ingredients, clean restaurant, comfortable environment, and exceptional and speedy service. First time here and we loved it. Custom pizza and truffle cheese bread was pretty average. The gelato was really good and not overwhelmingly sweet. Will recommend chocolate and dolce de leche - most popular ones. 

Ranch lovers beware: they ain't got no ranch.
