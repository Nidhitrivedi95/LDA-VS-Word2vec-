bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg There was a Groupon for Due Forni, and I had to jump on it. I mean, who doesn't love discounts and most importantly, pizza? My boyfriend and I ordered the the Panzanella (arugalla) salad and the Neopolitan style Maiale Bolgnese pizza. The salad had a nice crunch from the ground pistachios, and the tomatoes were sweet, fresh, and juicy. 

The pizza here is definitely not your standard take-out pizza. All of the pizzas here are 12 inches. The dough is light and chewy, and it tasted a slight bit like sourdough. Nevertheless, as a big fan of crust, I gobbled it right down. The pizza was slightly wet when picking it up, but it didn't seep through the crust. You definitely have to use two hands to eat it or use a fork. 

Overall, the experience here was pretty good with friendly customer service. Without the Groupon, I think the prices are a bit steep. If they lowered their prices a little, I think I would be more inclined to visit again.
