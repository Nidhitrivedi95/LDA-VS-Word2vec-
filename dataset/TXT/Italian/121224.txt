HaPwC4nxs6RPfe1pAQkQ4A The hostess was completely incompetent.  We arrived promptly for our reservation. Our dining companions were a few minutes late. There was one other party waiting to be seated. She seated that party and then everything stopped while the waiting area completely filled up. There were plenty of open tables but for some reason she wouldn't seat parties unless everyone was there. Even the full parties didn't get seated while she stared endlessly at the seating chart as if in a trance. 

Except for one group that walked in and she immediately kissed them and whisked them past the huge throng to their table! Pissing everyone else off. 

She assured everyone that their tables were available and being held but inexplicably wouldn't proceed with seating. Is this Outback? Even Outback is more efficient. The food was pretty good with a few missteps. Carpaccio special was excellent as was the Boston chowder. Clam pasta was gritty with the clams obviously not being cleaned thoroughly. 
So sad that by time we were seated we were irritated and cranky. How could any restaurant overcome that start?
