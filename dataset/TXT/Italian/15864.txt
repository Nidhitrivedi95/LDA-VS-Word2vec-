1UmZSifNBsygSWzbfKiAew Grand Opening.......Grand Closing probably isn't that far behind.  I hate to be harsh because I had such high hopes for this restaurant. The spaghetti was just, "ok."  The salad was yellow and the dressing tasted like some cheap dressing from the grocery store.  The meatballs were good...Not great but good.  I am so disapointed because we really do need some good restaurants in this area.
