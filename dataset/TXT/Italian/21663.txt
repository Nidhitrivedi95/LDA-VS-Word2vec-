3b4efqz06QrLQ_w2xLc4pA Went here the other night, had a small wait time and was then led to our table. 

Didn't really care for the table itself as it had a support stand that wouldn't let the chair given fully sit under the table, so it was a little ackward to get used to.

The waiter seemed new at his job, brought us out breadsticks and menus. As we ordered our drinks we looked the menu over and we waited a bit for him to come back. We finished our first drink when we had placed our orders. He said he would bring refills but that didn't come until after our food arrived, by another waiter who was asked by our original to get it for us.

My husband enjoyed his food, I felt my own dish was lacking in sauce and it seemed a little dry, in comparison to the sister restaurant at Arrowhead. 

Rest of the meal was fine though.
