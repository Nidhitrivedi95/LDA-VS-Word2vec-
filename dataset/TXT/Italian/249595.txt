vk-H15Ags7RQo0HiohTUfw Customer Service ---The big X!  Timely --- X!   Lunch crowd management ---X! With all of the eateries in the area that seem to handle the Boeing, MD Helicopters, Red Mountain HS, MCC crowds, why would you venture in to this mess more than once.  I ordered two meals that included a pizza special (old and cold) and a sandwich plate. The trusty "old and cold" was right out, salad and sandwich was 20+ minutes later and that was after chasing someone down and inquiring about it. Most in that area only have 30 min. lunches. UNSAT!
