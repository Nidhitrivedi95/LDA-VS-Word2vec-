R9-ZfAN3nPV-T9VG8v8Xwg The orignial is in Toronto - and boy is the Ajax one just as good.  Great sandwiches too.  Excellent desserts and coffee's ....it is VERY busy during the weekends - but I never had to wait - they are very organized.

The desserts are really good European quality - with topnotch ingredients.

I tried their Shrimp Cake and Fish Cake - the cod fish cake we found to be more to our liking.  The Shrimp has a nice hot kick to it - not too hot kind of more like paprika "hot".

Its nice having a lovely bakery nearby - the kind you usually find in downtown Toronto - and makes for a good place to pick up goodies if you having guests over.

Good quality
Good prices
Busy place - but service is fast and efficient
Parking lots of it in the mall
