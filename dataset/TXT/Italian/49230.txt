9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw When the moon hitsa your eye lika big pizza pia, that's a cibo" dont' doubt my sangin skills. Finally got a chance to check out Cibo tonight and man am I happy as a...well you get the rest.

Took wife and kids out for dinner before first friday.  I got this great glass or red called Valpolicello, which was AWESOME!  Wifey had a glass of Rose' that was legit.  We decided to have the pesto salad, Di Notte Pizza and Prosciutto Crudo. The salad was pretty good. I didn't taste much pesto, but it was still good. The crust on the pizza was something magic, seriously dope. The Prosciuto crudo was just like when I lived in Italy. Simple, straight forward and dope. Di Notte on the other hand literally tasted like buttered popcorn. No seriously, if you try it watch and see..not my fave. Overall the pizza was awesome, I'm stoked to try some of the other pies. They were busy but we managed to get an inside table right away, score!  If your looking for a legitamus prime pizza spot in cen-pho, you've found it.
