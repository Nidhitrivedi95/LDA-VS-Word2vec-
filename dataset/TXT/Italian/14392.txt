The waitstaff is super friendly and gives great recommendations on what to eat! I loved their breakfast! This one I kind of made up, its an all protein plate, which is not on the menu. But bacon and sausage came out smoking hot and the eggs where fluffed just as I had asked! Ice cold beer on tap for first thing in the morning or a very spicy bloody mary!! They have a very affordable breakfast menu! They have a sign out front as to what's on the daily special! Enjoy
