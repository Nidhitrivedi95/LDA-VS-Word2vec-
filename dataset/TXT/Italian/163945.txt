Clear full length window views out from your table. Busy lively atmosphere. Wait time is around 5 minutes even on a weekend night.

Their deep dish pizza was recommended to us as to what they're most known for. We picked the sausage "speciality" pizza. It is HUGE.. it looks practically like a pie or cake! It was too big to finish, even at a small size, for 2 people. It is definitely rather cheesy - you can film or take a photo of yourself doing a "pull" of it. As to how it tastes though? So disappointing. It is so bland - what am I even tasting? It was like a sea of pasta sauce, just too much sauce and not enough of the other ingredients. Their calamari was thankfully better. The fried lemons in it is interesting.
