7JWWeXqil03Ua_wV9KN8ZQ The food here is simply amazing! We ordered the Rigatoni al Funghi, and the vodka sauce, combined with the mushrooms, led to a tasteful dish that my brother and I polished off in seconds. 

The penne with chicken, broccoli, and sun-dried tomatoes was surprisingly delicious. My family and I normally find chicken breast too dry for our taste, but the chicken in here were very tender and full of flavor. Overall, the dish had many layers of taste, each part, the chicken, the broccoli, the penne, all combined to create a very delicious dish. 

Our waiter had a great sense of humor and gave some good recommendations, like the strawberry tiramisu, which was simply amazing. There was an abundance of strawberries in the dessert and it wasn't overly sweet. 

The restaurant itself was warm and friendly.  Large windows let the afternoon sunlight stream through and lit up the warm tones of the walls. The view of the lake was also very calming. 

We will definitely be coming back next time we're in town!
