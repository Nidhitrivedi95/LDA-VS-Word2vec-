jluEI1ZDQDeJlbl-M3YH3Q My first experience here was for a wedding dinner and it would've been the last if they hadn't begged us to return for another dinner on them just to make up for the first fiasco. Service was slow, wine over priced and the food was beyond salty. I mean they couldn't get anything right. Moving forward, we returned for our dinner on the house and it was just as bad. If it wasn't for the attentive waiter I wouldn't even give this place 1 star. Sure the place has a great view but c'mon if the food is sub par you will quickly forget about the view in no time. In regards to the meal, all meat dishes we ordered had to be sent back because they literally came to the table raw. All 4 came with standard veggies and not what was indicated on the menu.

I will never return here or recommend this restaurant to anyone. 
Sorry but the standards here are very low. Save your money.
