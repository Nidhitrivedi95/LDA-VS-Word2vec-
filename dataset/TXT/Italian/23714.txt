3yMmo1sERpks50quoaA8PQ This place has been around a while, and it's still pretty fantastic.  To find it, just look for the Office Max sign.  You know you've gone too far on Hayden when you've passed the Starbucks in the same strip mall. 

Soups at Uncle Sal's are incredible.  I'm not sure what they put in them, but it's a good thing.  If you're in the soup mood, or even if you're not, get the soup!  

The bar is not too big so, when it's full, it's really full.  But it's cozy.  (This is a great place to go on a date, though it is kind of spendy.)

The decor is very old fashioned and the tables are a bit tight here and there, but the restaurant can accommodate large groups.  You can also sit outside at some small tables that hug the side of the restaurant.

I highly recommend the Calimari appetizer and the Chicken Marsala. Also, the Cannoli are fantastic.  The shells are authentic; you can really taste the Italian cinnamon :)  I split mine but they are not too big to gobble down yourself.  Love it!
