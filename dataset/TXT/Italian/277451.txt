YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw Horrible service! I've gave this place a try with 3 visits and each time was worse then the last. 1st time I went it was for a work event and it took the over an hour to bring out 3 starter plates which was a salad, shrimp cocktail and French toast. 2nd and 3rd time I did brunch with my family the waiter took forever to serve us and had huge attitude and kept rolling his eyes, the manager had the same problem. The staff in this restaurant is the reason I don't recommend eating here.
