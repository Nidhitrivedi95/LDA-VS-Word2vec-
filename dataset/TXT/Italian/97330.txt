EtLmuDIMsBCmqdgpysz60Q Went here on a Saturday night with a friend for dinner after they got a gift certificate because of a yelp lol. We should've just used that on drinks. The server was good but when I ordered a drink at the bar I paid my tab in cash which was around $17-18 and handed her a $20. Instead of giving me change she just took the money. I ABSOLUTELY HATE THAT. Anyways we got seated and they were already out of mussels and scallops for the night. Should've taken that as an indicator to go somewhere else since my friend wanted to try the mussels specifically. We both ordered salads and kabobs given the limited menu selection. The salad was good but $9 for a small Greek salad? My lamb kabobs were overcooked they were well well well done. The layout of the bar itself is good and a very quiet and intimate place to bring a date for a drink but would not recommend the food. Doubt I will be back here.
