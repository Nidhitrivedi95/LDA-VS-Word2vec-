wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q I have been dining at the macaroni grill on Stephanie st in Henderson for over 10 years. In the past it was very good, not great, but always enjoyable. 
Last night forced me to never want to go to that location again. The service was acceptable, but the food quantity and presentation were terrible. I ordered the ratatouille, and when brought to the table I was told not to touch the bowl or underlying plate because they were burning hot. The plate was super hot and had obviously been put into the overhead broiler. That was rather strange because there was no cheese or anything on the plate that required the super hot broiler. I was super disappointed because there was sauce splattered all over the edge of the bowl. Very poor presentation. The portion was also very small for $14.95.
The manager did comp my meal, but that's no why I brought these issues to the waitresses attention. In addition,  the bread must be made off premise because it's not as crisp as normal.
I think the final straw was when leaving I noticed the 2 line cooks in the open kitchen both had cell phone earpieces on while cooking. If I ran this restaurant I would be looking for an entire new kitchen cook staff
