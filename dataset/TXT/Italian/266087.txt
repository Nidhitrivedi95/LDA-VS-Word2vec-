x-ZnHkRIhpGwZ_7VwiKlRg My first time at Crostatas, even though we live just a few minutes away.  My daughter and I went on a Thursday evening and the restaurant was pretty full.  We ordered (2) Insalata Mista salads, which consisted of fresh spring greens, strawberries and a balsamic dressing (homemade), which was accompanied by a warm and chewy breadstick (yum!).  We also ordered the Margherita pizza with italian sausage.   Our meal was Excellent, the pizza was chewy with just the right amount of crunch and toppings.   Service was a little bit slow, but other than that, I can't wait to go back.....soon!
