y769FA7VJOW4QQYdYlR62A Wow. This place is better than pizzeria libretto and I am not exaggerating. We didn't get to dine but had take away since the place was packed (not many tables to begin with). Who cares though when the food is amazing?! AND CHEAP.
Pollo toscano 8.5- ahhhhhmaaaazzzingggggg
Funghi 7.5 - that truffle oil ... Delicious 
Panna cotta 5 not bad but free tastes pretty damn good 

I can't wait to try the pasta! Everything is made from scratch. The pizza crust/dough was unreal. I could eat that all day. So impressed. 

If you check in you get a free dessert -- which they can pack away for you if you're doing take away! Woohoo! Winning :)
