xyMZdF9Xh9N6il831_Czsg Decided to go here last night with the girlfriend and couldn't be happier with that decision.  

The ambiance was great on the large patio - and when its March in Arizona, finding a table outside is ideal.  My only critique would be that the music from inside was not loud enough to be heard on the patio - not really a complaint, just making note of it.

Ordered the feta bruschetta and a bottle of wine to start and was very please with the size of the starter - 4 Large pieces - I could honestly foresee coming here in the future and simply having bruschetta and wine before calling it a night.  Ultimately I decided on the bistro beef with grilled asparagus and roasted beets and she had the leg of lamb with sauteed green beans and greek potatoes.  My entire meal not only came out extremely fast but cooked perfectly.  The beef was a nice medium rare, asparagus with the right amount of crisp - and I'm a sucker for beets, so not hard to please there.  Her order was great as well, but the lamb was just a little more on the well-done side. (honestly the only reason I didn't give 5 stars) However, this could just be a one-off fluke - do to our love of lamb, I'm sure I'll give it another shot the next time around and hope to see a little more pink in the meat.

After all that, we still had wine left so we decided to finish our meal with a cannoli and it was just the right amount of sweet.  (Some cannoli's are overly sweet - this one was perfect)

All in all, we were really pleased to have made the decision to try this place and I definitely will be back to LPC in the near future.
