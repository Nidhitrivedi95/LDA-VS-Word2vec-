jOseCpGmgbQWEfX2Wn_TGQ Avanti is as real as it gets! Angelo is straight from Florence Italy, so he knows Italian food!
I was fortunate enough to get a serenade from Angelo!
He and his guys make you feel like your part of the family.
Martini's and cocktails are AMAZING!
You really have not had Italian food in AZ until you have been to Avanti's!
