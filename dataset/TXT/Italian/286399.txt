ZH_QCa8_ryVdIb6sSsyCeg TERRIBLE SERVICE. And fruit flies everywhere. Worst I've ever had, and I've had some bad experiences! We called to see if they could fit our party of 6 and instead of telling us they were understaffed, they took the reservation. We sat inside and were not greeted not was our drink order taken for over 20 minutes. It took 15 more to get the drinks and then they took our order. We then sat there for an hour and a half. NO APOLOGY OR EXPLANATION. They brought out two people's food, and never came back. I went to ask what was going on and everyone was just standing around! Again, no explanation or apology. They were serving customers who were sitting outside that arrived an hour after we did, and they didn't even discount the few morsels of food we did get! Terrible terrible terrible. It was my second time there, the first wasn't this bad, but I will never ever go back. Being understaffed is one thing, being rude and ignoring your customers is horrible. Don't go there if you actually want to eat within 2 hours or if you expect good service.
