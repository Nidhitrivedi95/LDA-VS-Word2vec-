Although the place is fairly pricey, the food is awesome.  We tried the shrimp rolls with the crunchy center (excellent), the cajun chicken (which reminded me of the Louisiana that I just visited), and the creme brulee (a don't miss, with its real vanilla beans--which drives my gf wild).  The service is friendly and they'll good care of you.
