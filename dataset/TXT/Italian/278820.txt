YNHvFEvp9VDNwX5VhRanYQ This is the 3rd time that I have been to this place for take out over the years.  I came here because I had a 2 for 1 coupon which was about to expire.  For a Saturday night, the business was quite slow.  I didn't have to wait to order and the food was made fresh within 5-10 mins. This time I think the portion size was very generous.  We got the normal sized pasta, but for $3 more you get the larger size with quite a bit more pasta and sauce.  I really like the concept of pick your pasta and sauce and picking what other toppings to mixed with pasta.  We ordered the linguini meat sauce with zucchini and mushrooms and also the broccoli pesto penne with chicken.  Both dishes didn't have enough sauce, so the pasta was on the dry side.  There was however plenty of meat in the meat sauce.  The flavour of both dishes also needs some improvement.  This place is okay, for a quick pasta fix when you don't feel like cooking.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but because it's close to home, it's okay.
