6frPvwX14wDH8jju64ewRg Had the best time here tonight.  My friends took me out for my birthday and I am so glad they recommended this place.  Short but sweet. .. decor was tasteful and well done, , food was fresh,  delicious and perfect portions,  Menu was easy to read,  wine list was impeccable and mostly. .... The service from ALL the staff was the best I have had in about 3 years. .. as much as I would come back for the food. ...I rather enjoyed the service best.  Our main server was knowledgeable but not arrogant,  professional but not at all distant,  easy on the eyes (actually the whole staff was attractive) and he gave us glasses of ice wine to celebrate my birthday. ..I will be telling everyone I know to come here. .. just a lovely place to be. ... Thank you for the good time.
