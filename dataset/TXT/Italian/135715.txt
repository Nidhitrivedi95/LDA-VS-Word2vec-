iwzVhM5CirzkNS5wTxwZeA I have visited this restaurant once before for lunch. I had a salad. Nothing to write home about. So when I had a dinner meeting scheduled last night at Strand, I had no expectations. The food was non significant but not horrible. The salmon I order well came to the table medium rare. I ate two bites at the ends. The rest was inEdible. After paying our bill, my group of four noticed a cockroach as big as my thumb crawling against the wall. It made my skin crawl! I showed the slow crawling cockroach to the waitress. She didn't flinch. She signaled she saw the roach with a nod of her head the shouted out to someone by the kitchen as to signal "another roach sighting". 

I will not be back every again. This morning my stomach is turning and I have been in the bathroom on and off. Not sure if it was the Angry Shrimp (which was too spicy to enjoy) or an indication of a nasty kitchen. Eat at your own risk.
