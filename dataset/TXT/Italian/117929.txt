Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw We were looking for a vegetarian option inside the Venetian and I happened to just step along to read the menu in front of the restaurant. The waitress at the desk told me that they can make a lot of dishes vegetarian and we walked in with a hungry stomach at around 2:30 pm. 

The waitress recommended "eggplant musaka" and we also chose the Gnocchi pasta. 

We found that it was probably the best vegetarian Italian dishes we have tasted here in the US. I really recommend this especially to people who are of the impression that it is hard to find vegetarian options in Las Vegas. 

The Manager was also really courteous and friendly. We would love to dine here the next if we visit Las Vegas in future.
