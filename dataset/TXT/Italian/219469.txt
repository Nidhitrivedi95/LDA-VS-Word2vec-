SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg My boyfriend and I just ate here while we were staying on the Las Vegas strip. When we drove up...the outside of this place looked SKETCHY! Like a strip mall. Once inside, it is a very cute place. Like a dark, brooding speak easy. 

We ordered drinks, our waiter was very nice . He did warn me the Mint Julep I ordered was a very strong drink....and wow! It was too strong for me, he was very nice and offered to get me something else. 

We ordered the Kobe sliders...so juicy and flavorful! Also the carpaccio, perfection. Great meat and wonderful flavors. As well as the sweet potatoe tater tots with marshmallow crust...great idea, but fell a little short for me there wasn't enough salty contrast in the dish. We also ordered the farmers flat bread...ok, not wonderful. 

I did really like the good food we had here though. Be warned, if you like semi-sweet cocktails like me...there isn't a whole lot on the menu that doesn't involve bitters, gin, rum, or whiskey.
