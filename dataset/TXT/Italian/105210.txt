FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q I was a bit skeptical coming to the place as the neighborhood is "off the strip".  The atmosphere inside is very much like a home style restaurant.  I had the  Penne Alla Vodka and it was amazing!  Loved the taste and loved the texture. 

Would come back every time now that I have tried it.  Had a Groupon deal for $15 off and so my bill came out to $5 at the end.  Left a big tip for the food.
