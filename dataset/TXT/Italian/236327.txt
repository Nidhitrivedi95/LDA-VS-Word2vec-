Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA There are an awful lot of artisan pizza restaurants in Phoenix these days.  Federal Pizza joins the fray with Pizzzeria Bianca, LGO, The Parlor, and North Fattoria Italiana.  I gotta say, for me, Federal Pizza simply doesn't stack up to the competition.  I wanted so much to fall in love with this place because it's an Upward Projects restaurant and I love pretty much everything they do.  

The design, service, clientele, and environment are everything that I love about all the Upward Projects spots.  There is a really great trendy local feel to this place.  Unfortunately, the food just doesn't match up.  At least the pizza doesn't.  Some of the salads and the pork sandwich are pretty good.

I find the pizza crust itself to be bland and uninspired, although it has good consistency and is always cooked appropriately.  The sauces are completely lacking in flavor.  The toppings seem as though they would create interesting flavor profiles, but ultimately fail on that front as well.  Don't even think about the pepperoni or sausage options--you'll be drowned in grease.  

I keep going back for the pitchers of beer, friendly environment, and roasted vegetables.
