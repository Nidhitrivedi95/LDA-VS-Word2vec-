gsGxpk5uhy1XvaUSOrWTug We have not been to Olive Garden in awhile, last visit it was not good but thought we would see what if anything has changed! We both started with gnocchi soup! It was cold and watery and I couldn't find a bite of chicken, lucky for me I had 3 gnocchi, so okay put some parm on it! Ok decided to go for second bowl, it was warm, 2 gnocchi and hey a couple bites of chicken!  But was offered no Parmesan on top this time! Ok time for main course, chicken piccata, and zucchini bites, chicken was so dry and overcooked, sauce was tiny and weird taste! What can I say about the zucchini, it was raw, with Parmesan sprinkled on top! AWFUL! I love chicken piccata, I make at home, and have had other places, not sure what they were making! Left the zucchini on the plate, it was not good, believe me, the picture on menu is deceiving, not what I got! So to sum it up if I ever eat at Olive Garden again it will not be in Surprise!!!!!
