Hqs4YNST_ZHbshwyi4bnsQ Seriously - this is a real pizza joint!

I had the pork rules slice.  The crust is thin but not too thin.  The crust has a nice body too it with a crusty bottom, a bit of chewiness and a nice flavor. The slice was huge.  The pizza was topped with roasted pork, bacon, sausage, ham and pepperoni.  This is a great pie!  I know I could stop there. 

I checked in on yelp and cashed in on a free gelato.  Holy smokes - "I, Jason C. hereby solemnly swear to never eat regular ice cream ever again.  I do declare to eat only handmade gelato from Old School Pizzeria."  The pistachio gelato was that good.

I was ready to leave when I asked the guy behind the counter if those were "homemade cannoli shells?"  I asked because the shells were dark.  Real cannoli shells have a darker color because they are made with red wine.  It is rare to find homemade cannoli shells.  He said, "yes."  I said, "oooo I want one."  

Goodness - Authentic gelato and a real cannoli.  The pizza.  This place is legit.

Bring cash.
