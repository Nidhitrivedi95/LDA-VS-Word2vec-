w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q After filling my pockets at the Caesar's table game, I wanted to blow it all on a ridiculous lunch before I flew back home and restarted in the real world. The Palm did not disappoint.

I got the surf and turf combo with the 14 ounce filet mignon and half of a 3lb lobster (you can also pick a 4lb or 5lb lobster). The filet was the biggest one I've ever seen and succulent throughout and cooked to perfection at medium-rare. The lobster was huge and the table side cracking definitely made me feel pampered. I had to share my meal with a few friends since it was so ridiculously large, but it was money well spent. The total ended up being $95 with tax and tip.

My favorite part of the meal was the end where they squeeze fresh lemon in your hands and give you hot towels to wash yourself. Ahh Vegas, miss you already.
