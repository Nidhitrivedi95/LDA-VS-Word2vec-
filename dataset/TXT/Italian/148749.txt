kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg I came to Summerlin for a blind date at a restaurant that I'd never been to on the strength of some YELP reviews. We met and were seated outside on a beautiful August night where we were met by a most pleasant and courteous waiter who took our drink orders and returned promptly with both our cocktails and witty banter. He gave us ample time to talk and we never felt rushed to put in our orders for food. As starters, we decided on the charcuterie platter and the baked Brie which arrived in a puff pastry which included apricot preserves. Yum. Before we had time to delve into the main menu, we had already decided to have our second date at Grape Street also. Wish I could say more, but what happens in Summerlin....
