0jv1aUWkZfoJumErj3JCFQ I've only been to see Franco couple of times since he opened in Troon North... vs when he was at Un Bacio, I was there more frequently.
I must say that he's food has always been consistent regardless of the location. It's just good Italian food that I'm familiar with.The service staff was always courteous and accommodating. atmosphere comfortable.

If I didn't live so far away, I see myself there more often,
especially when my wallet can afford it.
