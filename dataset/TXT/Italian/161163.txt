lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ After 2 days of heavy drinking, a group of 4 dudes (Mr. Bloewen, Mr. Booth, Mr. Buxton, and myself) were looking for an early lunch.  We teetered on an all you can drink buffet and Mandalay, but though for the better to avoid that.  After Buxton was refused service at Burger Bar the night before, we elected to try out the nearby Slice of Vegas.

We were unsure of what to order, and our waiter was hard to find.  We were the only people in the establishment, since they just opened, but the waiter was either busy playing with his phone in the back, or just didn't want to talk to us.  We had to yell at him everytime to finish talking as he quickly was walking away.

We ordered an appetizer of french fries that were good and hot.  We were all in the mood for pizza so asked the waiter what size we should order.  We are 4 average built guys.  His response was, "I've seen some people eat a large all by themselves, and some split it with 4-5 people."  Gee, thanks a lot, Guy.

Without any help, we tried ordering the large pepperoni, and know we could order more if that was not enough.  If you are in doubt, I will say that it is more than enough for 4 dudes.  We were all stuffed, and didn't even finish one piece.  The pizza was also extremely greasy, and completely mediocre.  I think that I have to say Domino's is better than the Slice of Vegas.

I am highly doubtful for the continued existence of this restaurant, and assume that it will be replaced (go out of business) soon.  If the quality was higher, i would be more hopeful.
