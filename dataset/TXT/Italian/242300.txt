The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  
I have a Gluten Sensitivity and am Lactose intolerant so this place was AMAZING for me.  All of the menu items and Gluten Free and only the Lasagna is unable to be Dairy Free.  The GF pizza dough was the fluffiness GF dough I've ever had.  It rose about 1/3" which if you've ever had GF pizza before you know is a lot because most are cracker thin.  
If I lived in this area I would come every week.  They do have cheese and can make pizza with Gluten also so everyone can enjoy the menu and the cocktail menu is great too and they have GF bottled beers in addition to the draft beers.
