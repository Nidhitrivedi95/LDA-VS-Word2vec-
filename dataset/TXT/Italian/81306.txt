dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw The ambiance was nice. Reminds me of Sirio of Aria.
Food was a mix of 2 to 5 stars.
Bread - cold, 2 stars
Complimentary Meatballs -5 stars - Kudos to the server who noticed that it was taking them a long time for our entrees to be served to give out comp meatballs. It's delicious and its complimentary. Will I get this one again even if its not complimentary? YES!!! Definitely!!!
BF's Seafood Stew - Good, he liked it probably 3.5 stars, he prefer the seafood stew in SD better.
Braised Short ribs- 2 stars, its a bit burned and not yummy.
Peach Zabaione - 4 stars, love it
Chocolate Cake - 4 stars

Would we come back here again? Maybe.
