eMP3ffj6Zr7o3tY2G6EgSQ Excellent food with an amazing menu! We ordered a variety of things from the menu and loved everything, especially the fried chicken. Told the bartender to surprise me with a cool cocktail and I ended up having 4 of them! Great vibe, great staff, great location! Would come back again!
