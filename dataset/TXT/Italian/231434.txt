Tgc2dTcE1xOey2OUt_PvXA While vacationing in AZ we came here for dinner with family. They told us it was a busy restaurant, with a party of 7 we waited about 45 minutes and it was totally worth the wait. I tried the El Diablo Shrimp Pasta, the waiter and manager both joked that they'd bring me the fire extinguisher. I like spicy and loved this dish. Seeing as how it was our first time we all tried a bite or two of each others dishes and found everything tasted good. The service for the busy dinner was smooth. Can't wait to make a return visit on our next trip!
