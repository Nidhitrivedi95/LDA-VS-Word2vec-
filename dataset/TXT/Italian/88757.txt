E_jLyf_YuGgMP_rw8tvNSA Just walked in at 635pm on a Saturday night and they turned our business away (family of 3) restaurant was completely empty because they said they had a $100 order in dont of us and it would take an hour and a half to make us a pizza. A $100 order at a pizza place is like 5 pizzas? The place was EMPTY! The kitchen was staffed? I don't get it?! that's honestly bad business and we won't be back. Regardless of their 5 star reviews.
