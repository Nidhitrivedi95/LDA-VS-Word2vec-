WpZkK951tqHONywmKLmhQw My second review for this place and I have to say, our waitress Sarah from our last visit recognized me and my family. I have to believe because of our last visit and the fact that we were very nice to her, she stopped by to talk with us. 

Our waitress today Kaylee was equally as nice and both Sarah and Kaylee talked to us for quite a long time. Very friendly staff as usual, the food was rediculously good as well. The deep dish pizza was very tast, the cheese was chewy like it's supposed to be and the sauce was rich. 

The mild hot wings had such a good flavor, the balsamic dressing on our salad was good as well. Just a fantastic experience. Thank you Sarah and Kaylee for being nice to me and my family!!!
