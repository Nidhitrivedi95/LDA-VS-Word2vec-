BnMnAotMjCw7mYlYFZgCvQ Tuscan Inn is a city caliber restaurant in the suburbs.  Top notch food and good service.  The wine list is a little light, but you can find some gems on there as well, especially on the owners reserve list.  Each of those are rated 90 points or higher at varying prices.  Some decent finds for a restaurant of its size.

The sea scallops and the veal chop were our entrees and we could not find one thing we did not like about the preparation, presentation or taste.  They were wonderful and I would recommend either.  The house salad (which is fantastic with the optional additional Gorgonzola crumbles) comes with most entrees.  A nice treat in a higher quality restaurant these days.  They self professed their Cabernet Vinegarette was "famous" and the best.  I now agree.

The service was good, not great.  I missed our waitress' name and I regret that as I  would ask for her again.  The place was packed yet the attention was just right.  It would have been too little had we wanted to get out of there sooner, but since it was a special evening, and no kids, we enjoyed each other and the length of time.  The service lacked the "little things" like clearing plates before the next course (they sat awhile) and fresh forks and knives with each course (unless you asked).  That is knit-picking but one of the differences between 4 and 5 stars.

Overall, a great place, a good find and recommended.  Enjoy.
