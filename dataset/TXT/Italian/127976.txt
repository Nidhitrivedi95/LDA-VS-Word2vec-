HYhbeLznSWEl6JIYTllVUA We just happened to stop at this place while our daughter was visiting. We were very happy with the happy hour prices on drinks and food!  Our waitress was very friendly. We ordered one pizza per person thinking they were like a flatbread.  She told us they were big and no one eats a whole one!  So glad she warned us.. we ordered two  and took half of one home!
