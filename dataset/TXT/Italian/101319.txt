FcFnVG2NO2a6h6Mi86zaFQ Been to almost all the local coffee shops and this is still my favorite. My new favorite thing here now is the 32oz iced loose leaf tea. Even better when they leave the bag in!  Orange / cinnamon is probably my favorite, but I like to mix it up. Many great flavors. The coffee here great too. The only thing I wish they had more of are outlets. The table on the back right as you walk in, over by the bathrooms area, has an outlet. That is the only table that has one right there.
