j00iBr6uYnwgFs_J5y9f0w this was my second trip here. I wanted to give Rocco's another chance since my first visit was disappointing. Having been to a different location and enjoying it, I will not be returning here. The guy taking the order was a bit rude. Not just to me but others in line as well. The pizza was sickening, overwhelmed with grease it took any other flavors from the other ingredients right out of the picture.
