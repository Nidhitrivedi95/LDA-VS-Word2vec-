GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q As a kid I was always a picky eater. I never liked sandwiches or cheese steaks until my parents took me here one afternoon. After this day, I was OBSESSED. I've been going here since I was young. The family who owns Casella's are so friendly, owner even gave me a free cheesecake on my 17th birthday. Now whenever my family or I are in, Denise greets us by name and asks how our family is doing.
