heShcmma09uAfwU6yStMjg I order online on Valentines Day this year. I ordered the special heart shaped pizza with extra pepperoni. I was excited and couldn't wait. Once the delivery guy came by. I opened the box my pizza was looking right. It was pretty over cooked by looking at the crust. I just brushed off. So I ate the pizza. Later, my throat started bothering me. The next day, I got a sore throat from it. I got sick eating this. Thank you for getting me sick whoever did something to my pizza.
