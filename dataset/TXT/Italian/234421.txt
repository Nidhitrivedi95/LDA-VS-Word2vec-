tR4VVIdzcJCQus4GUFq3IA Our second time at La Cucina. The first time the service was fabulous. Meal was superb. Last night we returned expecting more of the same. The waitress was non plus. Just handed us the menu. Nothing about Happy Hour Specials or Specials of the Day. No wine list was given. We ordered an appetizer that we had had before. Eggplant Torte which came quickly and as before was very good. My husband ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs thinking it would be wonderful. I ordered the Chicken Marsala. Both were extremely disappointing. My chicken was tough and the sauce was awful. I had to ask the waitress several times to clear away the dirty dishes.The best part of the meal was the desert.  I could have cooked a better meal at home. Will not return to La Cucina.
