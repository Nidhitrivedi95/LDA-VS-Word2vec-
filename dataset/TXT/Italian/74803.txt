Cr5CLpmVrmzFyz_RfQ6rmA Revisited the past weekend with family in hopes that the à la carte menu will be more appealing than the party menu - was not disappointed! The Shrimp Spaghetti had an interesting combination of flavours, a rich sauce, and good presentation. Steak was ordered at the table again despite my warnings from my last visit, fortunately it turned out okay this time around though the fries and greens were still too salty for my preference. There seemed to be some confusion between the kitchen and the waiters as our food was "brought out" but never arrived to us in some cases, though management took care of the delay acceptably. I would advise on taking a close look at any extra cutlery or plates that may be requested to be brought for the table as it seemed their dishwasher was not performing at top quality...that dampened the experience for me significantly.
