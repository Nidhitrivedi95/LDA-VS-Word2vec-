Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw Italian #2 Perfect amount of oil/vinegar, good portion meat + cheese, AWESOME bread.
Downside = Boars Head Meats.. What a shame nitrate infested garbage meats.
Ordered fired zucchini wow maybe a few steps better than carls jr. Prob pre frozen etc.. Were not good @ all very disappointing in such an authentic style place
Overall - Great sandwich just too bad they use crap meats with nitrates. I would go back and buy some bread then get some non nitrate meats to put on their breads maybe ill buy cheese from them to give them a little extra business..
