From the moment we entered they treated us with class. Took our coats/jackets to be hung so we could enjoy the dinner with comfort. We were shown to our seats and boom our journey of a sexy restaurant night started. 

A lot of restaurants focus so much on being presentable and stylish that they lose focus on the other things. Our server was very humble yet informative about the menu. He was very detailed which helped us make our dinner choices. 

He didn't hover around and kept checking in on us at the appropriate intervals. Didn't feel rushed at all which was surprising considering how busy the place was. 

Food recommendations; the linguini. Yumm! The slight hint of truffle oil was just mind blowing. And of course the Friday evening special BBQ duck was just mouth watering. 

Since the night had been so amazing a dessert was in order and glad we didn't skip that. The chocolate roll with ice cream though sounds simple but it was just orgasmic. 

The interior is very industrial like yet feels warm. Though Friday night and I'm assuming same for sat, it's very busy and trendy. 

Looking for a place for a date night or hanging out with friends/family over scrumptious meals in Montreal then this is your destination.
