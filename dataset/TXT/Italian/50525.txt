9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw I do NOT understand the hype with this place.  I was expecting to be blown away.  I was not.  It is ok.  The sauce is not that great on the pizza, but the crust was amazing.  The sausage was pretty bland, too.  Cheese was good, just needed a little more.  The pulled pork sandwich had a super wood flavor...a little too much.  The fruit salad was just ok.  It's good but not great.  I prefer the Parlor for pizza.
