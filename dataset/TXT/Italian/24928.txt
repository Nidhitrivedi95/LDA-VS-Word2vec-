4gXdyihRiytmXEAfqLNMBw This was the most terrible experience I've ever had at any restaurant. 
My husband wanted to stay in for the evening, so we decided to get take out. I had never been to Babbo, so we thought we'd try it. I got the stuffed manicotti, which I could hardly finish because the texture and taste was so odd. It all makes sense now, considering I went to bed shortly after and woke up abruptly a few hours later violently sick. I went to the ER the next day thinking I had the flu or something, but they said it was definitely food poisoning. That meal was the only thing I had eaten that day. I was in the hospital for hours getting an IV and various medications for the nausea that was causing such severe dehydration and was told not to go back to work for a few days. I couldn't even sit up or stand without getting sick for DAYS. I called Babbo later that day to let them know what happened. I spoke to one of the managers who said she would forward the info to their GM and follow up with me. I called the next day because I hadn't heard from her. I told her I have hospital bills and I'm missing work and I still haven't even been reimbursed for my food. She was extremely rude and said she didn't have any information and nobody else had called saying they got sick from the food but that she'd get in touch with the GM that night or the following day and follow up. That was about 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything. I missed 3 days of work, I have $1500 in hospital bills, and I STILL payed $40 for our meal and it hasn't been reimbursed. I have never been that sick in my life and I definitely will not be going back or recommending anyone else to. 
I am only giving Babbo 1 star because I can't give it 0. They might have left a slightly less awful taste in my mouth had they handled this situation differently. If you're looking for food in the city of Surprise, go ANYWHERE but here!!!
