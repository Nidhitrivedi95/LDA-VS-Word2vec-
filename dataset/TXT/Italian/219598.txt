SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Had a great time here...I am not much of a drinker but I do like my Whiskey...

The Menu needs to be fixed as I could not read it..the font was hard to read and the red letters made it impossible..I thought because I was not wearing my glasses was the reason, so i asked the guy next to me and he said the same thing.....so fix that and all is good...

I asked the bar tender what was a good drink for whiskey he made me a Brown Derby it was really good..I saw a lot of cool drinks

The Brussels spourtts are definitely  must have no they are a try them before you try anything else kinda thing and I am not a brussel sprout kinda guy.

My new place for a steak as there happy hour has steaks at half price
