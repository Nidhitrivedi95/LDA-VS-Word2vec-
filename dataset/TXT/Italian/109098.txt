G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q I've been several times, love sitting at the bar. The bread plate is amazing! This time we had a window seat and did the chefs tasting menu, I highly recommend this! We ordered a starter of meat and burrata (fantastic) off the regular menu and were thankful, the antipasti with the tasting menu was eh. Mrs loved the lemon crema spaghetti with shrimp, I had the rigatoni with Bolognese which was very tasty. Both had the steak to finish, YUM! Could have done without the sides that came with the third course. We aren't big dessert people but they bring the cart over and offer you 3 each - the lemon cookies are hands down the most fantastic! Kudos all!
