Good pizza, love the thin crust. I ordered the Patata & Pancetta for $13.67. Lovely decor; comfy seats, warm light, suitable art. 

My friends and I stayed for about three hours as we waited for latecomers to arrive and eat and also taking this resto's name literally for its "social hang out." Thus, it was rather disconcerting to have our server constantly badgering us to leave, :/. lol, even when she did come by she'd ignore the empty jug of water. I'd understand if it was a busy afternoon or whatnot but, it wasn't (Sundays are more brunch-y days, no?) and that kind of ruined the experience for me.

Prolly wouldn't make a return-visit.
