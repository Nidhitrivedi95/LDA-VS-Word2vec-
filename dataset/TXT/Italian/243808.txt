usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA We had dinner at one of their outside tables on a warm evening last week while visiting Pittsburgh. We chose this restaurant after reading the reviews. Being from Canada, we are not used to BYOB's - wish we had planned better and brought some wine. That would have made the meal perfect. It was pretty awesome as it was though. We ordered the Margarita pizza for our six year old and it was very good. We devoured it. I had the Crespelle di Funghi which was very good but rich - the waiter warned me. Portions are large - I could only finish about a third of this dish. The BF had the braised rabbit pasta on the waiter's recommendation. The pasta was clearly homemade - very tender and cooked perfectly. The sauce was fabulous. We didn't order any of the salads but I wish we had - they were huge and looked and smelled delicious. We went there on a Saturday night around 9 and it was busy and very loud inside. Outside was much quieter. I would highly recommend this restaurant for great Italian food in Pittsburgh.
