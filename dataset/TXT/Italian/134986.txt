IT0IODInyhKbG4a_ka71MQ Went here for lunch today with a friend. Fortunately the place was not packed as Oregano's usually are. But even though there were plenty of open tables, we were still told there would be a 5-10 minute wait. Okay. It was closer to 10 min, but not a big deal. We ordered the garlic cheese bread with marinara, which is a must when I come to Oregano's. It's probably my favorite thing. For my entree, I went with the Zany Ziti (which is actually penne) and since it's supposed to have meat sauce, I decided against paying extra for meatballs. But when I received it, it was not meat sauce, just marinara. That was a disappointment! The pasta was also overcooked and falling apart. Not the best. For dessert we got the chocolate chip pizookie since they are always tasty. Wish I could give a higher rating, but the pasta was a big fail.
