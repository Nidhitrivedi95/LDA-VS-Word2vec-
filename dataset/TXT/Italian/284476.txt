zbR9fpCATDYbVdWn87Z2_Q Tried FBI pizza for the first time...not impressed. The girl taking the order over the phone had no clue about the advertised special on the website.  An hour later my cold pizza arrived with 2 toppings instead of 3 (even though all toppings were on the receipt), no drinks, no dipping sauce.  I asked the driver about the drinks and he told me that I could have drinks OR salad (the advertised special includes both).  He gave me a coupon for a free salad but after review, the coupon expired in November 2012???
I called back to explain the mistakes and asked to speak to a manager. The girl answering the phone said the only people working were herself and the cook. She offered to send another pizza. Thanks, but I didn't want to wait another hour.  

The pizza was delicious but having to deal with incompetent employees is just not worth the trouble.  One would think that the people working there would know what the advertised specials are...
