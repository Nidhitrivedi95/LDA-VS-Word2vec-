SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg I am what most people would call a pizza lover. I would eat it everyday if I could. I never knew this place existed until I walked in one day. I was leisurely walking by when the intoxicating smells lured me in to try a slice. One bite of the NY stlye, thin crust pizza, and I was in love. The cheese was melted to perfection and the crust had the perfect amount of crunch. I asked the man who owns the shop his secret and he simply replied, "fresh and homemade ingrediates." To this day, I refuse to eat pizza from anywhere else. They recently added pasta and paninis which are equally delectable. This is a must try place. But I warn you, one bite and you'll be hooked. You'll never go back to processed Dominos or Pizza Hut again. That's a guarantee!!!!!
