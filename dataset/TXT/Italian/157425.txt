Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA This place was EXTREMELY disappointing. 

It's bad enough that a cool looking hotel and casino from the outside (talking about New York New York here) has absolutely NOTHING to do on the inside. This is one of the only restaurants in the entire place and it sucked. There was a line to be seated that was pretty long. We truly thought that the place was spectacular because of it. It was our friends wedding night and they wanted to get a good dinner as did we. This place is over priced (it's Vegas), portions are tiny and the food is BLAND!

Not to mention, our waiter was exceptionally rude. He didn't want to explain anything to us (seriously, reading that menu is like reading a foreign language), it took him 15 minutes to bring us our bread and oil and balsamic, and he did not once offer any refills (I was afraid to even ask in fear that they'd charge us for refills)

Avoid this place at all costs. I rather would have tried the Irish restaurant on the other side of the casino.
