rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ After passing by this place thousands of times we decided to try it last night. It was my husband's birthday. We were greeted at the door by a very nice waiter Jamal. I must say that it truly was an awesome experience from the drinks and food to the very personable staff. It was Kathy the bartenders birthday too so she came to the table to wish hubby Happy birthday and Jamal was so great. We will definitely go back again and hope to make this place our new neighborhood place to go. The only bad thing is the hundreds of martini choices! Not really a bad thing. Settled on the antioxidant Martini. Delicious!
