KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ For all the hype that came along with this place I was extremely disappointed. The food came out super slow and when it did it was average at best. Nowhere near worth the hype and definitely not worth the price. They did do the right thing by comping our appetizers cause it took almost an hour for them to come out but there is little else to say positive about this particular experience.
