k7WRPbDd7rztjHcGGkEjlw Tillie's has been one of our family favorites for years. We were just there again last week and it was wonderful. The lasagna was incredible, saucy, cheesy, hot, fresh and HUGE! It was just as good reheated a couple of days later. The homemade cheese ravioli was incredible. I want to try the beef short rib ravioli next time, they sound interesting. The Arancini (risotto cakes) appetizer was delicious. Service is always great. We are so lucky to have the wonderful restaurant in our area. Thanks!
