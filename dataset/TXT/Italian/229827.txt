TAoN9nsibXOxsOnnG7Kd_g I've been here about 3-4 times over the last ten years, and let me tell you- it certainly has not changed in all those years! Good for service and food, bad for the scenery and, well, bathrooms. A mini-remodel would benefit them. 

You start with delicious, warm, soft bread. Each entree comes with either a soup or salad. I got the Italian house salad. Crisp produce and the dressing was good. 

I ordered the Chicken Parmesan. Holy cow, was it awesome! Good amount of sauce, and the chicken was not over cooked. My chicken came with a side, so I chose the Alfredo, which was great as well. The sauce is slightly thicker than some other Italian restaurants, which I appreciate. I hate thinking the sauce is watered down.

My husband ordered the veal- piscatto, I think (which ever has lemon and wine sauce). The flavors were fantastic- just the right amount of lemon, which was strong but not overwhelming. He chose the angel hair pasta with garlic and olive oil, which I was very jealous of. That flavor was amazing!

My sister is a huge fan of Riazzi's and comes here often. She loves the gnocci and has tried many, many dishes- none of them disappointing. 

We should have ordered dessert but didn't. Next time we will!
