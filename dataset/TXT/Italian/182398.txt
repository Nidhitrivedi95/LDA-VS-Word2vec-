oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw I just attended a $90 special prix-fixe dinner party at this dreadful restaurant. It was one of the worst meals I've ever had. It cost us $90 a head for just an appetizer, salad and main course -- no dessert or beverage of any sort. Maybe that would've been ok if the food was delicious but it wasn't special. And the entree was horrible. On top of that, service was slow. We were seated by 8:30 p.m. and couldn't wait to pay our bill and leave by 10:30 p.m.

The meal started with an antipasto appetizer sampling that gave us each one little meatball, a small slice of pizza, and a slice of bruschetta (chopped tomatoes on a small slice of Italian bread). 

From there, we proceeded to the cesar-ish salad, which was acceptably dressed but not amazing. Plus, the croutons were little rocks. 

As for the entree, we had a choice between chicken or a pork chop. The pork  chop sounded like a better value dollar-wise but it ended up being a huge chunk of meat with just a dot of veggie puree spooned into the center of the plate. No one sitting around me finished their main course. I didn't either.  

I'm here attending a convention and am sorely disappointed because the fancy food in Vegas is supposed to be good. If you're at the Manadalay Bay, there are plenty of other brand name restaurants here to try. Skip Lupo. If you're on a budget, there's an all-you-can eat buffet place that costs about 30 bucks, which is probably a good option for a group of people who might have various eating issues. 

Personally, I've had two meals at one of the lower priced restaurants, Red White and Blue, where a hamburger will still set you back $15 to $18 -- but the food and service are good. Check out my review for that place!
