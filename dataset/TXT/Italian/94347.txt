ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Terrible kitchen service and management ruins an otherwise great place . 
Came here for lunch . Ordered beets for a starter and salmon entree. Also ordered a glass of wine. Ten minutes later the wine arrives . Two minutes later the salmon .
No beets. When the beets arrive 5 minutes later the excuse is oh the starter chef "must have gotten backed up at least you got food!" When  I sent the beets back ( what was the point) the manager saw what happened and did not come over. Finally when he came to my table to help clear it I asked if he was the manager and he said yes. Had I not asked he never would have identified himself . I told him about how poor the kitchen service is and  his only comment was " they are in different places. I took it off your bill."
With a manager like that now I appreciate the comment " at least you got food."
