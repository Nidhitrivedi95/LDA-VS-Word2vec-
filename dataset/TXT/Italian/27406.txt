4sfof0u2L7_ryXQusDM-aA We had a very nice meal at Vivo. My wife and I shared a pizza and a ravioli dish. Both were very good, made from quality ingredients, flavors right on. The only complaint was the ravioli was undercooked, not al dente like it should be. Our kids ordered pizzas and were very satisfied. The service was very good, the atmosphere was nice, mandatory free valet, but tips expected. Overall a nice dining experience that will cause us to repeat soon.
