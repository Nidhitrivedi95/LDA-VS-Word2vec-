FmraE2CWt65VRnEqCAqNEg Visited on Sunday for the prime rib special,and we were seated right away.Was greeted by our server(Eddie)who took our drink order.Took a few minutes to get our beers as he was waiting tables on the patio as well.ordered the grilled wings for an app,and were great.We didn't see our server for a while after apps arrivedThe prime rib was good,but it seems that our server forgot to bring us our salads,and any bread during our meal.Food is good,but they need to straighten out the service,as once people start filling the dining room,it is to difficult to wait tables inside and out.
