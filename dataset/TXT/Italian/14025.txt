1aliEQ0L2uh2SUN6GQVJ0Q Yelp really came through for me. I never would have discovered this place otherwise. Its just a short walk from the two big dept stores in the area  Like other reviewers stated it's a great place for a meal, coffee or dessert.  I had a very nice & filling meal for 12EUR. They didn't have an English menu but the waiter was very helpful and friendly.
