gjATEWAllTfxfxhGqJ93sQ We went there for lunch. The terrace was pretty packed but we managed to get a table immediately. I had the worst seat of all: right next to the entrance. The terrace was also quite loud, but not intolerable.  

Il Focolaio has a large variety of pizzas. Also, the fuss about this place is the crust, which is oven-cooked. I chose the St-Denis: sausages, capicollo, mushrooms, mozzarella and I replaced the green bell peppers with onions. 

I don't think I ever got my food in a restaurant so quickly. I think we waited for about 15 minutes and yet the place was full. That was impressive. 

The pizza was a reasonable size (more or less 12 inches). The crust was really good. When you go, ask for the pepper and the spicy oil. It really adds a little something to your pizza. Otherwise, my pizza tasted a little bland.  

The prices are reasonable. They go from $11 to $15. 

Conclusion: If you want a good pizza that isn't worth $1 per slice, this is a good option. But I wouldn't say this is THE best pizzeria in Montreal.
