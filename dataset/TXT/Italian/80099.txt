d3zW_b-JWlxMneNn7K9xew Streets of New York has a few things going for it.. First, great service even on a packed Friday night. Second, great food. My wife and I have been here a few times and each time we are blown away by the quality of the food. Finally, great prices. Two can easily eat and drink for 35 or less.
