JsUprRhyzQyukZmAhcOg0A Valentine's Day Special. After receiving numerous e-mails advertising the Valentines Day Special dinner we decided to try it. BIG MISTAKE. Reservations at 5:15 pm. We stood for an hour at the reception desk (little seating and no bar seats available) along with many others waiting for a table. At 6 pm they were just seating the 5 pm reservations. We bailed out and went to another restaurant. Either they overbook or can't get the orders out quick enough to allow early diners to complete their meal. Very disappointing. We wont be back.
