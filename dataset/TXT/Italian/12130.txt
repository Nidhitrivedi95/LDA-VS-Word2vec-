0uwQIGlKICIYuRtayVnh7g Good place for greasy, quick carb cravings. Could be the chipotle of italian? They've taken to the new fad of bringing higher priced (quality?) cuisine (e.g. Bravo, Brio) to the masses in a more affordable medium, which is becoming increasing common in other parts of the U.S..

Good topping selections, though the staff here needs a lot of direction in terms of portion. Maybe most of the customers that come here like to have tons of sauce and not a lot of veges. That's just me. 

Usually get the pesto pasta. I like the new smaller size, though don't mind eating half of the large size and saving it for lunch the next day. The piadas are a bit too greasy for me, but manageable when sharing.
