wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg Amazing as always. The service is great. The food is delicious. The decor is farm-dreamy. But, what else could you expect from Sam Fox? I'd recommend the chicken (chef worried I didn't have enough sauce first time I ordered it and sought my table out with an additional bowl just in case) or the spaghetti (noodles very clearly made in house and out of this world).
