K74HYkFjYwhEpJt8HTOxnQ I eat at Johnny's frequently. I  love that this cozy, high end restaurant is located in the heart of one of Cleveland's worst neighborhoods.  It's like a diamond in the rough which is unique and enchanting.  Johnny's Bar is cozy, and offers perfect ambiance for a romatic dinner or a business dinner. The staff is great and Ricky is one of the best waiters in town.  However, I have never loved the food here.  It's always lacking to me.  I eat at fine establishments all over the US and I've never left Johnny's thinking about my meal.  The ambiance and atmosphere is far more memorable.  All of the dishes are high end and sound great, but I never taste anything and go "wow".  If Johnny's could improve their dishes, I'd give them a 5.
