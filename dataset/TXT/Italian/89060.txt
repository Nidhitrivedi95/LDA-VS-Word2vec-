e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw Really enjoyed our dinner here.. the prosciutto and melon starter was fantastic. My friend ordered the veal parmigiana and it was absolutely to die for.. the table voted it was the winner of the night. I tried the alaskan halibut, but found it a little bland. My mom's salmon was better. My husband tried to the spaghetti and clams and enjoyed it, but didn't seem to be blown away.
