Yo8ODT7aFMM2xKUd1yaBVw This place is a MUST PASS!!!  I would have given a zero star if i had the option.  Not kidding we waited over 40 min for our apps, they weren't totally bad but not worth the wait. ( low end strip mall quality at best)  had a few pasta's which were bland and not at all memorable, they completely forgot to order our entrees, even after the server repeated the order back to us.  Not a single apology or anything just defended himself to the end.  at the least have a manager come over.  Rethink it guys!!
