JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw Very poor customer service. I like their 'moules frites' but making a reservation with these people... You better adhere to their schedule, and the person on the other end of the line made me feel like i couldn't be trusted to make a reservation and to show up on his timeline. He was rude and abrasive and i try to be as cordial as possible.

Another time the waitress wouldn't let our table of 15-20 leave without giving her a tip. I don't remember it being written as mandatory, and her attitude throughout the evening didn't entice us to reward her with gratuities.

Domage... The food is good value at a good price.
