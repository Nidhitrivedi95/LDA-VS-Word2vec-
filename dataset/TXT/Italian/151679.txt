KPKQLzVKqLgEPKOWrSCRtg Went to the Monroeville location with the hubs for a late lunch because he brought home leftover chicken dish with pasta one day and promised he'd take me to where it came from.  I didn't order the chicken tho.  I ordered a pasta dish that came out a little on the 'watery' side instead of saucy.  Hubs ordered a much better dish that came out saucy instead of 'watery.'  So we took his leftovers home.  Service is good.  The decor could be a little brighter and not so green and burgundy.
