9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw This is such a sweet little spot. I had a friend visiting from San Francisco and she, along with my husband and I, arrived on a Saturday evening just as the (previously mentioned) wedding party had departed. We were greeted by the super sweet propietor and his wife. We ordered a drink (wine and beer prices were really reasonable) and took in the early 1900's bungalow where the restaurant is housed. There was so much character here (and so few TVs!) I really felt like I was back in Oakland.

We were seated quickly on their lovely patio. It was a gorgeous night and the ambiance was absolutely perfect. Our server admited to being a bit overwhelmed but still managed to give us prompt, humorous, and personable service.

We had brushcetta and a salad for an appetizer. Both were good. For dinner we each ordered a pizza - margarita (excellent), capricciosa (good), and salsiccia con patate (excellent). My SF friend was not as impressed as I was, but I truly enjoyed the food and the overall experience. Will definitely be back. Oh! And we found it on Yelp!
