0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg I was slightly disappointed with the food here.  From all the reviews I read, I thought that the pasta here was going to be exceptional. First off, let me state that the waiter I had was absolutely great and the view of the Bellagio and the fountains was fantastic as well.

Since none of the appetizers sounded appealing to me, I decided to order two pasta dishes.  I first ordered the spaghetti.  On the menu, it simply states "Spaghettti-tomato and basil."  As I started eating it, I realized that it was actually spicy and felt my lips burning.  Given that this is their signature dish, I expected to be blown away and I was not.  I feel that if the food is going to be spicy, they should let you know-this spaghetti certainly had more to it than simply tomato and basil.

The next dish I had was the Stracci-which was their seafood pasta dish that on the night I was there included crab, shrimp, and lobster.  The seafood was laid out on top of thin ribbons of black and yellow pasta.  While the seafood was tasty, I thought the dish was somewhat unimaginative.

Between these two pasta dishes and the bread that came out, which was fantastic, I was full and had to skip dessert.

Would I go back to Scarpetta?  Probably not, especially when considering there are so many fine restaurants in Las Vegas and the fact that with tax and tip, I spent close to $90 just for one person.  At the end of the day, I thought that the food was good but I just expected a bit more.
