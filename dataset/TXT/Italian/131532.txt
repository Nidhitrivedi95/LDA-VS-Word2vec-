Ih0f0UyhFufm3C7kR72DSQ Dining at Chef's Table is an experience everyone should try at least once. Setting in the kitchen gives you a new perspective on how a restaurant functions.  Watching how the food is prepared, plated, and served is a joy to behold. We were seated at 8:30 on a Saturday night and were treated to a 7 course tasting that was simply outstanding. Dante was the first to greet us and ask if there were any food preferences or restrictions he should adhere to. He then went about the task of preparing seven dishes that could only be describes as heavenly. He did this while overseeing the kitchen staff and taking every order from the wait staff. We seriously expected yelling, clanging of pots and pans, and an occasional dropped dish. None of that happened. It was a well oiled machine with the staff doing their jobs at a pace that blew us away.  They managed to talk, joke, and prepare the meals effortlessly.  Now let's talk food.  From our appetizer plate to dessert, everything was beautifully prepared, seasoned, and presented. Our server, David, paired wines for each course and did a spot-on job. His knowledge of wine was impressive (I'm a certified wine specialist), and his table side manner was delightful. Even a few jokes thrown in.  I realize that when you're sitting in the kitchen and the chef is paying specific attention to you, that it would be easy to rate them with five stars, but if you break down the evening to just the food and wine, it was still amazing.  I read the other reviews and have this to say. If you don't eat at a restaurant, don't rate it. If it's beyond your means, don't eat there. And never rate a restaurant after one meal. Seeing as how Dante has only been open a short while, it's a credit to Dante and his staff for this fantastic addition to Tremont and Cleveland.
