gyDTYm_NDWXEHBPGnL-oRQ I love this restaurant, I don't care what you think. LOVE

I'm a carb addict, hardcore. Luckily I'm a running addict as well, and the two go well together. 

State St. Is my favorite location although it can, at times, get overrun by people. I live near the area so sometimes I call for pickup on my way home from work. They've never gotten my order wrong, ever.  I like the dine-in style, I like the consistency, I've never had a bad meal from Noodles.

My current favorites:
Buttered noodles and Parmesan with chicken and broccoli.
Steak stroganoff 
Spinach and fresh fruit salad with balsamic fig dressing
Thai curry soup with shrimp

Runners up:
Pesto cavatappi
Japanese pan noodles
Wisconsin Mac

Stay away from: 
The Indonesian peanut sauté and the Bangkok curry. They're fools to believe they can reproduce those dishes, and I will not disappoint myself by ordering them.
