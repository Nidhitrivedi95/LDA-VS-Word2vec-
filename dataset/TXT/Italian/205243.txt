qeJnMI5RmyJ2TZvkqvjn6Q Sunday night summer dinner with my daughter and husband. Attentive service, good food, pretty much what we expected from a chain Italian restaurant. I ordered the roasted beet salad which was a large enough portion for a meal. My husband had the lasagna and thought it was good. Daughter ordered the pepperoni pizza which was big enough to take half of it home for lunch the next day.
