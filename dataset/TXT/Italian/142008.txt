JOoblYsQjFT-47tkt6om0A I am a 24/7 type of person who's constantly b*tching about the lack of 24 hour establishments in the city that aren't a grimy, terrifying coffee shop or strip club. 7 West is my answer to everything I'm looking for in a hangout, with the bonus of being open 24 hours a day!

I've had numerous birthday celebrations, first dates, brainstorm meetings and post-bar meals at 7 West - it's excellent for all of these things. The food is tasty but what really shines is THE DESSERTS!

If you go to the second floor there is a large display of massive cheesecakes, pies and tortes to choose from that rotates pretty often, depending what they have in stock. My #1 cheesecake to recommend is the Dulce De Leche, which as you can imagine from the combination of dulce de leche + cheesecake + crumb crust is otherworldly. If they have it on hand you'd be a fool not to order it.

There's also a really sweet, partially covered patio in the summer that seats about 15-20 people.
