wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q Never coming back here again this is the worst Romano's Macaroni Grill I've ever been to. The service was shitty the calamari was gummy the prosciutto mozzarella was not that great, I ordered a Italian soda and got an iced tea, it wasn't even that busy but I felt like the whole time my waiter was just waiting for me to leave.
