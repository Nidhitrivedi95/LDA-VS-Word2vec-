y8zlR75tcmvkg49dqdLGDg I'm not a pizza person and only order them occassionally. But i do like thin pizza. Tried several different ones with friends, not bad at all.  Place was clean. Server was okay. 

I wont say that I would be back just to get pizza here hence cant decide whether I should put it a 3 or a 4. I guess considering I dont have negative experience a 4.
