There are a few Giggling Tomatoes franchises now, but I think this is the original. Sitting right on the corner of Queen and Kennedy, parking's a bit of a mess, but there's plenty of room inside.

Their menu is overlarge. Breakfast, pasta, fish, burgers - this place tries to be a deli and a diner and a grill and an Italian restaurant at the same time. It results in them being a little overpriced, a little slow, and a little less well-executed than you'd want. You can hardly complain about lack of choice, though!

My advice is to pretend that they are a greasy spoon breakfast/lunch diner and treat the rest of their signage as a printing error. Their sandwiches are good, their omelets are massive but full of fresh veg, and their fries are pretty tasty.

Pro-tip: The portions are massive, and you would do well to take advantage thereof. 3 people can probably get by on 2 breakfast orders, and 4 can certainly make do with 3 lunches.

Parking Pro-tip: the strip mall just east of them on Queen has tons of parking, and is hardly a long walk.
