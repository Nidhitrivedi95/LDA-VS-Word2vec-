MrmwDgMlL2GtthlAZsJwNQ When jackastors has a long wait list on weekends, we usually go here instead. Although lately I am beginning to prefer this place over jack Astor's if I am planning on eating something versus just having drinks. The giant home made meatball dishes are a great pick, as are their pizzas. The lattes need some work. The only real annoyance is that the music is generally too loud, making conversation a chore because you cannot hear the others at the table. Overall, this place an a good refresh from its previois alias of Alice fazoolies, especially in terms of what is on the menu.
