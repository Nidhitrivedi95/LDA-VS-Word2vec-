OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ Our order to go included fettuccine alfredo with shrimp.  Got home and found out the shrimp was not cooked, at all.  It was mixed in raw! I had to drive back there to get a new one.  I wish now I had just returned our entire order as now I'm worried someone might get really sick.  I won't be going back.
