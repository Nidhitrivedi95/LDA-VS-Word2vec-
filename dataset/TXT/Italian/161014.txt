lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ Had food poisoning when I came here (not from this place). I was not in the right mind to be eating, but I figured some bread and fluids might work. Bread turned into pizza which delicious cheese. My cousin got the 5 cheese I think and it was way better than mine. The ricotta was super good. Started feeling good and ordered a beer with dinner too. It was a nice easy casual dining experience. I plan to go back when I am in town next month.
