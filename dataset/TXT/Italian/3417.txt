_7tBGb6yVoiSiHq9NfQk8A What idiot designed the door away from the parking lot...hostess was terrible ignored us for 10min. ....waitress very kind and funny perfect 
best part so far.....salad and bread came quick but it been 30 mins and no entrée and food was good the portabella mushroom parmigiana was fantastic. ...Okay overall if your not in a hurry and have 2 hrs to waste this is your place ....food is okay service is mediocre
