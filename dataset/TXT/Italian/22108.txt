3glVZZh_vyZH1VvPU0307A I'd like to begin by stating how I consider myself a foodie. I'm a frequent yelp user when it comes to reading reviews in particular cuisines to narrow down my options. Although this is my first yelp review, when it comes to Italian cuisine I strongly do not recommend this franchise. Anyone that wants quality Italian dishes should not come here. Although the staff is friendly and knowledgable, the food quality is atrosous. Both pasta dishes my partner and I ordered were extremely salty and inedible. I could go into further detail, but rather not. Moral of the story, save your time and money. This should not be part of blogto's top 10.
