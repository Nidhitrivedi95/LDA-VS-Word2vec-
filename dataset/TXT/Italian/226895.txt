SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ Had dinner to celebrate my Uncle's Birthday there while staying at Caesar's Palace.  Trevi was full but we were seated immediately. We had a choice to either sit outside to people watch around the forum or go inside with a darker ambiance. We chose to sit outside by a replica of Trevi Fountain and people watch tourists take pictures and pass by.

We tried the Calamari Fritti to start and it was delicious! Our waiter was very informative and said that they dip the Calamari in milk which makes it less chewy.  The marinara/bolognese sauce they used for the calamari was on point too!

My Uncle tried the Capri Coral Crush, He loved it! It came in a martini glass but was like a smoothie. It was a great mango-alcoholic drink!  I ended up ordering a nice glass of Merlot to compliment my meal.

For my main course I ordered the LINGUINE AI FRUTTI DI MARE and it was to die for! It was a huge portion and was so good that I was able to finish it! The Linguine comes with lobster, scallops, shrimp, tomatoes and this excellent fettucine like sauce! Definately could see why it was their signature dish!

My Uncle got the chef's special, kind of like a seafood stew with clams, lobster, scallops and shimp which was in some sort of broth. It was kind of like Vuyabase (sorry for the lack of spelling) He loved it!

Since it was his birthday, they brought out complimentary cheesecake and gave him the choice of that or chocolate cake! That was nice of them to bring it out with a candle lit!

The servers were very cordial and informative and I am definately planning on going back! The only downside is if you're a TOTAL REWARDS member which is the player's card for Caesar's Palace, You can't use your value credits to pay for the meal. Other than that, decent prices for Vegas, about a $100 bucks for the two of us but a very nice meal! GO FOR IT!

I give it 4.0 HEATS out of 5!
