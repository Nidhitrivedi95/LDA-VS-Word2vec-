Z6_gRH_m8FQlKgsNkZKmTg I love this place and am surprised it doesn't get more attention. I've been 10+ times - mostly recently, four of us came for dinner last night. I almost always make a reservation and it's easy to do online. The restaurant is cozy and intimate and in warm weather like last night, you can dine on the patio which is definitely a plus. The best part is the food, as I have never had a less-than-fantastic meal here. 

To start, they bring fresh crusty bread with balsamic and olive oil. Last night, we ordered the calamari and buffalo mozzerella/caprese appetizers, both which were perfect sizes for sharing among four people. The menu has a nice variety but the seafood and pasta are the real standouts. For entrees, we ordered the frutti di mare pasta, salmon, gnocchi, and veal risotto. I tried the first three - all were divine. The spicy tomato cream with lump crab mixed in on the frutti di mare is one of my absolute favorite pasta sauces and if you like scallops, the ones at Lucca are always perfectly cooked and fresh. On previous trips, I've also tried their daily ravioli, seafood mixed grill, and mushroom risotto and all were great. We also ordered the lemon semifreddo and the chocolate cake and highly recommend both. Prices are reasonable, especially for the quality and amount of food. I've also always had great service, even on busier nights.
