VeRHiEbUe_vHprYn8mnezA We were in Arizona from the SF bay area for our son's college orientation. It was our meal before heading to the airport and I wanted good Italian food.  So glad we found Franco's!  We were warmly greeted and seated immediately.  Franco graciously shared a lovely meat and cheese plate.  We ordered a nice house Chianti and settled in for an amazing meal in a warm, friendly environment.  We shared the pasta in truffle/cream sauce, meat sauce pasta (Franco's grandmother's recipe) and an AMAZING rack of veal seasoned and cooked perfectly on the rotisserie.  PERFECT meal, start to finish.  The bread was fresh and delicious, the olive oil was great too!  We consider ourselves to be "foodies" and would recommend Franco's to anyone lucky enough to get a reservation.  Thanks Franco's for a fabulous meal :)
