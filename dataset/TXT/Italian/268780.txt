XJ2dT7pwmutxM4ceQnTVUg Stopped in here with a group of 5 friends during bike night. First the positives:
The pizza was actually pretty good. We also had wings that were decent. Another in our group ordered a philly cheesesteak sandwich that looked yummy. Our service was good. We were actually enjoying our evening and food then came the bad: the check

My husband and I ordered the special which was $22 and change plus he had a soda to drink. Our bill was $35. Why you ask? Because the tip 18% was automatically added to the bill. I asked the manager why the tip was automatically added thinking it may be because we asked for the check to be split. She informed me that they automatically add the tip to groups of 6 or more. Our server then said "Oh, I thought it was 5 or more". Well her loss because I would have tipped more than their automatic tip but I hate being forced to tip especially without any advanced warning (like something printed on the menu). \

Bottom line-there are other choices in this area and we will definitely be going to those before I come back here. If you visit with 6 or more people either go somewhere else or don't sit together!
