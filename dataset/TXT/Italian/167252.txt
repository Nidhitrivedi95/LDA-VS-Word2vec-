Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw Best Garlic Knots I've ever tried. It had the right amount of garlic and came with a marinara dipping sauce. Other items we tried were delicious too, especially the Fried Gnocchi. We came here to try the White Pizza to try in comparison to Secret Pizza however this place isn't a top contender. Don't get me wrong, the food is still delicious here. It was also my first time trying cannolis here as well I liked it enough to try this locally to me. I can't always travel to Vegas for the food :p
