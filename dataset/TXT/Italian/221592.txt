SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg Worst service ever. We ask for a table. They tell us we can sit in chairs and order drinks. Then Went outside and saw tables and manager said we could not sit out there unless we were going to order dinner. Still sitting waiting for a server to ask for our order where we were actually told we should sit. Finally get up and leave and they say have a nice night. Worst service ever.
