4qQVf2lt-47VcQ4v54PEXQ We arrived in Scottsdale this June from New York.  Coincidentally, the owners of Basil & Garlic Bistro - also from NY - had arrived here this Spring.  

Allow me to say this local Italian Bistro is "pure heaven" - fresh, clean, superb food, incredibly excellent Pizzas, marvelous congenial service AND the real deal.  Economical and excellent prices, great menu variety + Italian Food as it should be.

Lucky for us it's only a few mile drive and WE will be regulars.  Take note - there is only seating for 34 and at times, there will be a wait = well worth it!  Better yet, just drop in on a weeknight - as we did yesterday... no wait - just BIG smiles.

To date, in my first 3 months here, Basil & Garlic Bistro is the VERY BEST value I've found and I'm certain you'll be as equally pleased here!
