u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg This. Place. Is. AWESOME!!!! I went over there with my lady yesterday and we sat and drank, and ate, and drank some more for about 4 hours. It was an amazing afternoon. The sun was shining, music was playin, and Postino's was happenin. 

We started things off with some Mimosas (it was still only 11:30) along with the bruschetta. This bruschetta plate was the best thing ever. You had four large pieces of bruschetta, topped with whatever you wanted, and then sliced into four. So we had 16 delicious pieces of warm bread with amazing stuff on top to go with our first round of Mimosa's. 

Noon time came, and it was time to switch to beer. What's this you say? 5 dollar pitchers of beer???? ALL DAY?!?!?! Sign me up! And this ain't no Bud Light sports bar pitcher, this is Hoegarden baby, and Odell's IPA. This is good freakin beer! So the wife got a cup of the soup, and we drank beer, and life was pretty freakin great. 

The sun was shining down on us pretty hard at this point, so we moved onto the couch area to beat the heat. There we sat for another couple of hours, putting away pitcher after delicious pitcher of beer, when the hunger bug snuck up on us again. No matter, PUB BOARD to the rescue! Pretzels and mustard and nuts and cheese and chorizo, and MORE BEER! 

All this food, mimosas, pitchers of beer, more food, and more pitchers of beer, and our entire afternoon cost me $55. That's not bad. 

Oh my oh my. This place is really fun, really cool, and the 3 super cute waitresses don't hurt anything either. Best valentines day ever, and thank you Postino's for facilitating our drunken afternoon! I will be back soon, and back often!
