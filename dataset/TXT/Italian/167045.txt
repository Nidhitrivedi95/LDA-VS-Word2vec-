Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw Went tonight for dinner.  Had the most amazing cheese pizza....crunchy on the bottom, hot gooey sauce, and the most amazing cheese! 
Me n' the hubs both ate dinner for a whopping total of $10.80.  What a deal! You can't even eat dinner for that at McDonalds.  
There were a lot of old folks in there and everybody was talking to each other (I guess they're regulars) and that's always a good sign.  I enjoyed it.  I'll definitely be back.
