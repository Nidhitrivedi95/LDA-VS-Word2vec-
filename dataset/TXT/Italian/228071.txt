SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog Moved here from New York in 2012. Came here on recommendation for lunch for 2. Food wise and taste was average Italian food at best. Nothing better to say it was ok like for the masses. Nothing unique from the pizza and entrees. If you want average and bland Italian food then you will love it. More like a cafeteria dinner style food. There are some excellent authentic Italian restaurants in Arizona. This is 100% not one of them.PAY a few dollars more to eat the best authentic Italian food in the state.As good as any in BROOKLYN OR MANHATTAN NEW YORK. Save time looking at my Italian reviews . I have been eating in excellent Italian restaurants for 56 years now . If you want to wait for fresh cooked I know the top ones to enjoy
