Had to go through the Venetian and another hotel to find it. The host and wait staff were really nice and friendly. I had ravioli and my boyfriend had a spaghetti both were good but they don't come with sides which are $7. The service was kind of slow. We noticed at the bottom of the menu in small font it says that 20% gratuity is automatically added to your bill. When we got the bill there was a "HSE" fee, we assumed that was the 20% gratuity and thus did not tip more than what was already apart of the bill. As if the "HSE" fee wasn't annoying enough, the first print off our bill said it was $10 so we paid what we needed past the $60 then when we got the change back the receipt said the HSE fee was $12. The first bill ticket said the total was $71 so we gave the Groupon worth $60 plus $20 in cash. We got $1 back in change plus the receipt...we never really figured all the cost out and how that came out. To add to things, about 10 minutes after leaving I began to feel really sick to my stomach and my boyfriend began to feel sick about 30 minutes later. So here we are laying in bed at our hotel on our last night in Vegas. I thought the food was good so I'm extremely disappointed. Eat and pay here at your own risk.
