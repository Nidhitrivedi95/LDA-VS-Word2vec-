I went to Paese tonight with a friend for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed it.

I was greeted by a super nice and funny hostess who led me to the bar while I waited for my friend to park and the bartender was just as funny and sociable as she was. We were seated promptly and our waiter was really knowledgeable on everything on the menu. He recommended a good beer for my friend and helped him decide which meal to get, which he wound up liking in the end. The waiter came by a lot, but somehow always at the right time. Never annoying. So in terms of service, this place is phenomenal.

The food was good. We started with the grilled shrimp and the pancetta wrapped scallops which were both fantastic. Thoroughly impressed with both of those. For dinner I got the veal and spinach ravioli and my friend got the potato cavatelli I believe. Something with boar's meat in it. Anyway, both were ok. Not as good as the starters, but well cooked and original. Maybe we shouldn't have ordered pasta. Either way, the food wouldn't stop me from trying this place again. There was obvious attention to detail, might just be my palate.

The atmosphere is good. Not dead, not too loud. Tasteful, simple decor. High ceilings, italian music playing all night. I went on a Wednesday so I'm sure on a Friday it would be even more bustling. 

All in all, a good experience. I'd definitely go back just for the friendly service.
