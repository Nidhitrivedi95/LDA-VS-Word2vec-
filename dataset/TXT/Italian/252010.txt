VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w Food was delicious. But was overshadowed by the scavenger b!tch waitresses at the bar as we waited to be seated. The waitress was asian with tattoos all over her. Real classy huh? She shouldve tattooed her ugly face so i couldve kept my appetite a little better. Anyhow my girlfriend, another couple and I were here for vday and the night was ruined when we were kicked out of our seats so 5 caucasian males in suits can be seated. We did not spend over $300 for dinner to be treated like this. NEVER AGAIN WILL WE COME HERE TO EAT UNLESS I WANT TO BE DEGRADED LIKE ITS THE 50's again.
