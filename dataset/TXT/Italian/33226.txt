When I dined here, in late February 2010, we went through 3 servers. The first server took our appetizer order, and he was wonderful. Then our *new* server came to finish our order for the entrees. When our food was delivered, my entree was completely wrong, he admitted to me that he pressed the wrong button, honest mistake. That was the last of him, I didn't receive my meal till after the rest of my party had finished theirs, and our *new new* server came to drop off our check.

The food was good, I had the lobster ravioli, and my one of my friends had the mahi mahi special. This place is priced moderately, and the view is pretty nice. 

Ask for a balcony seat, weather permitting, real nice scenery.
