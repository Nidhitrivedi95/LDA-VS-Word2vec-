ui8KERxCwlx8B5vWvpXxqg We just ate here this evening. We were promptly greeted & seated. We got the garlic knots, which is a MUST HAVE! Oh my heavens, talk about delicious!! My mom & I split the manicotti, which was the best manicotti we have ever had (and we are pasta lovers, with lots of experience). My fiancé had a calzone which was also very yummy & fresh! My favorite part of this experience was overhearing Dave, the manager giving a newer hostess feedback on her performance. He was so pleasant, and let her know what a great job she was doing. It was SO nice to overhear that because you just don't hear that much anymore. We will definitely be back, and highly recommend this place! It's also very Family / kid friendly!
