ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg We just returned from dinner at Crust.  This is a wonderful small rustic/style restaurant specializing in authentic Italian food, with top notch pizza.  And right in our neighborhood! The service was great, the freshness and quality of the food was impressive, and I loved the unique presentation of the pizza.  Somebody has paid attention to detail and it shows.  The hand stretched pizza is served on a wood board and is an elongated shape.  The crust is fantastic--crisp and chewy.  The pizza sauce is very fresh tasting with just the right amount of salt and garlic seasoning.  We had the original pizza with basil, small medallions of mozzarella, and sauce.  We added black olives and mushrooms.  We also split a Tuscan arugula salad which had white beans on top.  The salad is presented on top of a lovely baked bread bowl.   It was perfect.  Our well trained waiter recommended the butter cake with vanilla ice cream---this was one of the best desserts I've had at any restaurant.  A rich buttery cake, moist and dense with a wonderful buttery flavor.  
The overall experience was 5 star; we will be back.
