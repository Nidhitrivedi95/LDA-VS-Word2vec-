u9R0_pvEkl7QGPJYH3j1sg I come here whenever I visit phoenix because the food is so darn good and the atmosphere is relaxed and easy. 
But seriously, the food is really good. We always try a new dish when we come and have never been disappointed. This time he had a sausage & angel hair Arribiata and I had a chicken eggplant tomato stack in tomato cream sauce. Just outstanding! 
Always a lot of flavor, generous portions, and the service has always been on point. The complimentary garlic bread is always a plus since my husband cannot eat Italian without it. Can't wait to come back on my next visit.
