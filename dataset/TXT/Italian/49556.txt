9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw I found this wonderful little spot when I couldn't get into Pizzeria Bianco because the line was so long. What a great little jewel to be had. They have a wonderful atmosphere in a great set in an old house in the historic area the feel is warm and inviting. Don't rush as this is not a place you should rush...enjoy the time with the one you love here. I would highly recommend.
