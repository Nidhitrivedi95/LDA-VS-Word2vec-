w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q I went here for a bachelor party with 8 guys and we got great service. When we got there, we had to wait about 15 minutes but they were attentive so we did not feel neglected.

Even though this restaurant was in the Forum shops, the restaurant did not feel very commercial like some restaurants that are in mall food courts.

Our server gave us perfect service. Great recommendations and genuinely nice.

Many of us ordered the Lobster and Filet Mignon combo. Great deal especially since they crack all of your lobster shells for you. I think it was a lot of food though. I think two people can eat the half lobster and filet.

A friend also ordered the rib eye and it tasted great.

Service was timely considering we had a large party.

Dessert was a large platter of cakes galore. I think we were about to blow up.

Overall, we would definitely come back here, even though they are so many other very good restaurants in Vegas.  You get good portions, the food is great and the service is great. I think this restaurant is one of the best values in Vegas
