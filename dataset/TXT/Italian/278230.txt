yLrCSSrSnpxB-0ZEPt19jA My favorite pizza in Madison, better than Ian's and Glass Nickel and Greenbush (that's what that basement place on Regent is called, right?).  Big floppy slices that you've got to fold, and that nice orange grease oozes out and drips down your arm.  Sprinkle on some parmesan, get a coke, tuck a napkin in your collar and dig in.  

I'd say that a cheese slice will set you back $2.50 or so, and the more elaborate pizzas get up to around $6.00 a slice.  Barbecue Chicken pizza is a favorite with this humble yelper, and I think you'll like it too.  Free delivery in the downtown area (but tip well as always!)  Open late
