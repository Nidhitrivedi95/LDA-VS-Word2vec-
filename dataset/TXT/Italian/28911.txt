59c3Cp-p5i18xFCKUuCkFQ A good example of nice Italian food - not amazing but it's about 400m from my apartment so I am very happy with it. 
I had Caprese salad followed by Ravioli De Niro which was a good dinner. Also washed it down with some Primitivo. I dined alone and was happy to have good chats with the waiter and maitre D, didn't feel rushed though it was busy for a Tuesday and left feeling full and satisfied. Didn't have room for dessert! 
Good food - decent service and nice wine - can't go wrong with that!
