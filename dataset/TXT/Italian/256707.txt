w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q I was here last week for my boyfriend's birthday. We all got the Lobster Special. If I remembered correctly, it was $99 for 2 and included some sides. I'm not big on seafood, but I enjoyed it. I LOVE their wild mushroom side. 

This was my 2nd time here and the customer service is excellent. Everyone greets you with a smile. The servers and their assistants are kind and helpful.
