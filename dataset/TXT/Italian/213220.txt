r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA I really enjoy the food here however I just stopped in last Saturday and switched up my order, I usually stick with either the pasta or the hot sandwiches, but this time I went with a cold sandwich. I was rather disappointed. Everything about it was just ehhhhhhh. The bread, the salami, and the condiments were just not up to the standards I had come to love about Defalcos. I will definitely be back but I am going to stick with the hot menu.
