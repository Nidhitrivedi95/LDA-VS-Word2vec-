cXgXRqB40CGHEMKQgxLDTg Highly recommend this place if you like options. The price is a flat 7.99$ before tax for an 8inch pizza. You get a base and you can choose the sauces, meats, veggies, and seasoning. They dont limit you therefore you can add as much as youd like at no sacrifise. 

Personally, i got tomato sauce on the inner ring and garlic sauce on the outer ring. On top is parmesan cheese, chicken, peperoni, ham, mushroom, and a sprinkle of oregano. It taste delicious!
