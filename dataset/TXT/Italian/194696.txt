PJgNZN4UYLxP47cy_1c-DQ I cannot say enough good about this place! If you are looking for authentic NY pizza, then you need not look any further. My husband is from Brooklyn and I also lived in NYC for many years and this is just like sitting in a NYC pizzeria. The owner is so nice and will make almost anything on request. When they first opened, they did not have garlic knots on the menu so we would call and ask the owner to make them for us and he always did. Now they have them on the menu so we feel a little responsible for that, LOL. I always order mine extra wet and garlicky. I could take out the entire town of Transylvania's vampire population with one deep exhale after a batch of those yummy garlic knots. They are a must!

We drive close to an hour round trip, all the way from West Buckeye to get our pizza from Taste of Italy and it is worth every mile. The smell of it in our car on the way home has forced us to pull over to the side of the road and eat like starving heathens, right out of the box on a number of occasions. If you are looking for your run-of-the-mill, cardboard box, national chain pizza, this is not the place for you, but if you want authentic, N.Y. style pizza that will make your taste buds wake up and say, "Fuggeddaboudit" like a true Italian, then get off the internet, put your butt in the car and go to Taste of Italy and have some real Italian food! Mangia!
