hr0vxeTzlHx6fTpSSmu2AA We went for the cajun food and it was horrible. The prices were high ant the quality of the food was very disappointing. The rice with the creole dish was hard and undercooked. I have had lots of Cajun/Creole food ant this was by far the worst I have ever had. The staff was functional at best but not welcoming or friendly. We will never go back.
