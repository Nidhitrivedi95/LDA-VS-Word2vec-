VeBNqe1pI5QBxVbquv0uoQ Great service and incredible food.  I travel a good deal and always look for non-chain places to eat.  This is a small chain, but the service was probably the best I have seen in 6 months. 

Food was plentiful and fresh.  Also a great selection of wines to choose from.

Will be back on my next visit to PHX.
