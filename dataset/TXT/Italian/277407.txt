YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw Took my girlfriend here last night. We chose the patio for the good weather. Nick was our server and he made sure all of our needs were met. We started with a Caprese, and followed that with the calamari and tuna tartare. All three were super good, but the tuna stole the show for sure. For the entrees, I got the Short Rib Cavatelli and my girlfriend got the Rigatoni and Cherry Tomato. We also got the brussel sprouts and spaghetti squash to share. Everything was delicious, well coursed, and plentiful. Nick and the staff were amazing and I would highly recommend Bottiglia  if you're looking for a good date spot in a beautiful venue.
