ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag Great restaurant and so happy we came and tried this place out while visiting Cleveland. 

We started with the arugula salad and shared two pizzas, the cheese with an addition of pepperoni and the white pizza! All of the above were excellent and really loved the arugula salad! 

The gelato is so good!!!! Very yummy!!! Can't go wrong with any of the flavors!
