7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ I can't get enough of this place! Its a cute half grocery store half restaurant. The grocery store lets you grab and go for pre packaged meals (salads, sushi, drinks etc). The store itself is super cute! You can find so many knick-knacks plus a great wine selection. There is also a menu board to order sandwiches and personal pizzas. 

Do you like dessert?! So many great treats! The "Old Timer" is a rich chocolate cake. Try it! Also Gelato! Go during Happy hour to get Gelato half off. Yum!

My favorite salad is the Kale & Quinoa salad and I add Chicken Salad mix on top ($3 up charge). Taste so good. Try it! 

Parking can be a hassle but there are several areas (walking distance) to park or valet in the back.

I'll be a customer for life. Thanks LGO!
