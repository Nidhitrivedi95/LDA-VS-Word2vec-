bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg Very sad experience... We prejudged as young kids and treated VERY POORLY. We were sat in the bar at first. We were told because we were all 21 it was the only spot. We did NOT want to sit in the bar and after requesting to be moved, we were relocated to the dining area. Once we received the pizza... I requested pizza sauce, (there was VERY LITTLE/No sauce on the pizza) I was told it was an additional $2.00. It was a. $18.00 pizza... I explained that there was no sauce on it.. I was told it was the "type of pizza" I ordered.. I had no idea the Roman pizza had no/little sauce. Then the manager then had the audacity to explain to me the type of sauce means "little sauce." After this education we will never be back..
