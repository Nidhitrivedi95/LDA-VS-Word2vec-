K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ Great place to see the fountains but this is definitely not a "club". There was a cover band playing when we were there which then became a DJ later in the night. The crowd is definitely on the older side. I'd say the average age was 30-40. Come here to see the fountains and such but that's about it.
