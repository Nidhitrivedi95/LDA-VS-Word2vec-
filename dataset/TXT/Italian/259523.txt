WlINkrwGmUzyR-hoG-pIlw Came here for Winterlicious and wasn't sure what to expect as the menu was small. We had made a reservation, and thank god we did as the restaurant is very small. The ambiance is nice, and the staff are friendly, albeit a little overwhelmed it seems. 

We ordered the calamari (grilled) and it was perfectly cooked over a warm spinach salad. The waiter accidentally brought one fried one out for me, but I told him I had ordered grilled and he quickly went to fix it and left the fried for the table. The meatball was also good, the tomato sauce was delicious and had a nice kick. 

The chicken Parmesan was really good, I usually don't like this dish, but the tomato sauce is what made this dish for me. The sauce was flavourful and had a nice kick to it. The veggies on the side were well cooked too. The gnocchi was good and the sauce was super luscious and tasty.

The deep fried ice cream...AMAZING! it was coated in cake batter and drizzled with berry coulis with caramel and whipped cream. I COULD EAT THIS FOREVER.

We ordered the white sangria, which tastes like juice, but it was still yummy! 

I would definitely come back!!!
