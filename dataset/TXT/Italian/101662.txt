We went there on valentine day (yes it may not have been a great idea but we figured that they are top professionals)  and it sure was a disaster. 
We got a good seat at the back room to the left. E server was not attentive and frankly he did not care. Our water came late and he did not explain the specials well ever. We ordered Proscutto for appetizer, lobster pasta and veal scallopiine , a glass of Melbac wine, instead we got risotto with beets for appetizer and well done veal. Why? The server did not  boer to confirm our food (my date speaks perfect English but the server does not understand us). It took so kong for e risotto to arrive that we just ate it because the server delivered the food and left us for 15 minutes without coming back to ask about the food.  Our food arrived later than 2 other tables who came in at the same time, our water glass went empty for over 15 minutes without being refilled. 
The veal came well done but I overheard the waiter asking the other table whether they want it medium . Obviously the server did not bother asking us . He was simply disinterested . The veal was salty and close to bring tough, the pasta was also salty but the portion was small.   We ate everything but we were still hungry. The portion were smaller than winterlicious. 

I glanced at the other tables. Most couples's food arrived within 15 minutes so they were done within 40 minutes. 
Overall the experience was not fitting to their reputation. Service was horrible and food was substandard. I could have got the salty veal and pasta at Olive Garden or similar grade without paying 38 for,the veal and 25 for the small bowl of pasta. 
The best thing was their bread and olive 

That is sad for a place that prides itself on service and food quality. 

Lessons learned : no more going out on valentine day and will not got back for at least 6 months
