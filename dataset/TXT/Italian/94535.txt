ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA Food was absolutely amazing.  Firs walked up to separate coffee bar area with outside bar stool seating.  Then to the left lounge outside couches and a couple there with their beautiful Great Dane.  Inside cute bar area to the left and nice cozy dining to the right.  Music was coming from a stand in front spinning vinyl :) Awesome!   
Started with the avocado toast, delicious.  Then I ordered the arugula salad with chilled melon and burrata.  Probably my new favorite salad.  I generally do not like cantaloupe or melon but they sliced this do thin and the dressing with all if it together paired perfectly. My significant other ordered the chicken egg white  burrito and loved it. It was loaded and tasty. Will be back again soon for sure
