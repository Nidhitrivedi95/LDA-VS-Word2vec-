Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A Rest in Peace, THE BISTRO BUFFET 

FYI - As of October 15, 2016 the palms bistro buffet no longer carries any seafood whatsoever. 

They are now managed by the Station Casinos 100% and they have yet to determine if they will add in a seafood night. 

The old price for a dinner buffet was $17.99 dinner and $24.95 seafood dinner. 

It is now a straight $14.99 every night.
