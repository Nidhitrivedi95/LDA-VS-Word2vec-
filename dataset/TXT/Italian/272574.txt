xvgj2OVRNVVavdtOomlzTw Tonight we decided we wanted Italian and found La Lanterna on yelp near us. When we walked in the atmosphere was nice. We were greeted by the manager/ only waiter. After a short wait we ordered the beef stroganoff and the Chicken risotto. The beef stroganoff was great especially with fries. A very nice thick sauce. The chicken risotto was slightly different than our norm being made with red sauce, however was still enjoyable. Overall would highly recommend this place and would certainly come back! Cheers!
