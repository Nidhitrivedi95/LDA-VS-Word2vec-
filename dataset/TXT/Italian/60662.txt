aVvMVhCSNT3d4W37Ue1aUw Won't go back.  Saturday night and of the only 2 chardonnays offered by the glass, they only had one, which is a chardonnay I don't like. Bad enough to only have 2 chardonnays on the wine list, but when you're down to one, that's a problem.  The boss (perhaps the owner) refused to open up the chardonnary sold by the bottle so that I could have a glass, which we thought showed a lack of concern for the customer. I Had the shrimp, which were soggy and way over-salted.  My husband had lasagna, which was tasteless.  Bad customer service; bad food. There are too many other restaurants where the food is really good and where management respects customers to ever go back to Caffe Daniel.
