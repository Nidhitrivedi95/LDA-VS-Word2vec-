_VHU9KZUHRLp2Hc2JOKlYg Initially came here for Restuarant Week but was disappointed by the menu so my group and I ordered off of their regular menu and it was FANTASTIC. We started with the winter and goats n' greens salads (both were flavorful) and the beef tartare which was just MOUTH-WATERINGLY TASTY! My bf's mom ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and that is just about as good as it gets, my bf got the Chicken, and I got the Cioppino. The mussels, scallops, crab, and clams were fresh and the homemade sauce was delectable. Nabbed a wine bottle for the table as it was 1/2 off (Rosato, Italy 2012) and it was refreshing- not my favorite, but decent. The service (Ivor, our waiter) was on point, the food was amazing, and the company even better, so overall a 5-star experience here. 

Also, the pesto sauce that comes with the bread is TO DIE FOR. Don't even bother with the butter.
