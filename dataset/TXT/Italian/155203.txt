What a rare question, I almost had a stroke when I was asked.

 "How much of a slice would you like?"

Judging by first glance at the meat selection, a hell of a lot.

I took home the thickest chunk of Salami I've ever seen and some unknown polish sausage I was recommended. Both cuts came to about £5, but trust me it's worth it. They also had a great selection cheese as well, try the Provolone when you visit!
