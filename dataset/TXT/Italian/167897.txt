mJ_ucQ2_3hfTsmCcKb-hgw When needing an escape from the office yesterday, I asked a friend if she was up for lunch. Neither of us had been to Sienna Sulla Piazza yet, and since we're always seeking out new dining experiences, we decided to check it out. 

She made a reservation via Open Table for 12:15. We arrived promptly and were seated very quickly. The restaurant is smaller than I had anticipated but well decorated. I particularly loved the bar that has a beautifully lit wall highlighting the attached shelves filled with bottles.

Though I really wanted to try some of the pastas listed on the menu (the Ricotta Gnocchi and Beef Ravioli looked delightful), I thought that the prices were a bit steep for lunch. I really didn't want to spend $18 on an entree. Instead, I ordered the Classic Caesar Salad, and my friend and I split the Prosciutto & Arugula Flatbread. I am very picky about salads but enjoyed the Caesar. However, I do agree with Rachel C's review that the salad was a bit salty... even without the optional Anchovies. The pizza was descent but didn't blow me away. I felt like something was "off" when eating the pizza but couldn't quite put my finger on it. After having thought about it, I think that the classy prosciutto and arugula toppings did not match the more dive-pizza-joint style cheese, sauce, and crust.

I would definitely be open to checking out Sienna Sulla Piazza again to try some additional menu items. However, I think competitor Il Pizzaiolo right across Market Square - though more expensive for lunch - delivers better value for the money overall.
