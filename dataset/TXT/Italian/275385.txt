yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg My girlfriends and I were in old town Scottsdale for lunch. Came upon the Italian Grotto which smelled good, Frank Sinatra music playing and a lovely outdoor patio. We decided to stop and unfortunately met the owner Gary. We have never experienced such a rude, crass individual.  The cushions on the seats needed replaced, and the table was less than steady. However, this was not an issue in the grand scheme of things, as Gary became quickly ruder as the seconds sent by. Simple questions concerning the menu were met with contempt.  For example, he would not bring us glasses of water, but only bottled water that we had to pay for.....interestingly there were glasses of tap water galore at other tables.  It was hard to believe that 4 confident, smart and outspoken women would be left speechless by such overt disrespect for the patron.  As were about to get up and leave before ordering we were rescued by a new waiter; Kris. He was polite, kind and attuned to our needs. 

By the way, the food was fine-nothing out of this world. The wine was good. The bathroom was disgustingly dirty.   

As we looked back on the day and finally read the reviews about the angry, erratic, rude owner, we wondered if this was all a marketing ploy??

One might wonder if the health inspector should go in and assess not the food in this restaurant, but rather the environment.

As a local I will not be taking my out of town guests there again. In fact, I will be quite vocal with others about this disturbing restaurant encounter.
