D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg I am being generous with a three star review as I was very disappointed with service at Nove. As a resident of Vegas and having been to other upscale restaurants in many of the casinos I was surprised at the bad experience. 

Last night was dinner for my mom's 73rd birthday and we had tickets for an 8 pm show at the Pearl . 
I got a coupon for $25 off $75 for last night only and made a 6:45 reservation so we could go after o got off work and still have time to enjoy a full service meal before the show . I arrived at NOVE at 6:22 ( I checked the time because I knew we were early and hoped maybe we could be seated early.  

We were checked in and told we could wait in the bar and they would come and get us . I waited until 7:05 before approaching the desk as we had not been seated yet or even told that they were running late .. we were told we were next .. at 7:10 we were seated .  A waiter came to take our drink orders and told us since we had a show to get too , pasta was out best choice as it would be fastest. We chose to skip appetizers , go for pasta dishes and skip desserts as by the time we ordered and got our food it was 7:45 , so we ate quickly and I asked for the check when the food arrived so I could eat and run. We just made our show on time. 

What I had planned as a treat to my mom turned out to be a quick meal, with pasta that was ok, but not impressive enough to make me go out of my way to go there again . 

On a Friday night with a show and a coupon going out to ticket holders , they should not make reservations they can't accommodate ! 

Two sangrias and two pasta dishes came to exactly $75 so I will not argue with the price after coupon , but I won't be going back. I had better service last time I was at the Palms for a show at the social table bar and the food was good but it appears to be closed for renovations now .
