UQiUVCtG-rJxoriuEv1RRQ Great lunch and dinner spot in the art district of old town Scottsdale. We had the turkey club which had carved turkey, 2 slices of provolone, bacon, tomato, etc on sourdough. Also the egg salad sandwich which also had lettuce and tomato on sourdough. The egg salad was not too heavy and the red potato salad was amazing. I probably could've eaten a whole plate of just the potato salad. The restaurant is very quaint, has some eclectic music playing as I'm pretty sure I heard a jazz song, French language song, and Lady Gaga song while we were there. I may try out sitting on the patio next time as there was a musician playing across the street. Overall I would definitely go back, I want to try some of the homemade desserts next time.
