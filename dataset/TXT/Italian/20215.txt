3-6biVwm7VwPZ-k67jml-Q First things first, every time I have been here the pasta is cooked perfectly and the fish is some of the freshest I've ever tasted. Homemade sauces are fabulous, the owner, Giovanni, is friendly and welcoming, and Rosario, will cater to your every need. 

I have read the negative reviews, and surprised at how taken aback that people are that fresh, homemade food and desserts are "expensive." I guess Olive Garden works for some, but if you want truly homemade, catch of the day come here. Ask for Giovani, I've never received bad service and neither has the dozens of people I have sent here.
