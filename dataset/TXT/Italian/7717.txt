Food: The new pork tenderloin sandwich is great.  It will do the job for any Midwesterner. They still offer the best of their original menu too.  Fries were bland and undercooked.  The onion rings had skin left on them under the breading. The "Tractor Soda" is horrible.  Bad idea, bad taste.  Even the Kalil fountain was better.  The line was out the door and across the front, halfway to the parking lot.  How about some table service?
