277ETKOLg1XreTWL8hGlHw Molto Bene just opened in Lakewood not long ago, right next to India Garden.  My girlfriend and I came here for dinner with a group of 16 Yelpers for supper club.  It's a pretty small place in a house-like building.  The place is really nicely decorated and clean.  

They had our table ready with a nice hand written welcome sign, which we all thought was a nice touch!  The complimentary flat bread with EVOO/balsamic for dipping was ok, but a few of the pieces were a bit charred for my liking.  Appetizers came out quickly and the servers filled our water glasses without having to ask.  They don't have a liquor license, but you can BYOB.  I wish I would've known that beforehand though.  With the building being very small, the kitchen is tiny with only 2 chefs, so it really took forever for our entrees to come out...I mean a long time.  The kitchen was clearly overwhelmed, but having grown up in the restaurant business, I know how that can be.

The servers were fantastic though and they apologized for the long wait a number of times.  I ordered the Eggplant Parm with a side salad and it was pretty good..I was starving, so I inhaled it pretty quickly.  My girlfriend ordered the Penne alla Carbonara and it was good, but I think I  could easily make that at home.  The head chef is from Italy and he came out to chat with the table afterwards.  I couldn't hear what he was saying, but he had a cool accent.

In addition to serving Italian fare, Molto Bene has a nice walkup  gelato counter with some amazing flavors!  I had the Espresso and it was magnifico!  When I'm in the Lakewood/Rocky River area, I'll be sure to stop in just for the gelato!  I'd come back to dine in with a smaller group and when it's less busy though.  I'll say, 3 stars for the dining experience and 1 extra for the amazing gelato!

Overall, I enjoyed my dinner there and hope the restaurant does well!
