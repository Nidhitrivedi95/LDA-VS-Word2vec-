wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg First off, Paul you are the man! Seriously. You made my night. 

This is not my first time visiting North. I get excited anytime I get to go here. Had a wonderful dinner and couldnt resist but to share my experience. This place has incredible service surrounded by a perfect balance of home cooking and a beautiful night out on the town. Its very reasonably priced in my opinion and I haveny had anything on the menu that I havent liked. Althought the bolognese is the best. 

Danielle is our favorite server and if youre going anytime soon, try their Apple Bourbon cocktail for a perfect balance of fall and winter. 

You guys rock. See you again soon!
