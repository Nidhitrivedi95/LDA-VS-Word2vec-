m1Mk8bYVgKOX_KPGccU6Sw Had lunch there today and ordered a Margherita pizza. First time in my life that a Margherita pizza was turned into a GARLIC pizza.Dollops of minced garlic polka dotted the whole pizza. Close to inedible. When will Italian restaurants learn that authentic Italian cooking just has a hint of garlic, it is not the main ingredient. No one in that restaurant, management or the kitchen staff, knows anything about Italian food. I am only sorry I could not give it a -5 star rating. Stay away!!!!!
