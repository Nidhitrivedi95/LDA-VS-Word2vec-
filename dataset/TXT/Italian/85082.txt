dNHDXn2ot4mFc2YfIFBNhQ This is my second visit to this particular Carrabas and I did not have a good experience.  First we were treated badly, then they tried to change that, but the damage was done.

First let me say I do not send food back in a restaurant.  I can count on one hand the number of times I received a restaurant meal that I couldn't eat, however.  This was one of them.  I had the sirloin skewers with onions and tomatoes.  The plate was hot, but the food was ice cold.  The meat was cooked, but cold inside.  My side of fettuccini was hot around the edges and cold in the center.  The pasta was gummy, not "al dente".  

When I told the waitress my meal was cold, she practically yelled at me that I was not in my seat when she served it.  I had sat down as she walked away because I went to wash my hands.  I felt like a child being scolded.  She said she would get the manager as there were similar problems with other meals at our table.  She made it clear that we had our meals, however, and that was that!  No one was going to do anything more!

A little while later she returned in a more conciliatory attitude, offered my table mate a chance to order another meal, but frankly, we didn't know what someone might do to our meal since we complained.  

I just decided to take my meal home and heat it.  My friend ate nothing.  We were charged a reduced rate for the meals, but the experience means we won't go back there.  

I will forget the cold meal, but I will never forget how I was made to feel.
