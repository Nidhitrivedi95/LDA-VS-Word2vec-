Case in point, our table ordered: a whole chicken, a roasted corn pizza (vegetarian), a fish sandwich on lettuce with a salad (paleo), and a fish sandwich on bread.  For dessert, we tried the peanut butter pie and red velvet cake - both served with amazing gelato, made fresh. 

Everything was super delicious - impressive flavors, not too heavy. The desserts were incredible. The service was really pleasant and the atmosphere is cute. We'll definitely be back soon!

The only downside was that the wine is pretty pricey by the glass. We solved this by ordering a $15 bottle of wine.
