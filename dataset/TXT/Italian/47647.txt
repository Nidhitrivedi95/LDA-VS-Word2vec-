8yiLVWzJyyTEhYE0fVNvlA I've been to Il Mulino in NYC many times and have never been disappointed.  I've eaten at this Il Mulino in Vegas a few times and always had a flawless experience until the other night.  Don't get me wrong, the food is always prepared and served as ordered and it's absolutely the highest quality.  My only issue was a rude comment the waiter made when one of my guests asked for another piece of parmesan cheese, which is basically a "no-charge" appetizer. A few minutes earlier, I had asked for another piece and the waiter cut two smaller pieces and put it on my plate.  When my guest asked for another piece, the waiter said "I just gave him two".  It was said rather rudely, not taking into account that it was also on my plate that was used for other appetizers as well.  That being said, the captain and the meal were on point but I don't think the experience was flawless.  Maybe they should have offered a paid option, which we wouldn't have minded.
