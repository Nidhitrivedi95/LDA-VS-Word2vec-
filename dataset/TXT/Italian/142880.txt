js9rQZAlA5rr7oSBRRcCDw Prime real estate in Yorkville for years, the duo of Raymond Commisso and Leslie Chan have broadened their horizons, and our options, by opening in the most coveted spot of Market Lane in Woodbridge. The same menu of fresh al dente pasta like angel hair spagheti al pomodoro and basilico, and tagliollini with black tiger shrimps, arugula, and cherry tomatoes, is irresistible. Charbroiled or cornmeal encrusted calamari; humoungous calzone; lightly breaded lamb chops stuffed with prosciutto, spinach and mozzarella-we've enjoyed them all again and again. The pasta sauce is rich and tangy, and pasta is also served whole wheat or gluten free. A relaxed patio with refreshing cocktails and a sociable vibe; it's easy to linger here well into the evening.
