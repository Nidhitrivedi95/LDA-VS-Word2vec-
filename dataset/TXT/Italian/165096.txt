m1RrPKgNleBoGYdnRRhmGw shopping is a serious sport and sometimes you need some sustenance to help you continue on. 

what i ate:
- roast beef panini
- bagel with cream cheese

pros:
- food was pretty good. everything was made well and the way you ordered it
- decor: the pods were a fun and chic place to sit and rest from all the crazy shopping at city center. true with the style of the rest of the city center the pods were very well decorated
- alcohol: they serve alcohol, but itll cost you an arm.

cons:
- PRICE: good god the prices were outrageous. the roast beef sandwich was $10 and for that price i expect waiter service. the bagel was $4. a yogurt parfair was $6. it was so expensive that i didnt even order anything to drink. 

would i come again? not unless i was dying of hunger while shopping.
