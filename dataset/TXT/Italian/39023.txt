I've ordered delivery twice so far, and both times they've been earlier than they estimate (first time they were a minute early lol, the second like 20 minutes).  They even call to let you know they're on their way, and the drivers are super friendly.  The pizzas are tasty, especially for their price point.  The first time I ordered a cheese/half pepperoni pizza, and it was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Oddly enough there was one super tiny slice that had no cheese on it lol.  I couldn't explain it.  Second time it was the margarita, which was good.  The wings are big and meaty, and have always had tons of sauce.  Great experience.
