2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg I have passed by this place several times while visiting Echo and Rig. It was only recently I decided to come here for a simple lunch with a friend.

The place is charming, and has plenty of seating indoors and outdoors. We went to the counter to order, and picked up a steak sandwich, a pasta dish, an eclair, and a chocolate cake.

My friends pasta came out pretty quick, as did the desserts. My steak sandwich took probably 20 minutes, and that is being conservative. My friend had already finished his meal by the time my sandwich came through. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait. 

The eclair was good, but that was about it.
