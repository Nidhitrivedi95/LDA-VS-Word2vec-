fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg I went here on a Friday after work for some dinner. The parking can be a challenge so have some patience. 

I have had this place bookmarked for several years but I have never really found myself in the area to take advantage of this place. I was trying to decide on a couple of Korean dishes. There was one that was cooked in a skillet with rice and the dish that I finally chose was the Spicy Korean dish with beef and noodles. I'm really not a more spicy the better aficionado. I don't mine a little heat as long as it compliments the meal. I thought the spiciness to this dish was just right. They give you a huge portion and our waiter was always there to refill my water glass because my mouth was en fuego at times.

The cost was under $12 and a good deal for the amount of food received. The service was excellent and my wife really enjoyed this place as well. I will be back!
