jOseCpGmgbQWEfX2Wn_TGQ A classic Italian restaurant. Tablecloths and such, but not too pretentious or upscale. Just a good restaurant. Service was excellent and attentive. The atmosphere is somewhat traditional, and business-like. You'd think you were in a scene in the Godfather. 

But that's not what made it great.

The food was exquisite. From the perfect Italian breads, already brushed with olive oil, to the fluffy pasta crepe and nuanced sauce of the cannelloni, it was superb.

But that's not what made it great.

The wine list was thorough, but I just had the house red, which was a nice Chianti.

But that's not what made it great.

The cannoli. Don't leave this cannoli. OMG. I am a huge fan of a proper cannoli. By proper, I mean the filling should not be chalky. It should definitely not be custard. It really shouldn't be ricotta, but it's a cheaper cheese. The PROPER cheese should be mascarpone. The waiter promised it was, and every bit as good as what grandma used to make.

It was. I wanted to cry, it was so good. The filling was perfect - no chalkiness, no grit, no dryness. The shell was also perfectly cooked, just the right thickness and crispiness. It was like an out-of-body experience.

Go here at least for the cannoli. Stay for the dinner too. Fantastic place, and I'd wager the best Italian in the southwestern United States.
