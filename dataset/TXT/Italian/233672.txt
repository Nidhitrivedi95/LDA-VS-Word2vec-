tovUJgSCxi2JfUtP9eNQcA Expected a Friday night to be busy, and it was to a certain degree. Pick up would be about 30 minutes from the time of order until ready. Went inside at exactly 30 minutes and waited for a few before the pie was ready, I had no issues with that. Additionally, they were friendly and had great product knowledge (from the little interaction I had with them). Pizza was absolutely amazing!!! I was very surprised at how great the pizza was. I'll definitely be ordering from here again! Inside could've been a little cleaner considering there were so many people working this evening. Lastly, hometown Phoenix Suns were playing this evening but college ball was playing on their only TV. GO SUNS!
