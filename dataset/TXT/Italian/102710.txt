FIr6iGroJz6OP1m9vo3f9w This place was okay only. The pizza was mediocre and service was strange to say the least. My boyfriend and I went for lunch, we were the only people there- 3 different servers were rotating coming to check on us, but didn't seem that they communicated to each other who was helping us.  The food took forever. Probably won't go back.
