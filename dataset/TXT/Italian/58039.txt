ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg My girlfriend and I love Crust and frequent here often. They have amazing pizza, the Rustica is enough for two, and we usually split a salad. They have whole wheat crust, upon request, which is actually really good. There service is awesome and we always enjoy ourselves when we visit. They have a great wine selection by the glass and by the bottle. Our favorite is the red blend that is very unique, let it breathe though. They also have many flat screen tv's so you can keep up with what ever sporting event is on. The atmosphere is casual, but it can get noisy if the restaurant is full. The only time we've ever had poor food is when we do pick up. It's always been hit or miss then. We've never had a bad experience actually visiting the restaurant, which explains the 4 out of 5 stars.
