GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ For a place that has beer on its name it has a very limited selection of craft beer, that's why I gave 3 stars. I was a little disappointed when I sat down at the bar and saw the menu. Even the burgers doesn't look great on the paper. they taste very good, though. I ordered it medium rare and it was right on, very tasty, finger licking good. Perhaps they should rebrand it and take the beer out of the name.
