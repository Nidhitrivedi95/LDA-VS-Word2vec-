w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A Really like their food...BUT THEIR SERVICE SUCKS!!!!. Been there a few times and always have had a service issue. called twice today and was put on hold each time by ashley for 5 mins. Second time was disconnect. Spoke with jesus the mgr. and got the same excuse given before about being too busy taking care of other customers. I informed them that I was a customer as well but tgat didnt seem to make a difference. Just decided to get a pizza from BJ s . If it is half as good it will be worth it . Maybe if if I had said we were ordering 5 large pizzas and several desserts it might have made a difference.
