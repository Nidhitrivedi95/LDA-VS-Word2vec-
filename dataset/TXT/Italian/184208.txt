Being from New York, it's been SO hard to get good pizza around here!  Yeah, people will tell you a bunch of places, but they really are disappointing.  There's more to pizza than putting, "New York" in the name...

Familia pizza is really good.  The owner is a super nice guy from New York, and his son helps out.  The pizza is big and thin.  The crust is a big issue, and they have perfected it.  Great texture and taste.

By the way...you must must MUST try their cannoli.  His son makes the cream from scratch, and it's the best cannoli I have ever had in my life.  You can taste the riccotta instead of tons of sugar. 

AND they sell pizza by the slice, which is hard to find in Vegas.  Go there.
