_T2Aa3Vf5t68PqqxvzoX0Q Pizza was pretty good, and the wine selection was decent. I've never had an entree here that's really stood out though. It does seem like ownership put a lot of effort into the rooftop terrace reno. Aesthetically, it's pleasant. However, it's still pretty noisy up there with all the traffic from rte 22 and wasn't very relaxing. Hope they find a way to dampen the noise when the patio reopens this spring.
