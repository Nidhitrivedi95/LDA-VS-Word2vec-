this place is incredible. I normally don't do Italian restaurant... cause NOBODY cooks better than my Italian grandma could. And most Italian restaurants these days have been americanized. 

I was told to get the calzone. My sister ordered the pasta which was very good. The price for the calzone seemed a bit high for a typical calzone, but that didn't matter to me. I ordered it. 

Then it came to my table. HUGE! Half as tall as me this calzone. And filled with all sorts. Of course I was unable to eat it all and took me 2 days to finish it off. 

So no matter what you order here, you'll need a doggie bag or share a plate with someone. Really... portions are giant!

But outside of the food, they have this lovely Italian group that come in and play giving it a real Italian feel. And they play the mouse song my Italian family played when I was young. 

Really a lovely restaurant!

PS: this was one of the many restaurants that have attributed to my few extra pounds I gained in my 2 weeks in Pittsburgh. American food is YUM! Going to gym! ha ha
