YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw Wonderful!! My family and I enjoyed the food, atmosphere and amazing staff. Heidi was our server. She was great & very helpful with our indecisiveness on food and drinks. If you have the pleasure of having her as your server, take her up on her knowledge of the menu. 
We had the braised short ribs which was out of this world delicious. The ricotta dumplings were exceptional!! We also had the wood fire NY steak. It was absolutely amazing. Melts in the mouth. 
I started with a drink recommend by Heidi. It had a sorbet ice cream in it. Lovely, light and refreshing drink especially for a hot summer Vegas night. I finished with a chocolate and coffee drink which was just as tasty. 
We were full but managed to squeeze in a slice of their NY cheesecake. Wow, we finished it. Another great recommendation of Heidi's. So good and worth every calorie. 
If your in the neighborhood and hungry, I highly recommend this place. You won't be disappointed!!
