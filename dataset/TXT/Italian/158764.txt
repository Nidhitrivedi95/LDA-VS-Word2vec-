LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA The best Italian food I have ever had from a chain restaurant!  If you are staying in Vegas, get out of your hotel and take a walk to Maggiano's.  You will need the walk back to your hotel to help digest the fantastic meal you just ate.  I have eaten at Maggiano's a number of times around the country and now I find myself seeking them out when I travel.  If you like calamari you must try theirs.  I think my favorite dish so far is Mom's Lasagna.  Be sure to save room for the Tiramisu or Pound Cake with Caramelized Bananas.  They also have a very good wine list.
