nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Everything was perfect except it was extremely loud. And our souvenir glasses. 
We ordered the drinks in very nice souvenir glasses. We usually do this at all the tourist places that offer this. We thought our daughters would love them. They love watching the cake boss. Usually they will bring you a new glass wrapped up and you're set. 
When we got back from our trip we gave the boxes to our daughters and they opened them and here they were the glasses we drank out of and had beer residue and lemonade residue in it. How embarrassing. The beer one smelled so bad. I thought we were getting new glasses. They could have at least washed them. Good thing we gave them to our kids and not someone else. They were horribly dirty. 
Our Server was explaining the appetizers and I heard absolutely nothing he said. 
We were sat at a small table for two and I maybe said 5 words the whole time. Because it was too hard to carry on a conversation. 
It was our last night in Vegas and I wanted something romantic and memorable. 
When I think of Italian food I think romantic and intimate. 
It was not. That's the only thing I didn't enjoy. 

Food and drinks were amazing.
