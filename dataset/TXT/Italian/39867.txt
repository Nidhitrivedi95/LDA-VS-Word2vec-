Mario Batali, sir, you are an amazing amazing man. 

Went for a friend's birthday. Upon looking at the menu, I was struck that the food only took up one page while the wine list took up about 10. My kind of place. We were talked into ordering the $72 a person cut of dry aged rib eye. Also we ordered the lamb ragu, plate of jamon iberico (¡Viva España!), cauliflower au gratin and potatoes. 

Our meal started with the amazing rosemary scented rolls served with butter and bag fat. Mmmm bag fat. The lamb ragu consisted of handmade pasta and was delightful. 

Now for the steak. OH MY WORD. MAMMA MIA! Apparently, it's been voted best steak in the nation. I was skeptical but man oh man was it amazing. Tender, melt in your mouth awesomeness. The sides were pretty good but it was definitely all about the dry aged bone in rib eye. 

It was hard to believe we even had room for dessert but we split the tiramisu. Yum yum. 

When looking at the menu, I felt the prices were steep for pasta and steak but it was definitely worth every penny. The staff were awesome especially our server Helen.
