x6PA-2j7LpZAYFo2VojmQQ Used to be a huge fan of Little Fin and would visit on the occasional month for lunch. I loved their calamari po boy, but recently they had a menu change and took it off. They now serve tacos, if you're into those! Since they didn't have the po boy, I ordered their crispy haddock sandwich. My fiancé used to order that alot over the summer and it was quite yummy with a thick piece of haddock sticking out of the bun. To my surprise, the haddock piece is now alot smaller and thinner. We used to make our way downtown, a 30 minute drive from where we are for lunch here. Not sure if we'll be returning anymore, or as frequent. Maybe if they start changing back to their old ways. Portion sizes are small..  But sides still taste the same. (thank goodness!)
