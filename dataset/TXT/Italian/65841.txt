bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw We used to love Vivace but with this last experience we probably won't be back for a long while. They changed their menu a couple of weeks ago and it's rather lack luster. They retired some of the absolute favorites (like the bolognese pappardelle) in favor of some new twists and honestly, they just weren't as good - everything was just okay (some cases like the Caesar were less than okay). It's a shame because this place has great views, service is always good and we've usually enjoyed ourselves. But for the money you'll spend, there are definitely better food options available.
