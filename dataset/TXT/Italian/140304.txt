JK_DiDwbl7HX5OhCAh3h4g This was one of the worst service experiences I have ever had. The staff were cursing, yelling and seemed notably upset. Our waitress left the table midway through taking our order frustrated that we had questions about the menu. Another waitress made the people next to us move tables twice. 

It seemed they forgot to come and take our orders - we eventually had to flag them down to order. They didn't have the first two beers listed on their menu that we wanted to order.

One of our meals didn't arrive. It took 10 minutes to track down the server to tell her. At that point there was no apology. The food was brought out just in time to be packed up and we were still charged for it. This entire process took HOURS.

The patio looks nice, but don't be tempted.
