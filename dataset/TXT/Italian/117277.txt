GXDRFAunLh0aRao6ERnM4A Wow this is by far the absolute worst slice of pizza I've had in Vegas! The taste was horrible. Not just because I've lived in NY all my life and am accustomed to a good slice from most places. I can appreciate a good pizza no matter where it's made but just pure taste of this pizza was worse than a frozen pizza. Stay away! Save your money.
