2JYszoQKgJj6pPbaN7cLwQ This place is terrible.  Horrible. Other than the ambience, there is no reason to go. The bartenders have no concept of wines even though it's a martini wine bar. The food is ridiculously over priced and tastes like it came in frozen. It's 8$+ for a flat 16 oz miller light.  The 7$ add on salads normally come out browned and soaked in dressing to the point of soggy. You can pay 20$ for three cold raviolis though! The service in no better than eat n parks ..."welcome to asiagos can I start you off with something to drink", is how your greeted even though it has one of the biggest obnoxious drink menus you'll ever see. The wines are all wines you can find in your local liquor store, they just mark them up by 400%. The place is just so half fast in every aspect. Save your money and go to one of the other good established restaurants down in the north shore.
