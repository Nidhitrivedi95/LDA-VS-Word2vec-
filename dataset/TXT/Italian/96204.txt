eqQnIjAAhOUuHqK6gTWRXw Siraya was the one bright spot in our visit.  Sweet, helpful, and presented us with wonderful service.  The food was mediocre, and I was disappointed that the only thing I was interested in on the menu they were out of.  If we gave this place another shot it would be specifically to see our lovely server and enjoy a well made negroni.
