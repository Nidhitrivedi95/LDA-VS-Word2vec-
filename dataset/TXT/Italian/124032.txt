I don't love you back, ice cream. 

$5.50 for ONE scoop and another $2 for one more scoop. Served in a small cup that you can easily wrap your hand around. What has our world come to?

I got the pineapple ice cream, thinking it would be some Dole-pineapple taste. Wrong! There's barely any pineapple flavor! It's more creamy-flavored or some kind of coconut flavor. It's hard to even tell that it's pineapple without knowing you bought it. Not great.

The service was really rushed. The guy behind the counter asked us if we were ready while still skimming through each flavor. Everything looked good on the outside, but for $5.50/scoop, I think I'd rather go to Sbarro's or some Italian gelato/ice cream shop. Ciao, ciao!
