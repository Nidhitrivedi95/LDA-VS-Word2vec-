SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg This place was recommended by a local bartender who said the restaurant has great Ambiance and wonderful food. He was right. The bad news is the parking is very small. The service is not so great. We waited an hour and 10 minutes for bread. An hour and 30 minutes 
for our food. We were seated at 8:05 and don't be fooled the manager said that he could not give us the happy hour prices as the computers and menus change over automatically. After reading some of the other reviews I know now that that is not true. The service was nothing special and you have to pay automatic gratuity. Overall the food  is spectacular but it wasn't worth the hassle.
