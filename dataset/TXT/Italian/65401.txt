First time here today for thanksgiving brunch. My friends have raved about this place for ages and have been to several locations, thought I'd give it a try. 

I had the frittata - it was good. Salad on the side is a wise choice as this is a heavy meal and fries would have been too much. The slice of fresh baked bread, while tasty, was a bit too much bread for me. Overall it was a good and satisfying meal, good value. Atmosphere is good. Location is convenient and the service was great. 

The bottomless coffee is a big seller for me. While I wasn't super impressed overall (like, I still don't know what the "big deal" is about) I will try this place again and order something different.
