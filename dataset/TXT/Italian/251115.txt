vQq_sX0kSAUdT3yLW06q5A You ever go to one of those places that the food in the pics always looks great so you go there and order it and it's really bland and nothing special?

This is one of those places.

The part that bugs me most is we decided to try something new when we were heading to the BOMB New Mexican places in town which is right across the street. We talked ourselves into something new. Oops


The prices are reasonable. That's the only reason it's not getting a 1 star
