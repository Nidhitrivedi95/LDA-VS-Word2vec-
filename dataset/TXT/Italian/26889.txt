4qQVf2lt-47VcQ4v54PEXQ We came in kind of late (8:20 pm) yet they were graceful to find us a perfect table and make it super romantic and pretty. We ordered the specials (mine was delicious shrimp with sun dried tomatoes and poetic& tasty spaghetti made al dente just like 5 stars restaurants in Europe). My husband had chicken with delicious arrabiata sauce and egg plant graced by rigatoni pasta:)). We were impressed and are huge plates of food even though we both are thin people. We were blessed to order the tiramisu to go and enjoy it today. Amazing!!:)) I highly recommend this restaurant.
