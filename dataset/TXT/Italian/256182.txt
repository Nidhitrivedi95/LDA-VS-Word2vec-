My husband had the veal pavarotti which he really enjoyed.  Our two friends both had the fettuccine fellini which they raved about.  At the end of the meal they brought a plate of grapes and strawberries which were deliciously sweet.  The owner came around and chatted with us for a bit.  We really enjoyed our time and look forward to going back!
