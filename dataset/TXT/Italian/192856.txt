pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ By reading the other reviews , I am guessing I went there on a bad night.
I see lots of people complimenting their marinara sauce, so it can't be that bad.. but the one I was served was either the end of the batch of they ran out and had to use some baught in the store.
Their pasta were very bland, nothing out of the ordinary, store baught pasta are just as good.
The worst part, to me , was their garlic bread. i refuse to believe that what i was served is what they normally serve. I look, and tasted, like frozen garlic bread from the store, only with more garlic and more cheese added.
I had a garlic taste lasting for days after that one..
Like I said , after reading the other reviews, something must have been wrong when I was there , was the chef off ? maybe they didn't receive some deliveries ? Maybe they had tons of cooks calling sick ? 
I am not sure , but I will have to come back , for sure it won't be as bad..
