uOJ87zqbU1MtShCSHDkiyw I've been here several times for happy hour and dinner. If you're coming for happy hour on the weekend beware, the place gets very full and it can be a challenge to find a seat. I'm an Italian food fanatic and I must say they do a really solid job. Some things are a little different from back east but everything is tasty and well executed. The only negative about Va Bene is sometimes the service is a little slow. It's like after all of this time in business they don't know when to expect a crowd... really? Don't get me worng, it's never been so slow that I wanted to leave or anything, it's just that it shouldn't take that long to pour a glass of wine. Oh by the way, the Calamari is really good, lightly battered and cooked properly -- try it.
