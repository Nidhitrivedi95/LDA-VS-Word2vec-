Second chef was rude as can be, Tip for him, the pizza cooks faster when your not opening the door every five seconds to look at it. Also during your rush maybe have a couple pies going so there would be less wait time. The whole reason I'm writing this is that a girl had a slice of cheese to go that got cold. She went up to chef and asked for him to warm it up or replace it. He took he cold piece and put it back on the pizza bar to be reserved and grabbed her a fresher one. I would have left right then but figured i had a whole pizza coming so i wouldn't have any of those scraps. The whole thing was greasy and nasty. Stay away from this place, they have plenty of good places right across the strip. Worst 25 min wait for what i was severed .
