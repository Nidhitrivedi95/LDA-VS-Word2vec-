JH3zKlfslbSVeA_KsAaRRQ So apparently Splendido is changing owners this summer. I can only hope that the experience will stay the same, as the service is impeccable and the food on point. 

The foie gras is world class, and the lobster and scallops main has the perfect amount of butter, avoiding the oily mess that you're left with in other high-end restaurants.

Reservations: 5-7 day advance recommended.

The Damage: ~140pp, pre-tax, tip, drinks

Extra Tid-bit: Nice view of the kitchen. Though glass partition makes it impossible to hear the action.
