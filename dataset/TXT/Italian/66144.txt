BmuIoB6KQ8crkjhmuXSwWQ If I could have given this place a 0 out of 5 stars, I would have.  I love my veal sandwich and since moving to the neighborhood from Woodbridge, my husband and I have been on the hunt for a decent Italian sandwich joint.  Alas, we had the misfortune to step into this place and had what was possibly the worst veal sandwich and panini ever.  Say what you will about their friendly service but our experience was one of annoyance.  3 high school girls giggling behind the counter served us....barely.  The veal sandwich came on a mediocre size kaiser bun about half the size as found in places like California sandwich.  There was barely any tomato sauce as the sauce was way too thin to properly coat the limp and stale veal cutlets.  We also had their romano panini with "red pepper pesto" and it was another sad experience.  The salami they used were dry and the red pepper pesto came straight out of one of those store bought jars.  This place is only surviving because it's in Pickering where they're competing with Mr. Subs and Subways.  Next time, I'll just drive the extra 15 min and hit the newly opened California sandwiches on Eglinton and Vic Park.
