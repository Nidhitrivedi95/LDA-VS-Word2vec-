JogUSDKa1xyG3lLEmD4Xjg I was hoping Fiamma would be amazing because of its location near Rusan's and their awesome reputation and food. unfortunately it was was not so good. 

I ordered fried calamari which apparently comes with half a plate of zucchini (for $12?!)
it was soggy, the calamari was tough and tasted frozen, and above all it was beer battered (something I have never seen in an Italian restaurant) 

I also ordered a salmon Cesar salad. the salmon was very tasty (but an exceptionally small piece) and the salad had no croutons (i wouldn't normally fuss but it said croutons on the menu) 

I tried calling Fiamma three times and all three times it went to voice mail, I don't understand how a restaurant just doesn't answer the phone during the afternoon, even pizza hut on new year's evening answers the phone eventually (even when there's a hundred pizza orders in the kitchen) 

I wont be visiting again, thanks for my terrible $20 lunch Fiamma
