fhx1yUZlC1QwovIjdYeGiw This is probably one of the worst customer experiences I've had! We had a group for a friend's birthday, about 6 of us. After seated we waited for a few then our appetizer order was taken, it took a bit but not out of the ordinary. Then we waited quite a while longer before our order was taken, the assistant manager came to check on us and we explained our food was taking a long time and the drink of my friend never came. A while after they starting bringing food, my soup was wrong also. The food was good and the location nice, but the service was horrible. 
We waited some more, then a deferent server asked if we needed boxes and he brought us some. We still waiting for our check about 15 min later our server asks if we need our checks! After finally getting the check, they added 20% gratuity, which explains why our service was awful, since the tip was already included! 
We asked for a manager and both of them basically have the worst customer service attitude. Obviously they didn't care of our complain of how long the food took and the poor service. The assistant manager returned and said they couldn't do anything without "evidence." After multiple back and forth , due to mentioning the bad reviews on yelp, he said he would be back. After about 20 more minutes..... he said they agreed to take off the 20% gratuity off for us and "they will pay it out of their pocket. " no apology, not a care in the world that we would never come back. No wonder their service is awful, it's obvious the managers set the standards with their example. Needless to say, I will never go back there.
