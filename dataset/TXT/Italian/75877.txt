cs1qJvnWUg_f8g020z_3PQ I wish I could give this place more stars but I can't! The food was great don't get me wrong, but our first experience wasn't the best. Quick service which is always great, but talk about feeling unwelcome! For a first timer, it would've been nice to be introduced to the menu instead of asking 101 questions. That seems to be a problem I've been reading through other reviews. The servers seem to dislike assisting their customers when it comes to the menu. I really wanted to like this place but it's not worth a second visit. 2 stars for the delicious food. -3 stars for the service and overall atmosphere.
