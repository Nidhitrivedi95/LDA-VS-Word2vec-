xmWs-su5eB5_57CIw4sqfw My second time there was a horrible experience. Gina herself told the waiter to stop telling us what's good for the day's menu and told him "they're young they don't know nothing, don't waste your time on them". We were the first people to arrive and order and the smallest group but our food was last to come out and we began to notice that all the waiters, waitress, and Gina herself was entertaining other customers and left us out. I will never go back there again especially after I have told Gina myself that I did not enjoy the service and she just walked away.
