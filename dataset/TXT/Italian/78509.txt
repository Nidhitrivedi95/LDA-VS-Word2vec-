D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA I ate here tonight for the first time. The restaurant wasn't very busy. No one came to our table to take our order, and after 25 minutes I had to tell the hostess who just said "ok" to me. So that wasn't a good start.
After the manager came by to apologize the service got much better and food came out in 15 minutes.
The bread and pesto to start was very good. The toasted bread was infused with olive oil and made it really tasty.
Fettuccini Alfredo was pretty good.
The cheese pizza was the best pizza ever! It was soooo good. I will be for sure coming back for the pizza next time. Maybe just to get it to go. But sooo delicious!!!!
Because of the bad service in the beginning they gave us a free dessert and gave us the butter cake. & wow that was the best butter cake I've ever had too!
