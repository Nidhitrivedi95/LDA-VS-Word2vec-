dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA I came here tonight for the second time and devised a genius pie.  The first time, I remember it seemed expensive for Eric and I to get our custom pizzas, but this time I noticed there were two size options.  I am not sure if the 7 inch existed on our first visit.  I was over half an hour late to the party since I worked an event tonight, but Eric R., David S. and out of town friends visiting (Amy and David R.) all got their own 10 inch pies and none of them finished the full pie...because it is too big!

I got the 7 inch, with the spicy diavola sauce, parmesan and ricotta, beets (yes, it is an item on the salad menu but I felt compelled to grace my pizza with it), and caramelized onions.  It was PERFECT!!!  I squeezed a fresh lemon slice on it and ....wa-la... soooooo good!  I am not sure if anyone else would order this (the staff said no one had asked for beets on the pizza before) but with these fine toppings AND an iced tea my total was under $10.  What a deal!  I am just floored because the combination of these simple ingredients created a happy celebration in my mouth and I would order this again!
