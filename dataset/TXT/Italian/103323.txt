FmraE2CWt65VRnEqCAqNEg You know, I really want to like this place. The decor is nice, the patio very comfortable, even on hot evenings, it's in my neighborhood, and the food, when you finally get it, is good. 

The big problem I have is the terrible service. I've eaten here about 3 times and each time the service was terrible (very slow) and someone always had a problem with getting what they ordered. This past Tuesday we decided to give the $8.99 beer & a burger Tuesday special a try. We waited 20 minutes for our drinks and at least 45 minutes for our food.  Our burgers were ordered rare & medium rare, one with no tomatoes. They both came out so cooked that we couldn't tell them apart (neither close to rare) and neither had tomatoes. We had to ask for silverware, napkins, S&P (that has been the case on every visit). There have been empty tables every time I've been there, so I can't chalk up the bad service to being super busy.

This could be one of my favorite restaurants if they would just get their act together with the service and stop messing up the orders. If you can finally get them to bring what you ordered, the food is good. Awesome onion rings, and the Reuben is delicious, great beer selection.
