dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg Parma has been one of our favorites for a long time... but now I'm not sure if we'll ever return. This review covers two visits, one in March and again tonight.

In March, our food took an hour to arrive and only then because we had started asking what the hold up was. The food was okay, nothing memorable, but the 60+ minute wait was. Because of that, we didn't hurry back.

Tonight was 45+ minutes and our order wasn't lost. Our server, Kay, almost totally ignored us the entire time. We had to ask another server for soda refills after she ignored them and us for too long. Kay did ask Hubby if his steak was cooked correctly, which it was, then didn't return until we finally got her attention.

 My food, a Jidori chicken dish, was inedible. The sauce was good but the chicken was dry and boring. She took it off the bill after I refused to wait another 45 minutes for something else. Hubby's peppercorn steak was abysmal, he said, but we paid for it and got out.

One bad experience could be a fluke. Two? Marc must not care about this restaurant any longer.
