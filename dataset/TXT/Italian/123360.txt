hlrZHM4D48XiQtXh6cRg_w This place is great for a big group and we had lots of kids with us so it was perfect.   As a foodie, this is not my first choice but it served its purpose :)

It was a Friday night and I was really craving/needing a nice glass of wine.  I ordered the Malbec and 15 minutes later the waiter announced that they didn't have any ... so I had my water.

I ordered the spicy spaghetti, which is not spicy and was pretty bland.  But my expectations were not too high to be honest so it didn't really disappoint.  Our waiter put up with us and all our requests so that was great.
