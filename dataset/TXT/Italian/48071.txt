91sdZ0d-5RMXNcBYB3uU0g Very busy on a Saturday evening but was still able to snag a seat in their back area.  It's a cute area.  It gives you an outdoor feel but you're still fully covered in a heated space.

I wasn't very hungry but wanted to get my greens in for the day, so I opted to get a salad. I did want a bit of protein so I added prosciutto for an extra $2.  My friend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  We did get the bruschetta to start and meh.  I wasn't really a fan.  I didn't like how they make it like a "pizza on a pita".  See pic.  I don't like crust to begin with, so when there is an excess of bread I don't tend to eat it.  That's so much bread space that could be covered with tomatoes!  It's just a waste to me.  Plus the bread wasn't great either.  

The dressing on the salad was very light.  I actually devoured almost all of it and it was a lot of lettuce.  I probably wouldn't get it again as the only reason I got it was because I wasn't hungry.  I'll definitely try a pasta or pizza next time I come.  I did try a bit of the meatball from my friend's dish, and it was pretty tasty.

Nothing to really rave about, but again I'd have to try something more "authentic" on the menu.
