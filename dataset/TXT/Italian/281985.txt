yxQsedCcjJEfqhC7u8Rl0A We went here just because we felt like Italian- and we got reservations at the last minute.-which was a plus. And the place was crowded- definite plus for the last minute reservations then. The staff is very friendly and very knowledgeable - especially about the wines. They have an extensive wine list - which was awesome because the friends I went there with are wine connoisseurs. We started off with cocktails which hit the spot perfectly. The Calamari alla Griglia and Prosciutto alla Griglia was great and served with a mixed greens with a really tangy balsamic dressing. That set the tone for the rest of the meal. Agnello (rack of lamb), veal scaloppini and the day's- special -ravioli. The food was excellent - portions were just right. the wine was excellent and the service was great. It was a bit pricey no doubt. But totally worth it.
