ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg Came here with some friends the other day had two rusticas.  Had the palmero, and the MEAT.  Crunchy crust, nice fresh sauce, and really affordable. okay this phallic shaped pizza was delicious.   I hope I don't get yelp yelled at for this but i laughed when it came out.  I mean it's not even if you stretch your dirty mind you can see it I saw plainly two objects that resembled quite frankly a penis.  I checked out the pictures on the website and they look phallic but not the way they looked when i got them. 

Maybe a good place to take a date to see how they would react to such a funny thing. Like see if they have a good sense of humor you know?  Also had the buffalo salad which was tasty as well.  Only weird thing was we got a bottle of malbec and the guy opened the bottle and then sniffed it before he poured it.  Which i think is odd, he's not drinking the wine why does he need to sniff the wine? I mean someone at the table is going to taste it to make sure it's bad so why you need to sniff it homie?? He was a really nice guy though I just thought that was odd.
