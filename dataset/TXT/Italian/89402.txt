Everything was delicious. I shared the halibut and filet (medium well). Both were cooked to perfection. Husband enjoyed the sea bass. Fresh baked Focaccia and bread basket served at the beginning of the meal. A nice limoncello and raspberry sorbet finished off our meal nicely. No complaints, other than overpriced.
