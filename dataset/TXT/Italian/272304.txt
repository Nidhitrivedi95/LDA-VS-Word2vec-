XugCgJqRQgNGeiycvTybjA Another entry in Toronto's corporate pizza sphere. This particular location is across the street from the Pizzaville fail location. 

Mamma's position itself as a kind of gourmet slice/delivery operation, which means some pies have feta cheese and artichoke. Aside from the feta cheese pies, it serves up a decent selection of slices (unlike Pizzaville). The joint is clean and bug free (unlike Pizzaville). Prices are a nudge higher but instead of wasting your time walking into Pizzaville to find they have no slices or what they have are crawling with fruit flies, just head here is you're in the Yonge/Sheppard area and looking for a quick, hot, delicious slice.
