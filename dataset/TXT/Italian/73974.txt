cOWXtCz7F9GQhPIks8gm6Q Our server was amazing! You can definitely tell that this place is family owned but with an intimate setting! Our server had great recommendations and even told us about a Groupon deal that they were offering. Great drinks and food was well priced! I had the shrimp scampi and it was delicious! Will be back here for sure!
