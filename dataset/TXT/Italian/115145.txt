GQAvKHDfuBws7312iIqX6Q 25 years. I've been a loyal customers of Buono's Pizza for 25 years. 

Here's a hint guys, reheating an old pizza that's probably been sitting around for a few hours intended for slices isn't going to keep me coming back.  It's inexcusable for a restaurant to serve what I was served this evening. This wasn't a mistake: overcooked/undercooked it's giving a customer garbage because you don't want to take a loss on a product. 


Will not return. Ever.
