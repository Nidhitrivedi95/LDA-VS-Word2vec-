Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg Everything on their menu is astoundingly good. Best pizza in Las Vegas from the many places I have tried so far. Rosati's is a close second. 

Metro's Cheese and Macaroni is rich, cheesy, rich, decadent, and RICH! There is a reason why they put the "Cheese" in the name first. They use all cheese and only cheese ... no fillers, and you can taste the difference.  Wow. As a self-proclaimed cheese slut, I must admit this M&C beats any other I've ever had ... so far. 

Garlic Knots:  like thick, soft bread sticks, tied in a knot and smothered in garlicy butter, served with marinara ... I could easily make a meal of these alone.  Another WOW dish.  Metro Pizza is carb nirvana for this girl!
