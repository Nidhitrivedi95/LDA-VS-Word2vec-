7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA Spending the long weekend in Leslieville, I made the streetcar ride back out for brunch around 1:45pm.  Real jerk doesn't open til 2, so we waited in line for a table at Lady Marmalade.  As soon as we sat down, all the other tables cleared out. 
This is a vegan-friendly place that serves bacon- a now recurring theme among popular brunch places.  I guess it's very Toronto of a place to cater to both ends of the spectrum.  
The huevos rancheritos were too much food for me to finish.  They are served in a deep and wide plate which is half full of black beans. They are good, but I know how they are a magical fruit. Speaking of fruit, i didn't get any, even as a garnish. Anyway, the guac and cilantro and onion garnish was good and added to the heaviness of the beans and eggs.  
My major complaints was the evidence of canned tomato on the BLT. 
I suppose in these locavore times they didn't want to ship the tomatoes all the way from Cali for a little bacon, lettuce and TOMATO sandwich. But, canned? Maybe a note (like I saw at Burger Bar) stating that only fresh tomatoes are served when they can find them ripe etc... would have made my SO choose another meal. Instead  he had poached egg, bacon and a little bit of bread. 
Hideous 70's fabric-coated chairs.
