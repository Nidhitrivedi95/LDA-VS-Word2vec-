MrmwDgMlL2GtthlAZsJwNQ I love the atmosphere of this place! The decor is great and the patio is awesome! I love the flowers and plants all around. I wish the food was better! It just seems bland. I feel like my spaghetti and meatballs taste way better than theres. The only dish we love at this place is the artichoke dip! It seemed to have the most flavour! I wish they gave more bread with it though. They only give you four pieces. I think six would be great!
