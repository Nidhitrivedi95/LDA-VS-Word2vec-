wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg Just tried this place and LOVED it. We started with Spicy Lobster Bisque (soup of the day)... holy WOW!  This soup was so creamy, slightly spicy, rich, decadent... delicious.  I wound up ordering the Patata Pizza and was in love.  Great crust, the egg was done perfectly, and the cheese was almost meaty.  The BF ordered the Grinder sandwich and it was equally tasty.  The service was... new.  Sweet, sweet girl, but brand new and a little awkward.  She will do well in time.   I will definitely be back for more.
