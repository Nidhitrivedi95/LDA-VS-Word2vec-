q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Loved this place!  Make sure to make a reservation, we saw many people turned away during our Saturday night visit.

I ordered the lasagne with a Caesar salad and my husband ordered the rigatoni with a house salad.  We also shared the caprese appetizer.  Everything we had was fantastic!  My salad was garlicky, which I loved.  My husband's salad with Italian dressing was also good, but he found it to be too salty.  The caprese was composed of some fantastic prosciutto on top of perfectly ripe tomatoes, creamy mozzarella, and fresh basil.  It was quite good.

The rigatoni with Alfredo sauce was very heavy with a mild flavor, but we both loved it.  The lasagna was one of the best I've ever had!!  I think the use of their excellent meatballs in the lasagna is what really made it so excellent.

While I wouldn't rate Capo's as a 5 star restaurant on food alone (I reserve those ratings for the particularly spectacular), the ambiance was super fun and interesting.  It would be a great place for a large group dinner or for a romantic date, and you can't say that about many places.  Highly recommended!
