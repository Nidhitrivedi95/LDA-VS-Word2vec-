PxTKXsdYqoFHWAG2amz0XQ This was an interesting experience. 
When we first sat down and we're given menus I had a nice case of sticker shock.
The entry in yelp had two dollar signs, I feel like this is quite incorrect.
While the service was excellent, in my opinion the food was not worth the price.
I ordered pizza that was average, nothing to write home about. Another person in my party ordered the short ribs entree which was cooked and presented nicely, but it was very bland. The staff tried to remedy this for us by bringing some au jus but it didn't help. Then the waiter brought us the appetizer version of the short ribs which was better. 
Takeaway: amazing service, average pricey food.
