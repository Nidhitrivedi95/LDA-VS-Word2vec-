esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA Wonderful service !!!! I love the humor the chefs gives me cause I keep ordering so much. 

The oysters here tasted sooooo fresh and good. Didn't have that slimy texture or super fishy smell.

Regular oysters (5/5) 
- blue something oysters. They weren't too big or too small. Perfect . They were good and fresh. 
We pretty much ordered the premium oysters too. Also very good!
