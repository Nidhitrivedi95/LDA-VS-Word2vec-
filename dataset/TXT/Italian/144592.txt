k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ After hearing rave reviews for The Parlor, it certainly had a lot to live up to. And my first visit last week, it definitely won't be my last. 

My dinner buddy and I headed to the Parlor after work on a Thursday to find the place packed. Good sign. We made a beeline straight to the bar and admired the warm recycled wood accents and sleek contemporary look. I had the basil gimlet and she sipped on garden mojito, and they were both refreshing and delicious.

It was hard to choose from the delectable menu but decided to take advantage of the DIY sheet. We chose a meat and cheese plate with Humboldt fog (nice and clean), manchego (nutty goodness) and salami (salty and delicious). 

Then we decided to pick two 8" pizzas, and they ended up being more than enough. My friend had the barbecue chicken pizza that had a tart BBQ sauce, perfectly cooked chicken and fiery mini jalapeno peppers. We created another pizza with fresh tomatoes, wild mushrooms, homemade sausage and mozzarella, topped with pecorino and oregano. I liked that you could add herbs and pick your cheeses. The whole combination was heavenly, but could have used a bit more mushrooms. I especially loved the chewy yet airy crust. 

A minor complaint: My friend and I were quoted at a half hour wait and told the hostess we would be at the bar. When we checked in after 20, my friend noticed that a couple parties of two listed after us had already been seated. If I wasn't enjoying my basil gimlet so much, I would have been a bit more peeved but the hostess got us seated right away.
