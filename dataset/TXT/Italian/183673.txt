oEYyuU67YkYEsBzwP4PGag Thanks to Groupon I found this place.  Since I love Italian & Mexican food, I've always wondered what would happen if you mixed the 2 together.  I've dined in various restaurants who have tried to mesh the 2.  This was the first one that I've tried that's tried to do it in the style of a Chipotle....you walk up and 'put together' their version of a Burrito, Bowl, etc.  A Pellini = a Burrito.  Here's what I ordered:

Chicken Pellini (like an Italian Burrito), $6.55

The Chicken Pellini was pretty good...above average.  However, the sides fell short.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip was bland and the Bruschetta was *meh*....I'd pass on those next time, but since it came with the Groupon I'm glad I got to try it.

They also offer Beer & Wine here....which is a plus.  They also have Sriracha and other Hot Sauces to dress up your Pellini if you choose...the Sriracha was a nice touch and complimented the flavor of my Pellini well.

I can see this catching on.
