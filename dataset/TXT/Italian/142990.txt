js9rQZAlA5rr7oSBRRcCDw 3.5 stars for Dimmi! As previously noted, it's a tasty, reasonable option for Yorkville. Great date, BFF-hang or business-lunch spot.

I've been here approximately one trillion times and I have it down to a science: go with a friend so you won't have to decide between pizza and pasta, and get both. Or two pizzas, one red and one white. Done-zo.

My go-to selections:
- Rigatoni al Gorgonzola (mushrooms, roasted red peppers, cream sauce)
- Pizza Salmone (smoked salmon, arugula, red onions, capers, cream cheese)
- Pizza Gorgonzola (gorgonzola cheese, red peppers, olive oil, figs, honey)
- Gnocchi alla Dimmi (rose sauce, asiago)
- Tagliollini alla Gamberi (black tiger shrimps, arugula, cherry tomatoes)

Both of the gorgonzola dishes are delicious and rich but your stomach will magically find room for it.

The quality of service varies. They ding you with a charge if you split a plate over drinks, sometimes aren't the friendliest, and occasionally snatch the bread away before you're done with it.* Once I did have an awesome waiter, who presented us with a big thing of COTTON CANDY at the end of our meal and totally made my night. Sadly, the service hasn't been as great since, despite multiple visits. Love me, Dimmi! I want to love you.

*I'm never done with it.
