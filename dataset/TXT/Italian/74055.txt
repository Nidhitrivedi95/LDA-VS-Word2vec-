CPgyfcsyPegLha1ajaSRoA One thing I loooove, is some good Italian food. And this place serves it! The portions are plentiful and the quality of food taste is simply delightful and sets my taste buds off!!!! The Fettuccine Alfredo was good.  I also got a chance to try the Pasta with Vodka Sauce. That was something to definitely write home to mom about! So I highly recommend that. The only thing that I hate is, I live quite a distance from the place. But when I am in the area, this is where I will be at to get my Italian craving fix.
