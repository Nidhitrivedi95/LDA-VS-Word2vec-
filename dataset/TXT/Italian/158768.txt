LFs5jyYdXlzi0SpAYi1eSA Maggiano's is an old school red sauce Italian chain restaurant.   Usually, I use them for meetings -- their private dinning space and budget friendly menus are great anywhere in the USA.  

But this visit I found myself in the Fashion Mall on the Vegas strip.  I wasn't in the mood to shop nor did I want to pay $6++ for Starbucks so I went into Maggiano's to grab a coffee.  It was between lunch and dinner and the bar was empty.  I bellied up to the bar and ordered my 3 shots of espresso and read my book -- sometimes I find relaxing spots in the most unlikely places.  

The bartender was friendly but kept her distance as I wasn't in the mood to chat. Plus the off-hour diners kept her busy.  I had to leave before my coffee was finished so she gave me a kid's sippy cup so I could take my coffee to go!  Great service!
