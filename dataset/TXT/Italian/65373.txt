bKh66jlEqEKZZFkjWipt8w Have come here about 3 times when the other restaurants in the area were too busy. Admittedly I was surprised by the food and staff quality- both are excellent. The servers remembered me when I came in on my second time and everything I've ordered has been delicious. I also appreciate the general casual vibe and modern decor. Ordering at the counter and retrieving your own water is a cool concept and the seafood pasta is fantastic- I think about it often lol.
