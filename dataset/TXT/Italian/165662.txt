M7LycEla3delvqK4Auu0Dg This is my second time coming here. The service and the food were great. I think this had to be the best Italian place around here. The first time I came I was in the mood of eating fetuccini al Alfredo with chicken. They didn't have it on the menu so I asked the waiter which btw is a very nice, funny, Italian guy who loves to help and joke around haha... He said you want pasta with creamy white sauce and chicken, we make for you! ... And voila, they made it. Pretty tasty to say the least. I'll recommend this place if you are in the mood for some pasta and nice service around town.
