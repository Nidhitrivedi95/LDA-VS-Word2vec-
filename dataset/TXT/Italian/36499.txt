6We2O5X62J_gduXU7jvf8w WARNING: the marinara sauce is WAY too sweet. Completely ruined the experience. I get that the secrecy to a lot of sauces and even crust is a sweet component but this is too much. I asked for well done and it wasn't close but that's just bad on the kitchen tonight. The basil was fresh and the cheese was nice and gooey. The pepperoni was typical and greasy. I cheated on Grimaldi's and suffered. I hardly ever give a one star but the sauce earned it.
