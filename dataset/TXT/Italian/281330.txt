YstdDnNa6h_ms3Ys7Pz4uQ My husband and I were visiting the area and decided to stop in for a late lunch early dinner. The service was excellent,  knowledgeable and friendly. I have diet restrictions and when I asked questions the waitress Mary happily asked the chef if certain items contained sugar.  She was eager to assist me in choosing the right dish based off my food restrictions. The food was succulent and flavorful. I order the wood grilled chicken with red sauce made the way I needed to be done with no sugar and no cheese.  My husband went off of the waitress recommendation and had the Mahi Wulfe. My husband said his fish was outstanding. During or visit we even met the owner he was polite and helpful as well.  It is nice to go to a restaurant and get knowledgeable service.  They did it right.  Bravo!
