L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw The dinning room is simple, bright and modern. You have to access the restaurant from the outside of Yorkdale mall. The service was incredible! Our server was lively making sure our glasses of water were always full, and making the best recommendations as to what we should order.  We had the fried ravioli that was wickedly good. It was the perfect appetizer to start with. For our main course we had the linguine with prawns! Such a flavourful dish! For dessert I highly recommend having the Affogato......it's vanilla gelato with a shot of espresso and crumbled biscotti. Very yummy! I can't wait to go back again and again until I eventually taste everything on his menu! (And hopefully run into Jamie one day!)
