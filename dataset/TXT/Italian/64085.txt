BcLFIr4wtd3GQ3fnz15yDQ Amazing food! We went for dinner- closest thing I have tasted to Italy. So happy this is 5 minutes from our house- it will definitely be our spot to bring family & friends. The fact that we can support a local Pgh chef is another benefactor! Love the story behind the restaurant. Can't wait to try breakfast.
