yrZrnWdBR4pE21vcgv8KHw i was psyched about trying this place but it's much like all the other little trendoid "authentic" italian cafes.  there were a few choices i viewed on the on-line menu that i was interested in and this is why i chose lil' baci.  when we arrived at 3ish, we were told they were no longer offering their brunch menu (fine) and that we'd have the "lunch"  menu.  again, fine.  then it was the "late lunch" menu--which was a limited version of the lunch menu.  um...okay.  and then, we were told this was actually the "late lunch" menu from the other lil' baci location and they didn't have all of the pizzas listed.  so i picked a pizza.  oh, yeah, they don't have that one now either.  my bf picked a pizza.  nope, they don't have the rapini ready til 5pm.  2 cheese pizzas it is!  bottom line:  options were 3 salads and 4 pizzas.  whatever.  

main points:

*cheese pizza had 6 small circles of mozz.
*water bottles on tables are nice if you drink a lot of water.  but i don't pay to come out to eat to fill my own 4oz. water glass every 5 mins.
*stark wine selection
*interesting house cocktails
*gave a comped dessert for the birthday guest!
*server starting her shift styled her hair in the dining room mirror, put on her apron, and then brought drinks to a table.  (gross.)
*if you don't put salt & pepper shakers on the table because you "offer" fresh-ground--great!  then actually "offer" it.  don't make customer flag down server to ask for pepper mill.  
*$8 for a dessert that came in a baby food jar (literally)
*interesting vegetarian options on the menu 
*none of the aforementioned "interesting vegetarian options" available to order
*great prices on drinks during cocktail hour (4pm-6pm i think)

wished we had dropped $120 somewhere else :(
