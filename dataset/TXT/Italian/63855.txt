bchksAMD4CtI98_s_kJNpg We arried at 7 and left at 8:45. The atmosphere is nice. I had a great pinot noir and the sesame ahi tuna was great.  The beet salad  is great and the hazelnut ice cream and chocolate mousse is awesome. The drawbacks were that my wifes lamb chop was a little burnt, but they fixed it. The service was slow, and not in a good way. When we placed our drink order it took 5 to 10 minutes to get our drink. I  sent back my 2nd glass of wine because it arrived so late in my meal. 
I gave them 4 stars because I hope that their service will improve to the level of their  food.
