GWhp4fCu-NWR9PTJBi4Ifg I remembered pizza being ordered for lunch at work once from a "New York" pizza place that was pretty good and since this place was close by I thought this was it. I tried the buffet and the pizza I had was NOT as good as I remembered but was decent. The salad bar was ok as well but the dressings were horrible! I tried the Italian first and then ranch and both were bad. The pasta didn't look appetizing so I didn't try it. Overall the pizza is probably just a level above CiCi's.
