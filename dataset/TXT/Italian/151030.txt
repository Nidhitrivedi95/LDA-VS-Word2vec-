klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw LOVED the decor, LOVED the service.  The salmon, grilled artichokes and shishito peppers were all fabulous.  I have a gluten sensitivity and they have a special food allergen menu, which was presented to me after being seated (thanks to my thoughtful boyfriend who told them about my special diet when he made the reservation!) so this wins big points from me, it's so rare to find a restaurant who even knows what I mean by gluten-free.  Our waitress and the whole wait-staff actually was spot on.  Oh, and, my boyfriend really liked the pretzel bread.  The prices are a bit, shall we say, Wynn.  (Hence the 4 stars and not 5.)  It's a great little spot!
