JB065aFyfEl8mRAIUT0b8g Quick, casual and tasty! Come here for a fast dinner or take out! I had the Alfredo which was delish. The pizzas are all good...classic Italian thin crust. I really enjoy the  salads and apps as well. Nothing bad to say about this place, the foods about 8/10! Service 9/10! Ambiance 10/10.
