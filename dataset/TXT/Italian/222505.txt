SHtvOqudT3zlOdCnZjrXzQ The first time I actually went here was last year. I was actually looking for a Pizza Pizza nearby, but this place just happened to be there with the words "Big Slice" on the sign.

I decided to go in to have a peak and saw that their slices were decently priced at $4/slice (If I remember correctly).

When I received my slice, I now realize how the place was named, it was the biggest pizza slice I've ever received in my life. I don't remember tasting the greatest, but it was definitely a different experience and one that I remember pretty vividly.
