OpNrObgtHgYijZYOU0yF-Q I came here on a friend's recommendation.  We sat at the bar and had a pleasant surprise of an evening.  The bartender was skilled and top notch.  Cocktails were made to perfection and were treated as an art.  Delicious and beautiful.  I had a gin and tonic and a house special cocktail.  We ordered a pizza to share and loved the heavenly crust.  Warm, chewy, and perfectly complemented by the pizza toppings.  Crust definitely stole the show!  We split the pizza half-half with sausage/green pepper as well as bbq chicken.  Sausage/green pepper was the winner.  We also got side salads - a massive bucket of greens for only $1 with an entree!  More than enough food to go around.  For dessert I had the tiramisu: it was served in a coffee cup and although its ingredients seemed quite simple (pudding, whipped cream, etc) it came together perfectly and I couldn't have asked for anything more.  I had to be rolled back to the hotel with a happy belly I'm still thinking about days later!
