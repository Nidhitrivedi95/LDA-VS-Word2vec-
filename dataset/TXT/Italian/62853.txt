B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw This delicious Italian location is dangerously near King St W for my liking, but don't harp on Gusto by frat-boys-with-pay-cheques association. The food is tasty, the people are lovely and I'm stuffed to the gills. 

I had the mushroom fettuccini and it was truffle oiled, parmed up goodness. It wasn't a disgustingly large American pasta portion, but it was still too much. I paired it with their dollar per ounce red, 18 ounces to be exact, and together they made a perfect mismatched meal. 

The ambiance is woody, exposed brick, quirky lights and an open kitchen. Pretty standard for Toronto, but the standard works. I'm a bit bummed by how close together they seat their tables, but I get it. More tables, more money. 

PEPPER POINTS: This $1 per ounce wine shit is the shit. The. Shit.
