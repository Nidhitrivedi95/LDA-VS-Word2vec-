qRTbYc7ennnwfr992kfjdA I stopped in here for a quick lunch with some coworkers on a sunny Wednesday afternoon. To be honest we didn't originally intend to visit Caffino since none of us had even heard of it. But, I'm so glad our original choice of lunch spots was closed that day and we noticed the sign for this place. 

First of all, this place is so charming. Located in an old factory building nestled amongst many similar other ivy covered buildings, it feels really secluded even though its only a few steps away from the bustling activity of Liberty Village. We grabbed a seat on the partially shaded patio because I feel strongly that you should always sit on the patio if you can. 

All three of us are suckers for pasta so even though we had to go back to work and would later require large coffees to do so, we went for it. As a vegetarian I was pleased to learn that, since all dishes are made to order, its easy for the chef to leave out the meat in any of the dishes should you want. I was really into the idea of the Gnocchi La Romana (which features asparagus, prosciutto and gorgonzola cream sauce), but was not so into the prosciutto part. No problem. 

We were served bread with olive oil and balsamic while we waited for our meals to arrive, which wasn't very long at all. All three of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals and the lovely service. And since we were on lunch and not boozing it up, we were left with a very reasonably priced bill.
