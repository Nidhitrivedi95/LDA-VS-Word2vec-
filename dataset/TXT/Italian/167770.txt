Mi5uhdFB9OJteXPd0_IKfw I've been to this Carraba's at least 4 times. I took my Mother to it back in 1998 and the food was great. The calamari appetizer is the best I've ever eaten. I've had calamari at about 15 different restaurants and Carraba's is still the best. The warm bread with olive oil and spices is also very tasty. I usually get Chicken Carbonaro. with pasta. The food is usually excellent. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal there. I haven't been back to this restaurant in about 5 years, so I don't know if the quality is still the same. I see a lot of people complaining. Due to the recession, it's possible that the food may not be as good today. It was still great 5 years ago however. I would definitely go back and eat there again. I had proposed to my wife at Carraba's in Scottsdale and the food was great there as well.
