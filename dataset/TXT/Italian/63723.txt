BaVtTt9pBoI8rrN35tsj_g We came in for lunch today and Chris was our server. He was fun, quirky, and attentive. He never let our drinks or breadsticks run out. Our food was delicious and the manager was quick to fix a little snafu with my boyfriends meal. I am very pleased with our service and how friendly the entire staff was. It's our go-to date night and will be back!
