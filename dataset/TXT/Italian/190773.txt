Pb7Y3PeIq__NQk_uSgG6Vg Unfortunately this place did not have the best food. I do not recommend the shrimp pasta, it came with super tiny canned shrimp for salads and not very many of them. I was wanting a seafood meal and this was not it. We were the youngest group in the whole restaurant but it was picked as an overall middle of the road place for a large group of people driving from all around town. The service was ok. I did not pay for the pasta dish as it was not good at all but I definitely paid $6 for the super small side salad that came with the meal. Overall I do not recommend this place although as stated in another post they have the best bread ever and the rest of the guests at our table seemed to enjoy their meals. I tasted my husband's food and it was way better than mine.
