iag4htR8F7FmE9zpz7_GMw Levetto is a cute place. The restaurant itself is a bit on the small side, but it's very modern with nice decor and layout. The staff are very friendly! This restaurant has some of the best service I've ever seen. Really, really kind people.

To start, we ordered two small (4 slices each) pizzas: the margherita and the pizza verde. The margherita was absolutely delicious. It tasted very fresh: the cheese was perfectly gooey, but not so much as to think it had been reheated, the tomato sauce was perfectly sweet, and the dough was crispy but not brittle. To top it all off, it was garnished with a fresh slice of basil. Other places I've visited just sprinkle some dried basil on top, not Levetto. The pizza verde, on the other hand, seemed to be a bit confused. All of the toppings that were on it contrasted, not complimented, each other, making for an odd eating experience. The pesto was delicious though.

The pasta was just OK. It wasn't really al dente, and no matter how good the sauces were, they couldn't take away from the pasta not being properly cooked. My bucatini was a bit hard, so I didn't like how it turned out. There didn't seem to be enough bacon for the pasta - it wasn't well proportioned. The pasta was basically drowning the bacon. The portion sizes are pretty big, though, so I guess you get the most bang for your buck. If you come to Levetto, try the pizzas, rather than the pasta dishes. You will be much happier with your decision!
