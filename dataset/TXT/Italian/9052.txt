0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw Bottom line: this place is super solid. 

We went here as part of a Montreal weekend where my wife is trying to emulate Anthony Bourdain "Layover" in Montreal. We hit the usual spots over the previous 24h: Schwartz , Fairmont etc. All as expected and I am feeling the Montreal groove. We head here because we can't get in to Joe Beef- so let's do the sister resto. 

As we arrive in the 'hood I am feeling it's the Montreal version of Oz/Dundas in the centre of the Universe (Canada style). On arrival, it looks and feels cool but the initial reception is bland and the server cool. The cocktail offering, completely cookie cutter. I am thinking "Jenn Agg smokes these jokers at the Hoof". 

From then on however it's an onslaught of excellence. Great wine list. We had the Monts Damnes Sancerre. The food after that was just spectacular. The usual Quebec superb lineup of foie and later cheeses. Lamb, bass, and lobster spaghetti were stars. 

Vibe: crackling. Tunes: Classic Seger followed by perfect Stones as we nibbled foie gras. (You have to be there I guess but it seems like they read my mind). And the server is terrific at this point. 

Bottom line is I have to give thumbs up to this member of the Montreal lineup. It just doesn't get much better. Anywhere.
