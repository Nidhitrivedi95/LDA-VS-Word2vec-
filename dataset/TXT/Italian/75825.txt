cs1qJvnWUg_f8g020z_3PQ I'll admit it. I can be quite the "pizza-holic" at times. And it just so happened that I was trying quite a few pies during my Phoenix trip last week. Fortunately, I was able to cap it all off with a pilgrimage to one of the greatest pizzerias in America: Pizzeria Bianco.

Of course, we had to wait a while for a table. But when we're talking about pizzas coming directly from the brick oven and made with fresh quality ingredients, the wait is worth it!

Our party tried the Biancoverde, Margherita, Rosa, & Wiseguy Pizzas along with the Tomato & Mozzarella Antipasti Plate. And my goodness, the mozzarella was super creamy! And my goodness, the pizzas! The Rosa blew me away, and I'm not a big onion person. The Margherita definitely met my standards for that classic zesty goodness. And the Biancoverde was a pleasant surprise with a nice, spicy kick from the fresh arugula.

I didn't try the Wiseguy, but the carnivores in our party were somewhat underwhelmed by the fennel sausage. Other than that, no one was really disappointed by Bianco. Oh, and I very much enjoyed my Prosecco cocktail!

All in all, I was quite pleased with what I found and what I tasted at the original Pizzeria Bianco. And I now know why this seemingly humble spot tucked away in a strip mall was won so many culinary awards. It's definitely a "must eat" in PHX!
