jTnD_YpFIeUzhopfuvKpvA I have eaten take out and delivery from this restaurant before.  The previous meals were good.  However, tonight I ordered a cheesesteak and tiramasu to be delivered.  The cheesesteak was cold, the fries were undercooked and cold and the tiramasu was bordering on being frozen.  The only item I ordered that should have been cold, a 2 liter bottle of soda, was warm.  The delivery person was not friendly at all.  I'm disappointed.  The first two times I ate here the food was good, it has definitely gone down hill.
