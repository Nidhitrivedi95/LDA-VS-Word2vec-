PXN0l42g6IWp18NGJ7yn5w I'm going to tell you all the story of How I Met Hey Lucy's.

I remember going to Hey Lucy's when I first moved to Toronto  - we were ignored, the food was slow, and I left the restaurant unimpressed.  

Fast-forward a year when I went there for a Friday night dinner with the girls - I went early because I knew it would be packed.  There was a 30 min wait, so I put my name on the waiting list and told the nice man (who turned out to be the new owner) that I was just going to hang out at the Second Cup next door.

So now I'm at the Second Cup, waiting for my friends to arrive, when the owner came INTO THE SECOND CUP TO TELL ME THAT HE HAD A TABLE READY FOR ME.  On top of that, he let me bring in my hot chocolate, but ask if I can just put it in one of their mugs (sure!).  

At the restaurant, it felt as if we had our own private server with the amount of attention she was giving us, and I was so impressed that I booked my Champagne Birthday party in their upstairs lounge, where they created a special menu (yum!), closed it off for my party (at no charge) and we had our own bartender for the night.  It was so much fun!

I like this place - it has a cool vibe and the martini's are yummy. Check it out!
