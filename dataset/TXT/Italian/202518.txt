q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ Deliciosa and such fun. A fantastic start to our groups "mob" /rock n roll themed vacay.
We'd never tried pasta fazul which is a fabulous soup. I had the marvelous Gotta artichoke chicken dish, the mashed potatoes were perfect. My husband stuffed himself on lasagna and our guests loved the steaks. Servings plentiful.  Atmosphere gangsta fantasy. The Sinatra singer and magician frequented our table making us feel special and part of the family.

We were headed to the Vegas mob museum which is a don't miss the next morning so this was the perfect way to take us back in culinary time.

Food perfect.  Staff helpful, friendly while the greeter was in thuggery mode to set the tone.

Every dish exquisite.  Diet? Fuhgedabowdit. Order the cannoli. ..even if you gotta take it to go.
