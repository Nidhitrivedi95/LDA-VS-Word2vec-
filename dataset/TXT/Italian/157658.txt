Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA We had a very nice experience here.  We were hungry, and stopped here on a whim.

We both ordered calzones for dinner.  The calzones were baked, not fried which is my favorite way to prepare a calzone.  They didn't come with marinara sauce on top, but the waitress promptly brought me a dish when I asked for some.  I never had ham in a calzone before, and I loved it!  Smoky pork married with lots of mozzarella, what's not to like?

We didn't have appetizers or dessert, and the calzone was definitely big enough to fill us on it's own.  All in all, a wonderful dinner decision.
