5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA My family and I just love this place. Fresh, real, consistently awesome Italian food. My dad is a "REAL" Italian and swears this is some of the best stuff he's ever had. The grilled romaine salad is excellent and something I've never had before but sure am glad I tried it! The shrimp on the stone is a must EVERY time we go there, the dipping sauce is addicting! I always seem to order the Ventano Tortellini, HIGHLY recommended! Chicken, mushrooms, tortellini in a pink sauce covered with cheese and baked in an oven. Its like "adult mac and cheese" and I can't get enough of it. My dad usually gets linguine with prawns and scallops and fresh basil, and raves about how fresh everything tastes and how perfect the pasta noodles are cooked. They also have a nice wine and beer selection for those interested. The staff are all super friendly and always remember us when we come in. This is a great neighborhood restaurant that is as good as anything on the strip or anywhere else. Prices seem fair because i'm ALWAYS happy with what I eat, I'll pay a few extra dollars for something I truly enjoy eating. And i havent had anything here that i didnt like. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for really good Italian food. Also, the view of the strip out the huge windows (or out on the patio) is amazing! We'll be back soon! Keep up the great work guys!
