JBrBsKpw0bbXK5nlrXVOYQ We live down the street from the restaurant. It's one of our usual dinner joints. It is a Mom & Pop place, but food it great. I recommend the "THIN" crust pizza. We usually have the large antipasto salad with house dressing. It feeds 4 people! The garlic bread is the "BOMB". We use the private room, in the back, for all our special occasions, it's perfect!
