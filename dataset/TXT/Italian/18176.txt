2LOTz08OPRyA0ibJImJRbQ We had an absolutely sublime meal at Impasto during our first trip to Montreal. Our waiter was friendly, charming and made perfect suggestions for us. The pasta with lemon was incredible and just the right size and the porchetta with pear and greens was unforgettable. Would return in a heartbeat and recommend to others. Great spot!
