FmraE2CWt65VRnEqCAqNEg I have nothing special to report about my visit to this place.  The sandwich was ok, the appetizers were ok, the service was ok - but nothing impressed me other than the pretty bartender who looked a lot like Olivia Wilde.  I guess if you live near this place, and want to try it out, there's really no reason not to - but don't go out of your way.
