7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ Campbell and 40th is my favorite food intersection in Phoenix so far. 

The food itself is probably worth 4 stars but I'm going to bump it up for Courtney, our server who was great. Prompt, efficient, friendly.  This place is actually very reasonably priced if you order the right things.  Each pizza is enough to share (as stated on the menu) but we were ambitious and ordered more than enough. Thus, it allowed for us to sample different kinds and take some home which I'm def not complaining about.  The tap beer prices are also a great deal if you order the growler and split among friends. I'll probably buy the jug next time, which you can bring back and get even more discounts on a refill.

Pizzas had a great crust, like a thin crunchy asiago flatbread. Don't forget to add the freebies like onion, garlic, egg, chiles, and extra love. Very good. Friends had gelato and a red velvet cupcake that they said were enjoyable.  Atmosphere is spot on for a joint in Arcadia. Server correctly split our bill without hassle. 

Pizza, beer, fun. I'm going to find a fat, lazy day where I just go back and forth between Postino and LGO.
