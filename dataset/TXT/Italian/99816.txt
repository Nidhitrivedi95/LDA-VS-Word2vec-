F5BCXUpQpCRPeFmWnQmSJA So I haven't been back here for a few months and I noticed a few things different this time around. The service seems to be more attentive, the steak salad I normally order seems to be more fresh and steak meat in salad is more flavorful, and the portions are a little more generous. For example, I normally ask for extra dressing on the side and this time I didn't need it. The atmosphere seems to be more intimate like its run as a family business. 

I asked my waiter if they were under new management and he confirmed it's under new ownership. Well that explains it. I've always loved coming here. Even though I live 7 minutes away from the new one in Summerlin Downtown, I still find myself driving the extra 10 minutes to come back to this one. The new owner Linda stopped by to say hi and super nice by the way. She's all about quality and service. I was fine with the way it was before, but I have to say "I love this place" even more and will definitely be coming back to this one. The new one lacks quality and service and you pay a premium to dine/drink there. I don't have a problem paying the premium, but if you can get it all in one place, why not come to this one. So let your steering wheel drive you here.
