nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Tried this place for summerlicious. Decor is very simple, looks like an old Subway converted into a restaurant. Food is unbelievable. I had the shrimp tempura that came in shot glasses with exotic pineapple salsa. My husband had the quail, so tasty and perfectly cooked.
Owners are really friendly, although service is a bit slow.
Try the Lindt ice cream for dessert, its heavenly.
