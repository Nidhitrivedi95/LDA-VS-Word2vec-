kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ What a gracious host for our Yelp Elite Event! The food and drinks here were WAY above what I expected, nicely done! I started the night out with a play on a Moscow Mule, but with strawberries and Thyme. How have I never thought to do that? Brilliant! For the event, we had a humongous seafood tower with perfectly cooked seafood, awesome risotto station and a large charcuterie table with all the fixins. They were also walking around handing out small plates such as beef wellington, french onion soup and several types of Ceviche and Tartare, all were fantastic! I'm excited to come back as the menu looked terrific and they have bottomless bloody mary's for $15 on the weekend . yessssss!
