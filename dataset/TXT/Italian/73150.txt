CJvN2k3gjR7JspTx21icTQ Thin crust pizza with novel toppings... has the concept been done to death?  Maybe... with a plethora of other options sporting similar concepts, the warm smile of the proprietor stands out as a great feature of the place.

Small in size, it's definite a "neighbourhood shop".  Tartufo Bianco oil with actual truffles is always a plus.

So glad that's on the menu.
