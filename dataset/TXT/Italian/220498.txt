SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Awesome find, totally worth the effort to leave the strip. Cocktails were great, food was delicious, staff was attentive, happy hour pricing was absurd. We would happily pay full price for this experience, couldn't believe how little we spent. Seems to be busy ALL of the time - make a reservation, even on a Wednesday night.
