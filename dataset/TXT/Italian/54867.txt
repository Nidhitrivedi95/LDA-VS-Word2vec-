aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ Took a friend here for his birthday tonight. The appetizer would have been good had it it been one of the treats you're brought before the meal. It was the clam Po' Boy. Each white bread little bun had two .75 inch clams and some delicious sauce. Our entrees were good; he had the steak, I had the salmon. The most disappointing part of the meal was the dessert. He had the chocolate and mint and I had the strawberry something. Imagine what a 7th grader puts together as a final home Ec project that sits in the fridge for a few days until parents come in for your class presentation. The chocolate was like a choco-jello mix that's been sitting out for too long. My strawberry thing was on a pastry that I simply couldn't cut through with a spoon it was so hard. For special occasions I recommend Christopher's or Vincent's. I took a risk tonight and it didn't pay off.
