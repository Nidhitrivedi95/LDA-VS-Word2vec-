88Mq2edCXyXRtjmY_Vkarg Great local restaurant, owned by Rico Lorenzini, who used to be a chef for the now-closed Louis Tambellini's on Rte 51 and previously Mount Washington.  Sort of pricy, in my opinion, so go for lunch when it's cheaper or reserve this place for a special occasion dinner.  I really love the salad here, and try the fried zucchini as an appetizer.  Seafood ala Rico, the Virginia spots, and the scallops have always been good.
