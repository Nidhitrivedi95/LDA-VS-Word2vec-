The menu board does not even begin to convey what my delicious sandwich entailed. I was having menu anxiety and asked the cashier what the most popular cold sandwich was, she told me #2 so I went for it ("half" sandwich for $6 and some change) and specified the baguette for my bread. I know it had cappicola and asagio cheese and another meat but did not realize it would also include red onions, marinated peppers, and vinegar and oil. 

Per the menu board, my #2 was simple and unappealing, per the basket of deliciousness at my table, my sandwich was the best Italian sub I have found in Phoenix. The "half" sandwich alone was plenty to fill my lunchtime hunger.

I cannot wait to go back and try more of their sandwiches, pastas, the amazing looking antipasto salad, and various desserts perfectly displayed in a cooler in front of the deli counter.
