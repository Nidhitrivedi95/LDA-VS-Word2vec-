FhVYpbvE8IQeUHAcwPPIXg The restaurant was nice, we ordered pizza with mushroom, sausage and extra cheese.  It was our first time there and it had been a long week so I was looking forward to relaxing and my male friend and I thought we would try out Gabriella since it was close to home.  Our server was not pleasant, he made us feel rushed, he was rude.  We ordered our pizza and it was Luke warm. Our server gave us our bill and kept coming back every three to five minutes checking to see if we put money inside for the bill.  He made us very uncomfortable and was sending a message loud and clear we were not welcomed as customers.  I will not return to that place and will tell my friends don't go.  I hate to complain everyone needs a job,  this   Server was ridiculous.
