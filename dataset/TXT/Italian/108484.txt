fzxvmA3Ygu3yrQQ6-cEpTw My wife and I had some time to kill on Sunday night and decided to try the place out. We're fans of Chopped and Italian food. Our only concern was getting a seat since it only recently opened: a phone call confirmed no reservations available and that there might be a wait.

5:30 PM and we were seated right away!

Last thing first: the food was amazing! We had the fettucine, cavatelli, and a side of Brussels sprouts. The fettucine was lightly dressed and the mushrooms really added to the flavor. The duck and arugula in the cavatelli were similarly fantastic. My wife and I both agreed that the Brussels sprouts were an improvement over her recipe, so she's going to use that technique in future cooking.

The waitress (Katelynn, maybe?) was a frequent presence and extremely helpful in picking wine, blocking the sun at sunset, and boxing up our leftovers. I gave over 20% tip she was so engaging. Apparently our entrees were taking too long so she gave us a burrata appetizer to tide us over. We hadn't even noticed any delay so I appreciated the conscientiousness.

We had a decent seat to watch food coming out of the kitchen and have picked out at least the next four visits' meals! (A manager stopped by repeatedly to check on us, which I usually find a distracting interruption, but she did it well and I didn't even think about it until this review.)

The only complaint is that the music was loud, but I've abandoned any expectations of quiet when dining out. Oh, and there were no risotto dishes. I love risotto!
