YJS7cXGLAvWw9DUDXpw84Q Seen all the reviews about how great the food and service was, so I wanted to try it for myself. Boyfriend and I go to eat, we get sat quickly, drinks come snappy but we ended up waiting for 15 mins only for the server to check on us once. Another male server is walking around and doesn't even want to acknowledge us. They didn't even want to make eye contact. So they hid behind the bar and in the kitchen so we wouldn't get served. Rule number 1, never judge a person by the cover of its book especially the color of their skin or what they wear, some of US have money and we like to spend and tip GENEROUSLY because getting paid at 8.50 or less an hour doesn't pay the bills but whatever I can spend money and support a different Italian eatery elsewhere.
