NFHlMOEyVsbqY_VQNJFafQ Went there on Friday January 30 for dinner.  Was seated pretty quickly however noticing people complaining about not getting there food or not getting their order taken.  We sat for almost 30 minutes and not even got a water.  There was a couple sitting next to us and I overheard the gentleman tell the very young waitress that while he is finished  with his meal his wife never got her meal.  The waitress responded with oh what did she even order.  At that point I decided to leave since it was late and my daughter was really hungry.  The staff seemed like they were all high school age and the man working the bar was rude.
