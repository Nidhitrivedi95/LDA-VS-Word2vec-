i53HvxUdQEMllZ1XmpjjyA Delivery was about a hour, I ordered the spaghetti, Caesar salad, and jalapeño poppers. The spaghetti was good the salad was mediocre and the croutons where soft not crunchy, and do not order the jalapeño poppers, they where cold and don't look appetizing and I only ate one and it wasn't worth ordering again. The spaghetti wasn't bad but I could make it better however I would order it again, I haven't tried the pizza but might next time. The food is inexpensive, I only give it 3 stars based on the spaghetti I don't think I'd order the salad or poppers ever again.
