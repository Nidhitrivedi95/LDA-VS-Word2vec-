DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA Stopped in this little place for a quick bite before a movie on Sunday and had the best Albacore tuna sandwich ever in history. I could not believe how good it was. The tuna had chunks of green apples and sweet toasted pecans. Sandwich was served on cinnamon raisin bread which I normally would not have ordered, but it was perfect. 

After the movie went back there for wine because it was only $4.00 a glass on Sunday afternoons. What a wonderful afternoon with friends. Although I did not eat pastries, I checked them out in the case and they were beautiful, will definitely go back and buy for little gifts when I visit the Grandmas. Small and perfect desserts.

Loved, loved this little place! Prices were fair.
