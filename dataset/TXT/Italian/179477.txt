nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A Don't waste your time and money going to Buddy V's for Happy Hour.  We were seated outside the restaurant in the walkway and the seats had wood slates that were uncomfortable. We tried 6 dishes that were basically fast junk food with little flavor.

Our waitress was hap hazard with her service forgetting twice to fetch a glass for a bottled drink and only bringing 5 of the 6 appetizers with the 6th one arriving about 15 minutes later.

Afterwards we walked across to Carlos bakery and there was not one item that looked spectacular.  Food was grossly overpriced even in comparison to other Strip bakeries by 30%.
