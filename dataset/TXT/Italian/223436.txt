SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw Best pizza on the the southeast side of town. Located in a fairly old shopping center on Gibson off of the 215, you wouldn't expect this kind of quality from this unlikely place. It's tucked right behind a gas station in a residential area. We found this place because we wanted an alternative to the high-priced Grimaldi's. 

My family and I like the meatball pizza. In comparison to Verrazanos and New York Pizza (on Jones and Sahara), Bistro proves to be arguably superior. HOWEVER, Grimaldi's is still the best in Vegas imo. I just can't stand paying $35 for a pizza, which is why Bistro gets most of my business when I want a pie. 

To sum up my review, Bistro is proving to be the best of Las Vegas and Henderson. For the quality you get in a Bistro pizza, you can't beat the value.
