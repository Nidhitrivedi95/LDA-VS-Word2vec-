A group of 10 of us were looking for somewhere we could go on a Friday night where we wouldn't have to wait an hour and we ended up here. The restaurant is very nice on the inside and the patio, which is where we sat. When we came, they had a large enough table set up for us and the ambiance was very welcoming and gave you a small taste of Italy.

We started with the calamari and it was delicious! Their marinara sauce seems homemade and it paired very well with the calamari and the bread they brought to the table. The bread had some kind of seasoning on it that was delicious and it was cooked to perfection with a hard crust and soft inside.

We ordered a wide range of food from steak to pasta, salmon, vegetarian dish, etc. No one had any complaints. The food came out in good timing. They had a nice wine selection and the server was quite knowledgeable about the wines and the food. Although no one purchased any, their desserts looked wonderful! They ranged from cheesecake, creme brulee, cake, etc.

I would definitely return to this place. They are a tad pricey but worth it.
