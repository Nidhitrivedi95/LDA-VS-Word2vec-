djKTruHtS4n_vlfOknxjRw Reading one mediocre review after another made me terrified to return here after a year's absence, but I was pleased to see things are just as I remember them. The daily specials remain as uninspired as always (seafood, chicken and lamb entree) but luckily there are enough tried-and-true options on the menu to satisfy most cravings. There's Prosecco on offer for $30/bottle as well as other wines, and sitting outside is a nice option on busy weekends when there's lots of people-watching to be done on Bloor Street West.

Tonight I had the grilled salmon entree (in cream sauce with angel hair pasta, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots and wilted spinach) for $15 and it was fabulous. My least favourite server of all time (who I can only imagine was at the helm of all the recent 1-2 star reviews) is still there, but I've picked up tactics in order to avoid him entirely. There's a cute, perilously young server that's recently started working here and he's a real charmer. If you previously hated the service this guy might turn you around.
