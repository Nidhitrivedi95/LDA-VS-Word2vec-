qRTbYc7ennnwfr992kfjdA Had a Groupon to use here.  My work schedule was insane and the days I could use it were limited.  My partner and I decided to celebrate my birthday here.  Unfortunately she got sick and we had to cancel.  I called 10 days in advance before it expired to make a another reservation.  I was informed that the last day the Groupon was valid, the restaurant was closed for a private function (that's a breach of contract).  I asked if they could extend it but the person on the phone wasn't in authority to do so and I was promised a callback from the manager.  After multiple calls on multiple days, I never received a call from anyone in authority who could extend the Groupon.  I contacted Groupon to complain about the lack of communication from Management.  Groupon issued a refund.  I see all the 5 star reviews, and I guess I will never know how good the food is because they never allowed me to step foot in the door.  Too bad for them as we could have been repeat customers.
