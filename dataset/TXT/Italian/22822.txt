3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg Went with my wife for our anniversary and we both had steak. Probably the best steak we've had in years! We ate upstairs on the roof, it was quite romantic. They had a shallow pool in the middle with floating candles and flower petals, the roof even opened up to show the stars and night sky. Was very classy. A tad but dark though, I couldn't see very well at first.
