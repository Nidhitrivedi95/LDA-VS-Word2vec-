_v3WsjEworH53RcWzWKEEw Simple lunch spot in the PATH. I went for a business lunch and it was decent. There were certainly nice options that appeared on the menu. I chose the simple margherita pizza. I like to choose that style of pizza at Italian restaurants with thin crust pizza to compare them. The crust on this one was too big and it wasn't served hot enough. The pieces of mozzarella were a little too thick and there wasn't enough basil. The sauce was very tasty though. And the chili oil they gave on the side was also tasty. My lunch colleague got the lunch special and she enjoyed it.
