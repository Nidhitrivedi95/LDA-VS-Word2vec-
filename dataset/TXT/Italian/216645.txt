RThuRlhMdowhtY8vITEIzQ Best Pizza, bar none, in the city. A gooey, greasy, incredibly flavorful pie (thin crust of course). I used to drive one home all the time when I lived in Ohio. I had to put the pizza in the trunk ('cause in the backseat it was torture driving home). If ya haven't had a "cut", go NOW.
