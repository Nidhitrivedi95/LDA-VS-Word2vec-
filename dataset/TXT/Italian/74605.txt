CqCWN9aBJf8YNJxyel7psg Glass nickel pizza is definitely a place to get pizza if your craving really good speciality pizza, personally I get the chicken or chicken bacon ranch. And I am never unsatisfied.

Another thing that is very nice about this place is the fact that you can get not only pizza but other foods and this is very appealing when you want pizza but also are craving fries or foods like that. 

Now I do have to say that the prices are a little high when it comes to there food but I'm assuming its because of the fact that they are slightly larger than normal pizzas you can get at places like Pizza Hut, so I guess it's worth the price, and they are never late when I order my pizzas and never have any problems with them.

That being said I am giving them four stars because of the fact that there prices are a little high, I get they are slightly bigger but two large pizzas reach into the 30 to 40 dollar range depending on what kind of pizza.
