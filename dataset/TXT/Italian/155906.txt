L3R7y3_tUKQlM9kor4-Ccw This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto right now! Their food is out of this world - especially their seasonal specials! I love love love their famous prawn linguine! You can't go wrong at Jamie's! They also have the best non-alcoholic drinks ever! A lot of the times, I find restaurants don't have enough good non-alcoholic options. I would definitely recommend the refresher or lemon Ricky (seasonal). The service is amazing - their people really know what they are talking about! Good wait time management as well - they just text you when you're table is ready so you can maximize your time at Yorkdale Mall! For the quality and brand as well as the location, it's really good value! Never been disappointed here and I have recommended many friends and family who have also enjoyed their time here very much. Don't hesitate - guarantee you will have a great time!!
