eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA Disappointing Easter brunch. Went to what was supposed to be their special Easter brunch today. Was told there would be the Easter bunny, which there was, an egg hunt, and special coloring pages for kids. Well, only the bunny made it. And the food selections were too basic: scrambled eggs, French toast, biscuits, sausages, bacon, potatoes. Also muffins and  Danishes that were obviously not made there. That's it. They even had a nice pre printed menu for the day. It's a pretty restaurant with nice atmosphere, but a real let down for special brunch.
