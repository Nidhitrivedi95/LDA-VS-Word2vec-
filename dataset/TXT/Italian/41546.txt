7oEKIG7d1ttPRejppZ3WIA We arrived around 8:15am on a Sunday morning, and got a table right away.  We were a party of two, but there were larger tables available as well.  By 8:30, the restaurant was full and there was a lineup.
The service was very good; the servers were very friendly and kept our coffees filled, which was a good thing as our food took awhile to come out.  It was worth the wait though.  I ordered Eggs Benny with tomato and pesto (added avocado) and my sister ordered Huevos Rancheritos.  Both were delicious and tasted fresh.
Lady Marmalade would get 5 stars from me if it weren't for the slightly long wait for the food, as well as some dust I noticed next to our table.  I'd still go back (although not after 8:30).
