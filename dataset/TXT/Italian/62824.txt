B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw Best italian restaurant in toronto i have ever seen. With my friend we shared "calamarta con gamberi" (with shrimp and tomato sauce) and "mafalde ai fungi" (mushroom sauce). The atmosphere is very friendly. If you wanna hangout this place is the most convenient place. I had a good time..
