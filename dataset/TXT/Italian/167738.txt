Mi5uhdFB9OJteXPd0_IKfw Ate here as a late night meal while I was in Phoenix for a race. It was suggested by the concierge at our hotel. The food was decent a but overpriced for the quality but the ambience was mellow and nice. As you can see from my review... it was a pretty bland experience, but not bad.
