SkSkWld_ijmWVEDo9_ztKw I ordered a small cheese pizza. 
I checked in on yelp and found a coupon for one (1) free garlic knot. Free food so I was excited but when I presented it to the guy, he said I have to order a large pizza to get it. Looking back at the coupon, yes indeed,  the coupon says so at the bottom. But hey, It's all about customer service, customer want to try a piece of it, with or without coupon you should just give it and make your customer happy. Your customer get to try it and hope they like it and buy a whole order. Well that's just my thinking. 
Pizza was good.
