FyKefsWq62xeXpje0Flcig We were attracted to this restaurant because of good reviews posted elsewhere.  So my wife and I went for lunch.  My wife really liked the Pizza Bianco, and we even had enough left over for dinner that night too!  I had a sandwich and got a side of fries.  Unfortunately, the fries looked like they'd been done in oil that hadn't been hot enough as they were a little soft/soggy.  Nonetheless, I ate them and they tasted just right.  We said we'd go back and try them for dinner sometime.
