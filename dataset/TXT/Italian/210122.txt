qvQ-i1HgSloSJLkGnXsfhw Oh Red Devil, how I missed you so.  I can't recall how long it has been since first experiencing pizza from Red Devil, but it has been a long time. I was in the area tonight and decided to hit the old place up with a buddy (fellow yelper Joey L.) of mine. Upon entering, I remembered the place like it was yesterday. How, you ask? That would be because it looks the same inside as it did a million years ago. That may bother a few, but I love the old time feel. It brings you back to going to a restaurant for the food and food only. As for the grub, my friend and I started by knocking out an order of 10 wings coated in their medium NY sauce. I had to ask our waitress what the sauce was made of because it was that good. She stated the sauce is a combo of hot sauce, butter, and vinegar. Whatever it was, I wanted more. For dinner we had the Devil Special Pizza, which included pepperoni, sausage, onion, green pepper, and mushroom. The pizza was great. The crust was soft and firm in all the right places; while the cheese was very cheesy, and the meat was very flavorful. Definitely one of the better pizzas I have had in some time. On a side note, the ranch provided for the wings was very good and was not watered down as many pizza joints seem to do these days. Since I use ranch on my pie, it's a big deal to this guy. Overall, a very nice meal.
