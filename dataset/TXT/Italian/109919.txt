G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q BREAKFAST ONLY REVEIW. This was our second time for breakfast at Giada. The space is bright and airy. After a night in Vegas, this is a perfect spot. Quiet, clean, inviting. The dishes, light fixtures, furniture, colors, artwork, and even the hostess uniforms are all well appointed. Because it's breakfast, I don't want - nor do I expect - to get too adventurous. But Giada made it clear that their eggs and toast are simply much better than others. It's expensive. It's supposed to be. And you should know that going in ($6 for a plain coffee). The staff is friendly with just a sprinkle of attitude, arrogance and condescension. It's an annoying tendency I've been noticing lately in the service industry: Example, A hostess at Chili's becomes quite affected, cool and proud of herself when she becomes a hostess at Craftsteak. You're a hostess, get over yourself and smile.
