gae9LAyt7Qvf_OgAkWASxA I had to give it one star to post but no stars for the Station Square location would be overrated.  The worst food, bar none, that I have ever been served.  I have consulted yelp on many occasions but only now felt a need to forewarn my fellow diners: Avoid this place. We ordered a salad which was the only passable substance that was placed on our table.  The pasta marinara was overcooked cheap pasta with something like undrained pureed tomatoes for sauce.  It was literally floating in half a bowl of water.

We also ordered Chicken Marsala which came in a sauce that tasted like something between molasses and maple syrup.  That might fly on bacon or breakfast sausage but chicken and mushrooms?  Yikes.

The only high point was a reduction of about 90% on the bill after complaining.  Five stars to our waiter, he definitely did all he could to please us.
