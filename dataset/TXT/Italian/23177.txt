3q8MtOEIJ6nC7kVv_8Mfgw Service was unnattentive and food was BLAH!

I ordered the sea bass special and almost choked.  The whole fish presentation was nice but there were still many large bones in the fish.  

Dinner was going well until a bee chased us back indoors from sitting on the patio.  Not a problem, that's one of the elements you face when sitting outdoors.  However, the cockroach that appeared from the bench seating was not cool.  After that I mentally questioned the cleanliness of the restaurant.  

As soon as we saw that we downed our drinks and bolted for the door.  Never again!
