IXUwuNjy707wJNW2U4sRVg Long time fan, great food, Jon is awesome. This visit was unusual, however.

Been coming to Alessia's for years now, I try to bring everyone I know, it's that good. Great food, wonderful people, and great Italian wine selection. It's always a pleasure to see Jon there and he really makes you feel special.

Only had one issue this last time, we sat in the new annex room next to the bar and it felt a bit like a no man's land regarding service. Our waiter came around infrequently and not once throughout our main course were we brought water or asked about wine, etc. I would have ordered another glass if only I had been asked! Also, had to dine among our dirty plates from appetizers as they never came to get them.

Felt compelled to leave a review this time because this was not normal for Alessia's, that said, I'll be back for sure, no where else can you get great food and authentic Italian wine! Thanks, Jon! Don't forget about people who sit in the new, wine tasting room though!
