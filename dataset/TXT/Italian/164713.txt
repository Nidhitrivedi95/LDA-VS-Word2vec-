LZSyWy4IHgXg6QhW2jrBlw I only frequent this place once a year, its where I went on my first date with my boyfriend 2 years ago-- So its a special place for us.
I enjoy the service, very warm and friendly. We were offered a complimentary dessert in honor of our anniversary, but we were too stuffed from dinner to need any dessert. 
This is a good place for families and groups. I like the open kitchen plan. There is also take out option and a bar to quench your thirst if you so chose. Many items on the menu to chose from depending on what you are craving.. appetizers, soups, salads, seafood, chicken, pasta, and vegetables to name a few. 
See you next year! :)
