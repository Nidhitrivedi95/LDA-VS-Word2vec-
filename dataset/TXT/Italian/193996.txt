We opted to get the pasta and were so glad we did.  If we hadn't gotten the pasta, we would have just gotten about 12 big lonely shrimp on a plate.  The food was very good, but the service was pretty slow.  It took about five minutes for our waitress to come to our table to take our drink order.  They have these oversized shot glasses for your water, which I thought was odd but maybe it is to prevent spilling when patrons reach across the table to get more food.  It is a big pricey, but you do get a lot of food, and we were able to take home leftovers and eat on it the next day.  It wasn't as good as the day before, but it was still pretty tasty.
