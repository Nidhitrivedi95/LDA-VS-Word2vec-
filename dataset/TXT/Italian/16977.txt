277ETKOLg1XreTWL8hGlHw Fantastic service and amazing food. Not much else you can ask for. My table has the Gnocchi, Stuffed Rigatoni, and the Eggplant - all was exceptional. It's nice to finally have an Italian eatery where the food is light and fresh, instead of heavy and sad looking. Finished everything off with their Fig and Brie gelato - delicious.
