XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q Came here around 3 in the afternoon, had a party of 2 and a small child which was sleeping. Our waiter was Semir, and i must say i was highly satisfied wwith his service, and work ethic. I have been to this olive garden a couple of times but never had service like this.

In the middle of our late lunch we needed a little more cheese for our salad and we stopped Austin since Semir was a little busy with other guests. Austin had a great attitude. He never told me he would tell my waiter. He just did it because he saw our waiter was busy and he wasn't as busy. Overall the only reasons it wasnt 5 stars is because we saw atleast 6 empty booths when we got there but still had a 10 min wait. Best servers at this location to date.
