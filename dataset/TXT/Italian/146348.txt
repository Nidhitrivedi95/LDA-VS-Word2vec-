K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ I started inquiring about bachelorette venues over a year before our wedding, and encountered Kelly Kusumi at Hyde at the Bellagio.

I cannot say enough great things about Kelly!

She was so helpful and sweet from start to finish coordinating pricing and working on the best deal for my group of girls.

We even made things difficult by authorizing on one credit card and then having my fiancé come in the night of the party to provide a different card to charge to. Kelly didn't even bat an eyelid and gave my fiancé a tour of the beautiful club.

We were treated like royalty from the second we walked in. And the table.......OMG THANK YOU KELLY!!! Our table was at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Our whole group was beyond impressed and we had a fantastic night. Our waitress was sweet and so attentive.

I couldn't have asked for a better venue and experience for my bachelorette party and I cant thank Kelly enough for everything she did for us. We will definitely be back!
