7HjVdfoTqs4YbKqmoyKOeQ Have ordered from here a few times, mainly when I've found a code for money off.


 First time we ordered the base was solid in the middle, like bread goes when it's been microwaved!


 But decided to give it another go and have ordered a couple of times since then and it's been fine. I really like the stuffed crust pizzas and they have quite a good choice of starters too. We love their desert, think it's called 'choccy bites' that's 48 tiny chocolate covered pieces of ice cream, they're great!
