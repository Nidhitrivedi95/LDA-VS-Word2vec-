LZSyWy4IHgXg6QhW2jrBlw Last time, I gave this place 4 stars about a year ago because I was pretty pleased. Came back and our server/hostess Danny was so amazing I just had to go back and update my review. Simply due to her customer service, how attentive she was to both myself and my preggo bff, between the food and everything else I had to give this place 5 stars! My bff and I are definitely going to come back more often simply because this lady made our experience so memorable. Thank you Danny!
