pM4mWLjeaZJlcdUxut2lMg One of the best services we have ever had and a really excellent pizza, which we almost regretted ordering after seeing the delicious pasta being served around us! Really attentive waiters who were great for recommendations, particularly the sicilian wine. Even the nostalgic bowl of ice cream was really, really good. Well worth a visit!
