88Mq2edCXyXRtjmY_Vkarg Ran a little late to our reservation at 9pm by 8 minutes. 

Place was deserted, but there was another table there. 

Felt rushed by everything especially if we see and heard the OWNER of the restaurant rushing our servers, Janice and Don.

Bread was not fresh. 

Caesar salad was fresh as they make it right next to your table. I enjoyed it.

The shrimp Alla Rico? Was alright. I should of gotten the scallops. 

French onion soup was good.

The surf and turf was amazing! The lobster was so sweet, to die for.

This was my first time eating veal and it was alright. It was kind of plan for my taste.

Our food came out and some of our members lost their appetite as they saw the owner rushing the servers so we had to pack our food Togo and get out of their hair. Our food came around 950. We asked for the check at around 10:15. 

Janice and Don was great though. Thank you for the experience! 5 stars are for you guys. 

One star is for the owner displaying such behavior literally two steps away from our table which was totally awkward.
