k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ Went here for the first time on Wednesday evening at the suggestion of my son. We were a party of 5 but were seated immediately. Service was excellent, the waiter was really knowledgeable and explained many of the items on the menu in detail. Food was excellent and the overall experience was very good.
