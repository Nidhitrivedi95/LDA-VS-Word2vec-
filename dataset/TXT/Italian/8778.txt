0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ We've been to Novecento a few times now.  We love how quickly the brick oven cooks and chars the pizza which always results in a delicious meal.

That said, EVERY time we've been there the service has been mediocre at best. There is always mass confusion between all the employees, even when we've seen the owner (or perhaps manager?) working the line or the pizza oven as well. When were were there last, he was visibly stressed and short-tempered with this employees. He seems like a nice guy so it was a shame that the customers had to observe him like this.

The left hand is definitely not talking to the right at this restaurant. The cashiers are confused as to whose orders are whose which leaves a long line of customers telling them "That's my order!" or "Wait, that's mine!"  During all of this, the take-out orders continued to get mixed up with in-house orders. We saw customers finally just get frustrated and walk out.

It's like watching a train wreck. You don't want to watch but you can't look away from the carnage. 

There is definitely something missing in terms of efficiency here. I hope they figure out what it is to make the food service/cashier part run much more smoothly. It'd be a shame to see it go out of business since their food is excellent.
