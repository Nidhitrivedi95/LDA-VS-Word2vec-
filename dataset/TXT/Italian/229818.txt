TAoN9nsibXOxsOnnG7Kd_g Excellent and quick service. Wonderful ambiance. I took my wife here for Valentine's Day and the setting was just right. The food was pretty tasty but I would have gotten the regular lasagna instead of the spinach lasagna. Overall great place. I think I'll come bake for lunch when the prices are cheaper.
