Huo1lJmVkdqvFuLtA74Nhw Great old school checkered table cloth style pasta and pizza.  The Pavarotti pizza is the deluxe pizza.  They deliver too which brings me back to my childhood because their extra large pizza is a REAL EXTRA LARGE PIZZA, not the modern downsized version.  I love going there before a movie.  Not all of their pasta dishes meet my expectations but you know, it's not actually authentic Italian, because I think the owners are from Greece.
