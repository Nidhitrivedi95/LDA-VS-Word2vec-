Nico's in a location far away
Come around to Gilbert downtown
So many things that I want to try
You know I like my songs a little bit older
I just wanna try your food tonight
I just wanna try your drinks tonight

I got so many yelpers left to talk to
No one's around when you're in trouble
You know I'll be giving 5 stars for food
Start with Apps and end with housemade pasta
I just wanna try your food tonight
I just wanna try your drinks tonight


So I learned when I came that this was the sister restaurant to Virtu and got excited!  I came with a group of the foodie friends.  The place has a nice open layout and a contemporary rustic posh feel and look. 

We sat and I shot for a quick cocktail since I as remember Virtu has some fun cocktails; needless to say, Nico's didn't disappoint.  For my appetizer I shot for their famous Octopus starter; Octopus, lemon chickpeas, and chili butter with a side of arugula salad.  If you haven't had this dish yet you have to try it even if octopus is not your thing.  The octopus was meaty and a hint of saltiness with the chili butter providing a kick of spice.  The chickpeas gave it a nice and welcoming texture along with the bitterness of the arugula salad.  For my entree I ordered their housemade pasta the Pappardelle Salsiccia; sausage ragu, garlic, and peppers.  The pasta was thick and doughy to the bite; almost a tad bit underdone, but I actually like it that way!  

Overall, Nico has great atmosphere and the service here was ready to rock and roll when you are.  I had great experience with my friends and along with great drinks and food here so definitely a recommendation and coming back soon! - Enjoy!
