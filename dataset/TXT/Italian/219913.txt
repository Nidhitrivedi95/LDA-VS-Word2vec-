SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg Oh, how I loved this place! It's a true gem.  The drinks were incredible and I loved the atmosphere. Our bartender Isaiah (?) was so nice and explained the different spirits, he was very attentive on a busy night.

I am going to plan another trip to Vegas, just to come back here.  Their steaks are 1/2 off during happy hour and I want to try one next time.  They looked so yummy!
