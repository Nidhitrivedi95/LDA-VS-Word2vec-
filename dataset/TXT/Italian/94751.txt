Consider yourself warned.  Food was at best mediocre, I ordered the chicken caesar salad, the lettuce did not contain any green leaves but more of yellow.  I also found two "hearts"/stumps, where the meristem originates from the plant.  i.e. the hard part that you do not eat.

My pizza was burnt edges with undercooked dough, resulting in a very interesting experience as i tried to saw through it, flinging toppings across the table.  

after trying to signal the waitress for our bill, gave up after 15 minutes and went up to the front to pay for it.  I heard and saw several other customers faced with the same problem.  This was a 3 o'clock, arguably well past lunch hour rush.
