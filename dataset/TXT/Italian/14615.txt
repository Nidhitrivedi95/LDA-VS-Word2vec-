1FodVSAxoKqEKYQc3QHgvg I used to get delivery from this place fairly often and never had a problem until this one day when I called after waiting nearly 80 minutes with no pizza. I was told that the delivery driver had come to my apartment building, tried calling me on my phone, said nobody answered but then said he managed to get into my apartment building (someone was coming and/or going and let him in) and that he knocked on my actual apartment door. No answer so he left. That's crazy because I was home with my phone next to me. I never got a call nor heard knocking on my apartment door. They said they could send the pizza back out but by then it had been 80 minutes since I first called and I didn't want an old pizza. They didn't seem to believe me when I said I was home the whole time and it was all so strange I just said something like, "I'm sorry then but I no longer want the pizza" and hung up. I hoped it was a one off strange event since I never had a problem before and had ordered an average of every other week over a period of a year. So after a couple of months I decided to try them again. They remembered me and declined to deliver. When I told them that they had delivered successfully many, many times in the past and that I don't know what happened last time and that I was hoping "we could get over that as just a one time oddity" they basically hung up on me. I just can't figure it. One bad delivery experience after ordering many, many times and now they refuse because it's my fault somehow that one time? That seems like poor business to me.
