FcFnVG2NO2a6h6Mi86zaFQ Nice place with modern flair, and excellent hours.  This place is right near where I work so I was very excited to give it a try.  It just doesn't do it for me.  Another review said their espresso drink tasted more like a steamer, and I had the same experience.  I tried the carmella latte, and it was pretty much all syrup, very little espresso.  I couldn't finish it because it was so sweet.  Service was also very slow.  I think if they can work on the product a bit more, this place could be great.
