u9R0_pvEkl7QGPJYH3j1sg Fairly decent place. Been here a couple of times. I'd actually ordered a meal a few days ago and logged into Yelp on my phone to read the reviews - pity I didn't read about the wings sooner! Anyway, I got the D'Angelo pasta - fettucine with mushrooms and a rather nice cream sauce. Other time I was here I got their italian special sandwich. Not too bad - nothing ultra-spectacular (I still prefer Mr Goodcents for sub sandwiches and my own home-made pasta to anywhere else's) but a decent lunch destination. Pasta was $12, add a soda and walked out of there $18 poorer. Bit steep for lunch. Sandwiches of course are a bit less expensive. At lunchtime the place was actually quite full - the seating technician advised that there was a tiny table up the back but I was there with one of the other dudes from work and didn't really feel like getting that close up with him, so we sat at the bar.

Service was great, food came out quick, was fairly tasty, sodas refilled quick (we were at the bar, duh). I'd get take-away next time - it's just expensive enough for me to prefer not to have to pay the extra $ for a tip. Not with gas prices the way they are.

I'll probably go back maybe once every two weeks or so. It's just a-ight far as I'm concerned. I may upgrade my rating after my next visit if the wings turn out to be as good as Luke S. says they are. Doubtful they'll top the wings at Uncle Sam's, though. Their sub sandwich sure didn't top Sam's all-American grinder which is my current favourite hot sub.
