BQqwIYQuo2W94smjrBjy5g Great ambiance, very friendly staff, terrific food! Must try adobo nation and lemoncello dessert. The Filipino fusion dish was unlike any dish I've ever had at an Italian place, and it was fantastic. I can get lasagna anywhere, and this dish really show cased the chef's background and his Italian focus. Don't be afraid to try something new. The chef frequently came out 2 or 3 times) to our table to greet us and ask if the food was to our liking, I am sure if you didn't like something he would make it right. This is our new favorite Italian place!
