An Avant-garde, trendy, Modern establishment with the BEST damn pizza under the sun. Think of going to Pizzeria Bianco as an "experience" not just  "getting dinner". 
Expect long waits on most days if you don't want to get there early enough to be seated immediately. There's a wine bar next door where you will find yummy cheese platters and vino. Which means you can sip and snack while you wait in line. Give yourself about 3 hours for the entire experience and after making a reservation check out the pub just across the way, (if you have to wait a while). They have great beer, my favorite onion rings, a pool table, and indoor-outdoor seating (just be sure to keep checking back to make sure you don't get passed up!) 

Although each magnificent, My favorite Pizza's are: 
 "Sonny Boy"(Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives)  
 "Rosa":   (Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios)
I'm a regular here and the service and quality is always the same: MAESTRO WORK... Eat well, live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do. - Cheers
