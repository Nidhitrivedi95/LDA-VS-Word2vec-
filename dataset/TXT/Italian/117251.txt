GXDRFAunLh0aRao6ERnM4A Waiting for my show, Cirque du soleil, and this place is right across from the show.  It was quick and not too bad.  2 slices and a beer for $10.  Pizza was not too bad.  middle of the road really.  thin crust.  would eat here again, if the situation presented itself in the same manner. would not go out of my way to eat here, but would not say no, if I were nearby and hungry.
