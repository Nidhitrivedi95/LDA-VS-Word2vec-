tpesKzKbcPFekdThYZ4UpA Bar Italia is one of those Little Italy staples I'll happily go to with you if it's your jam, but I will never suggest it as an option. 

They do mussels, pastas, paninis and salads but no pizzas. They have a cute shaded patio right on college and drink specials. These things are mostly wins, save the lack of pizza. Pizza is my fave food group, so their utter disrespect of pies really gets my goat.  

Their sangria is too pricy for what it is: about half of a bottle of wine with a splash of brandy, cheap fruit and some soda for $39? Get a grip. No seriously. Get a grip on the rest of that bottle of wine and pour it in!
