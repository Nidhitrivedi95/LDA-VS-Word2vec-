7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ Really,   seat me in some ante-room-chamber that is not part of the restaurant with the excuse "well it can get loud in the main dining room". Welcome to Vegas you knuckleheads. So what is with the Menu/Pricing structure.  $15 for a taste add another $18 for the full entree?
If you need a taste put it on the Starters/Appetizers menu, the entree should be $33 simple as that. Next porterhouse, $80 per person for 2 only?  seriously, $160 for a steak that is no better than Craftsteak, Cut or any other Carnage in Vegas for 1/3 that price. Adding Mario's name may have intrigued me enough to try this place, but the people running it will NOT bring me back......
