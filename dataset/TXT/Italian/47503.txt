8yiLVWzJyyTEhYE0fVNvlA I went here recently ...  they just  moved some operations west from their amazing restaurant in New York (www.ilmulinonewyork.jp) ..  we had a private room for 8... amazing cuisine.. including sicilian lobster, tri colore pasta, rack of lamb with 8 ribs! 28 ounce steak (a good meal to split), veal scallopini, ... incredible presentation on the food. Tremendous wine list. This is a fine dining experience! The service was fantastic except they forgot to actually prepare my meal... so they only get 4 stars, b*tches! (we were all so hammered by that point that  I just split someone else's meal, it was cool) Extra pricey here.. but if you've just hit it big at the Craps table... check this place out!
