kpZ2vPjkHfee4pCLC05tfg Have just returned home from eating there tonight. The food was fairly tasty and it was a pleasant enough night, until when we were waiting for our bill my girlfriend spotted what can only be described as the biggest rat either of us have seen bound out of the kitchen. This monster proceeded to skip through the restaurant and scurried down to the toilets. We informed the waiter who after having a quick look told us ' It's downtown, it happens.' As someone who has lived downtown for several years and in the same neighbourhood I found this both alarmingly accepting and dismissive. We have never seen a rat this big and this is not an attempt at hyperbole.

They did comp us our bill because my girlfriend felt sick but the way the way the waiter accepted the unwanted guest was shocking.

Found out afterwards that they have recently been taken over by a people who are not Italian so ignore the quaint story in the menu about Italian ownership.

Avoid.
