cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA Ordered delivery online at 2:40 pm was told to expect delivery  in hour and a half, I was a lil disappointed but still ordered. I called at 4:30 pm to see where my pizza was, and they placed me on hold for 15 mins.  I gave up being on hold called back waited on hold another ten minutes and was told to expect my order in 15 minutes.  5:30 pm my pizza finally showed up an hour and twenty minutes late.  The worst part is that the pizza showed up cold and soggy.  I prob will never be back.
