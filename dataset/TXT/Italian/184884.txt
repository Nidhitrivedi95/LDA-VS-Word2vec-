oiv2xp6xWX8ZLgrKDsKdrA First off let me state that my wife loves the Mediterranean subs here. I went for the Gyros platter. You know you are in trouble when a place cannot properly pronounce the food they are selling! It's Gyros " Year ros" or Yeros . I know Pittsburgh thinks it's the way it's said but it only makes people from outside of Pittsburgh think you are a ignorant jagoff. (See? I included Pittsburghese)
 Let's just say it's a good thing I was hungry . It was mildly average. I will break it down.  The pita was actually the best part nice and soft. The lettuce was good. And the purple onions were crisp and tasty. But the sauce was a poor imitation of the standard sauce. As very little was in it making it more like sour cream . It would had been better also if there was more of it offered. Now the meat of the review. Since this is more of a pizza place it was your average put together out of a kit Gyros meat with a little flavor and just a bit over cooked.  
I have been here many times before because of the location being close to my house, and I'm sure I'll be here again I just will remember to stick to the subs.
