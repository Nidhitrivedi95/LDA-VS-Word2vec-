9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg After trekking out to try to get ramen we were faced with a long line. Having tried Scaddabush in Richmond Hill we immediately suggested to go with our 2 other companions.  While they were almost fully booked for dinner at around 7pm we still managed to get a table. Our servers Amanda and Alex get a special mention for taking care of us so well. We got the prosciutto mozzarella of course,  and our companions loved it! Along with some charity bread it was enough to stop the hangry We got for dinner: spaghetti to share with some stuffed meatballs,
 a small pan of carbonara, 
 the Butcher pizza,
And we were all so stuffed! Fresh pasta and tasty sauces made us so content we were glad about not getting ramen for once. 
Plus our companions mentioned how this might be their to go to date night place,  thanks Scaddabush!
