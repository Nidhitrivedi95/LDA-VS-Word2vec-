duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ We came here for a quick lunch on a weekday. Note that they only have buffet on weekends, and then only till 1pm. The dishes are on the expensive side, but what do you expect? It's connected to 4 seasons. We had 3 dishes:

The margarita pizza (I think that's what it's called) - I thought this one wasn't great, though the girlfriend thought it was the best dish. The bread of the pizza felt a bit too soft, and the sauce plus pizza was lacking. Maybe I'm just being too picky since I'm biased towards NY pizza. 

Shrimp tacos - these were great, the shrimp was big and fresh, and the lemon and avocado sauce was interesting. I prefer the taco toasted a bit more, but overall I can recommend this dish. 

Seafood mac and cheese - This was the highlight of the lunch. They did not skimp on the seafood, with chunks of lobster, scallop and shrimp. I devoured it in minutes. Girlfriend did not enjoy it though, so it may be an acquired taste. 

Overall, I give the food a solid 3. The extra star is for the service, our server was very at tentative and checked on us several times to make sure we were ok.
