JogUSDKa1xyG3lLEmD4Xjg Just phenomenal! Hubby & I were blown away by this neighborhood gem! A very unassuming storefront perhaps, but when you walk in the front door, you're greeted warmly & transported into a cozy, romantically-lit setting. It was a bustling Saturday eve, but we sat an out-the-way table for 2 on the second level. Just perfect. The Manager was very attentive & eager to make certain our expectations were being met. Our server, Kerwin, was nothing short of divine; personality plus, a true foodie who was really into his job and service beyond compare. He only wanted our experience to be top-notch. The food was out of this world, beautifully plated, bursting with homemade flavor and loads of TLC! Portion size is very generous; you will not walk away hungry. Being transplants from up North, we've been searching to find a non-chain, Old World Italian restaurant that would give us that authentic taste n' feel of Italy & Fiamma is IT. Hallelujah! If you're craving the real thing when it comes to Italian cuisine & want to be treated like royalty, you just GOTTA check this place out!
