Fajitas are great but everyone hates you when you order them lol get em anyway! LOL! It sets off a chain reaction! One person gets em, everyone smells em, the orders fly into the kitchen. You leave smelling like the wonderful peppers and onions but damn they're good! I can watch all the sports I want. It is a Bar and Grill that's what you kinda expect by the name. Free UFC, great happy hour. If they had a late night I would stay  later!
