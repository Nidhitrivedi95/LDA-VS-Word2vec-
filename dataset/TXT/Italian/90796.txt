eBj_YyJU5jVu6tbZCkdtDA I have never dined in the restaurant, i've only been here for happy hour in the bar.  I've been here multiple times and i have to say it is an exceptional deal. I've had everything off the happy hour menu and its extremely fresh and still pretty big portions. The only thing I wish was them having a better beer selection, but I can not complain because their food makes up for it.  So stop by after work and enjoy a nice fresh happy hour meal.  3:30-6:30 is the happy hour time!
