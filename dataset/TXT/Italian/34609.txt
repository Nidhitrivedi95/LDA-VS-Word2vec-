6guhjMLxtHUOT19T0EQWUg Trebbiano had excellent reviews on TripAdvisor so we decided to give it a whirl.  Making a reservation was simple and the person on the line spoke English which was a help. When we arrived we were met by Bruno who was extremely effusive and gregarious as he led us to our seats. We had no idea what he was saying but the other patrons nodded and smiled and we simply hoped he wasn't calling us names behind our backs. His charm was infectious and we couldn't help but smile with him. 

The wine list was lacking in depth and in any wines that had true character but I understand the Canadian palette to be expectant of wines that are fruity and flowery.  I prefer wines with a bit more grit and dirt...the closest of which was a Gabbiano Chianti Classico Reserva...while there were some Puglian and Sardinian wines the majority were overly fruit forward.

Because I was having a sausage appetizer I selected a glass of the Ruffino Orvietto and we had a perfectly acceptable d'Abruzzo with our main course as it went with nearly everything and was harmless. 

My sausage came slightly overcooked but still delicious on a bed of lightly dressed arugula. The light and fresh Orvietto cut the salt and fat of the sausage perfectly.  All of our mains (all primi's) were well executed but one in our party thought the risotto was a bit too large of a portion. My Carbonara was deliciously salty and creamy. 

Dessert was taken to a whole new level with a caramel cheesecake covered in bacon. Yes bacon. Simply awesome. And when completed with a simple Sambucca the meal was a rousing success.

When on the South shore of Montreal be sure to seek out Trebbiano.
