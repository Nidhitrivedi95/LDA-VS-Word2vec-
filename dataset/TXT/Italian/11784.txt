0tAJwKKzYBVDCrgiQiQS9Q BEWARE!!!!!!!  we made the mistake of eating there, the food tasted good at first then within an hour we were all sick to our stomachs, we overheard the owners screaming at their help and one of the workers actually stood up for herself and said "screw this" and quit on the spot, good for her, we were appalled at the owners, and as we were leaving we noticed the other employees and owner did not ever wash their hands and used same towels from back kitchen to wipe table we were sitting at. I hope health inspectors get there quickly before someone else gets sick like us.  HORRIBLE PLACE!!!!  OWNERS ARE COMPLETE a HOLES!!!!!  AVOID AT ALL COSTS. WE WILL NEVER BE BACK
