TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag Came in for a take out order. I was pretty much ignored for a while while the bartender chatted with two girls who were sitting at the bar. Someone else eventually took my order, and it was brought in a timely manner. When I was handed my to go bag, I asked if there was a fork in the bag. She said yes. Imagine my anger when I got all the way across the casino and up a billion floors to my room and discovered I was given no fork or napkins. I had to go all the way back to the casino to grab a fork from another restaurant. Definitely regretting leaving a tip!

UPDATE 8/8/13- I was contacted by management who more than made amends for my inconvenience. Super impressed with how much they care about their guests!
