LMdUoR00jPxQDWLYRq93FA Quiessence's ambience, a large reason why our dinner this past weekend one of the most memorable I've had in years, draws greatly from the house from which the restaurant operates.  Nestled off of 32nd street on South Mountain, the restaurant is the new tenant of what was once the home of Dwight and Maie Heard.  Arizona is young by comparison to most states, but the culture and history are far richer than its age would imply thanks to such extraordinary citizens like the Heards.  Chiefly known for their museum endowment to the City of Phoenix, the two were a Power Couple before such a term existed.  One could argue that Maie's contributions to the state outshine those of her newspaper / cattleman husband, a feat in and of itself because of the times in which she lived.  In the early 1900's, she was a driving force behind the YWCA, Arizona Red Cross, Little Theatre, Woman's Club, Phoenix Art Assocation, and the founder of the Social Service Center.  

The staff and presentation were excellent, our server Robby deftly handled my 9 year old son's palate trepidations with ease.  The menu was a refreshing surprise worthy of its own review.  I recommend the crudo and ny strip, but you really can't go wrong, as everything we ordered was fantastic.  

Thanks for a wonderful evening.  We'll be back soon!
