PIoUjT9DISeEdmZk55w7jw Quick and good Indian Nepali food. 

Starters - chicken momo's  were dry and not moist. 

Chicken curry Nepali style - was good just like any Indian 
chicken curry with bone in. Not spicy regular spice level even when we ordered hot - they merely added some green chilies to the already ready made curry which didn't do any good. 

Naan - were good not anything special will become rubbery once cold in few seconds. Eat it right away. Garlic naan is better.

Drinks - wines were good about £ 15 a bottle.

Desert - tried kulfi was not impressive but okay. Kulfi Pricy as compared. 

Comments: mainly cons 

Usually onions grew chill's chutneys etc are served with India Nepali food - but here waiter didn't even bring onions or lemon even to add to tandoori plate which is mandatory you can't eat with our sprinkling Lemon lime ! And onions !! He said he can bring green salad and charge for it but will not bring only red onions and lemon even for a charge. 


Service - Hostess and waiters seemed extremely busy and occupied. We were taken after a short wait but mostly No one absolutely will come to welcome and let you know tht the wait time would be so and so and if you can wait few mins then they will have the table ready Etc. 
we saw one family wait for few mins and walk out getting frustrated. 

Catered to Mainly to non Indian Non Asian - European crowd. 

Will not be back if in town. Nothing impressive as it seems after reading the reviews.
