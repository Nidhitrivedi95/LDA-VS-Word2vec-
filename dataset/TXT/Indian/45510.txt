ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw I was passing through town and came towards the end of their buffet time. The tandoori chicken and korma were perfect, though a little spicier than what I'm used to. The other buffet items were good and probably variations on cuisines I've had in the Chicago area. 

I would definitely return and bring a friend the next time I'm in Cleveland.
