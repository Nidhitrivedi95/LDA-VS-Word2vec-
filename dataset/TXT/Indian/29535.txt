jRxLnJ9my31Re_O2MvQGhw I went to tasty bowl today for the first time! I told myself a while ago that no matter what comes to that location I'm not going to go because I am still mad Snoops closed! But today a really sweet girl came into my work and gave me a menu and it was filled with my favorite go-to lunch - chicken pitas! The prices were also slightly under what I'm used to for this area so I decided to head over and give it a try.

I had a really pleasant experience. The food was fresh, hot, and fast. In addition, the owner took the time to ask me where I worked and he even gave me a sample of his Thai sweet chili rice bowl and it was AMAZING! The sauces are homemade and everything is so fresh tasting! It was topped with pico de gallo and a layer of shrimp sauce - both of which were obviously homemade. The owner was kind and generous and when you combine that with fresh, delicious, reasonably-priced food - this place is destined for success! 

Don't be afraid to try a rice bowl - I honestly wouldn't have ordered it but after trying the sample, I have no doubt I will be back quite regularly to chase down that fresh, saucy deliciousness!

**UPDATE***
18 days and more than five rice bowls later, I can officially say this is one of the only places in Steele Creek that I CRAVE! Im so happy to see this place always busy...hopefully that means they will be around for a long time! It's definitely something delicious, unique, and really good quality in the area and was much-needed!!
