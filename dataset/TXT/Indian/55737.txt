x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ Food is really good. But the service is aweful. I don't understand what part of restaurant service they don't get. They have such good food and I hope they don't screw up with the service and drive away the customers forever. I may be one ov those if they continue with this type of ridiculous service .
