yLKoESPQ8BN7dn6ADzZicQ Went here a couple days ago with some friends.  When we got there it was busy so the five of us had to squeeze into a 4 top instead.  The menu was extensive, and service was pretty attentive.  I ended up getting the lamb chops, which were pretty good.   I tried a bit of my friend's fish curry, and I liked that as well.  I ended up spending 20 dollars after tip.  In my opinion for the amount of food, it was a bit on the pricey side.  Overall, a nice new addition to the slew of restaurants already on Green Street.
