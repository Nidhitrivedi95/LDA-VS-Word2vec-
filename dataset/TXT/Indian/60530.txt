zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Just bought the hummus. Whatever the bread is, is disgusting. I can't exactly place the flavor but it keeps reminding me of cigarettes and burnt coffee. I threw it away. I hope I don't get sick from it. The hummus was average but considering the bread, I recommend getting something else.
