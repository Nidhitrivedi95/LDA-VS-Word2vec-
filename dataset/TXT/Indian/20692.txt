g14SuHGkIL-2pSWhRkSSlQ Awful. I was craving some desi food and thought this would be ideal. 

Firstly, when we walked in, nobody really explained what was going on. They just stared at us. So we got our own table and found the menu on the counters. 

Ordered the samosa chaat, chicken kathi roll and pav bhaji. None of the dishes we ordered tasted remotely authentic. Everything had a strong taste of SOME spice. I'm not sure what. But it felt like they had over seasoned everything and it just tasted bitter. If I cooked food I'd be able to point out what spice they used but as an eater...of food for the last 20 something years, I can honestly say this is not Bombay street food. This is a scam to make people overpay for food that does NOT taste good.
