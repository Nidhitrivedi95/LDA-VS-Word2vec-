zKSKmkBxfrltJau_4s1ZHA Food was tasty. Veg and non veg options. But didn't like the smell of the restaurant. When I walked in it smelled like pee. The floors were clean, bathrooms not clogged or anything. They need to figure out their air filtration system I guess. 

Food served on disposable containers. Which makes clean up easy. 

May not go back again personally.
