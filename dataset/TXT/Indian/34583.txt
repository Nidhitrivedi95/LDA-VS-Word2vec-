Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I went to this place while hiding from some weirdo who was chasing me down the Vegas strip. This place has lovely decor and a nice ambience. The buffet is $15.08 with tax, but there's not too much to choose from and they only serve water. Great flavor - better than what I had at a more expensive buffet, but I would have liked to see more variety and something to drink other than water. Pleasant staff.
