0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw I love trying new foods and different local establishments. I have to say this was he best food, service, and environment I have had the pleasure of experiencing. The owner was wonderful and took the time to treat us like family. The food was amazing and the service was perfect. Even if you do not live in Goodyear, I highly recommend making the drive to the India Garden. I usually do not rant and rave about any place, but I know that you will enjoy it as much as I did.
