OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA This place is honestly a Scarborough staple. It has some of the most diverse set of east asian food. The quantity is amazing for the price, nothing is over 10$! I ordered around 4 and got all my dishes at about 415, talk about fast service! Every dish is made very flavourful! Most dishes are very spicy however, so if you don't like spice make sure you specify when you order.
