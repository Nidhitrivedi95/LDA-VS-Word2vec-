RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Our preferred CLT spot for chicken tikka masala and vegetable samosas (with the noted exception of Passage to India, though that's clear across town). The waitstaff at BT is friendly and generally pretty good, though one of our usual servers regularly tends to be a little overconfident about remembering orders and sometimes has to come back to reconfirm (just write it down!). Definitely worth checking out if you're in Ballantyne. Both indoor and outdoor seating available.
