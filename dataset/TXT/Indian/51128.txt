UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ best bang for the buck in the area (even more than Chipotle)!

Hungry? Come for the $9 lunch buffet before 3PM and you will have one of the most authentic and tastiest lunches in the area

-I recommend getting "naan" (indian flatbread), which is brought to the table fresh from the kitchen throughout lunch. 
-Their chicken tandoori is delicious, full of flavor.
-Palak Paneer (cheese cubes bathed in sautéed spinach)
-Their rice pudding!!!!!!! (I seriously sometimes go just to get their rice pudding! It is hidden away near the front with the other condiments)

But if you are there for lunch, you should really try a little bit of everything. I once even had goat meat at this place! Indian Flame is authentic for sure (confirmed by an indian friend of mine)

The reason for 4/5 is because when I ordered tandoori chicken to go one night, it was incredibly dry, no matter how much sauce I put on, it was just nowhere near the quality of their lunchtime chicken (probably cooked way in advance and reheated, causing it to dry out)

Service- There used to be this big overly-proud man who worked there who was a dick and frankly, doesn't belong in the restaurant business. Long story short, he got 2 of our 4 orders completely wrong, stood awkwardly at the table for 2 full min refusing to bring back the right order, made a scene, blamed it on us. That was 2 years ago, and I have not seen him in recent visits. The lady who works the cashier now is SUPER nice, always thanking us for even the smallest things, and so is the skinnier gentleman who is often there.

Overall, I highly recommend this place for lunch. As for dinner, sit-in or take-out you are taking a chance. That rice pudding though...
