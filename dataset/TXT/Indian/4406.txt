1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g This is a fantastic Nepalese/Indian restaurant and this is coming from people who have lived in India and eaten Indian in the UK and throughout the US. Everything was good, but you must get the Chicken Momo and the Masala Tea/Chai. The dumplings are some of the best we've had (and we lived and traveled in China too), and the chai is the wonderfully creamy, sweet chai that you can get at any roadside stand in India and only very rarely in the US. Our entrees were excellent as well - the Chicken Datsi was creamy and delicious and the Nepali Chicken was an excellent sampler of various salads and dishes. Go and enjoy!
