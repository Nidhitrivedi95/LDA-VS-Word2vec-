ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ Simply the best South Indian food in Toronto. The dosas are amazing. The sambar is crazy good. The South Indian and Goan curries are perfect. The Naan is fantasic. And to top it all off the service is top notch. Its definitely not a fancy place, they've put all their energy into making the food and the service very memorable.
