cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA The biggest scam I've bought on Groupon. For a few reasons:
1. The photos on the website are not photos of their own.
2. Service was very poor. I insisted not buying drinks, but the waiter kept pushing me for virgins.
3. Portions are tiny. Plates were unnecessarily big.
4. Wobbly seat backs, dirty utensils and plates, napkins with loose threads.
5. Music was the type you could find in a club.
6. Service was extremely slow. It took 45 minutes to have two main courses ready.
7. Price was unreasonably expensive. $12 for 4 pieces of reheated meat; $24 for a lobster tail with rice.

Very unauthentic, very disappointed.
