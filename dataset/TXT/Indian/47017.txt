t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q Purchased a groupon for this as I was feeling like some Hakka food. Got their chili chicken and shrimp along with a fried rice dish. Quantity was great. Taste was so-so. If you use a groupon, I dont think you'd be disappointed. More than enough food for two. Was pretty empty when we went for a weekend dinner. 2 stars because of the really slow service - waitress taking order needed help from another waitress for almost everything we were ordering.
