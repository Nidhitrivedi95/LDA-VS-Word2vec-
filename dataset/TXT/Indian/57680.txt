yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Hands down, the best Indian food restaurant in the valley.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't beat my Indian friends' cooking.  :)

I love trying different dishes and I'm not afraid to do so because anything you order is flavorful and yummy.  My friends took me out for my birthday, and we all raved about the food.  

My favorites are any of the paneer dishes, chicken tikka masala, and the Indian chai.
