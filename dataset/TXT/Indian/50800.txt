ug_NBv4W_5fZf3hi2h2U_w this place bears a strange name and a strange combination of a sports bar+pub that carries indian food. 

the place inside is massive, has TV screens, bar, pool tables, outdoor patio and an open patio on the 2nd floor. 

on a sunday afternoon the place was empty. 

the food is good - we only ate the indian selection. and the prices are pretty cheap.
naan with curry sauce was delicious.

the server seemed to be bored but the service in general was good.
