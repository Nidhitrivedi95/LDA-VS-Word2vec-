tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I don't know what they put in their food but I am addicted!

It is the BEST indian food that I ever had. The owners and staff are all very friendly and do a great job. 

My fav is the dinner buffet. You have quite a big assortment of food you can choose from. My absolute long time favourite is the Chicken Tiki Masala and the Lamb Vindaloo. They are to die for. Perfect amount of spices! My boyfriend and I come here since they first opened and the quality of food and service has always stayed the same ehen not even got better! They imported a chef from India. So you can be sure that the food is very authentic.
In addition to the buffet they serve delicious garlic naan and chicken on a sizzling plate. Plus the price is unbeatable.

I am in love with this place and can't get enough of it. A hidden gem! They also have a banquet hall for groups of people.
