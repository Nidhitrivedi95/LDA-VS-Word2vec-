LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng My friends surprised me with a birthday dinner her and it was such a pleasant surprise! It's a beautiful restaurant, very well appointed. Service was a bit lacking - our drinks took quite a while to be served. But the food is authentic and flavorful, wonderful family-style options to share all around and enjoy. A great addition to the local restaurant scene.
