P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg If you are a fan of Hakka,the is one of the best place around. When you enter the restaurant you may feel bit congested,but still you can have a happy stay.

When it comes to the food you can expect a genuinely good hakka. Chicken 88 and chilly chicken were amazing.The service was good and fast. And you get surprisingly large quantities for what you pay.
