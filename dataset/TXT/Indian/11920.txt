auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Decided to try this place due to a restaurant.com gift certificate and we are completely glad we did.

We ordered the Tandoori Jhinga (shrimp), chicken tikka masala, one regular naan, one garlic naan, and a mango lassi.

Everything was great! Chicken tikka masala was spiced just right (..I think we could've handled a bit more spiciness) and shrimp tandoori was yummy. Garlic naan was a bit overcooked so we ordered a regular naan, which was just right. 

The restaurant itself is in a great location, spacious, with nice ambience. 

Overall, I'm glad there's an Indian restaurant in the Silverado area definitely worth a repeat visit :)
