-qdbWrCU8Ktg80dk458BAw Ok so chaat is from North India. Specifically Delhi. Any chat in Delhi is awesome. 

This is the closest I've had in Canada. Is it as good as Delhi chaat, definitely not, it can't be never will. 

Is it the best chat I've had in Canada, definitely. 

We ordered paani Puri, papri chaat, tikki chhole, amritsari kulcha, Rose soda, and nimbu pani. Everything was tantalising and mouth watering. It's spicy but ooh soooooo good. 

Highly recommended the kulcha.
