KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw i had always knew Rick was an amazing chef, from trying the butter chicken Lasagna to seeing his creative styles on instagram this restaurant was a definite MUST on my list.

My friends and i decided to come here for our annual christmas dinner and my socks were blown off my feet! 

i love the ambience of the place, its not your typical joint and it's got an awesome downtown feel to it.

we went late friday night and it was super busy, but understandable why it was.

i got the jerk chicken samosa chat and it was soooo good. i traded a samosa with my friend so i got to try the butter chicken one as well, and i have to say that is definitely my fav! 

i also stole food from my friends, the tandoori bacon, the loaded fries and the BOLT was on my list of items to try again! 

my tastebuds loved this place and needless to say, i will be back!
