ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ It was the first time my husband tried South Indian food and he fell in love with it. 
Even my mom was eating, she does not have a big apetite but love the food.
I had a chilly cheese dosa woooowwwww amazing convination, we had chicken biryani and pani puri.
We were so happy we tried this restaurant.
I gave four stars because the place was very dirty, and dusty.
But the food was mind blowing.
Definately coming back for take out!
