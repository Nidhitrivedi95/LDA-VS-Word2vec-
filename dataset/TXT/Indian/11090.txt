A9UQhHtG9Xh3nkhe3UvXzQ Came here with a bunch of friends. There's nothing wow about this place. The food is pretty average. Nothing special at all. I'd rather spend 3 bucks and take a bus  to Park & Jean Talon and get some tasty & not too pricey Indian food. 

Food : Meh
Service :Meh
Ambiance : Meh
Worth the price : Neh
