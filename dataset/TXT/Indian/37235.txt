o3dA9fcwg84luw9yamk7wQ Came here lunch had the vegan cauliflower and potato roti - the selection of vegan titis is wicked! The spicy level is accurate - I love hot and spicy but the waiter warned me to to try the medium /level 3 - it was perfect for me but would be too spicy for most.

I loved the portion size - I feel like I could have shared this with someone but I had lunch and super with a 10$ Roti 

Delilah and affordable with amazing vegan choices
