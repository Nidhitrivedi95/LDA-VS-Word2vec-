OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA I can't believe I've gone this long without writing a review. This is LONG OVERDUE. 
I went to high school down the street and I associate so many memories with this place from the past 4 years. This restaurant has been the place to go for comfort food and comfort from friends but also a cheap eats place when no one wants to travel too far or spend too much. The surroundings and the decor are sub-par but the mirrors in there will never cease to trip me out! 
I know everyone raves about the chili chicken but I truly do not enjoy the dish and prefer the sweet-and-sour over it by a long shot. The last time I was here (which was last week, I kid you not) , it seemed like the portions got bigger. I always order some sort of Manchurian dish because I feel the Lin Garden experience isn't complete with a dish full of fluorescent red on the table. They have quite a few vegetarian dishes so herbivores and carnivores can rest knowing there is something for everyone. 
I'm a total fan of spicy food but not the large amounts of MSG, salt or oil I'm sure all the dishes contain and in vast quantities no doubt. I'll be back for sure, but I'm probably going to have to starve myself all day for a meal here!
