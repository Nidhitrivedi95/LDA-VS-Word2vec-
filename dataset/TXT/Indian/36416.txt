NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Wonderful place to eat. Really quick service and great food. Very vegetarian friendly place. The biggest downside is the menu is too small but that is also the advantage, you don't have to think so hard on what you want to eat. They don't have order over the fone or online ordering yet.
