_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg Good variety, and very high quality food. I come by for the all-you-can-eat buffet just about every weekend and I am in love with the Chicken Tikki Masala. Good selection of imported ingredients from India in the store next to the restaurant shows that these people know their stuff!
