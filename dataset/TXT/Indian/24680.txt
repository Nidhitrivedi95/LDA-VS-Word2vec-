h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw It's good service and decent food. Have had dinner there a couple of times and it's pretty good value for money. Had a la carte once and dinner buffet once when there was a "so hungry cannot wait" group of 8 of us. While it was good and solid value for money, don't think I'll be going for buffet again. If you do go, check out their crackers mixed with pickled onion and green chutney. Add some red sauce on top of that - heavenly! 

Good service too - the waitstaff is courteous and pleasant. My SO wasn't happy that I left 25+% tip, for a buffet! Lesson learned for me. Sorry, Prince! But I think you can afford it ;-)
