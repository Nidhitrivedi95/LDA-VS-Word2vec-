HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A Came here on a weekday for dinner with some co-workers. The place is definitely tricky to find if you didn't know it was under an office building.

We ordered some samosas and 3 main dishes - aloo gobhi, chicken tikka masala and mixed vegetables with a few naans (there were 3 of us so 1 entree dish per person is a good amount of food). Overall the food wasn't impressive and wasn't worth the money.

The good: the samosas were very good and came with a couple of chutneys. It was cooked really well and was pretty soft.

The bad: the main dishes were all below average and the vegetables seemed undercooked for the most part. The potatoes and cauliflower in the aloo gobhi were still somewhat hard - a pretty easy fix if they had actually cooked it long enough. The chicken was kind of dry and tough. 

Overall the food wasn't terrible but definitely not worth the price. I would probably not go back, and recommend Choolaah to my friends as an alternative, even though its fast food.
