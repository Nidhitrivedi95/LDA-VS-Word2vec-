LUhVj-r2TtmFx6cyF9ilJg I have been eyeing this restaurant up for ages and finally got the chance to go last night and it was amazing!

Such a good selection of small Indian tapas plates ranging from £3.80-£4.90 and everything we had was delicious. They suggested between 3-4 plates per person but myself and my friend had 6 between us and we were stuffed! We shared the butter chicken (so tasty), the fishcakes, somosas, kebab buns (like little burgers), Garlic chicken and Aubergine and potato and everything just tasted wonderful, such good quality and tasty food.

The restaurant is BYOB as well, on wine and beer, so is great for a bigger group as will keep the costs for dinner down. They also cater for larger groups, when we were in there was a large group of 20 and there was plenty of room. The restaurant is large too and really well spaced out - the decor is quirky with large wooden tables and wire lampshades so it does remind you of grabbing a quick bite in an Indian train station, which I loved. They also have Bollywood posters on the walls and Indian music playing, making the whole experience that bit more inclusive - you could forget for a minute that you were at the top of Tollcross!

The staff were also really friendly too. 

This is definitely a new favourite of mine and I have been raving about it to everyone since last night. Tasty food, great choice and lovely surroundings go!
