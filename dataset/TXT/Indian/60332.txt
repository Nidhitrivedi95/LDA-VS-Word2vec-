ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Ordered the Tikka Masala (spicy) and Gulab Jamun. The Tikka was actually good and tasty, however it was not spicy at all even though I requested that. The Gulab was on point. The Naan was a bit dark and burnt though..

Overall I would order here again. Good food, good prices.
