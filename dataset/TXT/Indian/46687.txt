t3pKESVSZ34J36XQIsiZ7g I like this place - a lot. My boyfriend and I frequently get takeout from Gateways and the food is always delicious...the Egglplant Bharta particularly.
That being said, the reviewer who mentioned the cockroaches? Well, the dingy atmosphere is what inspired us to start getting takeout. A fresh coat of paint on the walls, a steam cleaner to the carpet and a makeover of the bathrooms would add a star and a half to this review.
Still, dinner is excellent...I wish I could comment on the lunch buffet but I've never been around to try it.
