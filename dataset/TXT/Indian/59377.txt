z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA The food here is amazing! And now I'm obsessed!
And they take Casecash!!!

Like the comparisons to chipotle, this place may not be the most authentic place to get Indian food. But the food definitely is tasty and the workers here are so dang nice.

When my friend and I walked in, the worker made fresh new white rice for us. They thoroughly explained all my questions and was not annoyed.

This place definitely replaces chipotle in my book. The food and workers are way better.
10/10 I recommend.
