C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Umm...how do I put this? 

This place is kinda cute, but the food is nothing special unfortunately. Their menu is amazing, the way they market their dishes on the menu, however when you get the dish, it's just okay. 
If you are just going for drinks, then maybe you will like it more, however as a restaurant its more of a 3 star place. 

Due to its romantic ambiance we will probably be back for some tea and dessert in the summer, however I won't be eating food here most likely. 

The service was very good and like I said the place has a cool vibe about it, do its a great option for a date:)
