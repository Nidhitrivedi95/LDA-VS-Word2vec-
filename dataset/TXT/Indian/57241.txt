So why only 3 stars?

Not a great deal of selection. Although they have vegetarian selections, they don't have any vegetable dishes - everything vegetarian is heavy and sauced and stuffed in rotis. Essentially, this is a great roti takeout shop, pretending to be a real restaurant. Don't get me wrong - the rotis are huge and delicious (Too huge, actually - they'll feed two easily). But that's as good as it gets - the rice dishes are huge, and heavy, and need some side dishes for variety. And there aren't any. 

I read the reviews here and thought I'd found a great indian place on the edge of the neighborhood. Instead, I found a less-than-a-real-indian-restaurant, with great take-out rotis.

I'm happy to know Mother India is here. I'll be grabbing a roti from time-to-time, but I'm never going in past the front counter again.
