ai9r_wv56TPzwtrfUEPXTw Always disappointed by the following:
* Samosa never freshly cooked
* Butter chicken = 80% sauce,10% meat,10% potato.

There is more chicken on a 1/4 chicken breast from
Metro than in this butter chicken dish.

This is the first place I've eaten at that adds
potato to butter chicken on rice...the pieces of
potato are cut to the same size as the small
pieces of chicken...deceptive with their
advertising suggesting reasonable amount
of chicken for a single serving meal. 

Why bother opening if no desire to do it right.
