DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA It's the worst food I could have eaten. They charge you a lot which is fine If the food is worth it. Honestly this is the most shitty food I have eaten. Even if they pay me next time I won't eat here.
Someone explain them what service is. I went with 4 elders and 2 kids.... luckily the kids had McDonald. When asked for seating we told six however while the server was serving we told that only 4 will have dinner. He wasn't happy hearing that and before serving was more interested in knowing if we are six or not. It was a very unwelcoming attitude. Finally, when I showed my displeasure and didn't pay the tip the person was arguing that I have to pay him and was telling me about some bullshit tax rules which i haven't heard in my entire life. Guys who are from India their service is worse than even the roadside food outlets back home.
If you want to eat and not stay hungry never go to this place. Have you ever eaten sweet chicken biryani with green peas and kala channa(black gram) at least I haven't. If you are hungry go to origin India(another store) same price they are heavenly and much more well behaved staff than these people who don't know what is service. I was thinking I should have eaten mc Donald with the kids instead of coming here.I again went for snacks at midnight I was hungry. And finally since I can't give negative rating and 1 is min with a low heart I have to give them one.
