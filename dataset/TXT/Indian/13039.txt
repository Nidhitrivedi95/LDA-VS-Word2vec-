b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw Words fail to describe the food served here! Service was fast and food delicious. The chef Guna Saravanan, even came met us, was extremely kind and asked us how the food was. Mark was so patient with our requests and helped us make the right order. 
The ambience friendly and exquisite. 
A Thursday afternoon lunch felt like a Sunday brunch, and only a handful of places can give that feel! 
Must go :)
