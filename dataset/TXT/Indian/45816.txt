SGapZBbSgSYY3fziaskULQ Was in the mood for something different today so I decided to give the India Palace a try.  I can't believe I've been passing this place by for so long. 

I got a seat at a booth then went straight to the buffet. What an array of choices available. I decided to try a little of everything. Although the tandoori chicken was a tad bit dry (and I'm nit-picking here), I can honestly say that there was nothing that I didn't like.  It was a festival of flavors. 

In addition to the deliciousness of the food, the place is spacious, comfortable and clean and the people are courteous and friendly. I've got nothing bad to say about this place. 

If you're downtown and getting tired of the burgers, pizza, sandwiches and such, give the India Palace a try.  If you like flavors, you'll luv this place.
