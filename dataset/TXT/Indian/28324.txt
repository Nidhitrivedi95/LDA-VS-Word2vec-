J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I always order the same dish at Indian restaurants - shahi paneer !  It's usually very flavourless and full of Indian spices. I also order garlic naan and rice on the side. 

This was my first time trying Little India downtown. I ordered for take out, and was told it would take 20 minutes. 25-30 minutes later, my food is finally ready and I head home. 

To say the least, the food was disappointing. I was expecting lots of flavour, but the small portion of shahi paneer was quite bland and boring. 

I've ordered this dish at multiple other Indian restaurants, for half the price and double the portions. Nothing makes me want to try any other dishes, so I'll never be back.
