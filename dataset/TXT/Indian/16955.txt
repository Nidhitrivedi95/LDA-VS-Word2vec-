DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew This is the best Indian food in Vegas. No frills location. Staff is responsive, welcoming and warm.  Personal favorites are calliflower appetizer,chicken madras and naan.  Everything we've tried is excellent. Trust your server on spice level. Different chefs on different nights makes a big difference. No frills but fab !
