fVbZptKCH2lIRS56M1zc6g Tried the lunch buffet and it was great and cheap - $9.99.  It says $11.00 on the takeout menu, so I'm not sure if they reduced their price to compete with Tandoori Flame.  This is a very competitive area for Indian Fusion food with both Avani and Tandoori Flame around the corner.  Guru's is very similar to Bukhara on Burhamthorpe as it's a mix of Indian and Hakka Chinese.  Had this been my first visit, I would have given it 5 stars, but I have to consider my last review (mediocre at best) as well in the star rating.  

Pros: Amazing butter chicken, goat curry is fall off the bone, tandoori chicken isn't too spicy and not burnt, fresh fruits and some Hakka food as well (chow mein, fried rice, , spring rolls and pakora). Also, good selection of stir fry veggies and potatoes.

Cons: Nothing really, except they only have 15-20 selection of hot food for their buffet, but it's better than too many choices with poor quality.  Also, they constantly fill up your water to make you full (not really a con) lol.  

Average things: Naan.  It's okay, but nothing special.

Final verdict: Try out their buffet during the weekdays.  Cheap and good.

Edited: I put pakora's twice lol
