RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Went here on  Saturday night and it was packed!!  I felt the quality of the food lacked.  The chicken was more "tough" and the naan was burnt.

Also, the service was sporadic...we were either being bombarded or the girl was ghost or the one girl that was very available didn't speak english so she would have to go find someone to interpret what I was asking so that didn't help in terms of service. 

The most disappointing aspect of dining here on the weekend is that they don't serve that little appetizer that most indian restaurants serve for free before the meal.  I have NO idea what the technical name is but it is like a thin cracker served with mango and mint chutney for dipping.  I was told that they don't offer that on weekends.  BOOO.

My tip---go to Blue Taj during the week.  I have been a huge fan of theirs but I was pretty disappointed by my first weekend visit.
