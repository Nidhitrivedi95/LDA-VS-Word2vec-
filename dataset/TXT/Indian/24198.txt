I tried the Chana Masala w/ the Roti - and it was great!  I ordered it in Medium and kind of wish I'd gone for the "Medium - hot" option.  It wasn't quite spicy enough.  I could have used more kick, but other establishments have made me scared to even mention the word "hot." 

The wait staff is still figuring things out, but they are extremely friendly!  There were frequent visits to the table, but hey - i don't mind.  That means we didn't go thirsty!  As for our drinks, they suggested we try the Indian Spiced Iced Tea.  It was amazing!  I'm craving more of it right now.  It is very flavorful and a great summer treat. 

The price for the portions is great.  Dinner prices has most dinner prices at $9 - $13.
