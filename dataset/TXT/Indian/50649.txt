UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg We tried the malai kofta and beef madras. Both were pretty good. I found the malai kofta a bit tangier than I normally like (I prefer creamy and a bit sweet). However, I will definitely order from here again until I find my favourite dish on the menu. We ordered pick up but there were lots of servers attending to the sit-in guests, which I took as a good sign of a well-run restaurant.
