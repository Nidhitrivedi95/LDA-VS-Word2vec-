I was visiting Montreal and one of my friend recommended us to try this place and I am so glad we did. It was the best Indian food I have had so far in North America. 

Ambiance: We arrived at the restaurant for dinner from all day driving from Quebec and the server was so kind to seat us up right away. We felt little out of place since everybody was dressed up. The restaurant setting was romantic and welcoming. 

Food & Service: Our server was very polite and responsive and answered all the question we had. We ordered Veg Thali with out choice of bhindi, Chicken Tikka masala, Garlic Naan and taj beer. Our pakories from thali were served as appetizer which were cripy and delicious. Next served were thali and chicken tikka and Naan. Every ingredient in Thali was delicious and fragnant and had balanced spices inclucing bhindi masala and chicken tikka was spicy and tender from inside. Next served was my tea and Gulab jamun. I asked the server to make tea with ginger and he obliged very happily.  The gulab jamun were very soft and perfectly sweet with the hint of saffron. 

Overall, I had Food-gasm while dinning at Le taj and I will definitely go there again on my Next visit to Montreal!
