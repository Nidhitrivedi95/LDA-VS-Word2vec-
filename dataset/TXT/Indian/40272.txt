PlJ5Tf9T4QlFQoNZf99aTg first time here.
read all the great reviews. I thought I would try it. 
terrible. 
I ordered the chicken with curry sauce.
the chicken pieces were fried before it was stir fried in the curry sauce. who does that?what the fuck.
I have never had a curry chicken dish where they fry the pieces first. it made me suspicious. maybe they were trying to hide something. 
the curry sauce was watery. it had a faint taste of curry.
I went up to pay for my bill. the male server saids it comes to 12.12. I said shouldn't it be 10 dollars plus tax. he gives me the bill. it reads 11.02.
he was trying to pull a fast one on me. he was the same oriental guy who served me.
maybe it was just the one dish I ordered. still I would not come back. shadeeeeee.
my water was never filled. the glass table tops were greasy.
