UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ It's a disgrace to Indian food. No Parking facility. Room is not warm inside. Ask for a glass of warm water and you get cold water no matter how many times you tell. Gravy is same for all curry, which is ground peanut/ badam and all colored red too. No option to give -ve Star.
           I called before going to dinner for the Parking options as I was concerned about the parking place and the guy told that they have space behind the building. Actually only 5-6 cars fit there and which is not there parking spot. Though parking was full, there was not a single customer inside. It took me few rounds and finally ended  up parking on Metered lot on the other side of the road. 
         I asked the server to suggest me his best dish so as to make me visit again. As per his suggestion I took Chicken Kurma and Malai kofta. I never  had  such a bad tasting both dishes. And you cant make a difference among both curries except that one had chicken and other had Veg kofta dipped in same gravy. Forget about Malai in Malai Kofta. 
          Finally, i got a bad stomach and gad and my room wad stinking at night. 

WILL NEVER EVER GO THERE AGAIN.
