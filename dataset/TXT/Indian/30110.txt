JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Food is very, very good.  The best Indian good in the area.  This restaurant just needs to work on the little details to be perfect.  Don't bang the silverware around while you put it away, teach the waiter how to pour ice water from a pitcher so that some ice goes in the glass.  

Still, overall a great restaurant and not to be missed.
