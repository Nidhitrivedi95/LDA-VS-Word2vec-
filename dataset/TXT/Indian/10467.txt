9sS0LaJVnv_HR_klZq4Dlg Truly 3.5 stars.  Great flavour, fresh food and love the dessert.  This plaza is packed with so much variety forcing everyone to compete not only in price but offering us/ spoiling us with some very nice food selections.  
There is a few tables but really catered for office lunch and not a family meal.  There is a washroom (albeit) unmarked.  The order counter is quick and efficient in taking your order and preparing it in record time.  Nice place for a quick (little messy) bite... be prepared to use your hands and tuck in as the only silverware is a spoon to use.
