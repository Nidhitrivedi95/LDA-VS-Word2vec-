CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA My wife and I found this gem after visiting her parents in the area. We had been to the same location years before and were not impressed. But these are new owners, and there is fresh décor (not overstated but clean). Music was at an appropriate level. The servers were very friendly. Food was delicious. For several dishes, you can select cheese of your favorite protein (e.g.,  lamb). I had British Tikka Masala with paneer cheese. Neither of us had digestion issues.
