eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg Good food, good service, decent prices.  Do you need more?  They have a lunch buffet which ends up being about $13.00 per person after tax and tip, and it has very decent variety.  I tried everything--don't judge me-I suffered afterward, but it was worth it.
The tandoori chicken, the onion pahkor, and the mango pudding were serious winners.
YUM!
