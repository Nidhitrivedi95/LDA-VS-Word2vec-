llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g This place is open pretty late. Tucked in the corner of the center, India palace is a good place to go to for Indian food. I ordered the chicken tikka masala plate with a side of rice. The rice is well cooked and the spice in it is very fresh. The chicken tikka masala is different from the usual ones I've had. It's sweeter and the part of the chicken is different than the chunks you get elsewhere. It's very soft and retains the taste of the chicken well. 

The sweetness is kind of odd but it is interesting. I don't have a big sweet tooth so I would prefer it to have had a stronger spice taste instead. That being said, the sweetness did complement the sauce well. 

Pros: 
- They give you a lot of rice. 
- You can choose how spicy the dishes are. I love that. 
- It has a really good Indian feel to it. It doesn't feel fake or a front. 

Cons:
- The fans!!!! Holy Molly.  The ceiling fans spin around under the lights. So you have a shadow of the moving fan moving in a strobe like effect. Gave me a headache. 
- Not really a con but could be annoying to some: the TV was quite loud and distracting with Indian music videos. I don't mind myself. I feels like it gives it a homey vibe. 

Bottom line:
Good food and wonderful service. They came up to my table just enough time to show me that they were attentive without feel like I was being smothered. Honestly it would be a five star if it weren't for the strobe light effect. It's not just good you have to take into account but the surroundings as well!
