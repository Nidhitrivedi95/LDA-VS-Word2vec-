oRRcTN6bgID4Z0UMeGXN0Q Worst Indian food ever eaten in Montreal! Poorest service ever..an attitude which is definitely not indian..Indians treat their guests very well..asha is not a good example..will never ever go back again..ill probably make some biriyani myself and serve it to them to show how it should really taste!
