Man : Heart
Pasand : Like or Desire

So manpasand basically means what your heart desires. 

And it explains this little hole in the wall perfectly.

I had to go back again today (after discovering it yesterday) and I tried the take out buffett special (7.49  + free pop)

The guy behind the counter said i could get 5 items for the buffett.

I chose:

1. The chicken biryani - huge portion! filled up half my container with it. Fragrant rice spiced perfectly with different coloured strands of rice :) with two huge pieces of chicken. DELICIOUS.

2. The mutter paneer (you need veggies right?) - I chose this to show my co-worker what Paneer was. It was really good. Your standard peas and paneer (indian cottage cheese) curry. 

3. The tandoori chicken - Really really good barbequed chicken! No explanation needed.

4. The chicken tikka - Chunks of chicken breast barbequed with various veggies (onions, peppers and tomatoes). This was really good. Not spicy. But still good.

5. The Fish Pakora - This was a wild card. I'm really squeamish about Fish. I can only really eat it when I'm out for sushi or something. I know, it's weird. Im okay with other seafood (shrimp, lobster, mussels, etc) but just fish is weird to me. I tried this out anyways. ITS EFFING GREAT! OMG. It's deep fried fish in a spicy red batter. Take your avg fish and chips, and kick it up 32423525 notches. I'm hooked.


and it came with free fresh!!!!! naan.

I'm in LOVE with this restaurant.

ps, the kids were there again today. SUPER CUTE.

LOVE

THIS

PLACE.
