JA-O7eaQ_Mkuzu4ctzEzfg Good selection of Indian food. We arrived early for dinner at 4:40 pm, the restaurant only opens for dinner @ 5:00.  Place was empty for the start of dinner with the exception of one other couple.  Food was excellent and portions seemed larger than what I'm used to.  Butter chicken was a little more tomato-y than I'm typically used to,  but was still awesome with the basmati rice and garlic naan.  

Also remember to try cheetah DARK lager with your meal.  Would definitely recommend the restaurant for the quality of the food... give it a try.
