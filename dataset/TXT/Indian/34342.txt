MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ The food here is decent, and has been the best of the various Indian and Pakistani restaurants within a 15 mile radius. You cannot compare it to Chicago or Houston South Asian restaurants, but will satisfy your cravings especially if your palette is Delhi or Lahore cooking. My biggest complaint and the reason for not giving 4 stars is the price - definitely more expensive than the other restaurants in the area, and overpriced in general.
