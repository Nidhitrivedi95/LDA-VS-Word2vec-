TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw No freebies or know the owner. We were on vacation and was looking for a decent Indian food so yelped and saw good reviews for this place. Also they had specials of free mango lassi. So we decided to try it out.

Was a good decision. Went there and placed a order, when the server came to take our order I told him that I had checked in on yelp for free mango lassi. The server was unaware of it ( seems like he had just joined) so he went to the manager to ask. The manger was extremely nice so he he came to us personally and told that we will get free lassi and that he was sorry that the server was unaware of it.
 
The only thing they could change is maybe increase the potion sizes a little bit, other wise the food tasted very good.

Also the ambience was nice to............overall good place
