FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg Our family has ordered and enjoyed the food from this location and is usually our go-to when we want to order good quality Indian cuisine. We normally check our order after picking it up at any restaurant to ensure we have everything, or ask the employees if they can check and go through our order for us before we leave. 

Tonight our family wanted to celebrate a special occasion together with some of our favourite dishes from this location. After confirming on the phone that we preferred to receive our rice in a separate container from the rest of our food (about 6 orders of rice), and after a seemingly thorough review of our order by the host at the restaurant, our rice was not in the bag with the rest of the food we received.  

We called to complain because the drive is not a short one to go back to fix a mistake made by the restaurant. After explaining the situation the host offered to send our food in a cab, but instead went out of his way to deliver the food personally. This was an example of great customer service to correct the original mistake that was made. 

We will order from here again in the future and were impressed by the effort made to right the wrong that had occurred.
