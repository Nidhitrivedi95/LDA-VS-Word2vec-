ScNo2XA1ZhsXjYiPVo-7oA I have been ordering from here for a while now and I am liking it more and more with every meal. Consistently good and tastes freshly made every time. I have only eaten inside it once and fair enough to those who have criticized the shabby decor. Who cares though when the food is great!  For pickup they are always quick to make it and I've never had to wait. Highlights have been the chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo and the garlic naan is always on point.  It is my go to Indian place in the west end.
