3frFidAcPVYAFB2RxxkIdA Star of India is my bf's favorite place to go for a good inexpensive lunch buffet near CMU.

They usually have a selection of about 4 stews/curries, tandoori chicken, pakoras, plain naan, palau rice, salad, and sweet rice. They also have some pretty decent mango juice. 

The place is pretty spacious, and even if the restaurant is full, I feel like I can breathe. The service is friendly, my water glass is always full, and they're not above asking whether you're done with your plate if they're not sure, before they take it away. (I somehow find it upsetting, in other restaurants, when I have to take a restroom break, to find my half-full plate gone when I get back).
