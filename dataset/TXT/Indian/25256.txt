hFay_o8K1YfqFiMFoSPv5Q I went on a Saturday afternoon hoping for a variety of vegetarian dishes in the buffet, but was disappointed. So had to turn to the a la carte.

Ordered the malai kofta and a mango lassi, both of which were a delight to the palate... a subtle taste and good consistency. The only reason this falls short is because the price does not do justice to the quantity. Having spent as much, I was expecting a bit more.

Also, adding some Indian music and decor will surely add some heat to this grill!
