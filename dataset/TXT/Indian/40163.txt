PiT0jyLL2Jwm2ODTDapOcg Deli-style Indian food place where you can choose the curry and rice usually comes with your order (unless you ask for naan). The prices are very reasonable ranging from £3 to 6 per meal and the food is quite authentic. Highly recommended if you're not in the mood for a normal restaurant.
