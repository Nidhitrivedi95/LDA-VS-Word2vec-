cF0PKI4NzTpojcQvQRNRLw The food here is worth a three . It's very good and big portions. This is More a comment on service. Took about a half hour to be seated, which is fine but it took another half hour for anyone to talk to us about drinks and food. Ok.  Icing on the cake was it literally took an hour for food to come out when we ordered a relatively simple dish. It was good food, however I would not be willing to travel to sauga again for it. Also, they add a service charge of five percent when there was hardly any service or contact. There was constantly a burning feeling in my eyes because of the smoke in the air. They need better ventilation for sure.
