Hq86WlkF7bdQlaGe_p5fHA Backstory - One night my SO had a pleasant drunken conversation with the friendly bartender here. Since then, he almost always ends his drunken nights here. He said he's always wanted to visit this place sober.

Place is clean and spacious and I love the British decor. At night the music is usually old school hip hop and during the day its the Beatles.

If you're not a bud light on tap kind of person, youll probably enjoy their selection of British drinks. 

As for brunch, well it was great. Really, I wasn't expecting much since I only ever come here to drink, but I really enjoyed my food, even more than some other highly rate brunches on here.

SO got the herbivore with poached eggs on a portobello mushroom and biscuit, I got the house special. Loved every part, from the salad to fries. Potatoes were perfect - flavourful but not salty, crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. Overall every part was cooked well and appetizing.

Will definitely make this place a usual.
