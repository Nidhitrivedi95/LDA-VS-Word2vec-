o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw The food is good here, but the combination of price, quantity of food and location didn't match up very well. I ordered the Chicken Biryani which was quite good. The chicken was moist and very well flavored. The butter chicken that my friend ordered was also very good , but at $12 a plate, I think it should either come with rice/naan or there should be more chicken.  I would  come back if the prices were more tad more reasonable.
