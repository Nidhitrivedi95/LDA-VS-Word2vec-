-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Let's just say the best thing I ate when I went here was the free crispy flat bread or whatever it was they serve you before you get your food. I love Indian food and this place is entirely overrated. The only reason why I came here was because of the Yelp rating being so high. I got the goat curry and garlic naan. My friend got the chicken tikka masala, after one bite of her dish, it was undesired for seconds.

My goat curry wasn't served warm enough and was not tender at all. The flavor was bland and not appealing. My garlic naan was burnt and did not taste good at all. The service was below mediocre, I had to ask for water before getting a refill. We were checked up on once the entire duration while we dined there. I don't ever plan on going back. Save your time and money! They even charge you for rice even when their entrees are priced $13.99 for the chicken tikka masala & $14.99 for the goat curry. I wasted $20+ for a sour stomach and bad taste in my mouth. Let's be real here, if you think this place deserves the 4 stars it has on Yelp, you've probably never had good Indian food before. In summation, bad service + bad tasting food = 1 star.
