oKDzHRuV3bYNE3LUAXuv5w Tikka Mahal is fairly recent on the takeaway scene in Edinburgh and it has made a pretty big impression on me. 

Situated in the Newington area of Edinburgh, Tikka Mahal is just a short walk from the city centre and it is very close to the University so it is a convenient place for students to go to for dinner. 

Despite being called Tikka Mahal, giving the impression that it is a curry house, they also do kebabs, burgers, pizzas and fish and chips - so a bit of everything. I came in with a friend who ordered a chicken korma curry with rice which he said was really tasty and the rice was well cooked. I had a burger and chips which also tasted really good and the portions were a decent size. Our meals came to about five pounds each which was a really good deal. 

There is quite a substantial dining area inside the shop, and Tikka Mahal also does takeaways as well as home deliveries which is incredibly convenient.  I haven't been back since but I had a good experience here I definitely plan to go back.
