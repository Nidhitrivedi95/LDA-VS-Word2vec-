I3YOFwPRQB_bSY3NDUyJNw I am writing this review after purchasing chaat items from their stall in the Bollywood Monster Mashup event in Celebration square on 7th August 2015..laughable small portions of aloo masala were served in one plate of pani puri (they were clearly trying to avoid refilling their stocks which is shameful..one should not open a stall for such a crowded event if one is not willing to come prepared to handle the rush!) and mediocre masala pani or flavoured water (there was no tamarind or hint of sweet to counterbalance the pungency of the flavored water)..highly disappointing.
