G0B4WeOehT6wGk1JvvPDHA Great Indian food! One of the best in Montreal.  Great selection of sweets.   What makes it unique is that the entire menu is vegetarian. We were 6 sharing a variety of dishes to go. A few found the spice level too much, but if you're not too sensitive to spice then it's perfect. It has become my go-to Indian take out place.
