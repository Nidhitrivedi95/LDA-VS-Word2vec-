WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA Ive had lots of indian food in my life, and although not an expert, I must say that I did not enjoy The Host.
We tried the chicken tikka masala, lamb roganjosh, tandoori chicken, and saag paneer. The chicken dishes were both EXTREMELY dry, and the tandoori chicken was left partially untouched for this reason. The lamb roganjosh seemed to have the spice ratio all confused, as all we tasted was something similar to coriander. The paneer was the best dish of the night. 
The rice and naan was pretty average. 
Overall, we did not really enjoy the meal and the prices were very high for mediocre dishes with very few pieces of meat.
