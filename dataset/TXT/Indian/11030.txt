A7IQT6RYVSWkvEAbiLCdtQ I went here for the first time yesterday and was pretty impressed. The atmosphere inside is very comfortable, and the selection of food for the buffet was also great! I did not expect it to be as big as it was but was pleasantly surprised. In terms of the taste of the food,  I enjoyed a lot of what I ate. The cakes were hard to bite into, so I'm guessing they were super stale but the gulab jamuns and ras malai were on point. I paid about 15 for dinner with tax so it wasn't a bad deal at all! This place gets pretty busy around 7 or 8 .. so we were glad we went a little earlier.
