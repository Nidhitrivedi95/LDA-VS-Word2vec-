P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag I came here for the Sunday night buffet and was very satisfied with the selection and quality for the price. There were a handful of dishes for vegetarians, omnivores, and carnivores. It would be awfully exhaustive to mention everything I tried, so I'm going to say that I was pleased with the food across the board and mention a few of my favorites.

I liked the vegetable pancakes. I spread the coconut chutney, the mango chutney, the mint sauce, and the harissa on pancakes. All of 'condiments' were good too. My favorite entree was the paneer with peas (I think it was called mattar paneer but I am not completely sure). Before leaving, make sure to pick up some masala chai. It has a well balanced taste.

The service was very attentive and accommodating. Our plates were quickly collected and our glasses were rarely empty.

All in all, I was very satisfied with my dinner here.
