J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ After trying 3 Indian lunch AYCE buffets in one week I givet his one runner-up to only Trimurtri.  I know people like this place the best on Indian-buffet row- but really, it doesn't compare- I won't go into it too much but you can read my review of the gold medal winner here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/trimurti-indian-cuisine-toronto#hrid:tcuV_zkmDVb5lpdU8x-0Ew

So the good things about this place?

-the naan is fresh and tasty
-the fruit bar is massive.  and delicious.  and the salad bar is big. and delicious.
-the options are amazing.  so if you are new to indian food its cool to try a little bit of everything.
-the rice options are nicer than the other places on teh strip.
- service is obviously excellent

cons: 
-the chicken @ the buffet is dry and uneventful
-the dishes are boviously fromt he night before- they taste a bit like the night before.  
-the crispy tortilla things are a bit spongey and less than tasty

*NOTE that if you go for dinner NONE of the cons are true because everything is fresh and so so delicious

Other than that, i'm a fan, but if I go for all-you-can-eat lunch, for the crazy cheap deal- I'll choose Trimirti
