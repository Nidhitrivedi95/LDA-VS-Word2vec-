oKDzHRuV3bYNE3LUAXuv5w I absolutely LOVE Tikka Mahal. It is the only place for Indian / Pakistani food in Edinburgh. They are very gracious when you walk in, and all food is prepared fresh to order. The quality of the chicken is fantastic, and you never get weird chewy parts like I often find at other cheap establishments. Both the chicken karahi and the chicken rogan josh are divine. They roll our the naan bread fresh right there for you. I'm a HUGE fan!
