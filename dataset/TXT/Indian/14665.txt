CB99Ifh4OnBTnuNdRjj_fQ Reviewers were correct in saying this is a no frills interior. A little worried that the wait for food would be long but our soup arrived shortly after ordering. Was also worried about the consistent ding from a microwave nearby. Salad came next and the dressing was tasty. Curried goat was delicious. Prices were a bit high but overall a great experience.
