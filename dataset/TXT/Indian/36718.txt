I had a paneer sandwich--which is Indian cheese, vegetables and sauce rolled up in naan. I agree with the Yelper who said this place is like an Indian version of Piada. The prices are steep for what you get, in my opinion. The size of my sandwich was normal--it wasn't like I was "stuffed" after eating it. The mango lassi was expensive -- $3.45 or $3.95, and was just okay. It was missing a key ingredient: rosewater--an essential component in a quality lassi. Anyhow--I think my bill was just below $12 for dine-in. 

The people were kind and friendly though, and I thought it was cool that you could see the naan being cooked through the glass wall. Food is expensive these days, unfortunately. Maybe with a few tweaks, this place will improve over time.
