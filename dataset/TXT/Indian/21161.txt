GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I started going here about 5 months ago when a friend who lives right near it said it was pretty good.  I do not eat nonkosher meat or poultry, so I was delighted when I saw they have a good amount of fish options with Talapia.  My favorite by far is the fish biryani (fish cooked with rice and a ton of herbs and seasonigns) served with a side of yogurt.  It is absolutely phenomenal and cheap considering the portion size.  I think it costs like 8 dollars.  The amount of seasonings and herbs is what really makes the dish taste so good.  

I have also tried the fish curries.  They are pretty good, but I much prefer the Biryani.  My GF usually orders a curry,either fish or vegetable, and she also loves it.  We also order the samosas on occasion, which have a great flavor.  The Naan is also delicious, but I have never really had "bad" naan at an indian/paki restuarant, so i do not think that having great naan is a special benefit - rather, if you dont have great naan, i wont be going to the restaurant!

The service is usually slow, but getting better as the restaurant becomes more professional.  I hope they dont lose the home style cooking or low prices as a result of becoming more of a "real" restaurant.  

Also, Guy Fieri ate there recently for his DDD show and I am very excited to see it!
