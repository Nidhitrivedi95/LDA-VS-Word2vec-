ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw I tried India Garden for the first time last night for take-out.  The garden salad was amazing - abundant amounts of cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, spices and lemon.  Very light and refreshing for summer.  I asked for the dressing on the side and honestly, the salad did not even need dressing with the lemon juice / spices.  The garlic naan was delicious.  As my entree, I asked for the Shrimp Saag.  I asked for additional vegetables and a medium spice.  The saag sauce was delicious and the spice was just right.  I will definitely be back!
