This is my favorite restaurant in the Madison area - Indian or otherwise.  The food is excellent.  I have very strict diet (vegan, very low/no oil, gluten free, nightshade free) and they accommodate!  The menu is extensive with several meals and appetizers that can be adjusted for me.  My favorites include hot and sour soup, pappadon (thin cracker), dosas, uthappam, and gobi - manchurian and pepper salt.

I'm really looking forward to trying Amber, their new restaurant, that is opening the end of 2015 or beginning of 2016, in the Willy West shopping center.
