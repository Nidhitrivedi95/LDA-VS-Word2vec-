A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA Took my friend here for her first South Indian food experience and she's definitely a fan!

We started with the dahivada; this was probably the low point of the meal. The vada was not very crispy and was pretty dense inside.

We also got the masala dosa and vegetable uttapam. The dosa was good, but not exceptional, and the uttapam was amazing. It had a perfect crispy exterior and was soft and fluffy inside...probably one of the best I've had. We ended with south indian coffee which was good as well.  

The restaurant itself is a little sparse, but that has been true of every South Indian place I've been to. We were very happy with the service, everything was served quickly and they were very good about topping off my friend's rapidly consumed glass of water :)

I would definitely go back.
