o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw I love this place!! Staff is great! Food is amazing.I have read a few reviews on here and I have to disagree with a recent post about the "a la carte" (which you didn't spell correctly ) as a person ordering food you should ask questions and if you are looking at a menu and it does not state comes "with" then ask. Also you should know that " a la carte" means you are just getting that item. I have not had a problem with the amount of food given, I have noticed recently that they have different togo packaging but it seems to be the same amount of food. I love this place and will always go there weekly!
