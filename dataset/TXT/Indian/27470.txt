IO8J6QJsdFeuso1Xmp3YtA Noor is totally deserving of my first 5 star review, and you'll now see why.

Whenever I want an Indian takeaway, there is only one word on my lips - Noor.  For the past few years, it has stood out for me as a purveyor of some of Edinburgh's finest takeaway food.  I totally agree with what Jonathan said: there are cheaper places, but they don't quite measure up.

All of the food I have ordered from Noor has been top notch.  I tend to go for the less spicy end of the spectrum, so stick with kormas and bhunas, occasionally stepping up to a tikka masala or rogan josh.  All of the food has been tasty and flavoursome, something which can be lacking in some takeaways.

The menu has a good variety, and the online ordering service means that you don't even have to leave the comfort of your sofa.  Delivery has always been on time, and the food has been piping hot.

It's so difficult to communicate the warm feeling that Noor gives in my stomach (before eating!).  Even the mention of a Noor curry starts the saliva production.  I command everyone to enjoy the awesomeness that is Noor!
