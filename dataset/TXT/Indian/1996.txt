_b8IGG_tsArBIMwlCVsWCQ India Time offers great quality food in great quantities for a reasonable (not cheap) price.  I've been going since the place opened and never had a bad meal.  I'd like to see more in the way of a lunch special.  Ordering an entree and rice and/or naan separately adds up but the food quality is great.
