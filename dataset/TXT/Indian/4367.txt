They don't pull their punches when it comes to spiciness, some of the dishes were too spicy for me (admittedly, I don't have a great tolerance for spicy foods) but I would rather have that than go to a buffet where everything is too mild and lacks taste.  The price isn't terribly competitive, the buffet is a bit expensive even for downtown but it's a nice break from routine and much closer than the other downtown Indian restaurant, Mirch Masala (over by the casino).  You can get the buffet for takeout, at which point you are charged by the pound but I wouldn't recommend it because it's very expensive.  The one time I got take out, I would say I only took about one third of the food I ate when I ate in and it ended up being almost the same price.  So if you want take out, I would recommend getting pickup from Mirch Masala (plus their butter chicken is better anyways) as you will get a better value for your money.  Oh, many reviews have already stated this but this is a serve-yourself environment, there is no wait staff.  You get your own food and drinks, you clear your own table.  This is not a problem for me but I think it decreases the value of the meal, especially considering the already slightly-elevated prices.
