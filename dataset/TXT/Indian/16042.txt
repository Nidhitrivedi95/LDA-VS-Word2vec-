DBxS04vNEd42NquQcAIMXA Came here with a group of seven and we ordered a lot of appetizers and some entrees to share.  Got a great sense of what they can do here foodwise.

It is located near the old Eastland mall site, but that should not deter you since they are a stand alone building and have plenty of parking spaces around the building.  Best guess is that the building used to be a mexican restaurant of sorts, but don't be fooled by appearances.

You walk in, there is a rather large dining room, a small stage, and two pool tables!  Definitely got a sense that we were in for a treat even before we sat down.  Behind the "stage" there's a wall were a projector was showing youtube indian dance music videos....  Pretty awesome.  Especially when the videos started buffering (maybe when more customers came in to use the wifi).  Super charming anyway.

Now the real star of the place:  the food!  Probably the biggest hit with our table was the cauliflower (gobhi) appetizer... came with two dipping sauces, delicious.  We also ordered dosas (mild and spicy version)... garlic naan (a must)...Chicken Tikka Masala was solid.  The Bhindi-do-piyaza (okra) was pretty darn amazing.  And we had a couple other things, including something that was not on the menu but our resident indian food expert requested it and they obliged.

Overall a great experience and I can't wait to go back to order off the Indo-Chinese part of the menu!
