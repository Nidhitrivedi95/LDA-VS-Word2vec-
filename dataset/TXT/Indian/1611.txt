-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA This was the worst Indian food buffet experience I have ever had. We were sat down and given water with no ice  and not offered anything else to drink besides water. The food was cold. They had mutton instead of lamb. The rice was cold and not replenished. The chili chicken was overcooked and the Naan was cold and not fresh. To top it all off we were pissed when we saw or bill of 15 dollars each for a lunch buffet. We should have went to our usual place which is India oven in Mesa.  The service and food there is amazing and they bring fresh Naan to your table. I'm never eating at chutneys again.
