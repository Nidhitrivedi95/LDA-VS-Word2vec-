yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Ate here on a Thursday evening after a long day of conference. Great service and delicious authentic Indian cuisine. Ordered Lamb Vindaloo off-menu and it was prepared perfectly to taste. Wife had Chicken Saagwala also prepared perfectly. Pappad with mint chutney and tamarind sauce was complimentary and was awesome. 10 minutes from the strip on Flamingo. So, convenient too. Highly recommend!
